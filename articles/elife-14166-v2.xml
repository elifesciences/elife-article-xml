pre-mRNAs. After assembly the spliceosome is activated for catalysis by rearrangement of subunits to form an active site. How this rearrangement is coordinated is not well-understood. During activation, U4 must be released to allow U6 conformational change, while Prp19 complex (NTC) recruitment is essential for stabilizing the active site. We used multi-wavelength colocalization single molecule spectroscopy to directly observe the key events in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> spliceosome activation. Following binding of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, the spliceosome either reverses assembly by discarding tri-snRNP or proceeds to activation by irreversible U4 loss. The major pathway for NTC recruitment occurs after U4 release. ATP stimulates both the competing U4 release and tri-snRNP discard processes. The data reveal the activation mechanism and show that overall splicing efficiency may be maintained through repeated rounds of disassembly and tri-snRNP reassociation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14166.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14166.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genes in an organism’s DNA may be expressed to form a protein via an intermediate molecule called RNA. In many organisms including humans, gene expression often begins by making a precursor molecule called a pre-mRNA. The pre-mRNA contains regions called exons that code for the protein product and regions called introns that do not. A machine in the cell called the spliceosome has the job of removing the introns in the pre-mRNA and stitching the exons together by a process known as splicing.</p><p>The spliceosome is made up of dozens of components that assemble on the pre-mRNAs. Before a newly assembled spliceosome can carry out splicing, it must be activated. The activation process involves several steps that are powered by the cell's universal power source (a molecule called ATP), including the release of many components from the spliceosome. Many of the details of the activation process are unclear.</p><p>Spliceosomes in the yeast species <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are similar to spliceosomes from humans, and so are often studied experimentally. Hoskins et al. have now used a technique called colocalization single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to follow, in real time, a single yeast spliceosome molecule as it activates. This technique uses a specialized microscope and a number of colored lasers to detect different spliceosome proteins at the same time. Hoskins et al. found that one of the steps during activation is irreversible – once that step occurs, the spliceosome must either perform the next activation steps or start the processes of assembly and activation over again.</p><p>Hoskins et al. also discovered that ATP causes some spliceosomes to be discarded during activation and not used for splicing. This indicates that before spliceosomes are allowed to activate, they may undergo 'quality control', which may be important for making sure that gene expression occurs efficiently and correctly. Future studies will investigate how this quality control process works in further detail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

most dynamic molecular machines inside the cell. Removal of introns from precursors to mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) involves the coordinated action of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and &gt;100 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoskins and Moore 2012</xref>). Some of these proteins along with the snRNAs assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs) that work together with other accessory proteins to catalyze splicing. Experiments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruby and Abelson 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konarska and Sharp 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng and Abelson 1987</xref>) and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tardiff and Rosbash 2006</xref>) indicate that spliceosomes are unlikely to exist as preformed complexes. Instead, spliceosomes are built from their snRNP and accessory protein components on pre-mRNAs, carry out splicing, and then are disassembled after each reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, the overall process can be described as sequential progression through distinct stages of spliceosome assembly, formation of the active site (called activation), catalysis, disassembly, and component recycling. A number of biochemical and genetic experiments have elucidated the splicing factors present at each stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>), as well as characteristic interactions between snRNA, pre-mRNA, and protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brow 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The U1 and U2 snRNPs identify the 5' splice site (SS) and branch site (BS), respectively, during early stages of spliceosome assembly. While U1 binding is ATP-independent, U2 base pairing with the intron to form the pre-spliceosome or A complex typically requires ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A pre-formed complex of U4, U5, and U6 (the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP) then joins A complex to form B complex. While B complex contains dozens of proteins and five snRNAs, it is not capable of mediating either of the two chemical steps of splicing (5' SS cleavage and exon ligation) since the spliceosomal components are not yet rearranged into a configuration capable of catalysis. This rearrangement encompasses two stages during the activation process. In the first stage, the Prp19-associated complex (NTC), the final major spliceosomal subcomplex, joins and U1 and U4 are expelled to form the B<sup>act</sup> spliceosome. In the second stage, B<sup>act</sup> is further remodeled to the B<sup>*</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lardelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wlodaver and Staley 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Cheng 2012</xref>). Single molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments suggest that it is only in B* complex that the 5' SS and BS become juxtaposed, a necessary prerequisite for formation of a spliceosome competent for 5' SS cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krishnan et al., 2013</xref>). These catalytically activated B<sup>*</sup> spliceosomes then progress further through stages of exon ligation, mRNA product release, and finally disassembly of the lariat intron-containing product complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14166.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cartoon of major steps in spliceosome assembly and activation and impact of 2 mM (dark green) and 50 µM (light green) ATP concentrations on U1 and NTC interactions with pre-mRNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spliceosome assembly and activation. snRNPs interact with the pre-mRNA to form the A complex, containing U1 and U2 associated with the 5' SS and BS, respectively.

For example, the order of U4 loss and NTC association is uncertain and alternative models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>). It is also unclear whether U4 snRNP loss is irreversible or whether it can rejoin an activated spliceosome to fix incorrectly assembled complexes by possible proofreading or spliceosomal discard pathways.</p><p>Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy techniques have proven valuable in elucidating the kinetic mechanisms of several parts of the splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krishnan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karunatilaka and Rueda 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of spliceosomal activation, we have used Colocalization Single Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>) to study the binding dynamics of U4 relative to other spliceosome components. CoSMoS is particularly suited for the study of unsynchronized reactions such as spliceosomal activation since individual reaction trajectories can be followed in real time and subsequently grouped into common patterns of behavior during data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Here we followed the comings and goings of U4, U5 and the NTC under conditions that permitted or prevented spliceosomal activation. By simultaneously observing multiple species, we were able to distinguish reaction pathways relevant to activation from off-pathway processes and define the order and reversibility of on-pathway binding and dissociation steps.

However, the profile of U1 fluorescent spot accumulation under the two conditions was quite different: at 2 mM ATP, U1 snRNP spot numbers increased, then decreased as spliceosomes underwent activation; at 50 µM ATP, U1 spots reached a higher surface density that did not decrease with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The latter result is consistent with U1 remaining bound to pre-activation spliceosomal B complexes. Inspection of individual U1 binding events on single pre-mRNAs confirmed this assumption. In 50 µM ATP, U1 spots often remained visible for tens of minutes (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, light green and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is much longer than previously observed either in the absence of ATP (which prevents A complex formation) or at an ATP concentration (2 mM) that supports splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, dark green and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>]). The distribution of U1 dwell times fit a three component model. This model contained short and intermediate dwell time components (~0.15 and 1.3 min, respectively) previously observed in 2 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>) plus a much longer-lived component (<underline>&gt;</underline>11 min) new to the 50 µM ATP condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). It is likely that these long-lived U1s are in stalled B complexes analogous to those previously purified from 50 µM ATP splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously found that the NTC does not co-purify with B complex but only with activated spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Almeida and O'Keefe 2015</xref>). To investigate whether and for how long NTC associates with stalled B complexes, we used yeast extracts bearing green-excited SNAP tag fluorophores on NTC components (Cef1 and Ntc90) to compare NTC association with pre-mRNA at 2 mM and 50 µM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>), spots of NTC fluorescence accumulated on a surface with tethered pre-mRNAs in the presence of 2 mM ATP. However, at 50 µM ATP we observed much less NTC accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results suggest that either the NTC cannot associate with B complex or it can associate only transiently, consistent with previous hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>). Inspection of individual pre-mRNAs showed fewer bound NTC molecules in 50 µM ATP and that NTC binding events often lasted for only a few seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, light green and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of the observed dwell times showed that at both 2 mM and 50 µM ATP, NTC binding events could be described by a distribution containing two exponential terms corresponding to short (~0.4 min) and long (~5 min) dwell time components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). However, under 50 µM ATP the long dwell time component represented only a negligible fraction of the distribution (amplitude of 0.06 vs. 0.46 for 50 µM and 2 mM ATP, respectively). Thus, the kinetically more stable interactions of NTC that are present at 2 mM ATP are largely absent at 50 µM ATP. In summary, the single-molecule U1 and NTC binding dynamics under low ATP conditions are consistent with the formation of stalled, B complex spliceosomes on surface tethered pre-mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Limiting ATP results in long-lived U4 binding events</title><p>To gain further information about the step at which spliceosome activation is blocked at 50 µM ATP, we incorporated fluorophores into U4/U6-snRNP proteins (Prp3 and Prp4, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardin et al., 2015</xref>]) that were previously shown to be lost during activation along with the U4 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>). We used homologous recombination to create a yeast strain harboring SNAP<sub>f</sub> tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2011</xref>) on both Prp3 and Prp4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This strain was viable, had a similar growth rate to the untagged parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and yielded WCE in which both SNAP<sub>f</sub> tagged proteins could be specifically and rapidly labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Further, the labeled extract was active in bulk splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>We performed two-color CoSMoS experiments to detect U4 interactions with surface-tethered pre-mRNAs via the labels on Prp3 and Prp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). At 50 µM ATP, U4 signals accumulated on the surface and reached a high density that did not decrease with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, light green), similar to the behavior we observed with U1. At 2 mM ATP we saw little accumulation of U4 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, dark green). As for U1, these results suggest that at limiting ATP, U4 remains bound to pre-activation spliceosomal B complexes. However, we do not yet know if complexes formed at limiting ATP that contain U4 are the same complexes that also contain U1. The properties of individual U4 binding events on single pre-mRNAs were consistent with B complex formation. In 50 µM ATP, some U4 particles interacted transiently while others remained associated for tens of minutes, whereas at 2 mM ATP nearly all U4 binding was transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Also consistent with these observations, at 2 mM ATP U4 exhibited two comparatively short lifetime components of ~0.2 and ~2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). In contrast, at 50 µM ATP the measured dwell times fit to a tri-exponential distribution with two similar short components (~0.1 min and ~1 min), but with a substantial fraction in an additional much longer component (<underline>&gt;</underline>13 min). We hypothesize that this long component arises from the formation of stalled B complex spliceosomes at 50 µM ATP. Absence of this component at 2 mM ATP is consistent with the idea that binding of U4/U6.U5 to form B complex is followed quickly by activation and concomitant U4 dissociation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14166.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Two-color CoSMoS observation of U4 dynamics at 2 mM (dark green) and 50 µM (light green) ATP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an experiment for observing U4 binding dynamics with a design similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and 1F.

Similarly 46% of U4 spots (467 of 1016 total) arrived simultaneously with a U5 spot appearance. Colocalization of simultaneously arriving U4 and U5 spots sometimes persisted for tens or hundreds of seconds; these events likely reflect tri-snRNP binding. Consistent with this interpretation, simultaneous appearances of U4 and U5 at control areas of interest (AOIs) with no detected pre-mRNA molecules were extremely rare (~3 × 10<sup>-4</sup> events AOI<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, the U4-only and U5-only binding events were typically transient, often lasting only a single frame (&lt;3 s), and were not analyzed further (data not shown).</p><p>In contrast to the observations at 2 mM ATP, we observed at 50 µM ATP a higher proportion of coincident U5 and U4 binding [79% of U5 spots appeared simultaneously with a U4 spot (223/284) and 85% of U4 spots appeared simultaneously with a U5 spot (223/262); e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>]. Because the same preparation of labeled U4/U5 extract was used in both 2 mM and 50 µM ATP experiments, it is probable that differences in the amount of coincident U4 and U5 binding reflect differences in tri-snRNP relative abundance under the two conditions; differences that likely originate from tri-snRNP disruption that accompanies spliceosome activation and splicing occurring at 2 mM ATP but not at 50 µM ATP. In addition, the tri-snRNP itself is destabilized by the addition of ATP, leading to an decrease in its abundance relative to free U4 and U5 snRNPs and the U4/U6 di-snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ATP-dependent outcomes of tri-snRNP binding</title><p>Based on the idea that the U4 and U5 coincident arrivals in the three-color CoSMoS experiments represented tri-snRNP binding events leading to B complex formation, we selected just those events for further analysis. We observed four different outcomes from these coincident binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>): (1) the U4 snRNP spot disappeared while the U5 spot remained; (2) the U5 snRNP spot disappeared while the U4 spot remained; (3) both the U4 and U5 spots disappeared simultaneously; or (4) both the U4 and U5 signals persisted on the pre-mRNA until the experiment was terminated after one hour. In the two cases in which one spot disappeared before the other, disappearance could be caused by photobleaching of the dye label, or by dissociation of the individual snRNP from B complex, leaving the other behind. However, simultaneous disappearance of both spots most likely represents U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP dissociation because simultaneous photobleaching is improbable.</p><p>In the presence of 2 mM ATP, the predominant outcome (62%; 79/128 events in a given experiment) of coincident U4.U5 binding was U4 spot loss followed by U5 spot loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This outcome is consistent with the expected U4 loss accompanying B complex activation followed by U5 loss after splicing. Loss of the U5 signal prior to loss of U4 was rarely seen (2%), and in no case did the U4.U5 signals persist until the end of the experiment. The remainder mostly (36%) followed the route in which U4 and U5 spots disappeared simultaneously. These results are consistent with the majority of tri-snRNP interactions with pre-mRNA at 2 mM ATP resulting in activation and U4 dissociation. The smaller fraction with simultaneous spot disappearance may represent release of intact tri-snRNP without spliceosome activation.</p><p>Flux through these pathways changed dramatically when the ATP concentration was reduced to 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The U4-first loss pathway was rarely observed (9%; 19/207 events in a given experiment), consistent with activation being blocked at 50 µM ATP. Instead, U4 and U5 most frequently (76%) disappeared simultaneously, with a small fraction (9%) not disappearing at all but persisting until the end of the experiment. These results suggest that when activation is suppressed by reducing ATP, tri-snRNP mostly releases intact but on rare occasions participates in formation of a kinetically stable complex on the pre-mRNA. The persistent complexes may correspond to the stalled B complexes previously isolated in ensemble studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fabrizio et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>). Further, the observation that U4-first loss is infrequently observed at 50 µM ATP confirms that most of the more frequent U4-first loss events observed at 2 mM ATP are due to U4 snRNP dissociation, not photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dynamics of tri-snRNP disappearance reveal new features of spliceosome proofreading and remodeling</title><p>We next analyzed the kinetic behavior of the complexes formed by simultaneous arrival of U4 and U5 – i.e., the tri-snRNP binding events – at 50 µM and 2 mM ATP.</p><p>First, we measured the U4/U5 dwell times for those events in which U4 and U5 left the pre-mRNA simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These events presumably represent release of bound tri-snRNP without activation. At both 50 µM and 2 mM ATP the dwell time distributions were multi-exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>), suggesting the presence of multiple distinct types of tri-snRNP/pre-mRNA complexes. At 50 µM ATP, the dwell time distribution fit to the sum of two exponential terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas the distribution at 2 mM ATP required three exponential terms for a satisfactory fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The two time constants at 50 µM ATP (52 and 780 s) appear to most closely correspond to the two longest time constants at 2 mM ATP (34 and 660 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). However, at 2 mM ATP the majority of dissociation events are not in these longer components but rather in the shortest-lived component (4 s).

We then exchanged the WCE containing 50 µM ATP with splicing buffer, also containing 50 µM ATP, to remove any unstable tri-snRNP-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During this first buffer wash, the majority of U4.U5 complexes remained bound to the slide (10–17% decrease in U4.U5 spot density, <italic>N</italic> = 253 ± 18 U5 spots per field of view in WCE prior to the wash). We next carried out a second buffer exchange and flowed in buffer containing either 50 µM or 2 mM ATP. When a second 50 µM ATP wash was carried out, the majority of U4/U5 complexes remained bound (~19% decrease in spot density between the first and second wash steps, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the majority of U4 and U5 spots were released when a 2 mM ATP wash was used: 74% and 68% decreases in U4 and U5 spot density, respectively, and only a small fraction of remaining U4 and U5 particles colocalized with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Release of U4 and/or U5 occurred very rapidly—within the deadtime of our experiment (~30 s). Loss of signals from both U4 and U5 is most consistent with ATP-dependent discard of these complexes since U5 should be retained in B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, these results suggest that the ATPase responsible for the discard of U4 and U5 is stably associated with the pre-mRNA and remains bound when the WCE is removed and replaced by buffer. Our data indicate that the majority (~68%) of stable U4.U5-containing complexes assembled at 50 µM ATP in WCE will be discarded in the presence of 2 mM ATP in buffer and only a smaller fraction (at most 32%) can potentially form B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes.</p><p>We next analyzed the pathway that is dominant at 2 mM ATP: events in which U4 and U5 fluorescence appeared simultaneously but the U4 fluorescence was lost prior to U5 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

This suggests that at least some pre-mRNAs that do splice also bind the tri-snRNP more than once. When multiple tri-snRNP associations were observed they were nearly always sequential: a second tri-snRNP binding was very rarely seen unless both U4 and U5 fluorescence from the previous association had already disappeared (simultaneous colocalization of two tri-snRNPs was potentially observed on only 6 out of 481 RNAs, <underline>&lt;</underline>1%).

Instead, we observed that approximately 10% (49 of 481) of pre-mRNAs under 2 mM ATP exhibited at least two repeats of U4/U5 simultaneous binding, followed by loss of the U4, followed by loss of U5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Since binding of the tri-snRNP is dependent on presence of an intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>), we conclude that on these pre-mRNAs the first U4 release event did not result in productive splicing and that subsequent observations of U4 release result from spliceosome re-assembly on the same pre-mRNA. These data indicate that activation does not always commit the pre-mRNA to splicing, and are consistent with the presence of discard pathways that can prevent splicing subsequent to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Since tri-snRNP association is reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>]), it is not surprising that we observed tri-snRNP to re-associate multiple times with the same pre-mRNA. In contrast, re-association of U4 complexes containing the labeled protein Prp3 after prior U4 departure was exceedingly rare. Of 260 cases in which both U4 and U5 fluorescence appeared simultaneously followed by disappearance of U4 and then U5, we observed only 15 instances (5.7%) of reappearance of U4 while U5 remained visible. It is likely that some of these rare events arose from background binding of fluorescent molecules to the slide surface since control experiments revealed that the rate of background U4 binding is similar to the observed rate of U4 re-binding subsequent to U5 loss (2.3 × 10<sup>-3</sup> vs. 9.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup> events/min, respectively). In addition, only 5 cases were found in which the rebound U4 spot was stable enough to last more than a single frame. Taken together, these results are consistent with activation being largely irreversible, with only a slim likelihood (&lt;2%) for rebinding of Prp3-containing U4 or U4/U6 snRNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tri-snRNP rebinding after discard involves fewer steps than initial Tri-snRNP recruitment</title><p>We wondered if pre-mRNAs that bound the tri-snRNP more than once also recruited tri-snRNPs by different kinetic pathways.

However, little is known about how activation is coordinated in terms of both the ordering of events and points of regulation. Here we demonstrate that the tri-snRNP can interact reversibly with pre-mRNA, that some tri-snRNP interactions do not result in release of U4, that when U4 is released this release is effectively irreversible, that ATP can promote both rapid activation and discard, and that NTC binding usually occurs only after U4 release. Together our data allow us to propose an integrated model for tri-snRNP association with the pre-spliceosome and subsequent spliceosome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The model proposes an ordered pathway for activation in which physiological ATP concentrations facilitate both U4 dissociation leading to NTC addition (progressing towards splicing) and tri-snRNP dissociation resulting in B-complex disassembly (progressing away from splicing).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14166.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for tri-snRNP recruitment and spliceosome activation highlighting the predominant pathways observed in our experiments.</title><p>The spliceosome and its other snRNP components are shown schematically as a grey circle.

It has often been assumed that the tri-snRNP binds to but cannot release from pre-mRNAs under these conditions. Our data show that this is not the case: the majority of tri-snRNP encounters with pre-mRNA molecules involved simultaneous U4 and U5 association and dissociation of both after just tens of seconds. While we did not examine U1 and U2 directly in these experiments, it is likely that these pre-mRNAs were assembled into pre-spliceosomes since single molecules of the tri-snRNP fail to accumulate on pre-mRNAs without ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>) and tri-snRNP association almost always requires prior U1 and U2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>). Only a small fraction of events resulted in tri-snRNP retention at the conclusion of our experiments. Based on our data, it is unclear what distinguishes complexes that released the tri-snRNP from those in which it was retained for tens of minutes. It is likely that the longest-lived complexes are the assemblies that have been purified and characterized as the spliceosomal B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>). Our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggest that the majority of spliceosome complexes formed at 50 µM ATP and that survive removal of the WCE are not competent for B<sup>act</sup> formation and are instead rapidly discarded by an ATP-dependent mechanism. However, neither our work nor previous studies have directly established what fraction of the remaining long-lived complexes are kinetically competent intermediates on the splicing pathway at physiological ATP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological ATP promotes both U4 and tri-snRNP release from B complex</title><p>Under limiting ATP conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the tri-snRNP associates with the pre-spliceosome but activation and release of U4 rarely occurs. Unexpectedly, at physiological ATP conditions that permit activation and splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), tri-snRNP release is much faster than at 50 µM ATP. The reason that splicing can nevertheless occur is because at high ATP U4 release is rapid, irreversible, and is thus able to compete with tri-snRNP dissociation even though that dissociation rate has also increased. Based on the observed fluxes through the U4 release and tri-snRNP dissociation pathways, a significant fraction (one of every three) tri-snRNP binding events ends in tri-snRNP dissociation without spliceosome activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Release of U4 is irreversible but does not guarantee splicing</title><p>While many steps in splicing have been shown to be readily reversible including snRNP and NTC association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>), pre-mRNA conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krishnan et al., 2013</xref>), and the chemical steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tseng and Cheng 2008</xref>), in our experiments the activation and loss of U4 appears to be almost irreversible. In &gt;98% of events in which U4 was ejected after tri-snRNP binding, Prp3-containing U4 snRNPs did not reappear while U5 remained bound. This indicates effective irreversibility of U4 loss. Since U4 loss permits U6 to make both inter- and intramolecular basepairing interactions to form the spliceosome catalytic core and these are mutually exclusive with U4 basepairing, our results suggest that U4 is quickly recycled in the extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998a</xref>) and/or that the conformational rearrangements within U6 occur rapidly, preventing re-base pairing with U4 directly or with the aid of the U4/U6 annealing protein Prp24.</p><p>Despite irreversible loss of U4 during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition, spliceosomal activation does not guarantee that the pre-mRNA will be spliced by that particular spliceosome. We observed multiple instances in which a pre-mRNA underwent several rounds of tri-snRNP binding, U4 release, then U5 release and tri-snRNP rebinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, release of U4 during activation does not always commit a particular spliceosome to catalysis and mRNA release. This result is consistent with the presence of proofreading and discard steps carried out by Prp16 and Prp22 occurring after spliceosomal U4 release, and with disassembly of discarded spliceosomes by Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess and Guthrie 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koodathingal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayas et al., 2006</xref>). Our data support a model in which the spliceosome cannot reverse its steps back to the B complex if discard occurs after U4 release. Instead, U5 (and likely U6) are released and a new tri-snRNP must be recruited to the pre-mRNA for a new activation attempt.</p><p>Taken together our data suggest that tri-snRNP rebinding compensates for discard at the B complex or subsequent stages, contributing to the overall efficiency of splicing by permitting multiple attempts at assembly and activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NTC association most frequently follows U4 release</title><p>The coordination of U4 release with other events during activation has not been well-studied. In particular, the relative timing of U4 release and NTC recruitment has remained ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Almeida and O'Keefe 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogg et al., 2010</xref>). Early immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that the NTC joins the spliceosome soon after or concomitant with U4 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarn et al., 1993</xref>). In contrast, later mass spectrometry analyses of purified spliceosomes stalled by limiting ATP detected small amounts of NTC in B complex, suggesting that stable U4 and NTC binding are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>). Our data explain this apparent contradiction by showing that at 2 mM ATP NTC recruitment soon after U4 release is the predominant pathway (79% of events). However, under limiting ATP (where there is little U4 release) transient interactions of NTC were still observed. More stable binding of NTC after U4 release is in agreement with both previous crosslinking results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasche et al., 2012</xref>) and more recent spliceosome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) that show key binding sites for the NTC include the U6 internal stem loop (ISL) and the catalytic core. Because the ISL is not present when U6 is basepaired to U4, active site formation may be the major means by which the spliceosome recruits and retains the NTC.</p><p>In contrast with the predominant pathway, we less frequently (19% of events) observed NTC arrival prior to U4 loss. Recently it has been shown that functional tri-snRNPs can form in the absence of stable U4/U6 basepairing, suggesting that protein/RNA interactions can play a major role in tethering U4 to U5 and U6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the minor pathway we observe represents spliceosomes that have disrupted U4.U6 basepairing to facilitate NTC recruitment but in which other interactions have remained intact that delay U4 release.</p><p>Finally, at 50 µM ATP NTC failed to accumulate on the pre-mRNA molecules and instead displayed mostly transient interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that the NTC cannot stably bind spliceosomes stalled at B complex. The source of the small number of NTC peptides detected in mass spectrometry analyses of stalled B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>) may reflect binding of the NTC to a small number of spliceosomes that may have been able to release U4 at 50 µM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Our single molecule data are consistent with data from human spliceosomes showing that NTC recruitment is also inhibited in complexes that fail to form B<sup>act</sup> when exchange of U1 for U6 pairing at the 5' SS is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiou et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, direct observation of binding and release of spliceosomal subcomplexes has allowed us to define the predominant pathways leading to spliceosomal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The results reveal that ATP stimulates both U4 release and tri-snRNP discard. ATP-dependent U4 release is known to be mediated by the Brr2 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raghunathan and Guthrie 1998b</xref>). The rapid tri-snRNP discard pathway is consistent with ATP-dependent proofreading by Prp28 during exchange of U1 for U6 basepairing at the 5' SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). If exchange is successful the spliceosome can proceed through the next steps of activation. If unsuccessful, Prp28 may induce rapid tri-snRNP release. It is possible that the discard pathway observed here may be related to prior observations of yeast pre-spliceosomes containing weakly bound tri-snRNPs upon inhibition of U1/U6 exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Staley and Guthrie 1999</xref>) and the labile tri-snRNPs present in human exon-defined splicing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boesler et al., 2015</xref>). The existence of this ATP-dependent tri-snRNP release pathway may serve to promote efficient splicing by preventing cellular accumulation of non-functional assemblies of snRNPs on pre-mRNAs.</p><p>By labeling protein components associated with U4 release, we have now demonstrated that all of the spliceosomal snRNPs and NTC are amenable to CoSMoS assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodgers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, there now exists a powerful toolset for studying compositional changes and dynamics of single spliceosomes in real time. Further mechanistic insights are likely to result from combining these tools with mutations in key spliceosomal components to better dissect the roles of individual proteins and snRNAs in the steps of spliceosomal assembly, activation, proofreading, chemistry, and recycling. Even in the absence of further studies, the data presented here define the sequence of major molecular events in spliceosome activation and explain how splicing can be efficient despite high fluxes through discard pathways after tri-snRNP binding and after activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of Pre-mRNAs</title><p>Capped RP51A pre-mRNA for in vitro splicing assays were transcribed in the presence of [α-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crawford et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jean Beggs and Jonathan Staley, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation was overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hoskins et al. exploit the unique and innovative capabilities of CoSMoS to study at unprecedented resolution the activation step of the spliceosome, arguably the most dramatic and catalytically-critical stage of spliceosome assembly. They investigate formation of the B complex and its conversion to the Bact complex by observing splicing substrate association and dissociation of U1, the tri-snRNP components U4 and U5, and/or the NTC, the complex characteristic of catalytically-activated spliceosomes. At low ATP, which stalls spliceosome assembly, the authors observed increased lifetimes of U1, U4, and U5 but decreased lifetimes of the NTC, consistent with previous observations. By simultaneously monitoring U4 and NTC binding and release from the substrate by three-color CoSMoS, the authors demonstrate that the NTC only transiently samples the substrate before U4 release and generally binds stably only after release, providing the first direct evidence for the dependence of stable NTC binding on U4 release. By co-localization of U4 and U5 by three-color CoSMoS, the authors also observed a substantial frequency of events in which both dissociate simultaneously. Surprisingly, at high ATP, there is a very fast phase of this event that predominates, implying a novel discard pathway that dominates the spliceosome activation phase. Importantly, the authors show that such discard events can be followed by rebinding of the tri-snRNP components. Further, while some studies on the U4/U6 annealing factor Prp24 have suggested action on the spliceosome, the authors provide the first evidence that U4 release from U6 on the spliceosome is irreversible and, strikingly, that subsequent U5 release can be followed by simultaneous reassociation of U4 and U5, revealing for the first time spliceosome re-assembly after the presumed discard of the splicing substrate and concomitant disassembly of the spliceosome.</p><p>Overall, the presentation is clear and enjoyable to read, the quality of the work is high, and the results are convincing. The analysis has not only provided direct evidence for previously suspected features of spliceosome assembly (e.g., the irreversibility of U4 release, the dependence of NTC binding on U4 release) but also revealed unexpected evidence for an apparently ATP-dependent discard pathway for the tri-snRNP and provided the first evidence for repeated cycles of tri-snRNP sampling of a substrate – both with and without U4 release.</p><p>Additionally, while the approach of CoSMoS has been previously introduced by the authors, the successful and revealing application here to the activation step in splicing will underscore the power of this approach in investigating factor dynamics to the broader community – well beyond the splicing field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A main question here is what underlies the apparent ATP-dependence of U4/U5(U6) dissociation. Does the fast phase at high ATP reflect a direct role for ATP in discard, as the authors imply, or do differences in assembly at high ATP lead to a spliceosome in which the tri-snRNP dissociates more rapidly but without an ATP-dependence? To test directly whether the simultaneous release of U4 and U5 is ATP dependent, could the authors easily wash away (low) ATP in the middle of an experiment, after assembly on substrate, and assay for a decrease in the rate of U4/U5 dissociation? If not, minimally, this ambiguity should be acknowledged in the manuscript.</p><p>2) It seems that the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> represent a subset of the data from the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. What proportion of the RNAs undergo multiple tri-snRNP binding events?</p><p>3) Related to the above, can the authors provide any data in support of molecules that undergo multiple tri-snRNP binding events eventually proceeding to a functional splicing reaction, rather than being eventually discarded? In other words, how likely is it that such multiple association/dissociation events reflect a normal spliceosome assembly pathway? For example, is it possible to know which molecules become spliced? Could the authors simultaneously monitor release of the excised intron? Minimally, does the proportion of molecules that display multiple tri-snRNP binding events match an estimate of the number of molecules that undergo splicing in this setup? As is, the last line of the Abstract is not justified.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Spliceosomes remain dynamic even when stalled by limiting ATP” the authors discuss the need for binding of U1 and U2 prior to tri-snRNP binding. It should also be discussed, either here or later, that when tri-snRNP dissociates, these data do not appear to allow distinguishing between dissociation only of the tri-snRNP to leave a stable pre-spliceosome, or if U2 and/or U1 dissociate also, i.e. discard of the entire complex, and then assembly of a new spliceosome from scratch. If tri-snRNP discard leads back to the prespliceosome, then one would expect that tri-snRNP rebinding a second time would be kinetically faster than initial binding events. Can this be evaluated? (Similarly, in cases where U4 release is followed by U5 release and re-binding of the tri-snRNP, is rebinding faster than initial binding?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14166.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A main question here is what underlies the apparent ATP-dependence of U4/U5(U6) dissociation.

Release occurs within the deadtime of the buffer exchange in our assay (~30s). Since both U4 and U5 are released, this is consistent with discard of these complexes. These experiments and the results are described in new text in the subsection “Dynamics of tri-snRNP Disappearance Reveal New Features of Spliceosome Proofreading and Remodeling” and in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Together, these results provide additional evidence for ATP dependence of U4 and U5 release from pre-mRNA and indicates that the ATPase responsible is part of the complex that assembles at 50 µM ATP on pre-mRNA and remains bound following an initial 50 µM wash step. Furthermore, our results suggest that the majority (~68%) of complexes assembled at low ATP are discarded at high ATP and the maximum fraction of assembled complexes containing U4 and U5 that can continue on to form B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomes is 32%.</p><p><italic>2) It seems that the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> represent a subset of the data from the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. What proportion of the RNAs undergo multiple tri-snRNP binding events?</italic></p><p>We have analyzed how many tri-snRNP binding events occur on each pre-mRNA at 2 mM ATP. Approximately 22% of pre-mRNAs undergo more than one tri-snRNP binding event. A histogram showing the number of tri-snRNP binding events observed on each pre-mRNA is reported in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and described in the subsection “Tri-snRNP activation and dissociation pathways can both occur on the same pre-mRNA Molecules”.</p><p><italic>3) Related to the above, can the authors provide any data in support of molecules that undergo multiple tri-snRNP binding events eventually proceeding to a functional splicing reaction, rather than being eventually discarded?

Could the authors simultaneously monitor release of the excised intron? Minimally, does the proportion of molecules that display multiple tri-snRNP binding events match an estimate of the number of molecules that undergo splicing in this setup? As is, the last line of the Abstract is not justified.</italic></p><p>We have not simultaneously monitored intron release; however, the number of molecules undergoing only 1 tri-snRNP binding event (~22%) is too small to account for the estimate of the number of molecules undergoing splicing (~60% of pre-mRNAs are able to go through at least the first step of splicing, as approximated from in vitro splicing assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, these data strongly suggest that many pre-mRNAs that do splice also experience multiple rounds of tri-snRNP binding and release. We have mentioned this observation in the subsection “Tri-snRNP activation and dissociation pathways can both occur on the same pre-mRNA Molecules”. We have also replaced the verb “can” with “may” in the last sentence of the Abstract.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Spliceosomes remain dynamic even when stalled by limiting ATP” the authors discuss the need for binding of U1 and U2 prior to tri-snRNP binding. It should also be discussed, either here or later, that when tri-snRNP dissociates, these data do not appear to allow distinguishing between dissociation only of the tri-snRNP to leave a stable pre-spliceosome, or if U2 and/or U1 dissociate also, i.e. discard of the entire complex, and then assembly of a new spliceosome from scratch. If tri-snRNP discard leads back to the prespliceosome, then one would expect that tri-snRNP rebinding a second time would be kinetically faster than initial binding events. Can this be evaluated? (Similarly, in cases where U4 release is followed by U5 release and re-binding of the tri-snRNP, is rebinding faster than initial binding?)</italic></p><p>The reviewers bring up an excellent point. To evaluate this we compared the time it takes for each pre-mRNA to bind the tri-snRNP initially compared with the times in between tri-snRNP binding events. For this latter subset of data, we further discriminated by times between tri-snRNP discard (simultaneous release of U4 and U5) and binding of the next tri-snRNP and by times between U4 release (i.e., B<sup>act</sup> formation) and binding of the next tri-snRNP. The results of these kinetic analyses are shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>.</p><p>In brief, binding of the initial tri-snRNP shows different kinetic features than re-binding of the tri-snRNP after discard or U4 release. These data and results are described in the subsection “Tri-snRNP Rebinding After Discard Involves Fewer Steps than Initial Tri-snRNP Recruitment”. This suggests that some component of the system is “primed” for rebinding of the tri-snRNP as well as another mechanism for maintaining splicing efficiency, just as the reviewers propose.</p></body></sub-article></article>
