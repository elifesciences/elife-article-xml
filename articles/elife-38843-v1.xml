coactivator Yorkie (Yki), which normally complexes with the TEF/TEAD family DNA-binding transcription factor Scalloped (Sd) to drive the expression of growth-promoting genes. Given its pivotal role as a central hub in mediating the transcriptional output of Hippo signaling, there is great interest in understanding the molecular regulation of the Sd-Yki complex. In this study, we identify Nerfin-1 as a transcriptional repressor that antagonizes the activity of the Sd-Yki complex by binding to the TEA DNA-binding domain of Sd. Consistent with its biochemical function, ectopic expression of Nerfin-1 results in tissue undergrowth in an Sd-dependent manner. Conversely, loss of Nerfin-1 enhances the ability of winner cells to eliminate loser cells in multiple scenarios of cell competition. We further show that INSM1, the mammalian ortholog of Nerfin-1, plays a conserved role in repressing the activity of the TEAD-YAP complex. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mode converging on the transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway that may be exploited for modulating the YAP oncoprotein in cancer and regenerative medicine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38843.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals uses a range of mechanisms to stop their organs from growing once they have reached the right shape and size. One of these processes, a set of chemical messages called the Hippo pathway, controls the balance of cell death and cell division. In fruit flies, Hippo works by repressing a complex formed of two proteins, Yorkie and Scalloped, which normally switch genes on to encourage cells to grow. Yorkie is also involved in cell competition, a process in which cells in a tissue compare themselves to each other. Healthier ‘winner’ cells then kill neighboring ‘loser’ cells that are weaker or damaged. This ensures that the tissue keeps working properly.</p><p>Despite Yorkie and Scalloped being key to control the growth and health of tissues, how the activity of these proteins is regulated was not well understood. To investigate, Guo et al. conducted a series experiments on fruit flies and found that a protein called Nerfin-1 can bind onto Scalloped to stop the Scalloped-Yorkie complex from switching on genes. As a result, flies with too much Nerfin-1 had stunted tissue growth. In addition, Guo et al. confirmed that the Nerfin-1 equivalent in mammals acts in the same way. Further work revealed that Nerfin-1 also plays a role in cell competition: without this protein, ‘winner’ cells became 'super winners', eliminating even more of the loser cells.</p><p>Besides regulating the size of organs, the Hippo pathway is also involved in stopping cells from dividing uncontrollably and becoming cancerous. Further research may therefore focus on Nerfin-1 and its equivalent in mammals to understand how this protein could contribute to the emergence of cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>cell competition</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY015708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The zinc finger protein Nerfin-1 represses the transcriptional output of Hippo signaling in cell competition by binding to the TEA DNA-binding domain of Scalloped.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hippo signaling pathway is a conserved mechanism that regulates organ size, tissue regeneration and stem cell biology in diverse animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Central to this pathway is a kinase cascade comprising tumor suppressors Hippo (Hpo, MST1/2 in mammals) and Warts (Wts, LATS1/2 in mammals), which are activated at the cell cortex by various upstream inputs. Wts/LATS in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the oncoprotein Yorkie (Yki, YAP/TAZ in mammals). As a transcriptional coactivator, Yki/YAP/TAZ does not bind DNA directly and its ability to regulate target gene expression relies on its obligatory DNA-binding partner encoded by the TEF/TEAD family transcription factor Scalloped (Sd, TEAD1/2/3/4 in mammals). Consistent with the importance of the Sd/TEAD-Yki/YAP/TAZ transcription factor complex in Hippo signaling, loss of Sd completely rescues Yki-induced overgrowth, and mutations in Yki/YAP/TAZ that disrupt its physical interactions with Sd/TEAD abolishes the growth-promoting activity of Yki/YAP/TAZ.</p><p>Given its critical role in dictating transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway, there is great interest in understanding the function and regulation of the Sd/TEAD-Yki/YAP/TAZ complex. Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have led to a default repression model concerning Sd function: in the absence of Yki, Sd functions by default as a transcriptional repressor that actively represses the transcription of Hippo target genes, and Yki promotes growth by de-repressing Sd’s repressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). This model provides a plausible explanation for the perplexing observation that while Yki is required for normal tissue growth, loss of Sd has a negligible effect in growth in most <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues: unlike loss of Yki, which leads to repression of Hippo target genes and tissue undergrowth, loss of Sd would lead to de-repression of Hippo target genes and therefore a much weaker effect on tissue growth. Indeed, despite its negligible effect on normal tissue growth, loss of <italic>sd</italic> completely rescues the undergrowth phenotype caused by loss of <italic>yki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). Further support for this model came from the identification of an Sd-binding protein called Tondu-domain-containing Growth Inhibitor (Tgi, Vgll4 in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>), which competes with Yki to bind to the C-terminal region of Sd in a mutually exclusive manner. As expected of a Sd corepressor, loss of <italic>tgi</italic> rescues the undergrowth phenotype of <italic>yki</italic> mutant cells. However, unlike the full rescue of <italic>yki</italic> mutant by loss of <italic>sd</italic>, the rescue by <italic>tgi</italic> is partial, suggesting the existence of additional co-repressor(s) of Sd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). Identification of such corepressors should provide important insights into transcriptional control of the Hippo signaling pathway.</p><p>Cell competition was first described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>) whereby underperforming cells (aka loser cells), such as those with reduced ribosomal activities (the <italic>Minute</italic> mutations), are actively eliminated by cell death when juxtaposed with wildtype cells (aka winner cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moreno et al., 2002</xref>). It has since been extended to many additional contexts involving social interactions between cells of different fitness, such as the elimination of neoplastic tumor cells by neighboring wildtype cells, the elimination of cells lacking the Dpp receptor TKV by their wildtype neighbors, or the elimination of wildtype cells by cells with higher Myc activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moreno and Basler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moreno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rhiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies further suggested that cell competition is conserved in mammals and may contribute to diverse physiological processes such as embryogenesis and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gogna et al., 2015</xref>). Several lines of evidence have implicated the Hippo signaling pathway in cell competition. It was reported that cells with higher Yki, like those with higher Myc, can eliminate their wildtype neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neto-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ziosi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, increased Yki activity could rescue the elimination of neoplastic tumor cells or <italic>Minute</italic> cells by their wildtype neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Menéndez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tyler et al., 2007</xref>). Lastly, the TEAD transcription factors were implicated in Myc-mediated cell competition in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mamada et al., 2015</xref>). A caveat of these studies is that they often involve conditions in which Yki is massively activated at supraphysiological level. Whether Yki is required for cell competition at its endogenous physiological level remains an open question.</p><p>Here, we describe the identification of Nerfin-1 as a transcriptional repressor that antagonizes the Sd-Yki complex by binding to the TEA DNA-binding domain of Sd. Not only does ectopic expression of Nerfin-1 result in tissue undergrowth in an Sd-dependent manner, loss of Nerfin-1 enhances the ability of winner cells to eliminate loser cells in multiple scenarios of cell competition. We also provide evidence showing the conserved function of a mammalian ortholog of Nerfin-1 in repressing the activity of the TEAD-YAP complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nerfin-1 binds to Sd and antagonizes transcriptional activity of the Sd-Yki complex</title><p>In an effort to identify additional regulators of the Sd-Yki transcription factor complex, we searched <italic>Drosophila</italic> Interaction Database (DroID, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.droidb.org">http://www.droidb.org</ext-link>) for proteins that physically associate with Sd and/or Yki. Nerfin-1 emerged as a candidate that interacts with both Sd and Yki. Specifically, a genome-wide yeast-two-hybrid screen using Nerfin-1 as bait identified Sd as a Nerfin-1-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Giot et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, a large-scale affinity purification screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells identified both Sd and Yki in Nerfin-1 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Nerfin-1 was initially identified as a protein that contains three zinc fingers and that is highly expressed in the nervous system (thus the name Nervous Finger) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stivers et al., 2000</xref>). Besides Nerfin-1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome also encodes a related protein called Nerfin-2, which shares sequence similarity with Nerfin-1. However, unlike Nerfin-1, which is expressed in imaginal discs, the expression of Nerfin-2 is undetectable in imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore focused our analysis on Nerfin-1 unless otherwise stated. To explore the relationship between Nerfin-1, Sd and Yki, we expressed epitope-tagged constructs for the three proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells and examined their interactions by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. Consistent with the DroID data, Sd robustly interacted with Nerfin-1 or Yki in pairwise co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, only weak interaction was detected between Nerfin-1 and Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then examined how each pairwise interaction was influenced by the co-expression of the third protein. While co-expression of Yki did not affect Sd-Nerfin-1 interaction and co-expression of Nerfin-1 did not affect Sd-Yki interaction, the modest Nerfin-1-Yki interaction was greatly potentiated by co-expression of Sd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). These findings suggest that Sd may simultaneously bind Nerfin-1 and Yki and thus function as an intermediary protein to bridge Nerfin-1 and Yki in a common protein complex. Consistent with this notion, the modest co-IP between Nerfin-1 and Yki was abolished by RNAi knockdown of Sd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that the co-IP between Nerfin-1 and Yki constructs was mediated by endogenous Sd present in S2R+ cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38843.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nerfin-1 binds to Sd and antagonizes transcriptional activity of the Sd-Yki complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) S2R+ cells expressing the indicated constructs were subjected to IP by anti-FLAG.

For this purpose, we assayed the transcriptional activity of the Sd-Yki complex using a luciferase reporter carrying multimerized minimal Hpo Responsive Element (HRE) derived from the Hippo target gene <italic>diap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). As expected, the HRE-luciferase reporter was increased 35-fold by co-expression of Sd and Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, co-expression of Nerfin-1 repressed the Sd-Yki-stimulated HRE-luciferase reporter close to the basal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that Nerfin-1 can antagonize the transcriptional activity of the Sd-Yki complex. To probe the molecular mechanisms underlying Nerfin-1’s repressive activity, we searched DroID database for other Nerfin-1-interacting proteins. Interestingly, CtBP, a component of the CtBP corepressor complex that represses gene transcription through the associated histone deacetylase (HDACs, Rpd3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), was identified as a Nerfin-1-associated protein in a large-scale IP/MS screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guruharsha et al., 2011</xref>). By co-expressing epitope-tagged CtBP or Rpd3 together with Nerfin-1 in S2R+ cells, we found that both proteins could be immunoprecipitated by Nerfin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>), suggesting that the CtBP complex may be involved in Nerfin-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistent with this notion, treating S2R+ cells with the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) significantly reversed Nerfin-1’s inhibition of Sd-Yki-stimulated HRE-luciferase reporter, despite that TSA itself had negligible effect on the basal activity of the HRE-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these findings support a model whereby Nerfin-1 antagonizes the transcriptional activity of the Sd-Yki complex by binding to Sd and recruiting transcriptional corepressors such as the CtBP corepressor complex.</p><p>To test whether the function of Nerfin-1 is evolutionarily conserved, we examined Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1), a mammalian homologue of Nerfin-1. Similar to their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts, TEAD1 and YAP were immunoprecipitated by INSM1 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Further echoing our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, YAP-INSM1 interaction was much weaker than TEAD1-INSM1 interaction, and co-expression of TEAD1 significantly enhanced YAP-INSM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Indeed, INSM1 potently suppressed YAP-induced transcriptional activation of luciferase reporters driven by multimerized TEAD binding sites (8xGTIIC-luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>) or CTGF promoter (CTGF-luc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). To further examine its role in transcriptional regulation, we measured the mRNA levels of a common set of YAP target genes in a lung carcinoid tumor cell line (H727) with high endogenous INSM1 expression. In agreement with our luciferase reporter assay, siRNA knockdown of INSM1 resulted in the upregulation of several YAP target genes, most notably CTGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These results suggest a conserved role for INSM1 in regulating the transcriptional output of Hippo signaling in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic interactions between Nerfin-1, Sd and Yki</title><p>To further corroborate our model that Nerfin-1 antagonizes the transcriptional output of the Sd-Yki complex by binding to Sd, we assayed Nerfin-1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Importantly, this small-clone phenotype was completely rescued by removal of Sd, demonstrating that Nerfin-1’s growth inhibitory activity is dependent on Sd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

Furthermore, Nerfin-1 and Yki do not compete with each other for Sd-binding, and the three proteins can co-exist in a trimeric protein complex. The simplest model to account for these findings is that Nerfin-1 and Yki non-competitively bind to different regions of Sd, with Nerfin-1 repressing while Yki activating the transcriptional outcome of Sd.

We tested whether this hypothetical protein docking surface is required for Nerfin-1-binding by mutating two conserved hydrophobic residues on this surface, Y108 and L130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Similar to truncated Sd lacking the entire TEA domain, an Sd<sup>Y108A</sup> or Sd<sup>L130G</sup> mutation also abolished Nerfin-1-Sd interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, mutation of residues in the loop linking H1 and H2 (Sd<sup>D120N/E121N</sup>), or residues in the DNA-contacting H3 (Sd<sup>Q153A</sup> and Sd<sup>R157A</sup>), had no effect on Nerfin-1-Sd interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, Nerfin-1 represents a strong candidate for the unknown protein that was previously speculated to bind to the hydrophobic surface on the TEA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anbanandam et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To further corroborate the functional significance of Nerfin-1-Sd binding in inhibiting the transcriptional output of the Sd-Yki complex, we took advantage of a fusion protein between the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and Yki (Gal4-Yki) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Since Gal4-Yki can directly activate a UAS-luciferase reporter in an Sd-independent manner, one would expect Gal4-Yki to be immune to Nerfin1-mediated repression. Indeed, despite Nerfin-1’s potent inhibitory activity on Sd-Yki-stimulated HRE-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), Nerfin-1 was completely inactive towards the transcriptional activity of Gal4-Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), Gal4-Yki was significantly inhibited by co-expression of the upstream tumor suppressor Hpo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results provide further support for our model that Nerfin-1 binding to the TEA domain of Sd is required for Nerfin-1-mediated transcriptional repression.</p><p>As an additional test of the importance of Sd’s TEA domain in Nerfin-1-mediated transcriptional repression, we engineered a fusion protein containing the N-terminal TEA domain of Sd and the C-terminal transactivation domain of Yki. As expected, the SdN-YkiC fusion protein potently activated the HRE-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Importantly, unlike the Gal4-Yki fusion protein, Nerfin-1 significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the SdN-YkiC fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). To test whether human INSM1 also executes its repressor function through the TEA domain of TEAD, we engineered a fusion protein containing the TEA domain of TEAD1 and the VP160 transcription activation domain. As expected, INSM1 also repressed the transcriptional activity of the TEA-VP160 fusion protein, as measured by the TEAD-responsive 8xGTIIC-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight the TEA domain of Sd/TEAD as the molecular target of Nerfin-1-mediated transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The zinc fingers of Nerfin-1 are required for Sd-binding and transcriptional repression</title><p>The most prominent structural feature of Nerfin-1 is the presence of three zinc fingers, referred to as ZF1, ZF2 and ZF3 hereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). To examine whether the zinc fingers are required for Sd-binding, we generated C-terminal truncations lacking all or some of the ZFs, as well as full-length Nerfin-1 carrying Cys-to-Ala mutations of two conserved cystine residues in each ZF (ZF1CA, ZF2CA or ZF3CA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In co-IP assays, a truncated Nerfin-1 protein lacking all ZFs (NT) completely abolished Nerfin-1-Sd interactions, while a truncated protein retaining ZF1 (NT-ZF1) could still bind Sd, suggesting that ZF1 is required for Nerfin-1-Sd interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the ZF1CA but not ZF3CA mutation abolished Nerfin-1-Sd interaction, while the ZF2CA mutation partially reduced Nerfin-1-Sd interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assayed the activity of the Nerfin-1 mutants <italic>in vivo</italic>. While overexpression of wildtype Nerfin-1 or ZF3CA by the GMR-Gal4 driver resulted in 100% pupal lethality, overexpression of ZF1CA by the same driver resulted in 100% flies surviving to adulthood and these flies had normal eye size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J and L</xref>). Overexpression of ZF2CA had an intermediate effect, with 25% flies surviving to adulthood with reduced eye size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). A similar trend was observed in HRE-luciferase reporter assay: ZF1CA was inactive and ZF3CA was fully functional in inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the SdN-YkiC fusion protein, while ZF2CA was partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). These structure-functional analyses further support our model implicating Nerfin-1 as a Sd-binding transcriptional repressor.</p><p>To further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Nerfin-1 represses Sd-mediated transcription, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine the physical interactions between these proteins and the endogenous <italic>diap1</italic> HRE site in S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, both Sd and Nerfin-1 associated with the <italic>diap1</italic> HRE. Interestingly, the binding of Sd to the HRE was decreased by the co-expression of Nerfin-1 but not a Nerfin-1 mutant protein defective in Sd-binding (ZF1CA). Together with our data implicating CtBP/HDAC in Nerfin-1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), these results suggest that Nerfin-1 represses Sd-dependent transcription both by compromising Sd-DNA interaction and by recruiting CtBP/HDAC corepressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nerfin-1 is dispensable for Hippo signaling in normal development</title><p>To investigate the physiological requirement of Nerfin-1, we examined loss-of-function mutant of <italic>nerfin-1</italic>.

We therefore examined <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant clones in several developmental contexts that are known to involve Hippo signaling. Given the antagonistic relationship between Nerfin-1 and Yki in dictating the transcriptional output of Sd, we expected that removal of endogenous Nerfin-1 may result in phenotypes resembling those caused by elevated Yki activity. Unexpectedly, we failed to detect such mutant phenotypes in multiple developmental contexts. First, mosaic eyes containing mutant clones for a null allele of <italic>nerfin-1</italic> did not show increased representation of mutant tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Instead of competition between <italic>Minute</italic> (red) and wildtype (white) cells, we assayed interactions between cells heterozygous for a recessive cell-lethal mutation (red) and wildtype (white) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>).

Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, Nerfin-1 physically associates with Sd and Yki, and the three proteins can form a trimeric complex. Second, in the eye discs, overexpression of Nerfin-1 suppresses tissue growth in an Sd-dependent manner. Third, Nerfin-1 genetically interacts with <italic>sd</italic> and <italic>yki</italic> in a dosage-dependent manner. Interestingly, the relationship between Nerfin-1 and Sd appears to be evolutionary conserved, since the mammalian counterparts of Nerfin-1, Sd and Yki also associate with each other and cooperatively regulate YAP target gene expression. Along this line, we note that loss of function of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Nerfin-1 and Sd, <italic>egl-46</italic> and <italic>egl-44</italic>, respectively, resulted in similar defects in the specification of FLP and HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the functional interactions between Nerfin-1 and Sd may have a deep evolutionary origin.</p><p>It is interesting to compare Nerfin-1 with another Sd-binding co-repressor, Tgi. While both proteins confer transcriptional repression by binding to Sd, there are clear differences in their mode of action. While Tgi and Yki bind to the C-terminal domain of Sd in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>), Nerfin-1 binds to the TEA DNA-binding domain of Sd, apparently independent of the binding of Yki to the C-terminal domain of Sd. Thus, Sd-Tgi binding, but not Sd-Nerfin-1 binding, is modulated by the strength of Hippo signaling. We have examined whether these proteins play redundant roles in Sd-mediated repression <italic>in vivo</italic> by generating <italic>nerfin-1 tgi</italic> double mutant combination, and found that loss of <italic>tgi</italic> does not enhance the proliferation of <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant tissues, or the ‘super-winner’ phenotype of <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant in cell competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). These results suggest that Nerfin-1 and Tgi are likely required in different contexts to suppress Sd function, although we cannot exclude the possibility that they are co-required in yet-to-be-identified biological contexts.</p><p>At present, how Tgi mediates transcriptional repression, especially the identity of the co-repressors recruited by Tgi to repress target gene transcription, remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, Nerfin-1 appears to repress target gene transcription by recruiting repressive histone modifying proteins such as CtBP-HDAC. Consistent with this notion, HDACs and CoREST, which are components of the CtBP-HDAC corepressor complex, were identified as proteins associated with the mammalian Nerfin-1 homologue INSM1 by IP/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Welcker et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, contrary to the Sd co-repressor Nerfin-1, the Sd co-activator Yki is known to confer transcriptional activation by recruiting the Trithorax-related (Trr) histone methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qing et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional output of Sd is dictated by the integration of positive and negative chromatin modifications at the target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Another insight from this study concerns the role of Nerfin-1 in cell competition. Although Nerfin-1 is dispensable for the growth of imaginal discs and ovarian follicle cells, we show that Nerfin-1 normally suppresses winner cell advantage in cell competition. Accordingly, loss of Nerfin-1 specifically in the winner cells confers a ‘super-winner’ phenotype, resulting in greater elimination of loser cells and increased representation of winner cells in mosaic tissues. Such ‘super-winner’ phenotype is mediated by increased Yki activity in the <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant winner cells, as reflected by both increased expression of the Yki target <italic>diap1</italic> in the winner cells and suppression of the ‘super-winner’ phenotype by halving the dosage of endogenous <italic>yki</italic>. Together with our molecular characterization of Nerfin-1, these results suggest that Nerfin-1 normally suppresses winner cell advantage by antagonizing the Sd-Yki complex in the winner cells. Since cell competition is conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gogna et al., 2015</xref>), it will be interesting to examine whether the mammalian counterpart of Nerfin-1 (INSM1) also plays a conserved role in cell competition.</p><p>Our findings uncovering a Yki-dependent requirement for Nerfin-1 in cell competition have several implications. First, although a number of genetic perturbations are known to cause cell competition, to our knowledge, <italic>nerfin-1</italic> is the first example of mutations that do not confer cell competition per se, but instead modulate the degree of cell competition conferred by others. Thus, cell competition is not simply the constitutive outcome of juxtaposition of cells of different fitness; the process itself is subjected to additional regulation. Second, although previous studies have implicated the Hippo signaling pathway in cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neto-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tyler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ziosi et al., 2010</xref>), those studies involved conditions in which Yki is massively activated at supraphysiological level. Our study therefore provides the first evidence that Yki is required for cell competition at its endogenous physiological level. Lastly, given that Nerfin-1 is dispensable for the growth of imaginal discs and ovarian follicle cells but is required for antagonizing Yki activity in cell competition, it is possible that Nerfin-1 is preferentially required in physiological contexts that involve interactions between cells with different Yki activity. Besides cell competition, cells with differential Yki activity have been documented in several examples of epithelial regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grusche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Losick et al., 2013</xref>). It will thus be interesting to examine the requirement of Nerfin-1 in these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>FLAG-Nerfin-1 construct was generated from cDNA clone LD18634 obtained from <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center (DGRC).

Two micrograms of primary antibodies and 50 μl of protein G agarose were used in each assay. The immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. All values were normalized to the input. The primers for analyzing the ChIP are provided as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>HRE Forward: <named-content content-type="sequence">ACGAACACGAAGACCAAA</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p>HRE Reverse: <named-content content-type="sequence">CTCCAAGCCAGTTTGATT</named-content></p></list-item></list><p>For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For each sample, 1 ug RNA was used for reverse transcription using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). 100 ng cDNA was used for real-time PCR with SYBR master mix (BioRad). Real-time PCR was performed using CFX96 real-time system (BioRad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Richard Fehon for Ex and Mer antibodies, Dr. Ward Odenwald for <italic>nerfin-1<sup>54</sup></italic> mutant fly, Dr. Nicholas Baker for <italic>RpL36</italic> transgenic fly, and the Bloomington Stock Centers for <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nerfin-1 represses transcriptional output of Hippo signaling in cell competition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. All individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eduardo Moreno (Reviewer #1); Kun-Liang Guan (Reviewer #2); Georg Halder (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The Hippo pathway is a critical regulator of growth and its mis-regulation, a major cause of oncogenic transformation in multiple tissues. This manuscript identifies Nerfin-1 as a novel regulator of the Hippo pathway that controls this pathway at the level of Sd DNA binding transcription factor and regulates the activity of the Hippo-regulated Yki transcriptional co-activator. Both biochemical and functional data showed that Nerfin-1 directly binds to Sd and represses gene expression. Nerfin-1 overexpression suppresses tissue growth and this effect is dependent on Sd. Surprisingly, Nerfin-1 deletion does not show a dramatic effect of growth in multiple tissues, suggesting it does not have a major role in physiological organ/tissue size control. However and interestingly, the authors showed that Nerfin-1 plays a role in cell competition as Nerfiin-1 inactivation promotes the winner cells to eliminate loser cells. Finally, data are presented to show that the mammalian Nerfin-1 homolog INSM1 similarly binds to and inhibits TEAD dependent transcription.</p><p>The data presented are good quality and support the major conclusions in the paper. Although Vg/VGL4 have been shown to inhibit Sd/TEAD dependent transcription, the mechanism of Nerfin-1/INSM1 in transcription repression of Sd/TEAD is different. Therefore, the study by Pan and colleagues has revealed a new mechanism of Hippo pathway transcription regulation and has high potential significance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear that the cell lethality shown in Figure 4J-N is due to cell competition rather than a case of autonomous lethality of the homozygous cells. The efficiency of ey-flp is quite high and therefore, Figure 4E and 4F do not assay cell competition either since with this high recombination level, the number of hets will be small, and red cells left are not uniquely identified as heterozygotes. Figure 5 is more convincing, as it uses hsFlp to induce recombination.</p><p>2) It will be very useful to know if Myc induced super-competition is similarly affected by Nerfin. Myc overexpression presents its own issues, but perhaps inclusion of p35 will still trigger supercompetition (Levayer et al., Nature 2015). This can be combined with Nerfin RNAi. Alternatively, Yki overexpression could be combined with Nerfin RNAi.</p><p>3) Does Nerfin1 block transcription by blocking the interaction of Sd with DNA or by recruiting CtBP corepressors or both? Does Nerfin1 bind to DNA?</p><p>4) On a similar vein, to further strengthen the study, the authors need to demonstrate that the function of Nerfon-1 in cell competition is mediated by Sd.</p><p>5) The authors argue that Nerfin-1 and Tgi act in parallel through different mechanisms and also Tgi is not sufficient to explain the suppressor function of Sd, The one obvious experiment missing is the phenotype and the explanation for it, of the Nerfin-1 Tgi double mutant. This is easy to do, and the results from it need to be included in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38843.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] However and interestingly, the authors showed that Nerfin-1 plays a role in cell competition as Nerfiin-1 inactivation promotes the winner cells to eliminate loser cells.

The efficiency of ey-flp is quite high and therefore, Figure 4E and 4F do not assay cell competition either since with this high recombination level, the number of hets will be small, and red cells left are not uniquely identified as heterozygotes. Figure 5 is more convincing, as it uses hsFlp to induce recombination.</p></disp-quote><p>The small number of heterozygous cells should not be a problem, since the eyeless-Flp system has been used extensively to study <italic>Minute</italic>-mediated cell competition (see for example, Tyler et al., 2007 and Lee et al., 2018, Dev Cell 46: 456-469). It is also worth noting that in such eyes, the red cells are unambiguously heterozygous for the cell-lethal mutation (<italic>cl</italic>) or <italic>Minute</italic>, since homozygous mutant cells of <italic>cl</italic> or <italic>Minute</italic> do not survive to adults. Therefore, this system allows one to unambiguously assess the relative fitness of WT cells versus <italic>cl</italic>/+ or <italic>Minute</italic>/+ cells. Irrespective of the baseline percentage of red cells in the eyeless-Flp system, the key is that we have uncovered increased occupancy of <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant cells compared to the WT cells, using both <italic>cl</italic> and <italic>Minute</italic> mutations (Figure 4). Importantly, similar results were obtained using hs-Flp-induced <italic>Minute</italic> wing discs (Figure 5E-F).</p><p>We acknowledge that unlike <italic>Minute</italic>, the interactions between WT and <italic>cl</italic>/+ cells are not classic examples of cell competition, although a recent paper from Hariharan lab has used this genetic setup to implicate Crumbs in cell competition (Hafezi et al., 2012). That is why we use <italic>cl</italic>/+ as an additional example to supplement our <italic>Minute</italic> experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It will be very useful to know if Myc induced super-competition is similarly affected by Nerfin. Myc overexpression presents its own issues, but perhaps inclusion of p35 will still trigger supercompetition (Levayer et al., Nature 2015). This can be combined with Nerfin RNAi. Alternatively, Yki overexpression could be combined with Nerfin RNAi.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper focuses on the molecular characterization of Nerfin-1 as a novel Sd-Yki co-repressor, and we have already presented <italic>in vivo</italic> data showing the requirement of Nerfin-1 in two different models of cell competition. While we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to examine additional contexts of cell competition, we feel that these studies are beyond the scope of the current study. Along this line, we note that numerous genetic perturbations can all lead to cell competition, and currently it is unclear whether they all employ similar molecular mechanisms – for example, even for many of the better studied cell competition genes such as Xrp1, Sas and PTP10D, it is unclear whether they are involved in all contexts of cell competition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does Nerfin1 block transcription by blocking the interaction of Sd with DNA or by recruiting CtBP corepressors or both? Does Nerfin1 bind to DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s questions, we performed ChIP analysis in S2R+ cells to study the binding of Sd and Nerfin-1 to the HRE site of the endogenous <italic>diap1</italic> locus (a known Sd-Yki target gene). We found that both proteins bind to the HRE site, and interestingly, the binding of Sd to HRE was decreased by the co-expression of Nerfin-1 but not a Nerfin-1 mutant protein defective in Sd-binding (Nerfin-1ZF1CA). These data are presented in a new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) in our revised paper. Together with our data showing Nerfin-1-CtBP interactions, these results suggest that Nerfin-1 represses Sd-dependent transcription both by compromising Sd-DNA interaction and by recruiting CtBP corepressors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On a similar vein, to further strengthen the study, the authors need to demonstrate that the function of Nerfon-1 in cell competition is mediated by Sd.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion. Since Nerfin-1 functions in the winner cells only, in order to demonstrate that Nerfin-1’s function in cell competition is mediated by Sd, one needs to remove <italic>sd</italic> specifically in the winner cells. This experiment is technically challenging since <italic>sd</italic> is on the X chromosome and <italic>nerfin-1</italic> is on the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome, and would require an <italic>sd</italic>-rescue transgene on the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome, which are not available. As an alternative, we tried to do this by RNAi knockdown of <italic>sd</italic>. Unfortunately, we had difficulties recovering compound mutant flies containing UAS-sdRNAi and <italic>nerfin-1/Minute</italic> with multiple attempts. Despite that, given our biochemical characterization of Nerfin-1-Sd protein interaction, the observation that the Nerfin-1 overexpression phenotype is dependent on Sd, the observation that the <italic>nerfin-1</italic> cell competition phenotype is sensitive to Yki dosage as well as the elevated expression of Sd target <italic>diap1</italic> in <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant winner cells, we feel that there is reasonable support for Nerfin-1 function through Sd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors argue that Nerfin-1 and Tgi act in parallel through different mechanisms and also Tgi is not sufficient to explain the suppressor function of Sd, The one obvious experiment missing is the phenotype and the explanation for it, of the Nerfin-1 Tgi double mutant. This is easy to do, and the results from it need to be included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have generated the <italic>nerfin-1 tgi</italic> double mutant. We found that the <italic>nerfin-1 tgi</italic> double mutant tissues do not over-proliferate compared to <italic>nerfin-1</italic> mutant tissues. We also analyzed the <italic>nerfin-1 tgi</italic> double mutant in <italic>Minute</italic> and <italic>cl</italic>/+ mediated cell competition and found that loss of <italic>tgi</italic> does not result in a “super-winner” phenotype, nor does it enhance the “super-winner” phenotype of <italic>nerfin-1</italic>. These new data are included in Figure 4—figure supplement 2F-H in the revised paper. Taken together, these results suggest that Nerfin-1 and Tgi may be required in different contexts to suppress Sd function.</p></body></sub-article></article>
