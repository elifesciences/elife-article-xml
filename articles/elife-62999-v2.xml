reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>During adolescence, chemicals and cells in the brain undergo significant reorganization. These changes are thought to be why teenagers are often more vulnerable to developing drug addictions and psychiatric disorders. However, it is not fully understood how the brain transforms during this transitional period.</p><p>Most of this reorganization takes place in the dopamine system which is responsible for triggering pleasurable sensations, including the feeling of reward after taking drugs. In 2020, a group of researchers found that adolescent male rats released less of the chemical dopamine in a part of the brain involved in the reward pathway than adult rats. But it was unclear what was causing this age-related effect.</p><p>To investigate, Iacino et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2020 study –blocked a family of receptors called nAChRs (short for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) in the brain cells of male rats. These receptors bind to a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine which stimulates cells to release dopamine. Iacino et al. found that inhibiting a specific type of nAChR led to a decrease in dopamine in adult rats, but an increase in early adolescent rats. However, this effect was not observed when other types of nAChRs were inhibited.</p><p>Iacino et al. found that the adolescent male rats also had higher levels of another neurotransmitter called GABA which blocks the release of dopamine. This led them to hypothesize that the reduced levels of dopamine in early adolescence may be due to increased levels of GABA, which is secreted by specialized cells which also have nAChRs on their surface<bold>.</bold></p><p>To investigate, Iacino et al. blocked two receptors for GABA that are found on dopamine-releasing neurons before exposing the rats to the nAChR inhibitor. This caused the adolescent rats to release less dopamine following nAChR inhibition, similar to the levels observed in adult rats. These findings suggest that the nAChR inhibitor leads to a rise in dopamine by stopping cells from releasing GABA – but only in adolescent rats.</p><p>The work of Iacino et al. demonstrates how the dopamine system differs in adolescence, which may provide new insights in to why teenagers are often more susceptible to addiction. For instance, nicotine, the addictive substance in cigarettes, can also bind to nAChRs and make them less sensitive to acetylcholine. This may reduce the release of GABA, resulting in more dopamine being released which is then sensed as a reward by the teenage brain. However, more research is needed to fully understand how this brain circuit is modulated by nicotine intake.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>adolescence</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA031791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA006634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA026117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA028162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pitts</surname><given-names>Elizabeth G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM102773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pitts</surname><given-names>Elizabeth G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peter McManus Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA058517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iacino</surname><given-names>Melody C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA052460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A circuit within the nucleus accumbens that exists during a specific developmental window through early adolescence male rats may serve as a substrate that underlies heightened reward seeking in this population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adolescence is the transitional period between childhood and adulthood characterized by changes in behaviors, such as increases in risk-taking, sensation seeking, and peer-focused sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spear, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spear, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>). These behavioral changes are thought to be evolutionarily advantageous, as they allow for the exploration necessary for a transition to independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spear, 2000</xref>). However, adolescence is also a time of increased vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (SUD), schizophrenia, and affective disorders, that can persist into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fareri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steinberg, 2008</xref>). Adolescent onset is also associated with increased severity of a range of psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kyriakopoulos and Frangou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Teicher, 2008</xref>). This may be, in part, because the brain is still developing during this vulnerable period and disturbances, such as drug-taking or stress, may disrupt the natural developmental trajectory. Thus, understanding how the adolescent brain develops in a normative state may help us pinpoint how and why this system is perturbed in disease.</p><p>Reorganization of the dopamine system is hypothesized to underlie many of the changes in adolescent behavior, particularly in reward-related learning and decision-making, and the increased vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spear, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahlstrom et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wahlstrom et al., 2010b</xref>). Preclinical research indicates that the dopamine system is going through major changes in adolescence. For example, the density of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum, firing rate of dopamine neurons, and dopamine synthesis all peak during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teicher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tarazi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Philpot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCutcheon et al., 2012</xref>). While reports examining extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum show both lower and higher levels of dopamine during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badanich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Philpot et al., 2009</xref>), sub-second stimulated dopamine release is consistently found to be decreased in the striatum of adolescent rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stamford, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palm and Nylander, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>). Our lab has previously shown that the maximum concentration of evoked dopamine release is decreased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of early adolescent male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>), though the mechanism responsible for differentially regulating dopamine release in adolescent and adult rats remains unclear.</p><p>Since previous research from our lab revealed that the NAc core has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>), we focused this report on understanding the mechanisms mediating dopamine release in that region. This is of particular interest because the NAc core is essential for regulating reward-related learning and goal-directed decision- making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Chiara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saddoris et al., 2013</xref>), which are altered during adolescence. Moreover, terminal dopamine release in the striatum does not always correspond with action potentials from ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trulson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). Release is also regulated by local circuitry via both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic mechanisms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nolan et al., 2020</xref>). Functionality of dopamine transporters and release probability (homosynaptic regulation) can both mediate stimulated dopamine release (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>). Heterosynaptic mechanisms include neurotransmitter release from local interneurons and projection neurons, such as acetylcholine interneurons, which play a critical role in regulating local terminal dopamine release (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Saunders, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nolan et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, optogenetic stimulation of acetylcholine release drives terminal dopamine release independent of action potential through activation of nAChRs on dopamine terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>). This local control over terminal dopamine release has important implications for how dopamine encodes salient information and drives behavior, and one or more of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate terminal dopamine release may change between adolescence and adulthood.</p><p>Extensive evidence indicates sex differences exist in the dopaminergic system and its local regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuhn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zachry et al., 2021</xref>). Previously, we have demonstrated that female adolescent rats have significantly higher evoked dopamine release in the NAc core as well as other subregions compared to that of adolescent male rats and adult females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the relationship between adolescent and adult dopamine release is opposite in females, and, therefore, either (1) the mechanisms explored here will likely not be the same for females as males, or (2) there is a secondary effect that masks this mechanism in females by altering the relationship we observe at baseline. Since these mechanisms are more than likely sexually dimorphic, we focus here on parsing out the mechanism involved in the changes seen within the adolescent and adult male dopaminergic system. Further research, some of which we are conducting, is needed to understand the relationship between male and female rats.</p><p>Given the role of local modulators in the dopamine system, variations in heterosynaptic regulation of striatal dopamine release may be responsible for the neurobiological changes seen between adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the role of local modulators on presynaptic NAc dopamine release of adult and adolescent male rats is the mechanism responsible for driving such developmental changes. Here, we use ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to compare stimulated dopamine release and local circuitry regulation in the NAc core of adult and adolescent male rats. We then use microdialysis to determine the influence of other extrinsic factors in vivo in mediating developmental changes in the dopaminergic system. Enhancing our understanding of the transitional changes in dopamine regulation may shed light on the mechanisms driving changes in reward-related behaviors, and related increase in vulnerability, that are characteristic of adolescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adolescent male rats have decreased dopamine release in the NAc core</title><p>We first compared the maximum concentration of stimulated dopamine release in the NAc core of adult (&gt;P70) and early adolescent (P28-35) male rats using ex vivo FSCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Adolescent male rats have significantly lower evoked dopamine release to single-pulse stimulations (<italic>t</italic>15=2.938, p=0.010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and across a range of stimulation parameters that model tonic- (5–10 Hz) and phasic-like (20–100 Hz) firing of dopamine neurons (main effect of age: <italic>F</italic>1, 20=10.96, p=0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Differences in dynamics at the dopamine terminal can modulate stimulated dopamine release (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nolan et al., 2020</xref>). For example, activity of dopamine transporters (DAT) have been shown to impact stimulated dopamine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Condon et al., 2019</xref>).

We thus compared paired-pulse ratios, a measure of dopamine release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cragg, 2003</xref>), between adult and adolescent rats.

Acetylcholine, signaling through multiple sub-types of nAChRs, is an important modulator of evoked dopamine release in the NAc core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, acetylcholine can drive dopamine release independent of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>) and tonically released acetylcholine increases baseline dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, antagonism or desensitization of nAChRs alters dopamine release in a frequency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rice and Cragg, 2004</xref>). Given the importance of nAChRs as a local mediator of dopamine release, we applied various drugs that selectively targeted each nAChR sub-type in the NAc core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Livingstone and Wonnacott, 2009</xref>) and compared changes in the maximum concentration of dopamine released in adults and adolescents. Methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective α7 nAChR antagonist, impacted dopamine release [expressed as a percentage of pre-MLA (drug-free), single-pulse release] in a frequency-dependent manner, but not in an age-dependent manner (MLA X frequency interaction: <italic>F</italic>4, 109.654=4.347, p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, H</xref>). In contrast, α- conotoxin PIA (α-Ctx), a selective antagonist of α6-containing nAChRs, differentially impacted dopamine release (normalized to single-pulse, pre-α-Ctx release) in adult and adolescent rats (age X α-Ctx interaction: <italic>F</italic>1, 161.896=27.218, p&lt;0.001), decreasing dopamine release to tonic-like stimulations in adults (1 pulse: <italic>t</italic>6=5.743, p=0.0012; 5 pulse 5 Hz: <italic>t</italic>6=6.917, p&lt;0.001; 5 pulse 10 Hz: <italic>t</italic>6=4.927, p=0.0026) and increasing dopamine release to phasic-like stimulations in adolescents (5 pulse 20 Hz: <italic>t</italic>10=2.335, p=0.0417; 5 pulse 100 Hz: <italic>t</italic>10=3.276, p=0.0084) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, H</xref>). When Dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DhβE), a β2-selective antagonist, was applied following α-Ctx, it further decreased dopamine release, but did not impact dopamine release differently by age group when plotted as a percent of pre-α-Ctx/drug-free baseline (main effect of DHβE: <italic>F</italic>1, 161.022=11.787, p=0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, H</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows that DHβE also has no effect when analyzed as a percentage of dopamine levels that are present following α-Ctx on the slice (i.e. replotted as α-Ctx baseline). To further determine whether α- Ctx is differentially impacting other terminal dopamine dynamics in an age-specific manner, we then examined the rate of dopamine uptake via the dopamine transporter (<italic>V</italic>max) and paired-pulse ratios. α-Ctx did not impact <italic>V</italic>max differently in adult and early adolescent rats (<italic>t</italic>17=0.131, p=0.898) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

To investigate whether the differential modulation of dopamine release by α-Ctx in early adolescent and adult rats is mediated through a multi-synaptic mechanism mediated by GABA, we antagonized GABAA and GABAB receptors, alone or together, prior to the bath application of α-Ctx and then compared the effects of α-Ctx in the presence or absence of GABA receptor antagonism. If the age-related effects of α-Ctx are mediated through GABA receptors, then antagonism of GABA receptors prior to α-Ctx application should eliminate differences in dopamine release modulation between adult and adolescent rats.

Supporting this, we found that GABA prevents the α-Ctx-induced increase in dopamine release in adolescents, causing adolescents to respond to α- Ctx similarly to adult rats (age X frequency X drug interaction: <italic>F</italic>4, 110.026=3.189, p=0.016) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We next analyzed the effects of GABA alone prior to α-Ctx application, although the effects of GABA alone might extend beyond just blocking the α-Ctx effect. We found there were age-related effects of GABA alone on dopamine release (prior to α-Ctx), that were opposite that of α-Ctx, albeit with a smaller effect size.

If age-related effects of α6- nAChRs are mediated by variations in adolescent GABA tone, then infusing α-Ctx directly into the NAc should demonstrate the α-Ctx-induced reduction of GABA levels. Baseline recordings of GABA levels in the NAc revealed that adolescent GABA tone was significantly higher than adult GABA tone (main effect of age: F1,27=4.88, p=0.0358) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

These results provide parallel evidence to our finding that the α-Ctx-induced increase in dopamine release in adolescent male rats may be GABA-mediated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Significant reorganization of the dopamine system occurs during the transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. Adolescents exhibit greater dopamine receptor levels, increased neuronal sensitivity, and altered dopamine dynamics when compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teicher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolanos et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galvan, 2010</xref>). Restructuring of the dopamine system occurs in protein expression and activity that affects dopamine release or uptake. Although these transitional changes in dopamine release are implicated in a wide range of psychiatric disorders, much is unknown about the mechanisms driving these age-related differences. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify variations in NAc core stimulated dopamine release and pinpoint the mechanism for which these changes may occur in adolescent and adult male rats.</p><p>Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>), we showed no difference in our measure of dopamine uptake (Vmax) between adult and adolescent male rats in the NAc, suggesting the rate of dopamine uptake does not drive differences in stimulated dopamine release shown here. While the affinity of dopamine for the DAT (i.e. Km) has been shown to be different in prior publications by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker and Kuhn, 2008</xref>), the dopamine curves we generated were optimized for measures of release and Vmax, not baseline affinity measurements (i.e. Km). Km is traditionally derived from the bottom third of the descending portion of the dopamine curve in FSCV, and electrode adsorption and other artifacts are known to occlude this outcome measure without affecting our other measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we did not quantify this measure and it remains possible that the affinity of dopamine for the DAT could be different between these groups.</p><p>Stimulation parameters were adjusted to model both tonic- and phasic-like neuronal firing across a wide range of frequencies in order to mimic physiologically relevant firing patterns. Replicating our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>), the present study found decreased dopamine release in the NAc core of adolescent male rats. This is consistent with in vivo evidence of male adolescent rats demonstrating lower NAc dopamine release than adults. For example, high-frequency stimulations of the VTA in anesthetized rats reveal significantly greater stimulated NAc dopamine release in adult males compared to adolescent males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker and Kuhn, 2008</xref>). In freely moving rats, differences in dopamine release between early adolescence and adulthood appear stimuli-specific and differ in habituation over repeated exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the frequency of dopamine transients was no different between early adolescent and adult rats both at baseline and in the initial response to social interactions with other rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). However, the unexpected presentation of additional stimuli across many modalities showed less frequent dopamine responses in early adolescent rats compared to the classic dopamine response of adult rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). We found that decreases in stimulated dopamine release are not driven by differences in release probability within a burst. For example, the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) shows the relative magnitude of release attributed to each pulse in a single burst. This differs from electrophysiological PPR in that we are directly observing the relative release magnitude from a population of neurons (as opposed to a single cell) between pulse 1 and pulse 2. PPRs are known to be frequency dependent as we show here, but we find there are no age-related differences in the distribution of release magnitude across pulses in a single burst. Of note, we previously found the age-related relationship of dopamine release in the NAc core to be opposite in females compared to males, with higher NAc dopamine release in adolescent females as compared to adult females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitts et al., 2020</xref>). However, research has demonstrated that striatal dopamine release is robustly regulated by ovarian hormone regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoest et al., 2018</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zachry et al., 2021</xref>). Given these physiological differences, our proposed mechanism may be masked, or is not representative of the female dopamine system. Thus, we focus the present studies on mechanisms underlying the male adolescent and adult dopamine system with plans to study female mechanisms of dopamine release in future work.</p><p>Given no differences in uptake rate or release probability within a burst, we shifted our focus to examining the involvement of heterosynaptic regulators, like cholinergic interneurons (CIN), on local dopamine release. We examined CIN influence on dopamine release under single pulse conditions and in the aggregate magnitude of release attributed to multiple pulses in a burst that mimics ‘tonic-like’ or ‘phasic-like’ firing conditions (i.e. not the relative release across individual pulses in a single burst as with the PPR). Acetylcholine and nAChRs are important regulators of terminal dopamine release within the striatum (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Saunders, 2020</xref>). Activation of CINs can cause dopamine release independent of VTA-mediated action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>), while pauses in CINs amplify the signal-to-background dopamine release by decreasing dopamine to low-frequency activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cragg, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the antagonism of nAChRs has been shown to regulate dopamine release in a frequency-dependent manner, decreasing dopamine release to tonic-like stimulations, while not impacting or facilitating dopamine release to phasic-like stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rice and Cragg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cragg, 2006</xref>). We found differences between adult and adolescent rats in modulation of NAc core dopamine release by α6- containing nAChRs, but not by α7 or non-α6 β2* nAChRs. Indeed, the application of α-Ctx (a selective α6- containing nAChRs antagonist) had a completely different effect on dopamine release in adults compared to early adolescent male rats. Namely, α-Ctx decreased dopamine release to tonic-like firing in male adults, while increasing dopamine release to stimulation frequencies that model phasic-like firing in male adolescents. A previous study from our lab using adult rats found that those rats most vulnerable to sensation seeking and markers of SUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siciliano et al., 2017</xref>) display a similar pattern of dopamine release to adolescent rats in the present study, particularly with respect to how α6-containing nAChRs modulated dopamine release. This is an intriguing finding and may indicate that α6-containing nAChR regulation of dopamine is a biomarker for vulnerability to SUD given that adolescence is a particularly susceptible time for sensation seeking and SUD development. Additional experiments and studies across more models of vulnerability are necessary to strengthen this comparison.</p><p>We next found that antagonists of GABAA and/or GABAB receptors applied prior to administration of α-Ctx blocked the α-Ctx-induced facilitation of dopamine release in adolescents, but not in adults. Blocking GABA receptors in adolescent rats unmasked the α-Ctx mediated decrease in dopamine release at single pulse and lower frequency stimulations that is well documented in prior literature and in the current adult rat group. This suggests that the blockade of α6-containing nAChRs in adolescent rats may have two parallel and independent mechanisms, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The first is the well-documented direct blocking of α6-containing nAChRs on dopamine varicosities that decreases DA release at low-frequency stimulations (i.e. the ‘masked’ effect in adolescents but present for adults). The second, and novel mechanism through early adolescence we propose, is an α-Ctx mediated reduction in GABA control of dopamine release that disinhibits dopamine and is responsible for the increase that is specific to adolescent rats. Indeed, nAChRs are expressed on the pre-synaptic terminals of GABA interneurons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tepper et al., 2018</xref>) and research indicates GABAA (and possibly GABAB) receptors are located on dopamine terminals and can impact both dopamine and GABA co-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pitman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Melchior et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2024</xref>). By applying GABA receptor antagonists prior to α-Ctx, the α-Ctx-mediated changes in dopamine are free from the influence of GABA. This is confirmed by our separate experimental finding that exogenous application of GABA prior to α-Ctx also prevents the age-related differences observed following α-Ctx alone. Thus, we propose that for early adolescent rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), α-Ctx blocks α6 nAChRs on GABA releasing cells to lower the influence of GABA on dopamine varicosities upon stimulation. The putative source of this GABA that expresses α6 nAChRs includes both local GABA interneurons and dopamine varicosities that co-release GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2024</xref>). This leads to disinhibition of dopamine and the elevated levels we observe only in adolescents. This effect masks the parallel mechanism of the direct influence of acetylcholine on dopamine release via varicosities only observed in adult rats. By replacing the reduced GABA levels caused by α-Ctx directly with exogenously applied GABA, or by blocking GABA receptors, we bypass the mechanism of α-Ctx-mediated reduction in GABA and subsequent disinhibition of dopamine. Although prior research has found no difference in the density of α6-containing nAChRs in the NAc of early adolescents and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doura et al., 2008</xref>), differences in localization or functionality of either α6-containing nAChRs or GABA receptors may underlie changes that create this novel multisynaptic mechanism of dopamine regulation in adolescent males.</p><p>Antagonizing GABAA or GABAB receptors, alone or together, did not impact dopamine release directly (i.e. outside of α6 nAChR modulation). In fact, prior literature on the effects of GABA antagonism on dopamine release is mixed. Some report no direct impact on dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pitman et al., 2014</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2024</xref> recently confirmed the presence of GABA-mediated inhibition of striatal dopamine release in male and female mice. In that study, the non-competitive antagonist of GABA<sub>A</sub>R chloride channels (i.e. Picrotoxin) was able to increase/disinhibit dopamine in the dorsal striatum and NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 2024</xref>). Differences in methodology, such as optogenetic versus electrical stimulation of dopamine varicosities, may account for the lack of GABA<sub>A</sub>R or GABA<sub>B</sub>R antagonist effect in our study. Given the non-selective nature of electrically evoked dopamine release here, it is possible that additional nearby GABA sources (compared to optogenetic studies) released enough GABA to ‘outcompete’ the competitive antagonists. Since GABA antagonists were only effective in the presence of α-Ctx, we propose that α-Ctx-mediated decreases in GABA may have lowered GABA enough to unmask the effects of the GABA competitive antagonists. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodnik et al., 2019</xref> found that GABAA receptor regulation of dopamine release in the NAc core functions through GABAB receptor activation. It is possible that a similar mechanism of action is mediating the effects seen here, although we did not investigate varying combinations of activation vs inhibition of GABAA and GABAB receptors. However, given this lack of direct effect of GABA antagonism on dopamine release, we applied GABA on the slice to confirm the role of GABA on the α-Ctx mediated effect as discussed earlier. Overall, activation of GABA receptors using GABA alone on slice led to small, but divergent dopamine release in adolescents and adults. The mechanism for this is not known, but could be differential effects of GABA receptor sensitivity on dopamine varicosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodnik et al., 2019</xref>) or on CINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yorgason et al., 2022</xref>). Regardless, the small effects of GABA alone on a slice in the presence of endogenous GABA are likely independent of the α6-mediated control of dopamine release explored in the present study.</p><p>Lastly, we used microdialysis in awake rats to confirm that the age-dependent differences in male dopamine release are mediated by a GABA mechanism involving α6-containing nAChRs in vivo. Indeed, the effects in vivo were consistent with expectations set by our studies in slices. First, we found that GABA tone is higher at baseline in adolescents compared to adults, which is consistent with greater inhibition of dopamine release in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, top row). Moreover, infusing α-Ctx directly into the NAc altered GABA tone in an age-dependent manner as indicated by the Age X Drug Interaction. Notably, α-Ctx mediated reductions in adolescent GABA levels are comparable to adult baseline GABA levels. Thus, blocking α6 nAChRs in adolescent rats makes GABA and dopamine signaling similar to that of adult rats at baseline in both our microdialysis and FSCV studies. Further studies are needed to understand the microcircuitry mediating the α6-containing nAChR regulation of dopamine release in adolescent rats. Interestingly, one report using adult mice found that antagonizing GABAB receptors increased dopamine release when β2-containing nAChRs were antagonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopes et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that GABA and nAChRs have a potentially complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that we suggest here may be age/developmental stage dependent.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that stimulated dopamine release is decreased in the NAc core of early adolescent male rats. This effect is driven, in part, by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release only in adolescent male rats, through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahlstrom et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wahlstrom et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Padmanabhan and Luna, 2014</xref>) and these changes are implicated in behavior as well as increased vulnerability to the development of various psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spear, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spear, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahlstrom et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wahlstrom et al., 2010b</xref>). The present study gives us novel insight into age-related differences in dopamine release and its regulation, thus highlighting critical neurochemical targets that may partially underlie these behavioral changes. Examining how these systems develop in healthy individuals is imperative to our understanding of how perturbations may disrupt development and lead to certain disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Early adolescent (P28-35), mid-adolescent (P38-42), and adult (P70-90) male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Huntingdon, UK) were maintained on a 12:12 hr reverse light/dark cycle (4:00 a.m. lights off; 4:00 p.m. lights on) with food and water available ad libitum. All animals were ordered in and allowed one week to habituate in the home chamber/housing colony prior to the start of experiments. All animals were maintained according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facilities (Accreditation #: 00008; PHS Assurance #: D16-00248 (A3391-01)). All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Wake Forest School of Medicine (Protocol Approval #: A21-143).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and then euthanized by rapid decapitation in a ventilated area free of blood or tissue from previous animals. Brains were rapidly removed and transferred into pre-oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): NaCl (126), KCl (2.5), monobasic NaH2PO4 (1.2), CaCl2 (2.4), MgCl2 (1.2), NaHCO3 (25), dextrose (D-glucose) (11), and L-ascorbic acid (0.4).

We used ex vivo FSCV for its many unique advantages, including the precise manipulation of local microcircuitry. Slice FSCV has high temporal and spatial resolution and can measure the effects of multiple drugs within a single animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferris et al., 2013</xref>) Briefly, a carbon-fiber recording microelectrode was placed 100–150 mm from a bipolar stimulating electrode. Extracellular dopamine was recorded by applying a triangular waveform (–0.4 to +1.2 to - 0.4 V <italic>vs</italic> Ag/Agcl, 400 V/s), sampling every 100 ms. Dopamine release was initially evoked by a single electrical pulse (750 mA, 2 ms, monophasic) applied to the tissue every 3 min. After the extracellular dopamine response was stable (three collections within &lt;10% variability), five-pulse stimulations were applied at varying frequencies (5, 10, 20, or 100 Hz) to model the physiological range of dopamine neuron firing. Additionally, paired-pulse stimulations were used to determine baseline probability of dopamine release. Paired-pulse ratios can be used to determine the release probability of dopamine (Condon et a., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cragg, 2003</xref>). We define paired-pulse ratio in a manner consistent with extant literature, namely as the ratio P2/P1, where P1 is peak dopamine release detected following 1 p stimulus and P2 is the peak dopamine release attributable to the second stimulation only. P2 was determined by subtracting dopamine release, including decay phase, after a single pulse from the summed paired-pulse response (i.e. P2-P1/P1).</p><p>After assessing the dopamine response to varying stimulation parameters, various compounds targeting nAChRs (Methyllycaconitine [MLA; a selective α7 nAChR antagonist], 30 nM; α-conotoxin PIA [α-Ctx; a selective α6-containing nAChR antagonist], 100 nM; dihydro-beta-erythroidine [DhβE; a selective β2-containing nAChR antagonist], 500 nM) or GABARs (Bicuculline [BIC; a selective GABAAR antagonist], 10 μM; CGP-52432 [CGP; A selective GABABR antagonist], 5 μM; γ-Aminobutyric acid [GABA], 10 μM) were bath applied and dopamine response equilibrated to single pulse stimulation. Separate slices from the same animal were used to test each drug independently, and the same frequency-response curves assessed under drug-free conditions were reassessed following drug application in each slice. In order to test the distinct contributions of α6* and non-α6* nAChRs, we added α-Ctx and DhβE in a cumulative fashion, equilibrating and testing single and multi-pulse frequencies (described above) following α-Ctx and then DhβE. Changes in dopamine signaling between α-Ctx alone and in combination with DHβE differentiated the contribution of α6* and non-α6* β2-containing nAChRs. Similarly, to examine the role of GABA or GABARs in the effects of α-Ctx, we bath applied GABA or BIC and CGP alone or together. Then, after equilibration and frequency-response curves, we applied α-Ctx and re-tested single- and multi-pulse stimulations. We ran only single doses of each compound because multiple different drugs and/or multiple stimulation parameters were applied on a limited number of slices per animal. Thus, we did not test whether group differences were a result of shifts in potency and/or efficacy. Examining single concentrations and documenting these effects across multiple stimulation parameters and the systems involved in the current study provides impetus to explore these additional outcomes in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo microdialysis</title><p>Freely moving microdialysis was used to determine how extracellular GABA in the interstitial fluid varies in adults versus adolescents. Microdialysis guide cannulae (BASinc, West Lafayette, IN) were stereotaxically implanted and counter-balanced in a separate cohort of adult and adolescent rats above the NAc. Adult (P70-90) coordinates were anteroposterior +1.2 mm, lateral ±2 mm, and ventral –5.2 mm. Coordinates are relative to bregma, midline, and skull surface, respectively. Adolescent (P28-35) coordinates were calculated individually using a bregma/lambda ratio in comparison with adult bregma/lambda measurements (~9 mm adult distance). For example, if the distance between bregma and lambda was 8.3 mm for a single adolescent, our ratio for that individual would be 8.3 mm/9 mm. The result (i.e. 0.92) would then be multiplied by adult anteroposterior, lateral, and ventral coordinates to calculate new adolescent coordinates. Adolescent coordinates exhibited slight individual variation. All rats were allowed 3–5 days recovery time following surgery before the start of any experimentation. Microdialysis probes (1 mm membrane length; BASinc) were inserted ~1 hr before the first sample collection. Tissue was continuously perfused at 1 µL/min throughout the duration of the experiment with artificial cerebrospinal fluid aCSF (pH 7.4) containing (in mM): NaCl (148), KCl (2.7), CaCl2 (1.2), MgCl2 (0.85). Collections occurred 3 hr into the dark cycle across 6 hr with samples collected every 20 min (i.e. 3 samples per hour). During the first 3 hr, 9 samples were collected as baseline samples. Following baseline collections, α-Ctx (1.6 µL) was then infused at 0.2 µL/min over 8 min. During the 3 hr post α-Ctx, nine additional samples were collected starting 10 min following the start of α-Ctx infusion in 20 min intervals. Upon completion of microdialysis sampling, rats were euthanized and brain extracted. Slices containing the NAc were then used to confirm proper placement of microdialysis probe by recording live tissue probe tracts in all rats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>General GABA ELISA</title><p>General GABA ELISA kit (ABClonal, Woburn, MA) was used to measure extracellular GABA concentration from all sampled microdialysates. All measurements were taken according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ABClonal, cat. #RK09124).

All sample wells were spiked with 0.0003 µg/30 µL GABA while GABA wells were spiked with 0.0005 µg/ 50 µL GABA to make 10 ng/mL samples to overcome the kit threshold.

Thus, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The findings reported in this manuscript suggest that dopamine release is regulated by a unique multisynaptic mechanism that is evident during adolescence, but not in adult male rats. The data presented suggests that this mechanism involves acetycholine acting at α-6-containing nicotinic acetycholine receptors, which mediate inhibition of dopamine via GABA release. The Reviewers agree that the results are suggestive of a novel synaptic mechanism that could potentially serve as a biomarker for substance abuse vulnerability. However, there are a number of concerns raised, as indicated below. Primary concerns surround the use of a single approach to identify the proposed mechanism, inconsistencies in data presentation and analyses, and the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. I agree that the ex vivo method provides strong advantages to a mechanistic pharmacological study as the one presented here. However, it is also complicated by the use of electrical stimulation to evoke dopamine release. For example, acetylcholine and GABA will be released along with dopamine. Please specifically address this in the discussion. Related to this, please provide discussion to bridge the ex vivo measurements to in vivo measurements from the literature: do the findings reported here predict the in vivo observations, or are they at least consistent?</p><p>– Evoked dopamine in anesthetized rats: Cocaine increases stimulated dopamine release more in periadolescent than adult rats.

PMID: 18508233.</p><p>– Spontaneous dopamine in awake rats: Fast dopamine release events in the nucleus accumbens of early adolescent rats. Robinson DL, Zitzman DL, Smith KJ, Spear LP. Neuroscience. 2011 Mar 10;176:296-307. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.12.016. Epub 2010 Dec 20. PMID: 21182904</p><p>2. Walker and Kuhn (2008) also reported reduced evoked dopamine release in male adolescent rats compared to adults in the caudate and nucleus accumbens. Analysis of the evoked signal revealed both reduced dopamine release per impulse as well as slower Vmax; in addition, Km in the caudate was lower in adolescent rats compared to adults, indicating higher affinity of the dopamine transporter for dopamine. If the authors can estimate Km from the present data? If so, adding this information will help to fill out the picture of age-related differences in dopamine regulation.</p><p>3. The authors' previous study reported marked sex differences in the comparison of adolescent and adult evoked dopamine release. Namely, while evoked, ex vivo dopamine release was lower in adolescent males than adult males, the opposite was observed in females. Only males were tested in the present study. Thus, the nACh/GABA mechanisms described here is not likely to generalize to females. This topic should be discussed.</p><p>4. Please provide the details on the voltage sweeps and the sampling frequency for the FSCV recordings. Most studies using FSCV perform voltage sweeps every 0.1s. This is important to state because it is not clear that this approach has the temporal resolution to examine PPR with the ISIs used in this study (0.01-0.2s). This issue is present in Figure 1E and Figure 4B.</p><p>5. Representative color plots and/or traces of FSCV recordings need to be included.</p><p>6. The normalization to the single pulse pre-drug dopamine response is appropriate for experiments involving only one pharmacological manipulation (e.g. Figure 2B). However, this pre-drug normalization is a problematic with experiments involving sequential pharmacological manipulations. For example, Figure 2D examines the effect of DHBE when a-Ctx is already on board. The data in this figure are normalized to the pre-drug dopamine response. Since the goal is to examine the effect of DHBE, a more appropriate normalization should be to the single pulse dopamine response with a-Ctx on board.</p><p>7. It is not clear why some of the data are normalized to the single pulse dopamine response (Figures2-3) and some of the data are presented as a % relative to a baseline treatment for data point (Figure 4). In general, I find the analysis in Figure 4 to be a bit more confusing because it is obscuring the increase in dopamine release with higher frequency stimulations.</p><p>8. Relating to the previous point, it appears that the decrease in DA release in adults following a-Ctx treatment is not blocked by GABA receptor antagonists (Figure 4E). However, this potentially interesting finding is not statistically examined since the data is presented as a % relative to the pre-Ctx condition.</p><p>9. Does GABA application differentially decrease dopamine release between adolescents and adults? This cannot be determined with how the data is presented in Figure 4F. This is an important point to address based on the model that is proposed. The observed results in juveniles could be explained by (i) greater expression of a6 receptors on GABA interneurons during adolescence or (ii) a greater sensitivity of dopamine neurons to GABA inhibition during adolescence (with no age-related changes in a6 receptor expression).</p><p>10. It seems that Figure 4A would be better placed in Figure 2 along with the representative examples (see comment #2). The same goes for Figure 4B, though I have my concerns if this analysis is appropriate (see comment #1).</p><p>11. Overlaying up to 8 traces with very subtle differences in color/symbol shape/line pattern makes it very challenging to visualize the data.</p><p>12. The schematics are a source of confusion. For example, there is no possible mechanism provided in Figure 2A by which a nicotinic receptor antagonist could increase dopamine release, as is shown in Figure 2C. I would suggest including a summary schematic at the end of the manuscript that illustrates the proposed differences between juveniles and adults.</p><p>13. My main concern is that the primary conclusion – i.e. that in early adolescence dopamine release is modulated by alpha6 nAChRs on GABA neurons in nucleus accumbens and that this mechanism does not exist in adulthood – is demonstrated through a single experimental paradigm. The data seem solid but it would give more confidence if this had been confirmed through an additional technique or in a less artificial situation. For example, biochemical, anatomical, or in vivo data to support their model or even data showing the consequences of this synaptic mechanism for the behavioral alterations associated with adolescence. Whether this level of additional depth is essential for publication though is a matter for discussion with the editor.</p><p>14. I have some concerns with the numbers of subjects used, the unit of statistic, and the possible outlier removal. For Figure 1 there are different numbers in each graph – if an outlier is removed from one measurement, I would expect them to be removed from the study or else it becomes difficult to interpret different measurements.</p><p>15. The use of a single concentration of the drugs leaves open the possibility that there is a shift in the concentration response curve rather than a qualitative difference in the underlying circuitry.</p><p>16. There are a number of places where the data are normalized to a value but the authors could be clearer about how this value might have been changed by the manipulation. For example, data in Figure 2B-D are normalized to 1 pulse but I found it a little difficult to ascertain how the 1 pulse data were affected by the manipulation. This is partly due to lack of description in the text and also due to the plotting style where it is difficult to distinguish symbols.</p><p>17. The use of paired-pulse ratio should be described more fully. In voltammetry, the method of calculating PPR and the conclusions that can be drawn this paradigm differ from traditional PPR as used in patch-clamp electrophysiology. It would be good if the authors are more explicit with this. In addition, they could discuss how the lack of age-dependent change in PPR (caused by α-Ctx) is not in conflict with the effects of a-Ctx using the other stimulation parameters.</p><p>18. More information should be stated on whether rats were bred in-house or ordered in. And if ordered in, how long was given for habituation. Potential stress of travel could be a factor.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A unique multi-synaptic mechanism involving acetylcholine and GABA regulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens through early adolescence&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by me as both Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, in collaboration with peer reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors are encouraged to address all of the specific points raised by the reviewers, but I wish to highlight several issues that were the focus of our discussions.</p><p>1) Consideration of the role of sex as a biological variable is essential, and it is appreciated that the manuscript refers to the prior work in the Introduction.

I agree that the ex vivo method provides strong advantages to a mechanistic pharmacological study as the one presented here. However, it is also complicated by the use of electrical stimulation to evoke dopamine release. For example, acetylcholine and GABA will be released along with dopamine.

We now discuss the differences/similaries between in vivo and ex vivo voltammetry studies and attempt to bridge our study with adolescent in vivo studies in introduction and discussion. (including citations of Walker and Kuhn, 2008 and Robinson et al., 2011)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Walker and Kuhn (2008) also reported reduced evoked dopamine release in male adolescent rats compared to adults in the caudate and nucleus accumbens. Analysis of the evoked signal revealed both reduced dopamine release per impulse as well as slower Vmax; in addition, Km in the caudate was lower in adolescent rats compared to adults, indicating higher affinity of the dopamine transporter for dopamine. If the authors can estimate Km from the present data? If so, adding this information will help to fill out the picture of age-related differences in dopamine regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. After much reanalysis of data, we elected not to include variability in Km data for this paper because we are not fully confident that we can model Km in our ex vivo preparation. There have been reports of Km in prior publications by Ferris that have ranged from 160 nM to 200 nM and is consistent with reports from seminal papers, but in those studies the slices and testing conditions were painstakingly optimized for detection of Km at the bottom portion of the descending limb of dopamine traces. While we used good signals that can model release and Vmax for the current study, we really did not optimize for Km assessment. We included this point in the discussion about how we did not optimize for Km but that Walker and Kuhn have shown this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors' previous study reported marked sex differences in the comparison of adolescent and adult evoked dopamine release. Namely, while evoked, ex vivo dopamine release was lower in adolescent males than adult males, the opposite was observed in females. Only males were tested in the present study. Thus, the nACh/GABA mechanisms described here is not likely to generalize to females. This topic should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss sex differences in the introduction to address this limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please provide the details on the voltage sweeps and the sampling frequency for the FSCV recordings. Most studies using FSCV perform voltage sweeps every 0.1s. This is important to state because it is not clear that this approach has the temporal resolution to examine PPR with the ISIs used in this study (0.01-0.2s). This issue is present in Figure 1E and Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>We included more information on the voltage sweeps and sampling frequency in the methodology. Note that we do sample every 0.1s so the reviewer is correct that we are not able to resolve DA magnitude for both pulses in the two-pulse condition. Our paired pulse follows current approaches in the literature from Alvarez and Cragg groups among others. It is the ratio of the single peak height (not separable) of the 2 pulses (summed), minus the 1 pulse peak height, over the peak height that is evoked from 1 pulse (i.e., P2-P1/P1). This is consistent with the literature that uses this approach from other laboratories, and has been explored mechanistically by other labs as well (Condon et a., 2019; Cragg et al., 2003). We now clarify this in the methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Representative color plots and/or traces of FSCV recordings need to be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative traces of FSCV recordings have been added to each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The normalization to the single pulse pre-drug dopamine response is appropriate for experiments involving only one pharmacological manipulation (e.g. Figure 2B). However, this pre-drug normalization is a problematic with experiments involving sequential pharmacological manipulations. For example, Figure 2D examines the effect of DHBE when a-Ctx is already on board. The data in this figure are normalized to the pre-drug dopamine response. Since the goal is to examine the effect of DHBE, a more appropriate normalization should be to the single pulse dopamine response with a-Ctx on board.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now revised in the manuscript according to the reviewer’s comment. We were not clear in the first draft on the analysis and our approach which we think lead to confusion. We retained the original graph with all drugs relative to no drug baseline in Figure 2D and now include the reviewer’s suggestion of DHBE (as drug #2) relative to conotoxin (as drug #1) in Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is not clear why some of the data are normalized to the single pulse dopamine response (Figures2-3) and some of the data are presented as a % relative to a baseline treatment for data point (Figure 4). In general, I find the analysis in Figure 4 to be a bit more confusing because it is obscuring the increase in dopamine release with higher frequency stimulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not clear in the first version of the manuscript as to what the percent baseline data were. Figures 2 and 4 now show a percent of baseline that is relative to the drug free condition for all drugs, as well as drug #2 in relation to drug #1 given comments from other reviewers about these same data. (see #6 response above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Relating to the previous point, it appears that the decrease in DA release in adults following a-Ctx treatment is not blocked by GABA receptor antagonists (Figure 4E). However, this potentially interesting finding is not statistically examined since the data is presented as a % relative to the pre-Ctx condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to points 6 and 7 on normalization, we are hoping that we have clarified our miscommunication, and we have added data. DA release in adult rats following a-ctx is not altered by GABA receptor antagonists. We know that α-ctx modulates DA release independent of GABA release via direct interactions with DA terminals, not only this result, but many prior studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Does GABA application differentially decrease dopamine release between adolescents and adults? This cannot be determined with how the data is presented in Figure 4F. This is an important point to address based on the model that is proposed. The observed results in juveniles could be explained by (i) greater expression of a6 receptors on GABA interneurons during adolescence or (ii) a greater sensitivity of dopamine neurons to GABA inhibition during adolescence (with no age-related changes in a6 receptor expression).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. GABA application to slices does interact with age to differentially affect dopamine release, which is now shown in Figure 4, included in results, and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. It seems that Figure 4A would be better placed in Figure 2 along with the representative examples (see comment #2). The same goes for Figure 4B, though I have my concerns if this analysis is appropriate (see comment #1).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea. We rearranged figure 2 to include old Figure 4A and 4B plus relevant traces (see #11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Overlaying up to 8 traces with very subtle differences in color/symbol shape/line pattern makes it very challenging to visualize the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected. Traces have been separated onto new graphs where appropriate. We have also adjusted the y-axes to ensure the full range of data effects are able to be easily visualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The schematics are a source of confusion. For example, there is no possible mechanism provided in Figure 2A by which a nicotinic receptor antagonist could increase dopamine release, as is shown in Figure 2C. I would suggest including a summary schematic at the end of the manuscript that illustrates the proposed differences between juveniles and adults.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you bringing this to our attention. We elected to include an additional schematic at the end of the manuscript to illustrate the proposed age-related differences (see Figure 5). Our schematic describes the differential GABAmediated circuits in adults and adolescents by presenting a side-by-side comparison of both baseline and post α-Ctx proposed mechanisms in the NAc core.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. My main concern is that the primary conclusion – i.e. that in early adolescence dopamine release is modulated by alpha6 nAChRs on GABA neurons in nucleus accumbens and that this mechanism does not exist in adulthood – is demonstrated through a single experimental paradigm. The data seem solid but it would give more confidence if this had been confirmed through an additional technique or in a less artificial situation. For example, biochemical, anatomical, or in vivo data to support their model or even data showing the consequences of this synaptic mechanism for the behavioral alterations associated with adolescence. Whether this level of additional depth is essential for publication though is a matter for discussion with the editor.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include in vivo measurements of GABA both pre- and post-α-ctx infusion using microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens in awake, freely-moving rats. The results of these data are presented in Figure 4H as well as in the proposed mechanism for Figure 5. Our in vivo studies provide parallel support to our ex vivo studies. Additional thoughts on these results have also been highlighted in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. I have some concerns with the numbers of subjects used, the unit of statistic, and the possible outlier removal. For Figure 1 there are different numbers in each graph – if an outlier is removed from one measurement, I would expect them to be removed from the study or else it becomes difficult to interpret different measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on this point. We were unclear about some of the methodology in the original submission, but have since clarified the unit of statistic as well as the number of subjects used in each study throughout the paper (see minor comment #1, #6). Note that only 3 outliers were removed, and that different numbers will be used across drugs / figures because we have multiple rigs that can run many slices / drugs from the same animal. However, sometimes there are not enough rigs or slices to run all drugs, so another animal will be run to compensate and over time, different numbers are run depending on prioritization of drug or to achieve sufficient power for varying effect sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The use of a single concentration of the drugs leaves open the possibility that there is a shift in the concentration response curve rather than a qualitative difference in the underlying circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We admit to being agnostic in this broad screening of compounds to shifts in potency vs efficacy, and now acknowledge directly in the manuscript this limitation, namely that we cannot assess these differences without the concentration response curve. However, we do believe that shifts in either (or both) potency and efficacy would be a result of differences in the biology of the circuit. For example, we know that receptor number might influence potency and therefore shift the concentration of neurotransmitter needed to activate a postsynaptic cell. Admittedly, we can’t test whether such things can be overcome (efficacy) with enough neurotransmitter. Future studies, paired with histochemical assessment of receptor density, for example, will be needed. This is all now addressed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. There are a number of places where the data are normalized to a value but the authors could be clearer about how this value might have been changed by the manipulation. For example, data in Figure 2B-D are normalized to 1 pulse but I found it a little difficult to ascertain how the 1 pulse data were affected by the manipulation. This is partly due to lack of description in the text and also due to the plotting style where it is difficult to distinguish symbols.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now made clearer in the revised version. What each data is normalized to is now made more clear. Note that normalizing to drug free conditions is used in other literature and our goal was to make similar to similar work (e.g., Rice and Cragg, 2004, <italic>Nature Neuroscience)</italic> similar to how other classic data are presents, like microdialysis data, whereby each time-point (in this case frequency), is normalized to the drug free condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The use of paired-pulse ratio should be described more fully. In voltammetry, the method of calculating PPR and the conclusions that can be drawn this paradigm differ from traditional PPR as used in patch-clamp electrophysiology. It would be good if the authors are more explicit with this. In addition, they could discuss how the lack of age-dependent change in PPR (caused by α-Ctx) is not in conflict with the effects of a-Ctx using the other stimulation parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have clarified our definition of PPR in the methodology (see #4). As per reviewer request, we have also highlighted this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. More information should be stated on whether rats were bred in-house or ordered in. And if ordered in, how long was given for habituation. Potential stress of travel could be a factor.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been clarified in the methodology. Rats were ordered from a vendor and allowed one full week in their home cage / chamber for habituation prior to experiments. This was the case for both adolescent and adult rats.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved significantly but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors are encouraged to address all of the specific points raised by the reviewers, but I wish to highlight several issues that were the focus of our discussions.</p><p>1) Consideration of the role of sex as a biological variable is essential, and it is appreciated that the manuscript refers to the prior work in the Introduction.

We now include additional discussion (third from last paragraph, blue font) on how the GABA antagonists could be blocking the effect of α-conotoxin in adolescent animals while having no effect on their own. First, a new paper was just published showing that GABA does in fact provide inhibitory tone on dopamine release and, when blocked with GABA antagonists, dopamine can be disinhibited in that paper (Patel et al., 2024). That study, however, used optogenetics to selectively activate dopamine varicosities, whereas our study uses electrical stimulation.

We agree on this point.

My final point relates to presentation of the microdialysis data that I feel still needs revision due to discrepancies between the Results, Discussion and the Figure Caption.</p><p>The Results provide statistics showing the interaction between Age x Drug allowing the conclusion that α-Ctx acts differently at different ages. However, no post hoc values are provided here though, which precludes specific statements regarding increases or decreases within or between different groups. The Discussion states various differences (higher GABA tone in adolescents, drug effect to decrease in adolescents and increase in adults), which should be backed up by these group comparisons. The figure caption seems in conflict with these sections as it states &quot;Interestingly, infusing α-Ctx into the NAc did not differentially affect adult or adolescent GABA levels, but revealed that adolescents have higher GABA tone as compared to adult.&quot; The figure itself has a star to indicate significance but it is unclear where this comes from or which group the comparison is supposed to apply to.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We revised the Results, Figure Caption, and Discussion to be more precise with our language regarding the interaction and include the Sidak post hoc comparison to indicate that adolescent baseline GABA is significantly different than adult baseline GABA. We also indicate in the figure caption that the asterisk is indicative of the Sidak posthoc test. Note that a few sentences of more elaborate speculation was removed in these areas to be more precise with noting the interaction and the baseline posthoc effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
