This study aimed to generate a novel epigenetic clock in rats—a model with unique physical, physiological, and biochemical advantages—by incorporating behavioral data, unsupervised machine learning, and network analysis to identify epigenetic signals that not only track with age, but also relates to phenotypic aging. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data was used to train an epigenetic age (DNAmAge) measure in Fischer 344 CDF (F344) rats. This measure correlated with age at (r = 0.93) in an independent sample, and related to physical functioning (p=5.9e-3), after adjusting for age and cell counts. DNAmAge was also found to correlate with age in male C57BL/6 mice (r = 0.79), and was decreased in response to caloric restriction.

Epigenetic clocks are traditionally measured by combining information on DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at hundreds of cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) to produce age predictions. These estimates have been shown to strongly correlate with observed age (often r &gt; 0.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). More importantly, the divergence in the predicted age relative to the observed age has been shown to reflect differential mortality and/or disease risk/prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Levine et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Levine et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Levine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambatipudi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Horvath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Horvath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu, 2019</xref>)—suggesting it captures differences in biological rather than chronological aging. Furthermore, in mice, evidence is beginning to emerge to show that genetic or behavioral interventions known to influence aging produce differences in the epigenetic age of birth cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sziraki et al., 2018</xref>)—leading to the growing enthusiasm surrounding the application of epigenetic clocks as powerful biomarkers in aging research.</p><p>The quest to identify measures that can assess biological age is currently a major goal in Geroscience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Justice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sierra, 2016</xref>). With the growing list of potential therapeutics to target aging, there is an immediate need to establish gold-standard measures for efficacy testing. Accurate biomarkers of aging will also enable better prognostic evaluation; they may inform treatment, study inclusion, and personal decisions; and perhaps most importantly, they will help uncover the underlying mechanisms driving biological aging. However, in order for a biomarker to be valuable in these endeavors, we must distinguish between changes that simply track with chronological time from those that relate to biological function (both entropic damage and/or compensatory mechanisms).</p><p>While up to this point, the vast majority of epigenetic clock studies have been conducted using human cohorts, our ability to elucidate the underlying biology of epigenetic aging will require mechanistic studies using mammalian animal models. Epigenetic clocks based on blood and multiple tissues have been developed for mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stubbs et al., 2017</xref>); however, because of their small size, drawing sufficient blood volumes for epigenetic analysis require terminal bleeds. Thus, the use of mice presents a problem when it comes to tracking epigenetic aging longitudinally or using it as a prognostic indicator. Conversely, rats share many of the same advantages as mice, yet also are approximately 10 times larger in mass, enabling the safe collection of substantially more blood at a given point in time without undue harm to the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016</xref>). The ability to safely collect a larger quantity of blood will allow researchers to track animals longitudinally and relate molecular changes to changes in phenotypic characteristics—including in vivo brain imaging or individual differences in age-related cognitive decline, for which rats may be better models than mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016</xref>). Allowing for multiple assays from the same samples will enable researchers to draw links between various hallmarks of aging.</p><p>The ability to link epigenetics to other phenotypic data is of critical importance in developing biomarkers of aging. Traditionally, correlations with chronological age have been used to assess validity of aging biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stubbs et al., 2017</xref>). However, evidence is mounting that this may not be the best approach. Indeed, the epigenetic clocks that appear most informative for predicting future health and wellness are not necessarily the strongest age predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levine et al., 2018</xref>). This is due to the fact that a number of molecular and physiological traits change over the lifespan, but the degree of change does not necessarily reflect their importance in the biological aging processes manifesting as death and disease. Therefore, the only way to distinguish changes that track chronological time versus those that track biological aging is to validate potential biomarkers using variables other than age.</p><p>The aim of this study was to measure DNAm using blood samples from a large, multi-age cohort of Fischer 344 CDF (F344) rats (n = 134) and associate DNAm patterns with chronological age along with behavioral and cellular changes. In doing so, we identified key epigenetic age changes and developed a novel rat epigenetic clock, which we show tracks age and functioning in rats. We also demonstrate that this clock can be used to track aging in mice and is responsive to interventions such as caloric restriction and cellular reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Age differences in DNAm</title><p>Male F344 rats were acquired from the NIA Aged Rodent Colony. The samples were evenly distributed over a large age range, spanning 1 to 27 months, with six rats in each age group (n = 162). Within three weeks of arrival, rats were weighed, blood was drawn for FACS and methylation sequencing, and behavioral testing was performed. Our analytic sample included 134 rats. Excluded samples represent animals that died or were euthanized prior to blood draw, those that did not pass quality control for bisulfite sequencing, and/or those without complete FACS, rotarod, or open field data.</p><p>Whole blood from retro-orbital sampling was used to perform reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and imputation was conducted via a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) sliding window, yielding information on DNAm levels at 5,505,909 cytosines across the genome for all animals. To train an age predictor, samples were split into training (n = 102) and test sets (n = 32) based on age to ensure equal age distributions. For instance, rats ages 2 m, 6 m, 10 m, 14 m, 18 m, 22 m, and 26 m were selected for the test set (n = 32), while all others were included in the training set (1 m, 3 m, 4 m, 5 m, 7 m, 8 m, 11 m, 12 m, 13 m, 15 m, 16 m, 17 m, 19 m, 20 m, 21 m, 23 m, 24 m, 25 m, 27 m). By applying elastic net regression to the training set, we built an age predictor that selected 68 of the 5.5 million sites. The age predictor based on the 68 CpGs, which we call DNAmAge, exhibited a correlation of r = 0.90 with observed age in the validation sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As with many of the other human and rodent clocks, the relationship between DNAmAge and age exhibits nonlinear properties, suggesting a sigmoidal relationship between the two variables.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis (PCA)-based construction of DNAmAge in rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Supervised approach: A sample of male F344 rats, ages 1 to 27 months, were split into training (n = 102) and test sets (n = 32).

To test this, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using the training sample to identify orthogonal signals and test for associations with age. Results suggest that PC1 only captures 4.7% of the variance in our data, and that jointly, the first 10 PCs capture 28% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, PC1 was strongly correlated with age (r = 0.93) in our independent test sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, when we applied these PCs (in contrast to CpGs) to train an age predictor, based on 10-fold cross-validation in the training sample, our model suggested that age prediction was not improved by including PCs beyond PC1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because eigenvalues for PC1 are in standardized units, we converted these to units of months to generate an interpretable estimate of DNAmAge. This was done using the beta coefficient and intercept values from a linear regression of chronological age regressed on PC1. To convert to units of months, PC1 eigenvalues were multiplied by the beta coefficient (0.405) and summed with the intercept value (13.966). This measure of DNAmAge is perfectly correlated (r = 1) with the original PC1 eigenvalues, thus, this rescaling does not alter our results. Rescaling using the coefficient 0.405 and constant 13.966 was applied or all subsequent validation in independent test samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DNAm associations with FACS and phenotypic variables</title><p>To explore the association between DNAm and aging-related functional variables, we tested the chronological age-adjusted associations between the DNAmAge measures and performance in rotarod and open-field behavioral tests of locomotor function. Data was available for eight summarized open-field test variables and two rotarod variables (max time and mean time). Additionally, we also tested for confounding variables heterogeneity in blood cell types using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) comprising information on 39 variables related to white blood cell composition. As with the DNAm data, given the redundancy in these measures, we ran two PCAs using the training sample—one to reduce the dimensionality of the FACS data and one to reduce dimensionality of the behavioral phenotype data (open field and rotarod). When examining the age correlations of the first three PCs, we found that PC1 for both types of variables are strongly associated with age in the validation sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). PC1 based on FACS data shows a correlation of r = 0.91 with age, and the PC1 based on phenotype data (open field and rotarod) correlates with age at r = 0.63. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S1, PC1 for phenotype data is most strongly related to the open-field variables, except for time spent in the center zone (an anxiety-sensitive measure) and duration of stereotypic movements, including grooming and sniffing. When examining association between age and individual phenotypic variables or FACS variables, we observed the same strong trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Using multivariate linear regression models, we tested whether age-adjusted DNAmAge was associated with phenotypic variables and/or confounded by FACS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In model 1, which included DNAmAge regressed on chronological age alone, as expected we observed that DNAmAge is strongly related to chronological age—similar to the correlation results. Results for Model 2, which included the addition of the phenotypic PC1 (standardized to have s.d. = 1), showed a significant association between DNAmAge and the physical functioning after controlling for age in the model. This suggests that among rats of the same chronological age, every one standard deviation in worsening locomotor function is associated with a 0.43 month increase in DNAmAge. Moreover, the addition of the phenotypic variable somewhat attenuated the chronological age effect, suggesting that part of the age-associated increase in DNAmAge is explained by declines in physical functioning (16%). In Model 3, we included PC1 from the FACS data (standardized to have s.d. = 1) as an additional covariate. In doing so, we observed further attenuation of the age association and a small attenuation of the phenotypic association, suggesting that cell composition may account for a small proportion of the associations between DNAmAge and either age and/or physical functioning. Nevertheless, the associations with phenotypic PC1 remained significant, suggesting that among animals of the same chronological age, age-related functional decline is related to epigenetic aging independent of cell composition. This was further supported by an expanded model in which the association between phenotypic PC1 and DNAmAge remains (β = 1.7, p=6.3e-3), even after adjustment for the first 10 PCs from the FACS PCA (results not shown).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Pheno PC1 and FACS PC1 are standardized variables, such that they have a standard deviation of 1.</title><p>Given that the DNAmAge variable is in units of (months), the beta coefficients represent the increase in DNAmAge (in units of months) associated with every 1 s.d. increase in either PC1 FACS or PC1 Pheno.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="3" valign="top">Beta coefficient (P-value)</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Model 1</th><th valign="top">Model 2</th><th valign="top">Model 3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">DNAmAge (PC1)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Age</td><td valign="top">0.75 (6.0e-15)</td><td valign="top">0.63 (1.27e-11)</td><td valign="top">0.42 (4.4e-4)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pheno PC1</td><td valign="top">--</td><td valign="top">1.46 (3.4e-3)</td><td valign="top">1.29 (5.9e-3)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FACS PC1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">--</td><td valign="top">1.91 (2.7e-2)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Validation in C57BL/6 mice</title><p>To add additional out-of-sample validation, we used publicly available RRBS data from mouse models.

Given this limitation, we re-calculated PC1 using only CpGs in common between the two species. When re-evaluating the performance in the rat data, the new DNAmAge measure from the overlapped CpGs was able to equivalently recapture the age signal, exhibiting a correlation of r=0.92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in the test data from rats. This is despite the fact that we started with a much smaller number of parameters (~3,600 compared to 5.5 million).

Interestingly, the mouse data showed high intercept and lower slope for DNAmAge as a function of age, suggesting that this DNAmAge measure is initially over-estimated in mouse, but that the rate of increase with age is slower than for rats.

Using an age-adjusted model, we found that DNAmAge was decreased in CR versus ad libitum fed animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S3), such that CR was associated with an average decrease of 1.20 months in DNAmAge (s.e.=0.31, p=1.6e-4). Although mice were subjected to CR starting at 14 weeks, the time they remained on the diet varied from about 6.5-23 months, at which point DNAm was assessed. Therefore, we tested whether prolonged CR amplified the deceleration of DNAmAge using a model with an interaction between age and CR. Results showed that DNAmAge was significantly associated with the interaction between chronological age and CR (β=-0.12, p=9.1e-3). This suggests a negative correlation between CR duration and DNAmAge. To test this directly, we calculated the linear model for DNAmAge regressed on age, using only control animals.

Thus, in order to deconstruct this aging signal into distinct components from which we can better study mechanisms, we clustered CpGs based on co-methylation patterns across samples. For instance, using the 3,755 CpGs shared across the rat and mouse RRBS data, we performed weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), with the goal of identifying co-methylation modules. Co-methylation modules represent clusters of tightly related CpGs, whose DNAm values are highly correlated across samples in both the rat and the mouse data. Using a signed network with a power of 1, we identified four co-methylation modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>)—blue (64 CpGs), pink (47 CpGs), purple (44 CpGs), and green (38 CpGs). The majority of CpGs (n=3,432) were not assigned to a module (denoted as the grey module). Next, we tested whether certain modules contributed more to the DNAmAge measure. To do this, we compared the weights of CpGs as a function of which module they were assigned to. We found that the green, purple, and blue modules contained CpGs with higher loadings compared to the grey module. Interestingly, the green module contained CpGs with both the highest positive and lowest negative loadings (CpGs that were strongly hypermethylated and hypomethylated with age, respectively), whereas the purple and blue modules were exclusively made up of CpGs that positively loaded on DNAmAge (CpGs that trended towards hypermethylation with age).

While it shares many of the same experimental advantages with its close relative, the mouse, the rat represents an exciting rodent model for studying mammalian aging. Its larger size better enables longitudinal tracking and simultaneous assessment of multiple assays and it is also better suited to in vivo brain scanning and performing assessments to study heterogeneity in cognitive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016</xref>). In moving forward, our ability to track how molecular features change over time in accordance with functional phenotypes will be critical for disentangling the causal pathways through which aging hallmarks directly contribute to morbidity and mortality. It will also better enable assessments of geroprotective therapeutics given that samples can be taken pre- and post-treatment without causing undue harm to the animal.</p><p>Our novel epigenetic clock was shown to strongly correlate with chronological age and relate to physical performance, independent of cell composition and/or chronological age. Furthermore, we show that it is also applicable to mice. For instance, we estimated our epigenetic clock in whole blood samples from C57BL/6 and found that it correlates with age at r=0.79. Moreover, we found that it is decreased in animals that have undergone CR. This is consistent with previous studies showing the CR prevent DNA methylation drift and epigenetic age in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>). We further observed, that the longer the animals remained on a CR diet, the lower their DNAmAge was relative to their chronological age, suggesting that the longer CR is maintained, the greater the decrease in epigenetic age.</p><p>Nevertheless, there were also interesting observations that differentiated the performance of our DNAmAge measure in mice versus rats. Most notably, the functional form of DNAmAge regressed on age. While DNAmAge exhibits a sigmoidal fit with age in rats, this is more dramatic in the mouse data. Furthermore, the measure appears compressed at both younger and older ages, such that the range in mouse chronological age is 0.66-34.4 months (mean=17.0, sd=10.8), yet the range in DNAmAge is 11.1-28.8 months (mean=16.9, sd=2.8). The non-linear fit of DNAmAge as a function of age has been repeatedly reported in both human and rodent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>). One possibility for this observation is that the changes in DNAm reflect other non-linear cellular changes, such as cellular division or mutation accumulation, which increase exponentially in early life and then decelerate upon maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rozhok and DeGregori, 2016</xref>). Relatedly, the proportion of senescent and/or precancerous cells may accumulate in a non-linear manner with age, such that these changes are slow in early life and then accelerate toward the end of the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zietkiewicz et al., 2009</xref>). The combination of these non-linear patterns in composite DNAmAge measure may therefore produce the sigmoidal age trajectories that have been observed. When considering the compression of DNAmAge across age in mice versus rats, one explanation is that some of the signals captured in epigenetic clocks are conserved, while other are not. If not all age-related DNAm changes in rats are conserved in mice this could offset, distend, or constrict the DNAmAge measure when applied to mice, even if the overall score still exhibits a significant age correlation.</p><p>To understand the 'types' of age-related DNAm changes that comprise the epigenetic clock, we performed weighted network analysis, which enabled us to identify co-methylation modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). These modules represent groups of CpGs with highly correlated DNAm levels across samples that are thought to capture specific epigenetic aging phenomena. Five modules were identified, four of which exhibited significant age correlations in both rats and mice. However, our ability to relate the modules to phenotypic data—rather than age alone—allowed us to identify the most promising aging signals. For instance, the two modules with the strongest age correlations (grey and purple) were not related to physical functioning in rats. Conversely, the green and blue modules, which had more conservative age correlations, were related to physical functioning in rats, independent of age. Interestingly, they exhibited deceleration in response to CR and were reset upon reprogramming. The majority of epigenetic clock studies evaluate measures on the basis of their age correlations. Here, we were able to start dissecting signals that are purely age-derived from those that are related to phenotypic changes and, therefore, are more relevant for biological aging. Had we relied exclusively on the robustness of the age predictions, it would have been impossible to pinpoint these two modules as being the most informative.</p><p>When examining their characteristics, we found that CpGs in the blue and green modules tended to lie in intergenic regions that were more than 10k bp downstream of TSS. Thus, these signatures are unlikely to represent promoter hypermethylation that directly repress gene transcription. Moreover, enrichment analyses showed that CpGs in these two modules tended to co-locate with H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and E2F1 TF, which suggests they are likely located in constitutive heterochromatin and/or facultative heterochromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saksouk et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, these patterns are reminiscent of an epigenetic landscape that has been associated with cellular senescence—another major hallmark of aging. In the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Narita et al., 2003</xref>, the authors described a distinct heterochromatic profile of senescent cells, which is characterized by heterochromatin protein recruitment (including H3K9me), and stable repression of E2F target genes, which have essential roles in cell cycle control. One possible explanation for our findings is that we are capturing the increasing proportion of senescent cells in blood that accompanies aging.</p><p>Relatedly, it has been proposed that changes in the distribution of heterochromatin may drive aging. Alterations and/or dysregulation in gene expression that is observed in aging, senescence, and/or cancer may stem from the concurrence of a global loss in constitutive heterochromatin that is accompanied by a redistribution of heterochromatin markers to facultative heterochromatin. This aging signature of heterochromatin redistribution may be influenced to some degree by age-related changes in DNAm stemming from downregulated activity of Dnmt1 (DNAm maintenance during replication) and upregulated activity of Dnmt3a/b (de novo DNAm).</p><p>Our results suggest that DNAm changes that may reflect redistribution of heterochromatin show strong age effects in blood from both mouse and rat, may be implicated in the age-associated decline in physical functioning, are slowed in response to CR, and are reset by reprogramming via induction of pluripotency.</p><p>Unlike previous DNAm aging signatures, our novel measure was built using an unsupervised approach, which was not directly aimed at chronological age prediction. Interestingly, while we considered the additive effects of multiple PCs in generating the DNAmAge measure, PC1 alone was sufficient to produce a highly age correlated variable in both the training and validation datasets. One explanation is that the F344 rats used in this study were highly homogenous—with the same sex, genetic background, and environment. Therefore, the main variance to be explained was age, which was subsequently captured in PC1. Because the rats may be aging in the same manner without differencing aging patterns/phenotypes, additional PCs were not picking-up age-related changes. That being said, we hypothesize that PCs beyond PC1 will add additional information when assessing aging in heterogenous populations—genetically diverse groups (e.g. humans), environmentally heterogeneous populations, diverse tissues, etc.</p><p>While the use of a homogenous group may have facilitated our ability to employ an unsupervised approach to develop an aging measure, it may also limit generalizability. For instance, all animals in our training and testing sets were male. Therefore, it is unclear whether female rats and/or mice would exhibit a different DNAm pattern with aging. This will be important to determine going forward given the consistent se differences in life expectancy across most species. Another potential limitation was the exclusive use of samples from blood for the majority of our analysis. As a next step, it will be crucial to determine if the signature we identified in our samples is universally exhibited across multiple diverse tissues. Interestingly, most human epigenetic clocks trained solely on DNAm in whole blood show strong age correlations in nearly all non-blood samples—suggesting that the major DNAm changes observed in blood are not blood-specific. As such, we hypothesize the same would be true for our new rodent epigenetic aging measure. In our analysis, we did have some samples that weren’t from blood (lung and kidney mouse fibroblasts). For both of these, we did observe an effect of reprogramming, further supporting the idea that the age measure we are capturing is not merely a reflection of changes in blood cells. However, the absolute values of the prediction were not closely aligned with the observed (or expected age) of the cells. Yet, this was also the case for the mouse samples from blood as well.</p><p>In moving forward, our ability to continue to unravel the complex signal linking DNAm changes to functional aging outcomes will require experiments in diverse model systems in which epigenetic changes can be both tracked longitudinally and related to other informative molecular and physiological hallmarks of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, male)</td><td valign="top">Fischer 344 CDF</td><td valign="top">NIA Aged Rodent Colony</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Fusion 4.0</td><td valign="top">Accuscan Instruments, Inc</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Rota-Rod Treadmill Control Software</td><td valign="top">MED-Associates, Inc</td><td valign="top">SOF-ENV-575</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">51106</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Genomic DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (gDCC)</td><td valign="top">Zymo</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/genomic-dna-clean-concentrator-gdcc/products/genomic-dna-clean-concentrator-10">D4010</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Qubit 1x dsDNA HS Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Q33231 <break/></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD3-FITC (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 201403</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.0 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD25-PE (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 202105</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.25 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD8a-PerCP (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 201712</td><td valign="top">FACS (5.0 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD11b/c-PE-Cy7 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 201818</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.25 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD4-APC-Cy7 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 201518</td><td valign="top">FACS (2.5 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat RT1B-AF647 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 562223</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.25 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD45RA-BV421 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 740043</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.25 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rat CD45-BV605 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 740371</td><td valign="top">FACS (1.25 ul/test)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Immunoprep Reagent System</td><td valign="top">Beckman Coulter</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 7546999</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">AMPure XP</td><td valign="top">Beckman Coulter</td><td valign="top">CAT#:A63880</td><td valign="top">RRBS (variable)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TruSeq Barcoded Adapters</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">CAT#:FC-121-1003</td><td valign="top">RRBS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CutAdapt</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">v2.4</td><td valign="top">RBBS adapter trimming</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BSSeeker2</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">v2.0.4</td><td valign="top">RRBS Alignment / Methylation Calling</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the NIA Animal Care and Use Committee.

DNA was eluted from columns in 200 µL of AE buffer, concentrated in 20 µL 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mM EDTA using Genomic DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-10 (Zymo), City, state, and quantified using a Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies, City, state). RRBS libraries were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orozco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, 100 ng of isolated DNA was digested with MspI restriction enzyme (NEB, Ipswich, MA), carried out end-repair/adenylation (NEB) and ligation with TruSeq barcoded adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA). DNA fragment length between 200 and 300bp were selected with SPRI magnetic beads (ABM, Richmond, BC, Canada), followed by bisulfite treatment (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and PCR amplification (Bioline, Taunton, MA). The libraries were sequenced by multiplexing 8 libraries per lane on the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer, with 100 bp single-end reads.</p><p>Sequencing reads were trimmed using CutAdapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove adapter sequences. Trimmed reads were mapped and methylation beta values called from the alignment file using BS-Seeker2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). We filtered aligned data to keep only cytosines with greater than 10x coverage in at least 80% of the samples. Methylation values for samples at sites with lower than 10x coverage were set to null. Missing values were imputed using a kNN sliding window; missing methylation values were assigned the average value of the five nearest neighbors by Euclidean distance within a 3Mb window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Elastic net penalized regression was used to generate a DNAm predictor of chronological age in rats based on RRBS data containing approximately 5.5 million cytosines. Prior to training, rats were grouped into training and testing sample based on age. For instance, rats ages 2m, 6m, 10m, 14m, 18m, 22m, and 26m were selected for the test set (n=32), while all others were included in the training set (n=104). Next PCA was run using the rats in the training set and elastic net was used to train a predictor of age based on PCs rather than individual CpGs. Given that the 10-fold cross-validation for the elastic net model showed PC1 alone produced the best predictor of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), PC1 was used as an estimate of DNAmAge. Thus, this measure contained the information from all CpGs (weighted according to contribution/loadings on PC1). The eigenvalues for PC1 were converted to units of months by regression chronological age on PC1 eigenvalues in the training sample. The PC-based DNAm was the product of eigenvalues and the beta coefficient from the linear regression, with the addition of the constant (intercept term) from the regression model. Both the PC based and the CpG based DNAmAge measures were estimated in the test samples by applying the equations from the training data. They were then evaluated based on biweight midcorrelations with age and multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the association between them and PC1 from a PCA of phenotypic variables (i.e. rotarod and open filed), after adjusting for age and cell composition (PC1-5 from PCA of FACS data).</p><p>LiftOver chain file from rn6 to mm10 genome assembly was downloaded from UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html">https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html</ext-link>) to provide the alignment from rat to mouse genome. rtracklayer liftOver function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/liftOver/">https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/liftOver/</ext-link>) was used to load the chain file and map the rat CpG to corresponding mouse genome coordinates. We then assessed CpG overlap between the mouse and rat data and found that 3625 of the 5.5 million CpGs were available in all datasets. As a result, we reran PCA in the training rat sample and fit a new DNAmAge measure based on the PCs from the 3625 CpGs. We also re-evaluated age correlations and associations with phenotypic variables in the rat test data. We then fit this DNAmAge predictor in the mouse data and used biweight midcorrelations to assess age associations, and multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the effect of CR on DNAmAge, relative to chronological age, as well as the effect of iPSC reprogramming in mouse lung and kidney fibroblasts.</p><p>To identify co-methylation modules, we applied consensus WGCNA to the mouse and rat RRBS data. For this analysis, we input data as a 'signed' topological overlap matrix, with a power=1. We also used deepSplit=1, minModuleSize=25, and minKMEtoStay=0.4. After grouping CpGs in modules, we generated module-specific DNAmAge measures based on PCA. We then tested for age association and phenotype associations in a manner consistent with models we have previously run.</p><p>Finally, LOLA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://databio.org/regiondb">http://databio.org/regiondb</ext-link>) and Cistrome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cistrome.org">http://cistrome.org</ext-link>) were used to assess enrichment for binding overlap of transcription factors, chromatic regulators, histone marks, variants, and genomic locations. For enrichment we used a background comprising all 3625 CpGs from the overlapped mouse and rat RRBS data. Enrichment was conducted independently for each of the four modules (excluding grey). Mouse (mm10) region sets were used for all enrichment analysis, given that Cistrome and LOLA only contain databases for human and mouse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Quia Claybourne for technical assistance with rat behavior tests.

This represents the first epigenetic clock for predicting rat aging, and thus a significant extension of what have been defined in mice and humans. In particular, rat models provide a number of advantages over mouse models especially with respect to the possible recurring measurement of blood profiles without harm to the animals. The authors show that the rat DNAmAge derived from the longitudinal sampling and a Principal Component-based modeling also correlates with phenotypic aging in mice and rejuvenation-related phenotypes conferred by an age intervention such as calorie restriction in mice as well as in fibroblast-derived iPSCs. This longitudinal study design, combined with the proposed model, is powerful with the demonstrated potential to evaluate the effects of aging interventions. Thus this study will certainly be of broad interest to the community of researchers studying the biology of aging. However, as detailed below, a number of concerns were also raised, relating in large part to insufficient clarity in the current version with respect to the authors' presentation of methods and data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Abstract:</p><p>Is the number behind physical functioning a p-value?</p><p>2) Subsection “Age differences in DNAm”</p><p>i) There are 27 age groups; they chose 32 animals for the test set, the exact age distribution should be indicated.</p><p>ii) They should mention the panel number in the text, not just Figure 1.</p><p>iii) The order of the panels is different from the appearance in the text.

As shown in Figure 1 that value is r=0.93 (thus r2=0.87). However, because this may be confusing to readers, we now report it as a correlation coefficient rather than variance explained. Example: “PC1 was strongly correlated with age (r=0.93) in our independent test sample (Figure 1C)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vii) They used regression to get the relationship between the PC1 and age.

We have added the following to the text.</p><p>“Because eigenvalues for PC1 are in standardized units, we converted these to units of months to generate an interpretable estimate of DNAmAge. This was done using the β coefficient and intercept values from a linear regression of chronological age regressed on PC1. To convert to units of months, PC1 eigenvalues were multiplied by the β coefficient (0.405) and summed with the intercept value (13.966). This measure of DNAmAge is perfectly correlated (r=1) with the original PC1 eigenvalues, thus, this rescaling does not alter our results. Rescaling using the coefficient 0.405 and constant 13.966 was applied or all subsequent validation in independent test samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>viii) In the figure legend they write: “multiplying the coefficient by PC1 and adding the constant in the test sample”. Do they mean they multiply the coefficients of the regression line by PC1? Which constant do they mean and how and what exactly do they add?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment #7.

We have added the following:</p><p>“Next PCA was run using the rats in the training set and elastic net was used to train a predictor of age based on PCs rather than individual CpGs. Given that the 10-fold cross-validation for the elastic net model showed PC1 alone produced the best predictor of age (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), PC1 was used as an estimate of DNAmAge. Thus, this measure contained the information from all CpGs (weighted according to contribution/loadings on PC1). (…) They were then evaluated based on biweight midcorrelations with age and multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the association between them and PC1 from a PCA of phenotypic variables (i.e. rotarod and open filed), after adjusting for age and cell composition (PC1-5 from PCA of FACS data).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) They mention that including more PCs into the predictor does not improve the prediction. Show a plot or table for this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1 has been added. It shows that based on 10-fold cross-validation, the elastic net model with the lowest MSE was that with only one variable (which happened to be PC1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) For the DNAm associations with FACS and Phenotypic variables:</p><p>a) Table S1 in Supplementary file 1: Explain what exactly the β coefficient is (the degree of change in the outcome variable, i.e. DNAmAge, for every unit of change in the predictor variable, i.e. Age, or Pheno PC1,.)</p></disp-quote><p>PCs for Phenotypic variables and FACS variables were standardized so that they have a standard deviation of 1. Given that the DNAmAge variable is in units of (months), the β coefficients represent the increase in DNAmAge (in units of months) associated with every 1 s.d. increase in either PC1 FACS or PC1 Pheno. This has been clarified as a footnote.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why is the β coefficient between phenotypic PC1 and DNAmAge increasing, when taking more PCs of the FACS PCA into account? Shouldn't it decrease? Clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not increasing. It is decreasing from 1.46 to 1.29, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> and as illustrated from our text.</p><p>“In Model 3, we included PC1 from the FACS data (standardized to have s.d.=1) as an additional covariate.

Overall, we find strong age associations for nearly all open field and rotarod variables—except for time in center and time in stereotypy (Figure S10). The same is true in the multivariate model, such that DNAmAge is also significantly associated with the phenotype variables after adjusting for age and FACS (Table S4). When looking at age associations with individual FACS variables, we find strong positive and negative correlations. For instance, age has a strong negative association with Memory CD8<sup>+</sup> Cytotoxic T cells and B cells; and a strong positive association with total and percent myeloid cells and activated T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Validation in C57BL/6 Mice:</p><p>i) A correlation line in Figure 2 (as they did before) should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Figure 2—figure supplement 1: Verify whether the y-axis label is correct. It might be the difference between the true and the DNAmAge, and not the DNAmAge itself.</p></disp-quote><p>The y-axis label “DNAmAge (Adj. Age)” is correct. This signifies the residual when regressing DNAmAge on chronological age. It represents how much epigenetically older/younger a mouse is compared to what is expected for its chronological age. We use this value rather than the δ (DNAmAge-Age) because the fit with age is non-linear, thus the δ produces biased results (with chronologically older samples being underestimated and chronologically younger samples being over estimated). This is something that has been consistantly reported in the literature (especially related to human epigenetic clocks), which is why the residual (often called age acceleration) has been used in most papers—as we are doing here.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have added text to better clarify what the y-axis represents in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Deconstruction of epigenetic aging measures:</p><p>i) It would be interesting to do the same analysis for the whole rat dataset, instead of the smaller rat-mice dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, because it is computationally intensive, WGCNA cannot be applied to extremely large datasets. Even with ~5k variables it is recommended that WGCNA be run in blocks, in which variables are split and then remerged. However, with 5.5 million variables WGCNA is not computationally feasible (See: https://peterlangfelder.com/2018/11/25/blockwise-network-analysis-of-large-data/). That being said, we hypothesize that similar results would come out of the data given that the methylome is extremely redundant and that we were able to capture almost the identical age signal even when restricting the data to overlapped CpGs. Given that this is an important point, we have made sure to acknowledge it in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Why did they choose a power of 1? Usually the smallest power is chosen so that the network is scale-free.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. WGCNA has traditionally been applied to RNA-seq or similar data, and in such instances the goal is to generate networks that fit scale-free topology. However, theoretically, we don’t feel this applies to the current application as there is no evidence that clustering of DNAm patterns should be scale-free similar to something like a protein-protein interaction network or gene expression pathway. Additionally, the way in which we are thinking of networks based on DNAm data is that they represent informational networks (akin to an operating system of the cell), whose emergent properties are exhibited in different cellular and/or physiological phenotypes. Additionally, it was recently reported that most networks, including informational ones are not scale-free, and that scale-free topology in complex systems is actually quite rare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08746-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08746-5</ext-link>). As such, we took a conservative approach in that we did not adjust adjacency measures to force a scale-free topology on the network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) In the text they write Figure S3, but mean S4.</p><p>iv) The order of the text and the panels in the figure is not the same.</p><p>v) Should the axis be scaled the same?</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi) The correlation coefficients for the pink module in the text and the plot are different.</p></disp-quote><p>They are the same (just rounded to the second decimal)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vii) They write “using a fully adjusted linear model ([…] Table S2)”, but Table S2 is not for the specific modules.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and have added the correct table (Table S3 in Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>viii) They reference the table again, maybe they forgot to include the right table? otherwise this is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed per response to comment #vii</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Genomic Features of Methylation Modules:</p><p>i) Include a figure for the overlaps.</p></disp-quote><p>Added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) What supplemental material?</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed—we meant to include these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion:</p><p>i) Paragraph one: Horvath's recent paper: Reversing age: dual species measurement of epigenetic age with a single clock (biorxiv 08.05.2020) reports an epigenetic aging clock in rats and should be cited here accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this.
