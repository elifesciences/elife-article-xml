genes within it is far from complete. The lack of a complete mapping of functions to genes hampers systematic understanding of the biology of the cell. The advent of high-throughput metabolomics offers a unique approach to uncovering gene function with an attractive combination of cost, robustness, and breadth of applicability. Here, we used flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry to dynamically profile the metabolome of 164 loss-of-function mutants in TOR and receptor or receptor-like genes under a time course of rapamycin treatment, generating a dataset with &gt;7000 metabolomics measurements. In order to provide a resource to the broader community, those data are made available for browsing through an interactive data visualization app hosted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch">https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch</ext-link>. We demonstrate that dynamic metabolite responses to rapamycin are more informative than steady-state responses when recovering known regulators of TOR signaling, as well as identifying new ones. Deletion of a subset of the novel genes causes phenotypes and proteome responses to rapamycin that further implicate them in TOR signaling. We found that one of these genes, <italic>CFF1,</italic> was connected to the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis through URA10. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for flagging novel potential TOR signaling-related genes and highlight the utility of dynamic perturbations when using functional metabolomics to deliver biological insight.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>chemical genetics</kwd><kwd>TOR signaling</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>chemical biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>ETH Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 19-FEL-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doubleday</surname><given-names>Peter F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Fellowship LT000604/2017-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holbrook-Smith</surname><given-names>Duncan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High throughput metabolome profiling of yeast cells that are dynamically perturbed with the drug rapamycin can be used to implicate new genes in the key cellular process of TOR signaling, including the gene of unknown function <italic>CFF1</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the long-standing sequencing of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genetic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goffeau et al., 1996</xref>), the characterization of the roles of genes and proteins within it is an ongoing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wood et al., 2019</xref>). Any systematic understanding of the cell will require a full mapping between genes and functions. Various approaches have been used to explore gene function at a genome-wide scale. Many of these approaches rely only on tracking changes in the fitness of mutants in different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giaever et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, synthetic genome arrays can be used to explore gene function by identifying genetic interactions between genes of unknown function and genes whose functions are better characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>). These approaches have been very successful, but generally use fitness as a readout to infer function through a guilt-by-association approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind, 2000</xref>) and thus are limited to genes that influence fitness under the chosen experimental conditions. Other techniques have been developed where the effects of mutations on the cell can be tracked beyond fitness. These approaches include transcriptional profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Velculescu et al., 1997</xref>) and high content imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter, 2007</xref>), among others. There is enormous variability for these approaches in terms of the number of unique features that can be collected as well as the time and cost required per sample analyzed. These approaches can also reveal changes within the cell that are measurable but that would not translate into differences in fitness. With the advent of high-throughput metabolomics, including flow-injection analysis mass spectrometry (FIA-MS), it is possible to measure the metabolome profile of cells in less than a minute per sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuhrer et al., 2011</xref>). Increased throughput in metabolomics has allowed the union of functional genomics and metabolomics, opening a new approach to the characterization of gene function at a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuhrer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between genetics and the metabolome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been a long-standing area of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breunig et al., 2014</xref>), and metabolomics has been used to understand gene function. For example, metabolomics has been used to uncover phenotypes for silent mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raamsdonk et al., 2001</xref>). In the past, pioneering work has demonstrated that high-throughput approaches can be used on a genome-wide scale to measure amounts of amino acids in yeast deletion mutants for the purpose of characterizing regulatory principles of biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mülleder et al., 2016a</xref>). Other work in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has explored the effect of loss-of-function mutations on the metabolome at a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuhrer et al., 2017</xref>). However, these genome-scale approaches are insufficient to fully associate genes and functions since not all genetic deletions will exert a measurable effect on the cell in every condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>). This may in part be due to limited metabolome coverage, but it may also be because these studies were performed under steady-state conditions. Under these conditions, cells are not exposed to any dynamic perturbation, allowing them to buffer their metabolism in such a way as to obscure the effects of different mutations on the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jost and Weiner, 2015</xref>). Dynamic cellular perturbation may reveal functional relationships between genes by evading some portion of compensating changes within the cellular system. Tracking the dynamics of the metabolome for large numbers of mutants has historically been unattainable due to throughput limitations, but with the order-of-magnitude increase in measurement speed offered by flow-injection such experiments are now feasible.</p><p>The ability to precisely follow changes in the levels of metabolites is particularly important when investigating the cellular systems that regulate metabolism and growth. The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling system is a core regulator of these decisions around growth in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González and Hall, 2017</xref>). Many core components of TOR signaling have been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>). This includes the discovery of two functionally distinct sets of TOR protein complexes, one of which (TORC1) is sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin and a second complex (TORC2) which is not (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eltschinger and Loewith, 2016</xref>). Key questions remain regarding the roles of different TOR signaling genes in the regulation of metabolism. For example, although it has been shown that leucine can regulate TOR through interactions with its transporter SLC7A5 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor, 2014</xref>), the broader question of how other amino acid levels are able to regulate TOR is currently not fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González and Hall, 2017</xref>). Genome-scale investigations have been devised to identify genes that convey resistance or susceptibility to the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in different mutant forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher et al., 2006</xref>). Although these approaches have had successes, they do not provide specific information regarding how any given mutation affects the cell. By contrast, high-throughput metabolomics can provide specific insights by identifying which mutants lead to defects in different dimensions of the metabolic response of the cell to rapamycin while also allowing for guilt-by-association analysis on the basis of metabolome similarity.</p><p>In this work, we exploit dynamic high-throughput metabolome profiling to measure the metabolome profiles of 164 loss-of-function mutants in yeast, and newly associate three genes with TOR signaling. Further investigation of these mutants showed that they have proteomic alterations that further implicate them in TOR signaling. A subset of them also showed altered growth responses during nutrient upshifts where TOR signaling is important. One of these genes, <italic>CFF1</italic> (YML079W), is a gene of unknown function with structural similarity to auxin binding proteins in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>) that has recently been shown to be required for the production of quorum-sensing compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valastyan et al., 2021</xref>). We discovered that a <italic>CFF1</italic> loss-of-function mutant also shows altered pyrimidine metabolism during nutrient upshifts, likely due to altered expression of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme URA10. These results demonstrate that <italic>CFF1</italic> mutation alters the cell’s response to rapamycin and nutritional shifts, and thus implicates it in TOR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TOR mutants show altered metabolome responses to rapamycin treatment</title><p>We sought to establish the metabolome responses of different TOR-related mutants to rapamycin so that we could use those responses as a baseline to explore gene function for mutants not yet known to be involved in TOR signaling. Thus, we characterized the effects of a collection of 85 mutants in TOR-related signaling genes on the metabolome response of the cell to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The mutant collection included deletions in regulators that act upstream of TORC1, as well as downstream kinases or genes involved TOR-related processes such as autophagy. Only nonessential mutants were selected for the collection. These TOR signaling mutants were cultivated on synthetic defined media with glucose and ammonium as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.7 at which point metabolites were extracted and a rapamycin treatment (400 ng/mL) was performed. Rapamycin treatment inhibits TORC1 and elicits important dynamic responses in terms of metabolite levels and downstream signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). We aimed to capture these dynamic effects in our mutant strains by preparing polar metabolite extracts after 5, 30, 60, and 90 min of rapamycin treatment. These extracts were measured using FIA-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuhrer et al., 2011</xref>), a chromatography-free method that allows for the measurement of relative metabolite levels with a broad coverage of metabolite classes in less than a minute per sample. The effect of rapamycin treatment on wild-type yeast as measured by high-throughput FIA-MS was orthogonally validated by a longer liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based measurement method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The similar metabolome response seen using both methods demonstrated that our high-throughput measurements were of sufficient quality to explore the relative differences in metabolome responses between the mutants in this study while providing the throughput required to study the large number of mutants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolome profiling of TOR and receptor-related mutants captures dynamic metabolome changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram illustrating the study design.

Specifically, the levels of most amino acids increase after rapamycin treatment due to inhibition of translational initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berset et al., 1998</xref>), with some exceptions such as serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mülleder et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). Upon TORC1 inactivation through starvation, nucleotide degradation increases, which leads to increased pool sizes of nucleoside-related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Since the yeast were cultivated in media containing glucose as a carbon source and ammonium as a nitrogen source, basal TORC1 signaling is high in these exponentially growing wild-type yeast until rapamycin is added to inhibit TORC1. Consistent with reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>), changes in metabolite levels such as nucleosides were seen when wild-type yeast were treated with rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The TOR-related mutants within this study are drawn from a range of classes, with multiple genes involved in autophagy, positive and negative regulation of TOR signaling, signaling genes that are mechanistically downstream of TOR, and other classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Significantly altered metabolite levels (absolute log2 transformed fold-changes of &gt;0.5 compared with wild-type with a p-value of &lt;0.05) could be observed for mutants across all functional classes compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The highest number of changes in metabolite levels across all mutants were observed after 90 min of rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results show that treating the cells with rapamycin can reveal metabolic responses that are not measurable prior to treatment.</p><p>Deleting genes that are positive upstream regulators of TOR signaling reduces the signal propagated through that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Péli-Gulli et al., 2015</xref>), and thus either causes changes in the metabolome that resemble those resulting from rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mülleder et al., 2016a</xref>) or could further sensitize the cell to TORC1 inhibition. <italic>gtr1,</italic> a mutant in a key positive regulator of TOR signaling that acts upstream of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binda et al., 2009</xref>), showed elevated levels of glutamine compared with wild-type in the absence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since glutamine levels increase after rapamycin inhibition of TORC1, this increase in glutamine in <italic>gtr1</italic> serves as a positive control. Phenylalanine also shows an accumulation after cells were treated with rapamycin, but it showed similar levels in untreated wild-type and <italic>gtr1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, the <italic>gtr1</italic> mutant showed a much stronger accumulation of the amino acid than did wild-type after rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, some metabolic alterations manifested by deleting genes involved in TOR signaling are only revealed after treatment with rapamycin. When this analysis was expanded to all deletion mutants in genes that code for positive regulators of TORC1 signaling within our collection (<italic>GTR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binda et al., 2009</xref>], <italic>GTR2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binda et al., 2009</xref>], <italic>LST4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Péli-Gulli et al., 2015</xref>], <italic>MTC5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>], <italic>RTC1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>], <italic>SEA4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panchaud et al., 2013</xref>]; hereafter referred to as 'positive regulators'), similar effects were seen across mutants and time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

By enriching the mutant collection for receptor-related functions, we aimed to increase our chances of identifying genes that are involved in the regulation of TORC1 signaling. Dynamic metabolome extracts for these 85 mutants (from here on referred to as receptor-related) were collected under the same conditions as described above for the TOR mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and were analyzed by FIA-MS.</p><p>Metabolome profiles for each mutant at each time point were determined by calculating the average log2 fold-change between the metabolite intensities of the mutants compared with the wild-type control. Patterns of metabolome similarity across the dataset were systematically analyzed by calculating the Pearson correlation between the metabolome profiles for each mutant in the TOR and receptor-related collections to each other for each time point. Manhattan distances between each mutant’s profiles of correlation were then calculated and the mutants were subjected to hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This analysis showed clustering of the positive regulators, with most co-clustering mutants being other TOR-related genes. Indeed, the empirical likelihood for the distances between positive regulators being as low as was observed was calculated to be &lt;5% for all time points that were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The median distance between each mutant and the other positive regulators was used as a metric for the binary classification of mutants as being positive regulators or not. Annotated positive regulators of TORC1 signaling were treated as true positives, and all other mutants in the annotated collection were treated as false positives. When the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated for each time point, the values were &gt;0.5 for all the time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BC</xref>). The area under the curve for the untreated cells was observed to be the smallest of all the time points, indicating that a dynamic perturbation by rapamycin treatment improved the recovery of true positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This highlights the utility of dynamic perturbations when applying metabolomics to studying gene function. Previous studies have interrogated gene function by measuring the genetic interactions between mutations in yeast systematically, including for mutations in genes included in this study. It is possible that the metabolome-based distances that were calculated here capture the same information that arises from genetic interaction studies. However, when the metabolome distances between mutants were compared with the genetic interaction score between genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>), small but significant correlations were seen between the datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These correlations were largely driven by relatively few interactions with large negative genetic interaction scores. This demonstrates that, with the exception of very strong negative genetic interactions, metabolome-based distances between mutants provide additional descriptions of the functional relationships between mutants. This suggests that new patterns of similarity derived from metabolomics could be used to identify new functional relationships.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Positive regulators of TOR signaling cluster together based on their metabolome profiles after rapamycin treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Pearson correlation matrix between all TOR and receptor-related genes is shown for the 30 min rapamycin treatment condition with clustering based on Ward’s algorithm of the Manhattan distance.

For one, TOR-related genes showed smaller distances to the positive regulators compared with the receptor-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is expected since although these genes are not upstream positive regulators of TORC1 signaling, many of them are effectors of TORC1 signaling that are involved in the cellular response to altered TORC1 signaling and thus should share some features of their metabolic response. Additionally, genes that are negative regulators of TORC1 signaling (<italic>NPR3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neklesa and Davis, 2009</xref>], <italic>PBP1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2019</xref>], <italic>PSR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>], <italic>PSR2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>], <italic>TIP41</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacinto et al., 2001</xref>], and <italic>WHI2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>]) showed among the longest distances to the positive regulators within the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is expected since the metabolome response of a loss-of-function mutant in a negative regulator of TORC1 would be quite distant from those of positive regulators. This, therefore provides additional evidence that metabolome-based distances can capture functional relationships between genes.</p><p>Given that our analysis was able to recover known positive regulators of TORC1, we extended this analysis to ask which receptor-related mutant metabolome profiles were consistent with being a positive regulator of TORC1. For each time point, the distance at which a false-positive rate of 0.2 was obtained for the recovery of positive regulators was determined. Six receptor-related mutants (<italic>RGT2, HXK2, URE2, BCK1, CLA4,</italic> and <italic>CFF1</italic>) were able to pass this cutoff and were selected as potential novel positive regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DE</xref>). Out of these genes, three are involved in signaling pathways with known cross-talk with TORC1 signaling. Namely, <italic>RGT2</italic> and <italic>HXK2</italic> are involved in sugar sensing via the PKA signaling, which feeds into the regulation of downstream TORC1 signaling targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shashkova et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>URE2</italic> is a transcriptional regulator for nitrogen catabolite repression, which is in part regulated by TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shashkova et al., 2015</xref>). The other hits included the intracellular kinases <italic>BCK1</italic> and <italic>CLA4</italic>, as well as a gene of poorly characterized function <italic>YML079W</italic>, which has recently been named <italic>CFF1</italic> based on its inability to produce the compound 4-hydroxymethylfuranone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valastyan et al., 2021</xref>). These results show that a metabolome profiling-based guilt-by-association approach can be used to identify genes with known cross-talk with TOR signaling as well as genes whose connections to TOR signaling are completely novel.</p><p>Beyond the guilt-by-association approach outlined above, the data presented here can also be viewed at the level of the individual mutant and metabolite. This allows us to assess the involvement of different genes in specific metabolic processes. This stands in contrast to other guilt-by-association approaches that are based solely on fitness and cannot directly observe the effect of mutants on metabolic processes. One of the strongest examples is <italic>atg13</italic>, which is incapable of performing autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Funakoshi et al., 1997</xref>). This mutant shows a strong reduction in the accumulation of the nucleoside inosine under rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This is likely caused by the inability of the mutant to perform autophagy under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), but other metabolites such as glutamine show no difference in their accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) or in the case of kynurenine a more limited effect is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results highlight a clear relationship between <italic>ATG13</italic> and nucleoside pool sizes under rapamycin treatment that likely results from the disruption of autophagy, but also raises questions about the mechanism through which <italic>ATG13</italic> affects the levels of metabolites like kynurine. This is an example of the type of observation that can be obtained from this analysis that would be missing from a more traditional guilt-by-association approach. Although <italic>ATG13</italic> deletion had one of the strongest effects on metabolite levels within the dataset, differences in the metabolome profiles of many genes across a range of different functional classes were observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, the data included within this study can be used to query the effect of the deletion of genes of interest on the metabolome. The response of the cell to rapamycin is not restricted to changes at the level of the metabolome, so we set forth to investigate the proteome response of the mutants in the newly predicted positive regulators of TORC1 signaling to rapamycin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>New and predicted TOR signaling genes show altered proteome responses to rapamycin</title><p>Metabolome-based guilt-by-association was used to newly implicate <italic>CFF1, BCK1,</italic> and <italic>CLA4</italic> in TORC1 signaling. It is hypothesized that if these genes are involved in TORC1 signaling, the effect of their deletion on the cell is mediated at least in part by changing protein levels. We would also expect these changes to be similar to those seen in mutants in known positive regulators of TOR signaling. We tested this by analyzing the proteomes of six mutants in known positive regulators of TORC1 signaling, and the six receptor-related mutants that were associated with positive regulation of TORC1 signaling as was described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Cultures were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.8 in defined media with glucose and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources. The strains were treated with 400 ng/mL rapamycin and were then grown for 30 min before harvesting the yeast and subjecting them to label-free, quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>). Treatment of wild-type yeast with rapamycin resulted in broad changes in the proteome, with enriched changes in the levels of proteins in gene ontology (GO) biological process categories such as carbohydrate and organic acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), recapitulating patterns observed in previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iesmantavicius et al., 2014</xref>). TOR signaling gene deletion mutants would be expected to show altered proteome responses to rapamycin treatment compared with the proteome responses seen in wild-type. The proteins that changed in abundance upon rapamycin treatment in all 12 mutants were tested for enrichment of the GO terms that were enriched for wild-type treated with rapamycin. All mutants, except HXK2 and RGT2, showed clearly altered patterns of GO enrichment upon rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as would be expected for genes that are required to respond to rapamycin.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>New TOR hits resemble positive TORC1 regulators at the level of the proteome and growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) -log10 transformed adjusted p-values are shown for the enrichment of gene ontology (GO) biological processes in changing proteins after rapamycin treatment in each mutant.

The Pearson correlation between those mutant proteome profiles was then calculated and used to assess how similar the effects of the mutations were on the proteome. The correlations coefficients were universally positive, with values as high as 0.91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

TORC1 signaling is central to the adaptation of the yeast cell to changing nutritional environments. Therefore, mutations that impair TORC1 signaling reduce the ability of the cell to adapt to increases or decreases in nutritional quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kira et al., 2014</xref>). We tested whether deletion mutants in <italic>CFF1, RGT2, HXK2, URE2, CLA4,</italic> and <italic>BCK1</italic> showed such an impairment by performing nutritional upshift experiments. Cultures were grown in minimal media with proline as a nitrogen source and glucose as a carbon source. Under these conditions, TORC1 activity is reduced due to the poor nitrogen source quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stracka et al., 2014</xref>). After cultivation for 18 hr, the cultures were exposed to a nutritional upshift through the introduction of ammonium sulfate into the cultures, after which the growth rate and lag time were determined for all the predicted positive regulator mutants. Under these conditions, TORC1 signaling will become more active than before the addition of the ammonium sulfate, and genes involved in the positive regulation of TORC1 signaling would be expected to be physiologically relevant. <italic>cff1</italic> and <italic>bck1</italic> showed significantly reduced growth rates upon the supplementation of the media with ammonium sulfate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and <italic>hxk2</italic> demonstrated a longer lag time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Previously published functional genomics screens have shown that known positive regulators of TORC1 signaling show reduced growth rates when grown in minimal media compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>). In that study, the relative growth rates of the positive regulators varied from 0.71 to 0.97 with an average value of 0.84 for the five positive regulators that were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>). This means that the reduction of growth rate seen for <italic>cff1</italic> and <italic>bck1</italic> was within a similar range as was reported previously for the known positive regulators as described above. Although <italic>CFF1</italic> and <italic>BCK1</italic> have not previously been considered TORC1 signaling genes, these mutants showed reduced growth rates during a nitrogen source upshift as would be expected for a mutation in a positive regulator of TORC1 signaling. These results, in addition to their metabolome and proteome level similarity to known positive regulators of TORC1 signaling, further implicate these two genes in the TORC1 signaling. Although <italic>CFF1, BCK1,</italic> and <italic>CLA4</italic> all show signs of involvement in TORC1 signaling, because <italic>CFF1</italic> is a protein of unknown function, we decided to investigate its possible role in TORC1 signaling in greater depth.</p><p>The protein SCH9 is directly phosphorylated by TORC1 and is a key node for transmission of signaling intro processes downstream of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urban et al., 2007</xref>).

As expected, Western blot quantification revealed a similar degree of SCH9 phosphorylation in wild-type and <italic>cff1</italic> strains in rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since CFF1 is required for a normal response to changing nutritional environments, it therefore appears to act mechanistically downstream of TORC1.

Notably, the recovery of known positive regulators of TORC1 signaling was highest after the cells were dynamically perturbed with rapamycin. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that dynamic perturbation of the cell improves the recovery of eukaryotic gene function when using a metabolomics-based guilt-by-association scheme. These studies also provide insights into why different genome-wide metabolome profiling experiments conducted under steady state appear to provide incomplete information regarding gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mülleder et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuhrer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Through our guilt-by-association approach, we were able to use patterns of metabolome similarity to recall known positive regulators of TORC1 signaling and implicate six receptor-related genes in that process as well.

Previous work has also demonstrated structural similarity between CFF1 and auxin-binding proteins from plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>), as well as a role in determining the production of the compound 4-hydroxymethylfuranone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valastyan et al., 2021</xref>). Further exploration of the <italic>cff1</italic> response to rapamycin at the proteome level revealed a clearly impaired response to rapamycin, a similarity between the effects of <italic>cff1</italic> on the proteome to those of rapamycin, and a reduction in CFF1 abundance under rapamycin treatment. We showed that <italic>CFF1</italic> deletion caused a defective response to nutrient upshifts at the level of growth and altered metabolite pool sizes and during a nitrogen quality downshift. The phosphorylation of the key TORC1 target SCH9 was not altered in <italic>cff1</italic> yeast, suggesting that the mechanism of action of the gene lies downstream of TORC1. Intriguingly, CFF1 has been reported to be phosphorylated at a number of positions, including serine 68 under glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>). This could point to additional regulation of CFF1 activity at a post-translational level within the context of TOR signaling downstream of TORC1. Although the exact mechanistic role of CFF1 in TORC1 signaling will require deeper investigation<bold>,</bold> CFF1 seems to act downstream of TORC1 to regulate pyrimidine biosynthesis through URA10.

These kinds of observations can be made across many other mutants that are included in this dataset and can be the basis of future work where the roles of genes in metabolic regulation can be explored by members of the scientific community. To enhance the usability of this data, we assembled an interactive data visualization app where users can browse through this data in order to investigate mutants that are of interest to them (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch">https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch</ext-link>). Furthermore, our data are made available in raw form, and because the acquisition of the main dataset was performed in an untargeted mode, these data can be reanalyzed in the future as the library of potential metabolites is expanded. This can allow for even greater utility for researchers with a particular interest in any compound that may be unannotated within our analysis. In addition to this metabolomics data, this article includes the proteome response of 12 mutants to rapamycin and thus provides a resource for members of the community who wish to further explore the proteome response of the cell to rapamycin treatment in those strains.</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate that condition-specific, dynamic metabolome profiling can offer attractive properties for the exploration of gene function compared to steady state metabolomics measurements. This builds on work showing that dynamic perturbations of gene expression can be used to recover drug-target relationships on the basis of metabolome similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holbrook-Smith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anglada-Girotto et al., 2022</xref>) and thus further demonstrates the value of non-steady-state perturbations of the cell in the context of metabolome profiling. Although this approach included measurements of the metabolome at five time points, subsequent analysis at a genome-wide level could just as easily be performed with a single time point within the dynamic perturbation. Thus, we can reveal relationships between metabolites and mutants that could be hidden during steady state due to homeostatic changes in gene expression or other compensatory changes within the cell. This would allow for the discovery of hitherto uncharacterized relationships between genes as well as identify novel roles for genes in metabolic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast cultivation</title><p>Liquid-cultivated yeast were grown at a temperature of 30°C with a shaking frequency of 250 rpm.

Below were have included our response to the points raised by our reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Reichling et al. used flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry (FIA-MS), a chromatography-free high-throughput method of untargeted metabolomics, to assess the temporary changes in the concentrations of polar metabolites within budding yeast exposed to the TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) inhibitor rapamycin. The water-soluble metabolomes of the rapamycin-treated wild-type (WT) strain, many mutants in the non-essential genes lacking known protein components of the TORC1-upstream and -downstream signaling and numerous gene-deletion mutants missing the redundant small-molecule protein receptors that might participate in TORC1 signaling were analyzed by FIA-MS. The quality of the quantitative metabolome profiling performed by the FIA-MS method was validated with the help of a time-consuming liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of WT cells.</p><p>Using the FIA-MS-based metabolome profiling, the authors revealed that rapamycin treatment upregulates or downregulates the polar metabolomes specific to a distinct set of cellular processes. Similar patterns of the temporal dynamics of rapamycin-induced changes in the metabolomes characteristic of these cellular processes were observed in WT cells and mutants deficient in known protein components of TORC1 signaling. Remarkably, the authors found that three mutants (i.e., BCK1, CLA4 and CFF1) impaired in the small-molecule protein receptors that were unknown for their roles in TORC1 signaling exhibit the temporal dynamics of rapamycin-induced metabolome changes comparable to the mutants deficient in the known positive protein regulators of TORC1 signaling. Furthermore, the comparative metabolome-based analyses of relationships between rapamycin-treated cells defective in the many known and several unknown protein regulators of TORC1 signaling allowed authors to conclude that such analyses objectively reflect the functional connectivity of these protein regulators. Moreover, the authors provided evidence that comparing the metabolome profiles in rapamycin-treated WT and TORC1 signaling mutant cells enables the identification of new metabolic reactions and pathways affected by and/or contributing to the TORC1-dependent nutrient signaling network.</p><p>In this proof-of-principle study, the authors also employed the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for a quantitative proteomic comparison of rapamycin-treated WT cells and mutants impaired in the known and previously unknown protein components of TORC1 signaling. They found that rapamycin induces comparable changes in the proteomes of all these cells. This proteomic analysis confirmed that the small-molecule protein receptors previously unknown as TORC1 signaling components and identified as such components only with the help of dynamic metabolome are integrated into the TORC1 signaling network. The authors further confirmed the essential contribution of the novel protein components of the TORC1 signaling to this type of nutrient signaling in the experiments on measuring growth rate changes following a nitrogen source upshift and assessing metabolome and proteome alterations after a nitrogen source downshift.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and of high technical quality. All claims are convincing, fully supported by the experimental data and appropriately discussed in the context of previous literature. The authors have been fair in their treatment of previous literature. They provided the methodological detail sufficient for others to reproduce the experiments. No additional experiments are needed to support the claims made in the manuscript. The experiments are adequately replicated and statistical analysis is appropriately performed.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This pioneering study represents a major conceptual advancement in the fields of using condition-specific, dynamic metabolome profiling for the deep understanding of relationships between genes integrated into a signaling pathway, discovering novel genes incorporated into a cellular signaling network and its small-molecule regulators, and identifying the metabolic pathways governed by a signal transduction network.</p><p>The treatment of the existing literature on the research topic by the manuscript's authors is balanced and fair.</p><p>This well-organized and clearly written manuscript is a must-read for anyone interested in the molecular mechanisms of cellular signaling.</p><p>My field of expertise involves exploring the molecular dynamics of complex cellular processes using advanced genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches (including the mass spectrometry-based analyses of the cellular proteomes, lipidomes and water-soluble metabolomes).</p><p>I recommend accepting this manuscript for publication in any journal affiliated with Review Commons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 heartily for their comments and for the time they spent reviewing our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this manuscript, Rechiling et al., have used a unique approach by exploiting a temporal dynamic high-throughput metabolome profiling (using flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to measure the metabolome profiles of many mutants in yeast, which allow them to newly annotate 3 genes in the TOR signaling pathway. This work demonstrate elegantly that dynamic perturbation of the cell allows inferring gene function when using a metabolomics-based guilt-by-association scheme. They were able to successfully find genes like CFF1, BCK1 and CLA4 which might act as positive regulators in the TOR pathway.</p><p>This an interesting study since it provides an alternative approach to annotate gene function and their contribution to known signaling pathways by analyzing the dynamic of the soluble metabolome. Overall, the manuscript was concisely well written, and the finding has a great potential to improve our understanding of gene function and genetic determinism of metabolism in model organisms.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>As the cellular response to rapamycin is not restricted to changes at the level of the metabolome, the authors investigated the proteomic response of each mutant to reaffirm their functional relationship to the TOR pathway. In this regard, it is not clear why the author did not consider a time-course analysis of the proteome as they did for the metabolome. The measurable steady-state proteomic signature might also reflect a buffered cellular state which might hide other response.</p></disp-quote><p>A time course analysis of the proteome for all mutants would be extremely interesting. However, due to the time and cost of proteomic analysis we instead focused on one time point for rapamycin treatment in the context of proteomics analysis. The proteome response data from mutants treated with rapamycin for 1 hour was used to identify the altered proteome responses of the mutants presented in figure 3A. This allowed us to explore the proteome responses of the mutants to rapamycin, and overcome the cellular buffering that our reviewer correctly points to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Many typos in the methodology section (e.g., potassium phosphate.…)</p></disp-quote><p>The typos in the methods section have been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 1: Not clear what this figure show and how it supports the author's claim that FIA-MS was validated by LC-MS.</p></disp-quote><p>The positive linear relationship between the values for the measured metabolites by FIA-MS and LC-MS indicate that similar results were obtained with both methods.
