We examined the cervical cancer screening participation during the pandemic in Denmark.</p> <p><bold>Methods:</bold> We included all women aged 23-64 years old invited to participate in cervical cancer screening from 2015-2021 as registered in the Cervical Cancer Screening Database combined with population-wide registries. Using a generalised linear model, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cervical cancer screening participation within 90, 180 and 365 days since invitation during the pandemic in comparison with the previous years adjusting for age, year and month of invitation.</p> <p><bold>Results:</bold> Altogether, 2,220,000 invited women (in 1,466,353 individuals) were included in the study. Before the pandemic, 36% of invited women participated in screening within 90 days, 54% participated within 180 days and 65% participated within 365 days. At the start of the pandemic, participation in cervical cancer screening within 90 days was lower (pre-lockdown PR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.56-0.59 and 1<sup>st</sup> lockdown PR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.75-0.77) compared with the previous years. A reduction in participation within 180 days was also seen during pre-lockdown (PR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.88-0.90) and 1<sup>st</sup> lockdown (PR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.91-0.93). Allowing for 365 days to participation, only a slight reduction (3%) in participation was seen with slightly lower participation in some groups (immigrants, low education and low income).</p> <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The overall participation in cervical cancer screening was reduced during the early phase of the pandemic. However, the decline almost diminished with longer follow-up time.</p> <p><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was funded by the Danish Cancer Society Scientific Committee (grant number R321-A17417) and the Danish regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Danish Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R321-A17417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>Tina Bech</given-names></name><name><surname>Møller</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Danish regions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>Tina Bech</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Ethical considerationsThe study is registered at the Central Denmark Region's register of research projects (journal number 1-16-02-381-20).
