It is made of T-shaped bifurcation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons. Our previous study has shown that Slit signaling is required for proper guidance during bifurcation, but loss of Slit does not affect all DRG axons. Here, we examined the role of the extracellular molecule Netrin-1 (Ntn1). Using wholemount staining with tissue clearing, we showed that mice lacking Ntn1 had axons escaping from the dorsal funiculus at the time of bifurcation. Genetic labeling confirmed that these misprojecting axons come from DRG neurons. Single axon analysis showed that loss of Ntn1 did not affect bifurcation but rather altered turning angles. To distinguish their guidance functions, we examined mice with triple deletion of Ntn1, Slit1, and Slit2 and found a completely disorganized dorsal funiculus. Comparing mice with different genotypes using immunolabeling and single axon tracing revealed additive guidance errors, demonstrating the independent roles of Ntn1 and Slit. Moreover, the same defects were observed in embryos lacking their cognate receptors. These in vivo studies thus demonstrate the presence of multi-factorial guidance mechanisms that ensure proper formation of a common branched axonal structure during spinal cord development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>dorsal funiculus</kwd><kwd>axon bifurcation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS108671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nickerson</surname><given-names>Kelsey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC014916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS095908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaworski</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS062047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS112504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Formation of dorsal axonal tracts in the spinal cord depends on multiple guidance mechanisms that control growth direction of bifurcating axons in the dorsal root entry zone.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With only one axon extending out from the soma, a neuron uses axonal branches to connect with multiple synaptic targets in complex neural circuits. Often axonal branches develop stereotypic patterns that support proper circuit connection and function. This involves not only the generation of new branches at the right location but also the guidance of newly formed branches toward their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibson and Ma, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>). While extensive knowledge has been gained on the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance and axon branching in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armijo-Weingart and Gallo, 2017</xref>; Chédotal, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo, 2011</xref>), less attention has been paid to how branches are guided in association with branch formation when precise circuits are assembled.</p><p>The central projections of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons in the spinal cord provide an excellent model to investigate such guidance mechanisms during branch morphogenesis. These projections relay somatosensory information (e.g., pain and touch) collected by their peripheral projections in the skin and muscle to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Bayer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirnics and Koerber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramon y Cajal, 1904</xref>). Upon reaching the dorsal spinal cord, they normally bifurcate in a location called the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirnics and Koerber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozaki and Snider, 1997</xref>). The bifurcated branches appear to extend in opposite directions along the rostrocaudal axis, generating T-shaped junctions, as part of the dorsal funiculus in the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibson and Ma, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nascimento et al., 2018</xref>). The dorsal funiculus is a critical axonal track in the spinal cord that allows information to flow between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS). Damage to or malformation of this evolutionarily conserved axonal structure in the DREZ can lead to paralysis, as commonly seen after spinal cord injury or in genetic disorders such as Frederick ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koeppen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, understanding the development of DRG axon bifurcation could provide useful insights into the mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of forming branched circuits.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NF immunostaining reveals DRG axon misprojections in <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants in cleared wholemount embryos and transverse sections.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Inverted fluorescent images of wholemount NF staining of CUBIC-cleared E10.5 WT (<bold>A, C</bold>) or <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> (<bold>B, D</bold>) embryos.

In mice, after reaching the dorsal spinal cord at embryonic day (E) 10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mirnics and Koerber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozaki and Snider, 1997</xref>), the DRG central projection first generates a new branch in response to the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) present in the dorsal spinal cord, a step that requires the CNP receptor Npr2 as well as cGMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao and Ma, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting two daughter branches are then guided to grow only in the DREZ along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozaki and Snider, 1997</xref>), leading to the formation of the T-shaped branch junction. This step is partly controlled by the Slit family of guidance molecules, Slit1 and Slit2, which are expressed next to the DREZ inside the spinal cord, as well as their Robo receptors, which are expressed by DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>). In mouse mutants lacking Slit1 and Slit2 or their receptors Robo1 and Robo2, one of the daughter branches misprojects into the spinal cord. However, the defect only affects ~50% DRG axons and does not eliminate the dorsal funiculus, suggesting the presence of other molecular mechanisms that guide bifurcating DRG afferents.</p><p>In search of additional molecular mechanisms, we re-evaluated the role of Netrin-1 (Ntn1), an extracellular molecule expressed in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Early studies of <italic>Ntn1</italic> deletion based on a gene-trap allele (<italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic>) as well as targeted deletion alleles have identified aberrant entry of sensory axons into the dorsal spinal cord at E11.5 and E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadarajan and Butler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varadarajan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yung et al., 2015</xref>). Because of its expression immediately adjacent to the DREZ at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>), it has been suggested that Ntn1 prevents premature ingrowth of sensory afferents into the spinal cord via repulsion, an activity that was demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is not clear whether Ntn1 is also required for proper DRG axon bifurcation, and if so, whether Ntn1 is needed for forming the second branch or guiding bifurcated axons.</p><p>Using wholemount immunostaining coupled with tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Renier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>), we examined <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants and found an ingrowth defect at the time of bifurcation, which differs in time and location from what has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Genetic and dye labeling confirmed that the misprojections were from DRG axons and single-cell analysis demonstrated that the defect resulted from misguidance of otherwise normally bifurcated axons. The misprojections had different trajectories from those found in <italic>Slit1;Slit2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>), and triple deletion of both pathways led to a rare and more severe phenotype with a near loss of the dorsal funiculus. Finally, a similar phenotype was also seen in mice lacking Ntn1 and Slit receptors. Taken together, these results demonstrate a new role for Ntn1, and more importantly, the presence of multiple guidance mechanisms that confine the bifurcating axons within the DREZ and ensure the precise construction of the dorsal funiculus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Ntn1 causes axons to escape from the dorsal funiculus during bifurcation</title><p>To determine the role of Ntn1 in early DRG axon development, we first confirmed the expression of <italic>Ntn1</italic> in the spinal cord at E10.5, when DRG axons start to bifurcate and form the dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozaki and Snider, 1997</xref>).

This RNA expression profile is in line with the localization of Ntn1 proteins made by ventricular zone neural progenitor cells and deposited along the pial layer adjacent to the DREZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dominici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadarajan and Butler, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To examine the DRG axonal tracts as they are entering the spinal cord at the DREZ, we performed wholemount neurofilament (NF) antibody staining combined with the CUBIC tissue clearing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>). Individual DRGs and their central projections in the dorsal funiculus can be seen from the lateral side of the embryos by confocal microscopy. As shown in wild type (WT) embryos, the central DRG axons first extend dorsally, enter the spinal cord, bundle and form the dorsal funiculus that runs along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Due to the developmental delay along the rostrocaudal axis, the dorsal funiculus shown as a longitudinal track is thicker near the forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) than near the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), where it has just begun to form from bifurcated axons. These labeled axons stay within the tract forming tightly bundled fascicles, with few labeled axons extending dorsally from the dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This clear projection pattern can be also seen by traditional NF staining using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based immunostaining and BA/BB-based tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). When viewed on a stereoscope, the labeled DRG axons appear to stay within the tract, leaving a clear space between left and right dorsal funiculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D, G and H</xref>).</p><p>Similar to those of WT embryos, DRG projections in <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants also form the dorsal funiculus, which can be seen as a NF-labeled longitudinal tract in the forelimb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, while some axons remain in the tract, a subpopulation of NF-labeled fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> arrows) were found to escape the tract, filling the space above the dorsal funiculus. These misprojecting fiber can be seen in traditional NF staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, I, J</xref>). They appear in the hindlimb region where the dorsal funiculus starts to emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the defect happens at the time of bifurcation.</p><p>To quantify the misprojections, we used line scans to determine the number of misprojecting fibers straying away from the dorsal funiculus of a single DRG in the fluorescent wholemount images viewed from the lateral side of the embryo. Lines were placed in three positions - proximal, medial, and distal - that are 75 μm apart between the DREZ and the roof plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In WT embryos, almost no fibers were found at any of the three positions, indicating that axons remain inside the dorsal funiculus. In <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants, an average of 22 fibers per DRG were found in the line proximal to the DREZ, 17 fibers/DRG were found in the medial line, and 14 fibers/DRG were found in the distal line that is closest to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of NF-fibers in the dorsal midline of the <italic>Ntn1</italic>mutants suggests that misprojections climb up in the dorsal spinal cord.</p><p>To better understand the location of misprojections, we examined transverse sections of E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H, K, L</xref>) and E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I, J, M, N</xref>) embryos stained for NF. In the dorsal spinal cord of WT embryos, NF labels axons that extend from the DRG into the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H, I, J</xref>). The DREZ is smaller at E10.5 than E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref> vs I,J), but at both ages, the intense NF staining that represents the cross-sections of the dorsal funiculus remains inside the DREZ. However, in <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants, NF-labeled fibers extended out from the DREZ at both ages. More misprojections were found at E11.5, but they all grow along the pia surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K, L, M and N</xref>), consistent with the dorsally extending trajectories seen in the wholemount staining above. Thus, loss of Ntn1 caused NF-labeled axons to escape from the DREZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ntn1 is invovled in DRG branch guidance at the time of bifurcation</title><p>Since NF can label axons from different neuronal populations including DRG sensory neurons, commissural neurons, and other spinal cord interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moreno-Bravo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yung et al., 2015</xref>), we wanted to confirm that the observed misprojections at E10.5 are indeed axons from DRG sensory neurons. We thus introduced a neural specific CreER<sup>T2</sup> recombinase driver (<italic>Neurog1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>) and an Ai14 Cre reporter to our <italic>Ntn1</italic> mice to label all DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>). After Tamoxifen treatment to activate the Cre recombinase, we used RFP antibody to label the fluorescent protein tdTomato, which is expressed from the Ai14 allele, and examined DRG neurons and their axons in iDISCO-cleared and antibody-stained wholemount embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Renier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In WT control embryos, tdTomato labeling is seen in DRG cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, asterisks), central axons projecting toward the dorsal spinal cord, and the dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, yellow dotted box), which are also labeled by NF staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’</xref>). In <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutant embryos, tdTomato labeling is seen in DRG central projections as well as misprojections that escape from the DREZ and reach the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NF staining similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the misprojecting fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B’</xref>) invading the dorsal space. While not all NF misprojections are tdTomato positive, all tdTomato-labeled misprojections are NF-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B”</xref>). This can be demonstrated by closer examination of the region above the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) where most misprojecting fibers are stained for both tdTomato and NF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C”</xref>, yellow arrows) but only a few are stained for just NF alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C’ and C”</xref>, white arrow). Importantly, these tdTomato-labeled misprojections came directly from the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). D2 dorsal interneurons inside the spinal cord are known to express <italic>Neurog1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Helms and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>). Although they are labeled by tdTomato staining, D2 interneurons are not labeled by NF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A”</xref>) and thus do not contribute to the NF-labeled misprojections. On the other hand, since <italic>Neurog1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> may not be active in all DRG neurons, tdTomato-labeled misprojections likely underrepresent the DRG axon misprojections. Thus, these data support that some if not all NF-labeled misprojections seen above are from DRG sensory neurons.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genetic labeling of DRG neurons confirms the origin of misprojections and reveals guidance defects during bifurcation in <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Sensory axon specific genetic labeling based on tdTomato expression driven by tamoxifen-induced <italic>Neurog1:CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> in E10.5 WT (<bold>A</bold>) or <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> (<bold>B</bold>) embryos that were cleared by iDISCO.

We utilized the leaky recombinase activity of CreER<sup>T2</sup> in the absence of tamoxifen, which leads to tdTomato expression, seemingly at random in a small population of DRG neurons and thus sparsely labels their axons. In iDISCO cleared E10.5 WT embryos, tdTomato labeling revealed that DRG axons displayed two types of morphologies in the DREZ: (1) bifurcated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which have already reached the DREZ and bifurcated to extend the two branches in the dorsal funiculus that can be visualized by NF co-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); (2) non-bifurcated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which have not yet bifurcated but reached the spinal cord and turned into the DREZ. Both bifurcated and non-bifurcated axons (n=12 vs 14) stay within the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) in the WT spinal cord. Similar bifurcated (n=17) and non-bifurcated (n=13) axons are found in <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). However, although some bifurcated axons exhibit branches that correctly turn at the DREZ and follow the dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, left branch), others often project dorsally out of the DREZ, indicating guidance errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, right branch). Non-bifurcated axons often enter the DREZ and project away from the dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For comparison, nearly all axonal terminals stayed within the DREZ of WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), whereas ~55% bifurcated and ~70% non-bifurcated axons in the <italic>Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> mutants misprojected outside of the defined dorsal funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

Since the misprojections in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants appear on the dorsal pial surface and stay outside the spinal cord, we hypothesize that Ntn1 and Slit have different guidance functions that are both required for the formation of the dorsal funiculus. To test this hypothesis, we generated triple mutants (<italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic>) and examined sensory axons in wholemount embryos using NF staining and tissue clearing as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Triple mutants were generated in the <italic>Slit1</italic> null background (<italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>+/+</sup>;Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>), which has nearly normal DRG axon projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), similar to those in the WT embryos described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Once reaching the DREZ, axons form compact bundles that run along the rostrocaudal axis. A few short stray axons, due to the loss of <italic>Slit1</italic>, enter the normally clear space between the dorsal funiculi of the two sides of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, NF labeled axons are completely disorganized around the DREZ (dotted-line region) in triple mutants (<italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). DRG axons still grow dorsally extending from the cell body, but rarely turn into the longitudinal track of the DREZ. Most of them continue to grow straight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, arrows) or veer off slightly after passing the presumptive dorsal funiculus. Examination using traditional DAB staining described earlier also confirms this complete ablation of the funiculus in triple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) when viewed in either the forelimb or the hindlimb region.

First, when viewed from the lateral side of the wholemount embryos as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), <italic>Slit1</italic> single mutants (<italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>+/+</sup>;Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) have a compact DREZ with few DRG axons projecting away. In double mutants lacking both Slit1 and Slit2 (<italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>), an increased number of DRG axons leave the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrows) and appear in the proximal region of the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), similar to those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>). The number of misprojections tapers off more distally from the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This can be demonstrated by viewing the misprojections from the dorsal side of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), as those misprojections maintain a relatively straight trajectory perpendicular to the DREZ. They also reach the midline but stop there without crossing to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. Such a trajectory is consistent with their invasion into the spinal cord, which can be shown on the transverse-section of the spinal cord. There, NF-labeled fibers appear to enter the spinal cord from the DREZ with horizontal trajectories inside the dorsal proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>, arrows). These misprojections reach the midline with an average length of 137.8 μm and a summed length of ~0.8 mm, indicating a high number of misprojections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T</xref>). For comparison, few misprojections are found in the <italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animal on transverse sections, with a summed length of only 0.02 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T</xref>).</p><p>As in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants, <italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>+/+</sup>;Ntn1<sup>β/β</sup></italic> embryos have a large number of dorsal misprojections that spread out in random directions from the DREZ along the dorsal spinal cord when viewed from the side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, arrowheads). They appear to extend away from the DREZ and reach more distal edge of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and H</xref>), different from that in <italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup>;Slit2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mutants. This can be corroborated by the dorsal view, which demonstrates that misprojections are wavy and long, sometimes passing the midline and reaching to the contralateral side of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Such pattern is the result of misprojections emerging from the DREZ and growing upward along the pial layer as shown on the transverse section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>). As a consequence, the distance from the midline to the DREZ is reduced to ~6 μm from ~69 μm of the <italic>Slit1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> control animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T</xref>).

These results demonstrate the presence of multiple mechanisms to ensure the proper formation of the dorsal funiculus, a structure that is essential to sensory function in the mammalian spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Light, 1988</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ntn1 signaling is required for guiding bifurcating DRG axons in the DREZ</title><p>Our analysis of mouse mutants lacking the secreted molecule Ntn1 expanded previous observation of a spinal cord ingrowth defect that was interpreted as the function of Ntn1 in a critical ‘waiting period’ before DRG axons sprout collateral branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). However, our study showed that loss of this molecular pathway also leads to a profound guidance error at the time of bifurcation, as misprojecting axons were found as early as E10.5, when the dorsal funiculus first forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The misprojecting axons do not stop at the DREZ but instead project more dorsally along the pial surface with random paths, supporting the idea that Ntn1 is needed for proper guidance of DRG afferents right at the time when they bifurcate in the DREZ. The origin of the misprojections is confirmed to come from DRG neurons by both genetic labeling using <italic>Neurog1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and DiI labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Single axon labeling by both methods further demonstrates the guidance role of Ntn1, which is different from what was suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). In these studies, DRG axons were found to enter from the ventral side of the DREZ in the medial spinal cord, leading to the proposal that Ntn1 blocks the DRG axons from entering the spinal cord when they initially arrive at the DREZ. Our data demonstrate that Ntn1 is required for guidance as well, but Ntn1 acts on bifurcating axons to guide their growth along the DREZ and loss of Ntn1 causes misprojections to exit the dorsal side of the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, single axon DiI labeling at a later stage rules out the requirement of Ntn1 in bifurcation as the majority of DRG axons in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants still form two branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is an important conclusion as premature entrance into the spinal cord could interfere or delay bifurcation, which was not analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, both dorsal and medial misprojections were observed in the recent studies of the embryo with complete Ntrn1 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moreno-Bravo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadarajan and Butler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that Ntn1 may play multiple guidance roles. Regardless, our single axon analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) demonstrates that Ntn1 exerts its guidance function on DRG axons at the time of bifurcation.</p><p>The guidance function is further supported by the similar defect found in mice lacking the Ntn1 receptor DCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This DCC function is reminiscent to that found in zebrafish DRG axons, which require proper DCC signaling to control actin-mediated invadopodia during the initial entry into the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikel-Coury et al., 2021</xref>). There are two possible mechanisms. One is that Ntn1 proteins present locally outside the DREZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>) provides a permissive cue that encourage the growth of newly bifurcated branches but restrict their trajectory within the DREZ, similar to the recently described role for Ntn1 in confining pontine neuron migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yung et al., 2018</xref>). Such a permissive function matches with the proposed adhesion function of DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meijers et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that the guidance function is mediated by a repulsive action of Ntn1, which can be mediated by both DCC and the repulsive receptor Unc5C. This is supported by Unc5C expression in DRG neurons as well as the repulsive activity of Ntn1 on E11.5 and E13.5 DRG axons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it would be interesting to re-examine Unc5C mutants and determine its role during DRG axon bifurcation and distinguish these potential mechanisms for Ntn1 signaling. Regardless, our studies demonstrate a key role for Ntn1 signaling in DRG axon guidance right after bifurcation at the DREZ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple mechanisms are present to regulate DRG axon guidance during bifurcation</title><p>One striking result from our studies is the complete disorganization and the loss of axonal bundles in the dorsal funiculus when both Slit and Ntn1 pathways are impaired.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a severe defect of the dorsal funiculus.</p><p>Importantly, when the misprojections were examined more carefully, we found that the guidance error found in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants is different from that found in mice lacking Slit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>). The misprojections due to the loss of Slit signaling tend to enter the spinal cord horizontally whereas those from the loss of Ntn1/DCC grow more dorsally and stay at the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, different growth trajectories were found for the misprojections: those in <italic>Slit/Robo</italic> mutants are relatively straight and horizontal whereas those in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants are wavy and randomly oriented. It is worth noting that the misprojections seen in <italic>Slit/Robo</italic> mutants enter the spinal cord from the middle or the dorsal side of the DREZ, which is different from those medial misprojections found in <italic>Ntn1</italic> mutants discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moreno-Bravo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadarajan and Butler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, these phenotypes suggest that Ntn1 and Slit have different actions in guiding DRG axons. This conclusion is further supported by the defects in triple mutants, which exhibit both types of misprojections. Quantitative analysis shows that loss of both pathways results in added defects for both horizontally and dorsally invading misprojections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), suggesting non-redundant functions of the two mechanisms.</p><p>Building on a collateral-couple repulsion model we proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibson and Ma, 2011</xref>), we suggest that Slit and Ntn1 regulate branch guidance at two different steps during bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When the primary axon of DRG neurons first reach the dorsal spinal cord, they are guided by Slit to turn into the DREZ; after turning, the second branch is stimulated to form by CNP; and finally, the two branches continue to grow along the DREZ and their trajectory is regulated by Ntn1. Future analysis at single-cell levels would be useful to test this refined model and distinguish the role of these molecules before and after bifurcation. Imaging the growth cone behaviors during bifurcation in vivo would provide additional information of the guidance decision as shown by recent studies in zebrafish and spinal cord explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikel-Coury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nichols and Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pignata et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, our new study demonstrates that formation of a simple bifurcation structure requires multiple molecular mechanisms to ensure not only the formation of the second branches but also the correct orientation of both branches.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cartoon illustration of the different guidance roles of Slit and Ntn1 during bifurcation.</title><p>A working model for the role of Slit and Ntn1 in regulating branch guidance at two different steps during bifurcation.

After forming the second branch stimulated by CNP, the two bifurcated axons continue to grow along the DREZ with their trajectories regulated by a Ntn1-dependent guidance mechanism.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94109-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>New insights of guidance regulation at the DREZ</title><p>The guidance function of Ntn1 and Slit has been well studied in midline guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chédotal, 2019</xref>), but guidance regulation of DRG axons at the DREZ is less well understood. It is worth noting that midline crossing is defined by the floor plate, a structure that is formed during early spinal cord development and which serves as an intermediate target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chédotal, 2019</xref>). However, in our view, the DREZ is an evolving structure that is not defined by any preexisting cell types. Rather, the DREZ is constructed at the location where DRG sensory axons first bifurcate, a process that involves the interaction of the DRG central axons with the cells in the dorsal spinal cord. This is best illustrated by the recent time-lapse imaging in the live zebrafish spinal cord, where the growth cone of pioneer DRG sensory neurons uses actin-rich filopodia and invadopodia to interact with the glial environment and brake axon growth at the future DREZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikel-Coury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nichols and Smith, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, DCC signaling was shown to control invadopodia stabilization during this precise guidance event, pointing to a critical role of the interaction between DRG axons and the local environment when entering the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kikel-Coury et al., 2021</xref>). Although our phenotype is consistent with this critical role, future live cell imaging is needed to examine how growth cones of rodent DRG axons are regulated to coordinate growth, guidance, and bifurcation during DREZ development. Nonetheless, our identification of the role of extracellular cues like Slit, Ntn1, and CNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma and Tessier-Lavigne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao and Ma, 2009</xref>) supports the hypothesis that both formation of the second branch and guidance of both bifurcated branches are critical to establishing the DREZ.</p><p>In addition to these extracellular cues, it has been suggested that sensory axon ingrowth and DREZ formation could be influenced by glial cells, especially boundary cap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Golding et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golding and Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maro et al., 2004</xref>). Since boundary cap cells are derived from late-born neural crest cells and associated with the dorsal root entry site starting at E12 in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golding and Cohen, 1997</xref>), they could potentially shape the DREZ during initial DRG axon ingrowth and bifurcation. Although boundary cap cells do not seem to correlate with growth of pioneer DRG axons to the DREZ in the developing zebrafish spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nichols and Smith, 2019</xref>), it would be interesting to examine their roles in rodent DRG axons by combining our single cell analysis with boundary cap cell-specific ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maro et al., 2004</xref>). Besides boundary cap cells, dorsal interneurons, which migrate ventrally at the time of DRG axon bifurcation, might also play a role here, as migration defects have been reported in both <italic>Ntn1</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Junge et al., 2016</xref>). These cells could produce extracellular factors to control DRG axon guidance. In fact, loss of TAG-1/Axonin-1 from these cells cause similar but not identical afferent defects at the DREZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perrin et al., 2001</xref>). To determine whether Ntn1 acts directly on DRG axons or indirectly to influence DRG bifurcation via interneurons, cell-specific deletion (instead of global knockouts used in this study) is needed to distinguish cell autonomous vs non-cell autonomous roles of DCC in guiding DRG axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suter and Jaworski, 2019</xref>). Regardless of the mechanistic details, our in vivo analysis in various knockout mice provides the first step toward understanding the complex regulation of axonal development at the DREZ, the PNS-CNS interface that is critical to spinal cord function and is often disrupted in genetic disorders or after injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koeppen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

However it is unclear to me, without having read those other studies, what is actually different between this study and those, and why there would be differences between the results from two groups. If the authors think this is an important point to make they need to more clearly say what the other group saw and offer an explanation of why the data may be different.</p></disp-quote><p>We added detailed comparison of the defects from different studies to the first section of the Discussion and suggested multiple roles of Ntn1 in controlling sensory axon growth at the DREZ in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the final section of the discussion it says, &quot;The guidance regulation of DRG axon bifurcation by Slit and Ntn1 may be similar to but overshadowed by their function in midline guidance [43].&quot; The meaning of this sentence was unclear to me. I had been thinking that since there are total knockout embryos (not conditional) there could be patterning effects that happen before the DRG branching that influence the formation of the DREZ. Is this what the authors mean to say here? How can the authors show that the guidance factors they have knocked out are actually functioning in the DRG neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the first sentence is vague, so we edited the paragraph and included the discussion of the regulation of DRG axons at the DREZ, which was the main theme of this last section. In addition, we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion of the possible indirect role of Ntn1 on DRG axons via the control of interneuron migration. This possibility was included in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In several of the figures (3T, 5I, 5J) there are distance measurements that are presumably averages of multiple axons in 3 or 4 embryos because 3-4 points are shown per graph. However, the figure and methods do not say how many axons were measured per embryo and I could not find if it says these numbers are averages. Clarifying the details of these panels would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The n is the number of animals analyzed and is now added to the figure legends. From each animal, multiple sections (2-4) were analyzed for various parameters in Fig. 3 and 5. This information was added to the Method section of the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall the data matches the conclusions in the paper. However, to this reviewer, the title suggests that Ntn and Slit will have defects in bifurcation. This is not the presented phenotype. I recommend the authors change the title to better reflect the findings of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the title of the revised manuscript to reflect the control of growth direction in the context of bifurcation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction of the work clearly outlines what is known about DREZ formation in mice but could extend its discussion to other systems like chick and zebrafish (Jaeda Coutinho-Budd et al. 2008, Wang and Scott 2000, Golding et al 1997, Nichols and Smith 2019, Kikel-Coury et al 2021). These studies are particularly important given that pioneer events, including bifurcation, can be visualized. Acknowledging the contribution of other model systems to the understanding of DRG axon patterning is important to improve the scholarly discussion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more detailed discussion of the current knowledge of DRG axon growth at the DREZ from several relevant studies of the rodent and zebrafish models in the last section of Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the data presented, the authors see defects in the axon patterning of DRG neurons and conclude it is a defect in the dorsal funiculus formation. Another interpretation is that a subset of axons cannot invade the spinal cord boundary properly. This phenotype was observed in zebrafish with timelapse imaging (Kikel-Coury et al 2021). It may not be necessary to specifically test the axons' ability to enter the spinal cord in this paper, but the possibility that this could drive the presented phenotypes should be more clearly stated in the results. Entry is not thoroughly addressed in this paper and would need to be confirmed by labeling the edge of the spinal cord with a second reporter. No entry would obviously impact axon targeting. However, delayed entry could place the axon in a navigation environment that is atypical, causing it to navigate aberrantly and present as a funiculus phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very interesting point. In our present view, dorsal funiculus formation is related to DRG axon patterning, which involves growth, guidance, and bifurcation of the incoming afferents at the dorsal spinal cord. We believe that these events are highly coordinated by various environmental cues to generate the DREZ and the dorsal funiculus. The defects we observed could result from the disruption of such coordination that leads to misregulation of DRG axon entry at the dorsal spinal cord, as suggested by the reviewer. We propose that further analysis by time-lapse imaging as done in zebrafish would provide better understanding of such coordination. This discussion was included in the last section of Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify that their approach does not knock out molecules in a cell-specific way. This would specifically impact the interpretation of the Dcc phenotypes. It is possible that UNC-40/DCC is guiding cells that are not labeled. The non-autonomous role of UNC-40/DCC should be clearly stated as a possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>This discussion was added to the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
