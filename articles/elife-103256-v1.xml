most common cause of irreversible blindness. Using a magnetic cell steering technique with excellent efficiency and tissue-specific targeting, we delivered two types of cells into a mouse model of glaucoma: either human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) or induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TM cells). We observed a 4.5 [3.1, 6.0] mmHg or 27% reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) for 9 months after a single dose of only 1500 magnetically steered hAMSCs, explained by increased outflow through the conventional pathway and associated with a higher TM cellularity. iPSC-TM cells were also effective, but less so, showing only a 1.9 [0.4, 3.3] mmHg or 13% IOP reduction and increased risk of tumorigenicity. In both cases, injected cells remained detectable in the iridocorneal angle 3 weeks post-transplantation. Based on the locations of the delivered cells, the mechanism of IOP lowering is most likely paracrine signaling. We conclude that magnetically steered hAMSC cell therapy has potential for long-term treatment of ocular hypertension in glaucoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glaucoma</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>intraocular pressure</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY030071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emelianov</surname><given-names>Stanislav Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuehn</surname><given-names>Markus H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ethier</surname><given-names>C Ross</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008065</institution-id><institution>Georgia Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowed chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ethier</surname><given-names>C Ross</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Magnetically steered mesenchymal stem cells significantly lowered intraocular pressure for 9 months in mice, motivating the translation of this technology for the treatment of glaucoma.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma, an optic neuropathy, is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, with more than 80 million cases worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tham et al., 2014</xref>). Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common subtype of the disease, is characterized by a gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells and a corresponding loss of vision. While the exact mechanism underlying retinal ganglion loss is not well understood, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman and Miglior, 2008</xref>; consequently, all current clinical treatments seek to sustainably lower IOP, using pharmacological, laser, and surgical means. However, the success of such IOP-lowering treatments is reduced by low patient adherence to medical therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reardon et al., 2011</xref>), by postsurgical complications, and/or by patients becoming refractory to originally successful treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heijl et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, there remains a major unmet public health need for methods that offer sustained IOP control in glaucoma patients.</p><p>The trabecular meshwork (TM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is an ocular tissue that drains the majority of aqueous humor (AH) from the human eye, and its function is a major determinant of IOP. There are a number of age- and glaucoma-associated changes in the TM, including an age-associated loss of TM cells which is accelerated in POAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref>). This cell deficiency has been identified as a therapeutic target for IOP control in glaucoma patients, with multiple groups attempting to re-functionalize the TM by injection of stem cells into the eye to restore normal IOP homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roubeix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Hassan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental schematic and design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of magnetically steered cell delivery to the trabecular meshwork (TM). As cells are injected into the anterior chamber at a low flow rate, the experimenter places the ‘point magnet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrani Fard et al., 2023</xref>) on the limbus and carefully drags the cells toward the iridocorneal angle, targeting the TM. Features of the figure are not drawn to scale. (<bold>B</bold>) Timeline of the experiments. An ultrastructural analysis, specifically the quantification of inner wall basement membrane fenestrations, was not undertaken for eyes receiving induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TMs) due to their inferior performance. Additionally, cell retention in the anterior chamber was only investigated at the short term. Note that baseline measurements were taken for wild-type (WT) and transgenic animals that did not necessarily receive an injection afterward. Refer to Materials and methods for a description of various experimental groups and further details.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103256-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Despite the potential of stem cell treatment for IOP control, there remain several critical barriers to translation. For example, cell delivery to the TM has typically relied on passive transport of cells by AH outflow, leading to extremely low delivery efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). A more efficient delivery method is desirable, which is expected to both increase the therapeutic benefit of the treatment and reduce immunogenicity; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2020</xref> reported an increase in the inflammatory markers CD45 and GR1 and T-cell markers CD4 and CD3 in the iris and the cornea after mesenchymal stem cell injection, likely due to off-target cell delivery. We have recently introduced a magnetically steered cell delivery technique which significantly outperforms previously used magnetic and nonmagnetic delivery techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrani Fard et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we characterize the efficacy of our stem cell delivery using this technique to lower IOP.</p><p>A second barrier to translation is the lack of knowledge about which cell type should be delivered to restore TM function. Three types of cells have previously been used in this context: native TM stem cells (TMSCs), mesenchymal stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derivatives. TMSC therapy lowers IOP and increases TM cellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>) and is theoretically attractive. However, the scarcity of TMSCs, constituting only 2–5% of the entire TM cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braunger et al., 2014</xref>), and the invasiveness of the required cell collection procedure significantly reduce the translational potential of this cell source. Alternatively, mesenchymal stem cells have been used in several studies, showing a transient IOP reduction, as well as neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roubeix et al., 2015</xref>). For example, Manuguerra-Gagné et al. injected bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a rat model of IOP elevation, observing a reduction in IOP for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>). These results, together with the ease of sourcing autologous cells and the established safety of mesenchymal stem cell therapy in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lalu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2021</xref>), make these stem cells a strong candidate for clinical POAG cell therapy. Finally, iPSCs can be differentiated into iPSC-TM cells, with the differentiated cells displaying phenotypic similarity to adult TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). Intracameral injection of iPSC-TMs into a perfused porcine anterior segment POAG model restored the IOP homeostatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Hassan et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, Zhu and colleagues delivered iPSC-TMs into the anterior chambers of ocular hypertensive mice and reported increased TM cellularity due to proliferation of endogenous cells and a corresponding decrease in the IOP for up to 12 weeks after cell delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Although both MSC and IPSC-TM showed promise, there is no information about their efficacy and safety in comparison to each other. Therefore, here, we compare the benefits of mesenchymal stem cells vs. iPSC-TM cells.</p><p>An additional barrier to translation is the choice of an appropriate animal model for preclinical testing, since no animal model replicates all the pathological phenotypes of POAG. For example, although nonhuman primate models show high anatomical and functional resemblance to humans and are the gold standard for certain preclinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>), induction of ocular hypertension requires laser photocoagulation of the TM, which is very unlike TM changes seen in POAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acott et al., 1989</xref>). Microbead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sappington et al., 2010</xref>) and hypertonic saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morrison et al., 1997</xref>) models of ocular hypertension are similarly distinct from human POAG pathology. Commercially available DBA/2 mice show TM cell loss and IOP elevation but are associated with undesirable systemic and ocular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in this work, we chose to use transgenic MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice. These mice carry a glaucoma-causing point mutation in the MYOC gene and have been reported to show an accelerated loss of TM cellularity and a gradual ocular hypertension development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zode et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we here evaluate the effectiveness of TM cell therapy, using a magnetic cell steering method and two clinically relevant cell choices, namely human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and iPSC-TM cells, in MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice. We judged effectiveness by the extent and longevity of IOP reduction, improvement in outflow facility, and increase in TM cellularity, among other outcome measures, and performed experiments using animal cohorts at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, detailed in Materials and methods section). Despite the absence of ocular hypertension in our MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice, our data demonstrate sustained IOP lowering and a significant benefit of magnetic cell steering in the eye, particularly for hAMSCs, strongly indicating further translational potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell transplantation lowered IOP and improved AH dynamics</title><p>We delivered and magnetically steered either hAMSCs or iPSC-TMs to the TM of eyes of MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; mice described above), measuring IOPs and outflow facilities at short-, mid-, and long-term time points, corresponding to ~1 month, 3–4 months, and 9 months after cell delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our high-level goals were to: (i) elucidate the impact of hAMSC or iPSC-TM delivery on IOP; and (ii) quantify the portion of IOP change due to changes in outflow facility, a key functional metric of the TM. Outflow facility is the numerical inverse of the hydraulic resistance to AH drainage through the conventional outflow pathway.</p><p>We expected transgenic MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice to show elevated IOP by 6–7 months of age, when baseline IOP measurements were taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zode et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, we saw no meaningful IOP difference between Tg-MYOCY437H mice (Tg group) and wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Despite this lack of IOP elevation in the transgenic model, magnetically steered delivery of hAMSCs led to a marked IOP decrease in Tg animals as compared to sham injection of saline at short-, mid-, and long-term time points. The IOP reduction was sustained in hAMSC-treated eyes over all three time points, with no statistically significant difference between any combination of these time points. iPSC-TM treatment also led to a reduction in IOP compared to sham (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) injection controls at both the short- and mid-term time points, although this difference did not reach statistical significance at the latter time. The IOP reduction due to iPSC-TM cells was approximately half that due to hAMSC treatment at both short- and medium-term time points (short term: <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4.3</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.6</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.9</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$- 4.3\left [- 5.6,- 2.9\right]\, \rm mmHg$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for hAMSC vs. <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.3</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.6</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$- 2.3\left [- 3.6,- 1.0\right]\, \rm mmHg$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for iPSC-TM, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.021</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft3">\begin{document}$p=0.021$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>; mid-term: <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4.5</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft4">\begin{document}$- 4.5\left [- 5.8,- 3.1\right ]\, \rm mmHg$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for hAMSC vs. <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.9</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.3</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft5">\begin{document}$- 1.9\left [- 3.3,- 0.4\right]\, \rm mmHg$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> for iPSC-TM, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.005</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft6">\begin{document}$p=0.005$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>; all data reported as means and 95% confidence intervals).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Intraocular pressure (IOP) was reduced by targeted cell delivery to the trabecular meshwork (TM).</title><p>In each experimental cohort, the central white strip indicates the mean, while the darker region represents the 95% confidence interval on the mean.

We hypothesized that our targeted magnetic delivery approach would prove efficacious. A secondary goal was to compare the efficacy of two clinically relevant stem cell types: hAMSCs and iPSCs that had been differentiated toward a TM cell phenotype (iPSC-TMs).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>hAMSC delivery led to long-term IOP reduction</title><p>Our major finding was that magnetically steered delivery of hAMSCs led to a significant and sustained lowering of IOP, which could be almost entirely explained by improved function of the conventional outflow pathway. Specifically, we saw an ~27% (4.5 mmHg) IOP reduction in eyes receiving hAMSCs vs. saline (sham) injection control eyes, which was sustained for 9 months after cell delivery. This lowering of IOP was closely related to a stable ~2.8-fold increase in outflow facility in the hAMSC treatment group vs. saline injection controls.</p><p>Eyes subjected to saline injection exhibited marginally higher IOPs and lower outflow facilities on average, in comparison to the transgenic animals at baseline. However, due to the lack of statistical significance in these differences and the inherent age difference between the saline-injected animals and the non-injected controls at baseline, no conclusive inference can be drawn regarding the effect of saline injection. To investigate this phenomenon further, we also analyzed IOPs in uninjected contralateral eyes at the mid-term time point (Appendix 2). The uninjected contralateral transgenic eyes (10 months of age) showed an IOP of 16.5 [15.9, 17.1] mmHg, which was intermediate between the IOP levels of the 6- to 7-month-old Tg group (15.4 [14.7, 16.1] mmHg) and the sham-injected group (16.9 [15.5, 18.2] mmHg). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Of note, contralateral hypertension has been previously reported after subconjunctival and periocular injection of dexamethasone-loaded nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>), and we similarly cannot definitively rule out potential contralateral effects induced by our stem cell injections. Thus, we cannot draw any definite conclusions from these additional IOP comparisons at this time.</p><p>Our measured IOPs were close to ‘expected IOPs’ calculated from facility measurements, strongly suggesting that the majority of the IOP-lowering effect after hAMSC delivery was due to an improvement in the function of the conventional outflow pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>There was a slight offset between measured and expected IOPs</title><p>Despite the very close correlation between measured and expected IOPs noted above, there was a small but consistent offset between these two quantities, which may be due to several factors. First, cell delivery could theoretically cause a decrease in the rate of AH formation or an increase in the rate of uveoscleral outflow, which would lower experimentally measured IOP. However, according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, a change in the pressure-independent flow rate (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft26">\begin{document}$Q$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) would disproportionately affect the IOP in groups with lower facility. For example, if we conservatively assume that the 1.2 mmHg average residual (experimental IOP – expected IOP) was caused by a difference in inflow rate for transgenic animals vs. WT animals, which we used as the reference for calculating inflow rate (see Materials and methods), the 95% confidence interval on the mean of the residuals would have been ~5 times larger than what we actually calculated. The second possible explanation is that the mismatch was caused by an error in rebound tonometry, e.g., due to tonometer miscalibration or an anesthesia-induced drop in IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). However, if we assume that all groups, including WT animals, had an experimentally measured IOP that was artifactually lower than true IOP, the pressure-independent flow rate (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft27">\begin{document}$Q$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) calculated for WT animals would incorporate this effect. Thus, when this <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft28">\begin{document}$Q$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> is used to calculate expected IOPs for groups other than WT animals, there should not be an offset between the experimental and expected IOPs, at least for groups with facilities similar to WT animals. We therefore suggest that the most plausible explanation is an inherent difference between the transgenic and WT animals, such as in the biomechanical properties of the cornea (leading to an error in the IOP read by the tonometer), in the episcleral venous pressure, or in the amount of IOP reduction due to anesthesia.</p><p>Despite some uncertainty about the minor offset between the expected and measured IOPs, the data strongly suggests that the IOP lowering caused by stem cell therapy is largely due to a restoration of function to the conventional outflow pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>hAMSC treatment led to increased TM cellularity and reduced BMM</title><p>One of the hallmarks of POAG is loss of TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref>), which was an early motivation for TM cell therapy as a potential treatment for this disease. We found that hAMSC delivery led to a striking 2.2-fold increase in TM cellularity 3–4 weeks after treatment vs. saline-injected controls, which showed cellularities similar to eyes from WT mice. This increased cellularity declined somewhat by 3–4 months after cell injection but then stabilized for up to 9 months after injection. Additionally, the increase in cellularity was strongly correlated with a decrease in IOP for pooled data from all the experimental groups. This correlation more directly highlights the potential of TM cell therapy in treating ocular hypertension, where TM cellularity is reduced and IOP is elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref> showed that humans at birth have ~2.3-fold higher TM cellularity compared to a 40-year-old individual, and that this cellularity reduces sharply within the first 5 years of life. This trend in human eye cellularity resembles, both qualitatively and quantitatively, our observations after hAMSC treatment when the ~27 months’ average lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graber et al., 2013</xref>) of the mouse is taken into account. Further studies of factors controlling TM cellularity after hAMSC delivery are indicated but lie beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>Another feature of POAG is an accumulation of ECM within the juxtacanalicular tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchshofer et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanism(s) underlying this ECM accumulation are not entirely understood. Nevertheless, increased levels of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) in the AH of POAG patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tripathi et al., 1994</xref>) and its role in decreasing the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) suggest that the abnormal ECM deposits may be due to decreased ECM turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchshofer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tamm and Fuchshofer, 2007</xref>). Thus, after detecting the significant increase in TM cellularity and reduction in IOP using hAMSCs, we wondered whether transplanted cells would also affect ECM levels in the TM. Our quantification showed that this was indeed the case: hAMSC-transplanted eyes at the mid-term time point had 35% less BMM under the IW of Schlemm’s canal than in saline-injected control eyes. This finding is consistent with the general theme of TM functional restoration seen throughout this study. A future study to analyze the levels of TGF-β2 in the AH, as well as the ratio of active to pro-form levels of MMPs in hAMSC-transplanted eyes, would be of interest to better understand the mechanism through which exogenous cells modulate ECM turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison with previous work</title><p>Unfortunately, it is not feasible to directly compare the results of this study with those of previous studies that have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of nonmagnetic cell therapy in MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). This is due to the unexpected lack of a POAG phenotype in our transgenic mice (discussed in detail below). Yet in our study, we found a stable IOP lowering and increase in outflow facility over 9 months (corresponding to one-third of the animals’ lifespan), which for the first time attests to the possible longevity of IOP lowering due to TM cell therapy. In addition, because of the targeted nature of our delivery technique, we could achieve these reported therapeutic outcomes by injecting a total of only ~1500 cells, which is significantly lower, i.e., more efficient, than the 50,000 cells used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One literature comparison that can be made is for the BMM normalized length. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2021</xref> reported values of 0.40 [0.23, 0.57] for this quantity in naïve eyes and 0.50 [0.38, 0.60] for sham-injected (PBS containing nonconjugated polymeric nanoparticles) eyes in 2- to 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Overby et al., 2014</xref> measured a BMM normalized length of 0.29 [0.16, 0.42] in 6- to 7-month-old mice from the same strain. Despite our sham mid-term group being 9–11 months of age and being on a transgenic background, with no phenotypic manifestation, the 0.52 [0.34, 0.70] BMM normalized length we measured for this group is consistent with those previously reported values. The fact that we observed reduced BMM length in cell-treated eyes vs. control values may suggest that a homeostatic balance in cell-treated eyes was tipped toward the presence of less BMM, consistent with hypotensive IOP measurements and greater outflow facility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>hAMSCs outperformed iPSC-TMs</title><p>This study for the first time compared the IOP-lowering performance of hAMSCs vs. iPSC-TMs – two of the most clinically relevant cell types for future TM cell therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulon et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the performance of iPSC-TMs was significantly inferior to that of hAMSCs, as quantified by several outcome measures; most notably, the IOP reduction after iPSC-TM cell delivery was only half that seen after hAMSC delivery. The beneficial effect of iPSC-TM treatment on TM cellularity was also significantly lower than hAMSC at the short-term time point (1.4-fold vs. 2.2-fold increase), although this difference declined at the mid-term time point (1.4-fold vs. 1.6-fold increase). In addition to their IOP-reducing efficacy, another major drawback of the iPSC-TMs was the high incidence of ocular tumorigenicity. More than 60% of the eyes injected with iPSC-TM cells developed tumors, requiring termination of the experiment. A body of previous literature, including a systematic review of 1000 clinical trials involving mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, finds no incidence of tumorigenicity in tissues receiving mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting an intrinsic resistance to tumor formation once positioned in the correct niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lalu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodríguez-Fuentes et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, tumorigenicity remains a concern for iPSC derivatives due to transfection with oncogenic factors, genetic aberrations during in vitro cultures, and contamination of transplants with undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neri, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lamm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamanaka, 2020</xref>). Despite following a protocol to isolate differentiated iPSC-TM cells, including using a non-integrating viral vector for transfection of reprogramming factors and a commonly used magnetic activated cell sorting approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamanaka, 2020</xref>), there unfortunately remains a chance for contamination and reprogramming of these cells posttransplantation. Interestingly, the iris is reported to be a favorable location for organ culture and tumor formation, with fivefold faster growth compared to subcutaneous injection, and thus has previously been considered for tumorigenicity safety studies, emphasizing the importance of rigorous iPSC processing in any future treatments involving iPSC-TM cell injection into the anterior chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olson and Seiger, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inagaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boone and DuPree, 1968</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cell retention profiles differed between the two cell types</title><p>Both cell types were detectable in the anterior chamber 3 weeks after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), with iPSC-TM cells tending to better integrate with the TM tissue, whereas the hAMSCs mostly accumulated close to, but not within, the TM. This phenomenon, which was consistently observed, may be due to the widely reported aggregation of mesenchymal stem cells immediately posttransplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burand et al., 2020</xref>), which consequently prevented them from entering the deeper aspects of the TM, characterized by narrow flow channels. Note that the exogenous iPSC-TMs more directly contributed to increasing TM cellularity than did the hAMSCs due to the better integration of iPSC-TM cells into the TM. This finding complicates the interpretation of the relationship between increased TM cellularity and IOP reduction. In addition, loss of signal in long-term in vivo fluorescent cell tracking is inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Progatzky et al., 2013</xref>), so the fluorescent signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> may not be marking all the exogenous cells retained in the anterior eye.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>A likely role for paracrine signaling underlying TM cell therapy</title><p>The lack of specific hAMSC homing into the TM also provides important insight about the putative mechanism(s) by which these cells lowered IOP and improved AH dynamics. Several hypotheses address how injected cells may affect TM functional restoration: exogenous cells can either integrate with the TM and differentiate into TM-like cells, or can promote endogenous TM cell proliferation through direct contact or through their secretome. Du and colleagues, in two studies using mice, showed that TMSCs that reach the TM co-express AQP1 and CHI3L1, indicative of their differentiation into TM cells, although quantification was not performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref> reported a 114% increase in TM cellularity after iPSC-TM injection in MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice compared to saline-injected controls, yet TM-residing exogenous cells accounted for only 23% of this increase. This finding is consistent with several studies that report the proliferative effect of exogenous cells on the TM in terms of higher Ki-67 expression and BrdU signal, as well as an increased prevalence of Nestin+ progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). How this proliferation is mediated, however, is a matter of controversy. In two studies, Zhu et al. showed that iPSC-TMs induce significant proliferation of both cells from the TM5 cell line (an immortalized TM cell line) or primary TM cells carrying Ad5RSV-myocilinY437H when in co-culture, yet did not when they were co-cultured in the presence of a physical (membrane) separation between iPSC-TMs and TM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiong et al., 2021</xref> conducted similar experiments with TMSCs and MyocY437H primary TM cells and observed no proliferative effect with or without contact between the cells. On the contrary, two studies have reported the beneficial effect of injecting conditioned media from bone marrow MSCs in hypertensive rat eyes, including a significant reduction in IOP, neuroprotection, and elevated proliferation markers in the TM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manuguerra-Gagné et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roubeix et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, the significant lowering of IOP seen after the delivery of hAMSCs and their accumulation near, but not within, the TM supports the notion that injected cells act upon the TM through their secretome. Thus, a proteomic comparison of the secretome of hAMSCs and iPSC-TMs may provide significant insight into their paracrine effect on TM functional restoration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation of this study was the lack of a POAG phenotype in our transgenic mouse colony. Even though MYOC<sup>Y437H</sup> mice have previously been shown to exhibit an elevation in IOP and a decrease in both outflow facility and TM cellularity, our colony did not show any difference in those parameters compared to WT animals. While we are not certain of the cause, one possibility is that our IOP measurements were inaccurate. However, this is unlikely because of the correlation between measured IOP and outflow facility in cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and the fact that IOPs in our WT animals lay within previously reported ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Overby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2014</xref>). It should be noted that reported IOPs for anesthetized WT C57BL/6 mice vary depending on the measurement method used, with a lower bound of ~12.5 mmHg under deep levels of injection-induced anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">John et al., 1997</xref>) and an upper bound of ~20 mmHg under gas-induced extra light anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2021</xref>), with values close to our measurements being frequent in the literature. An alternative, and perhaps more likely, possibility is that the transgene was silenced in the original breeders of this colony. Unfortunately, this only became evident after the 6–7 months’ wait time required for the expected onset of the phenotype. Despite the strong effectiveness of our novel TM cell therapy technique (even in the absence of ocular hypertension), the main concern is whether cell therapy would work as effectively in a glaucomatous eye. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raghunathan et al., 2018</xref> showed that when healthy TM cells are cultured on the ECM derived from glaucomatous TM cells, the healthy cells experience differential stiffening and altered expression profiles similar to the glaucomatous phenotype. Therefore, a glaucomatous ECM may negatively impact the exogenous cells and curtail their therapeutic potential. Fortunately, since in our study, hAMSCs did not seem to need to integrate into the TM to lower IOP, they may also not be affected by glaucomatous changes in the TM. Additionally, Goldmann’s equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) shows that the same percentage increase in outflow facility produces a greater magnitude of IOP lowering in a hypertensive eye vs. in a normotensive eye. Therefore, evaluation of magnetically steered hAMSC cell therapy in an alternative preclinical glaucoma model is indicated.</p><p>An additional limitation is that, since histology was only performed on a subset of the eyes after outflow facility measurements, it is possible that there may also have been undetected tumors in the iPSC-injected eyes reported in the IOP and outflow facility plots. This could affect the reported efficacy of the iPSC-TM cells, and further experiments comparing hADMSCs to more carefully processed iPSC-TM cells may be worthwhile.</p><p>In summary, this work shows the effectiveness of our novel magnetic TM cell therapy approach for long-term IOP reduction through functional changes in the conventional outflow pathway. The comparison between hAMSCs and iPSC-TM cells strongly suggested the inferiority of the latter cell type in this treatment paradigm, as judged by tumorigenicity and less effective IOP lowering. The localization of injected hAMSCs deep in the iridocorneal angle, but not full integration into the TM, supports the hypothesis that exogenous cells promote TM functional restoration through paracrine signaling. Therefore, even though the mouse model used in this study did not show a POAG phenotype, this treatment approach merits further study with the eventual goal of clinical translation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We conducted experiments in several cohorts of mice, as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1"><list-item><p>WT: wild-type hybrid mice (naïve controls)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tg: Tg-MYOCY437H mice, a model of POAG (see details below)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sham: Tg mice receiving PBS (injection controls)</p></list-item><list-item><p>hAMSC: Tg mice receiving magnetically steered hAMSCs</p></list-item><list-item><p>iPSC-TM: Tg mice receiving magnetically steered iPSC-TMs</p></list-item></list><p>Our key outcome measures were IOP, outflow facility, TM cellularity, cell retention in the anterior segment, and ultrastructural analysis of TM ECM, with timelines as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

This is because, in our experience (data not shown), the tracer’s signal was only faintly present 2 months after injection in vivo, while signal was maintained for a longer period in vitro, as advertised by the manufacturer. We are unsure whether this loss of signal was caused by a loss of cell integrity or by fluorescence fading in vivo. Further, due to the high incidence of tumorigenicity and inferior overall effectiveness in animals receiving iPSC-TM cells, long-term measurements, as well as ultrastructural analysis, were not pursued for this group. We chose to perform ultrastructural analysis for the hAMSC group at the mid-term time point, as this is the longest time point previously studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) and enables comparison with previous work.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell preparation</title><p>hAMSCs were purchased commercially (Lonza Bioscience, Walkersville, MD, USA) and were prepared for injection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrani Fard et al., 2023</xref>).

Cells were then trypsinized, resuspended by the addition of cell culture media, and placed in a 1.5 ml microtube.

After 3 min at room temperature, an equal volume of FBS was added to the cell solution to stop the reaction, and cells were washed three times with the cell culture media to remove any unbound dye. For all the experiments where animals received hAMSC, cell count and &gt;90% viability were verified using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

The pluripotency of reprogrammed iPSCs was confirmed using RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and teratoma formation. iPSCs were then differentiated by culturing in conditioned media from primary human TM (phTM) cells. To prepare this conditioned media, phTM cells were extracted from donor eyes and cultured in α-MEM supplemented by 10% inactivated FBS and 2% primocin. Conditioned media was then collected from the cells and sterilized by passing through a 0.2 µm membrane filter. The iPSCs were maintained in conditioned media for 8 weeks to induce differentiation. It is important to remove any undifferentiated iPSCs from the iPSC-TM populations due to the risk of tumorigenicity associated with pluripotent stem cells. Therefore, the iPSC-TMs were incubated with CD15 antibodies (Miltneyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) conjugated with magnetic microbeads to label the undifferentiated iPSCs.

The resulting needle had a pointed tip and an outer diameter of approximately 100 µm. Cell adhesion to the needle walls in the lumen can cause inconsistent cell delivery to the eye; thus, we plasma-cleaned the needles, coated them with trichlorosilane, and loaded them with 0.02% Pluronic F-127 (P2443, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by vigorously rinsing with PBS.

These quadrants received sequential 15 min treatments in 15% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 30% sucrose, and a 1:1 solution of 30% sucrose and optimal cutting temperature (OCT) media. After embedding in OCT, samples were floated in a 100% ethanol bath cooled by dry ice to flash-freeze. 10-µm-thick sagittal sections were cut using a CryoStar NX70 cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and placed on Superfrost Plus gold slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In an additional step, specific to TM cellularity quantification, the samples were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and stained with DAPI (NucBlue Fixed Cell DAPI, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) for 15 min followed by coverslipping with antifade media (ProLong Gold Antifade medium, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Sagittal sections were then imaged as tilescans.</p><p>To quantify TM cellularity, ideally all the cells in the TM should be counted. However, due to the partial or complete collapse of Schlemm’s canal and the small separation between the TM and the iris in the murine iridocorneal angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2019</xref>), identifying the boundaries of the TM can be challenging. Thus, to minimize error, we instead counted the DAPI-stained nuclei in the region that we could identify as the TM with a high confidence and normalized this count by the length of the IW of Schlemm’s canal adjacent to this segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that morphological characteristics such as the autofluorescence in the corneoscleral shell, high degree of pigmentation in the iris, as well as the change in the density and orientation of the cells transitioning from the TM to iris helped with locating the TM cell nuclei.</p><p>Eyes of animals injected with iPSC-TMs showing anatomical signs of tumor growth were enucleated and immersion fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological studies. Three of these eyes were randomly chosen, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 5-µm-thick sagittal sections were cut using a microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Three additional eyes from the hAMSC long-term group underwent the same procedure for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of ECM underlying the IW of SC</title><p>The amount of BMM in the hAMSC mid-term experimental group and in corresponding injection control eyes (four eyes in each cohort) was quantified using electron micrographs, using an approach similar to that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Overby et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the two anterior segment quadrants not used for TM cell counting (described above) were immersion fixed overnight at 4°C in universal fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% paraformaldehyde in Sörensen’s buffer). The specimens were next embedded in Epon resin, and 65 nm sagittal sections were cut through iridocorneal tissues using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6, A-1170; Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH) followed by staining with uranyl acetate/lead citrate. Sagittal sections were examined with a JEM-1400 electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA, USA) at ×8000 magnification. At least one section per quadrant was included in the quantification of BMM deposits as described below.</p><p>The lengths of BMM segments directly in contact with the IW of Schlemm’s canal and the total length of IW were measured from electron micrographs using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) by two independent annotators in a masked fashion. To enhance BMM identification from micrographs, we first adjusted the contrast for each image, using an ImageJ macro that assigned a brightness level of 255 to a manually selected region of the lumen of SC and a brightness level of zero to a manually selected region of a cell nucleus. The ratio of the length of BMM segments directly underlying the IW to the total length of IW was calculated for each segment, representing the extent of non-fenestrated BMM material underlying the IW. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> exhibits an example of the demarcations. Note that ECM deposits clearly separated from the IW were not considered as BMM deposits.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>IOP, outflow facility, and TM cellularity index were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test for each treatment group. Since the outflow facility is known to be log-normally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sherwood et al., 2016</xref>), facility data was first log-transformed prior to conducting any statistical tests. All outcome measures, except for TM cellularity and normalized BMM length, were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. For TM cellularity and BMM length, we used a linear mixed-effects model, treating the experimental group as the fixed effect while considering the eyes, various sections of each eye, and annotators (for BMM only) as replicates, i.e., as random effects. Following these analyses, we conducted post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction. However, we limited our comparisons to those chosen a priori to be relevant to the interpretation of our study to avoid an overly conservative adjustment of critical p-values as required by Bonferroni correction. To compare the impact of different treatments on IOP and outflow facility, we computed the difference between the treatment groups and their respective injection controls. Subsequently, we conducted two-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Given the log-transformation of facility data, the subtracted values became ratios upon inverse transformation. To check for consistency between IOP and outflow facility measurements, we calculated residuals as the difference between the expected and experimentally measured IOPs. A two-tailed t-test was then performed on these residuals with <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mi>µ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft41">\begin{document}$H_{0}\colon \Micro =0$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>. Pearson’s correlation test was used to measure the relation between TM cellular density and IOP. All analyses were done using MATLAB (v2020, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). A significance level of 5% was employed for all tests, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Cryosections from the eyes, which were sampled for cell retention studies, were rehydrated for 30 min. Subsequently, the sections were covered with the 10% potassium ferrocyanide solution for 5 min, followed by a 15 min treatment with the Prussian blue solution. After treatment, the sections were rinsed three times in distilled water, dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and then mounted for imaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>SPIONs co-located with exogenous cells posttransplantation</title><p>A major concern regarding the use of SPIONs for cell encapsulation is dose-dependent toxicity, which could damage both the transplanted cells and native tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sadeghiani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stroh et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore visualized the SPIONs using Prussian blue staining anterior segment sagittal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Unfortunately, this dark blue stain proved barely discernible from pigment. Detectable labeling could mostly be found at comparable locations within the AC as in hAMSC-injected eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), where both the cells and SPIONs accumulated in the vicinity of TM, and in iPSC-TM-injected eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), with the cells and SPIONs found within the TM.

Top row: No Prussian blue staining could be found in the saline injection control. Middle row: Prussian blue stain is challenging to distinguish from melanin, but accumulation of blue label (red arrowheads) can be seen to coincide with the locations of exogenous cells visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In particular, injected human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) primarily accumulated close to the trabecular meshwork (TM), corresponding to the location of Prussian blue stain. A small region of Prussian blue staining can be observed in the TM (green arrowhead). Bottom row: Similarly, in eyes receiving induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TMs), most of the Prussian blue staining was found within the TM, corresponding to the location of injected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Unfortunately, the fluorescent signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was significantly attenuated after Prussian blue staining and could not be overlaid on these images to assist with interpretation. Iris degradation, notable in the middle row, is an undesirable artifact of the cryosectioning or staining process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103256-app1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>SPIONs did not accumulate within the native tissues of the AC</title><p>Iron oxide-induced toxicity, as both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, is a major concern when using SPIONs in cell encapsulation and transplantation. In vitro studies have reported that SPION labeling is generally safe at concentrations below 100 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). Since we used a fourfold lower concentration for cell labeling in this study, the encapsulated cells were likely unaffected.</p><p>Once inside the AC, the SPIONs may be released from the injected cells. The TM, as the phagocytic and filtering component of the main AH outflow pathway, is a likely destination. Our Prussian blue staining to visualize SPIONs in the AC after delivery was masked by pigmentation and was hard to visualize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The SPIONs that we could detect were mostly co-located with the transplanted cells and were likely not released at a significant rate within the AC. In the case of iPSC-TM cells, which showed good integration with the TM, detectable SPIONs were also primarily found within the TM. Whether these SPIONs had been released from the injected cells or were still encapsulated remains unknown. Nevertheless, the significant increase in TM cellularity discussed above indicates that the accumulation of SPIONs within the TM is unlikely to have any toxic effect on native tissues.</p></sec></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Detailed analysis of IOP measurements</title><table-wrap id="app2table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—table 1.</label><caption><title>Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements for select groups, shown as means and [95% confidence intervals] similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</title><p>Tg Mid: Untreated eyes, either contralateral to sham mid-term or human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hAMSC) mid-term eyes (n=23).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="background-color: #90CAF9;">Group</th><th style="background-color: #90CAF9;">IOP (mmHg)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15.6 [14.8,16.3]</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">Tg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15.4 [14.7,16.1]</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">Tg Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16.5 [15.9,17.1]</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">Sham Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16.9 [15.5,18.2]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="app2table2" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—table 2.</label><caption><title>Result of multiple comparison for the groups listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>.</title><p>None of the comparisons reached statistical significance.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">Compared groups</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td colspan="2" style="background-color: #90CAF9;">vs.</td><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">p-Value<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="app2table2fn1">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">1</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.3579</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">2</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0680</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">3</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sham Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0491</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">4</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">Tg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0278</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">5</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">Tg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sham Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.0311</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: #90CAF9;">6</td><td style="background-color: #E6E6E6;">Tg Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sham Mid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.5148</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="app2table2fn1"><label>*</label><p>Post hoc comparisons were performed after ANOVA.

Dr. Zode also stated that he was uncertain of the reason for this loss of phenotype. His observation is consistent with our report. However, other investigators continue to observe the desired phenotype in their colonies of this mouse (Dr. Wei Zhu, personal communication). Continued use of this mouse model should therefore be approached with caution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This observational study investigates the efficacy of intracameral injected human stem cells as a means to re-functionalize the trabecular meshwork for the restoration of intraocular pressure homeostasis. Using a murine model of glaucoma, human adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells are shown to be biologically safer and functionally superior at eliciting a sustained reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). The authors conclude that the use of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells has the potential for long-term treatment of ocular hypertension in glaucoma.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A noted strength is the use of a magnetic steering technique to direct injected stem cells to the iridocorneal angle. An additional strength is the comparison of efficacy between two distinct sources of stem cells: human adipose-derived mesenchymal vs. induced pluripotent cell derivatives. Utilizing both in vivo and ex vivo methodology coupled with histological evidence of introduced stem cell localization provides a consistent and compelling argument for a sustainable impact exogenous stem cells may have on the refunctionalization of a pathologically compromised TM.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A noted weakness of the study, as pointed out by the authors, includes the unanticipated failure of the genetic model to develop glaucoma-related pathology (elevated IOP, TM cell changes). While this is most unfortunate, it does temper the conclusion that exogenous human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells may restore TM cell function. Given that TM cell function was not altered in their genetic model, it is difficult to say with any certainty that the introduced stem cells would be capable of restoring pathologically altered TM function. A restoration effect remains to be seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the phrase “restoration of TM function” is not fully supported by our results, given the absence of ocular hypertension in our animal model. Accordingly, we have revised the language to more precisely describe our findings. For specific details regarding these changes, please refer to our response to Reviewer 1’s public comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another noted complication to these findings is the observation that sham intracameralinjected saline control animals all showed elevated IOP and reduced outflow facility, compared to WT or Tg untreated animals, which allowed for more robust statistically significant outcomes. Additional comments/concerns that the authors may wish to address are elaborated in the Private Review section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that sham-injected animals tended to have higher average IOPs than transgenic animals in our study. However, these differences did not reach statistical significance and therefore remain inconclusive. Further, an increase in IOP following placebo injection has been previously reported (Zhu et al., 2016).</p><p>Prompted by the Referee’s comments and also a private comment from Referee 1, we further investigated this effect by analyzing IOP in uninjected contralateral eyes at the mid-term time point and comparing the IOPs in these eyes to other cohorts, as now presented as additional data in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figure 4 (see below). In brief, the uninjected contralateral transgenic eyes (10 months old) showed an IOP of 16.5 [15.9, 17.1] mmHg, which was intermediate between the IOP levels of the 6–7-month-old Tg group (15.4 [14.7, 16.1] mmHg) and the sham group (16.9 [15.5, 18.2] mmHg). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Additionally, we cannot rule out potential contralateral effects induced by the injections.</p><p>Regarding the best way to assess the effect of cell treatment, we feel very strongly that the most relevant IOP comparison is between cell-injected eyes and control (vehicle)-injected eyes, since this provides the most direct accounting for the effects of injection itself on IOP. Other comparisons, such as WT or untreated Tg eyes vs. cell-treated eyes, are interesting but harder to interpret. However, in response to the referee’s comment, we have added comparisons between cell-treated groups and untreated Tg eyes to Table 2, adjusting the post-hoc corrections accordingly. All hAMSC treated groups show statistically significant decrease in IOP even compared to Tg untreated eyes, while iPSC-TMs fail to reach such significance.</p><p>The following changes were made to the manuscript:</p><p>Lines 326 et seq.: Eyes subjected to saline injection exhibited marginally higher IOPs and lower outflow facilities on average, in comparison to the transgenic animals at baseline. However, due to the lack of statistical significance in these differences and the inherent age difference between the saline-injected animals and the non-injected controls at baseline, no conclusive inference can be drawn regarding the effect of saline injection. To investigate this phenomenon further, we also analyzed IOPs in uninjected contralateral eyes at the midterm time point (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Figure 4). The uninjected contralateral transgenic eyes (10 months old) showed an IOP of 16.5 [15.9, 17.1] mmHg, which was intermediate between the IOP levels of the 6–7-month-old Tg group (15.4 [14.7, 16.1] mmHg) and the sham-injected group (16.9 [15.5, 18.2] mmHg). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Of note, contralateral hypertension has been previously reported after subconjunctival and periocular injection of dexamethasoneloaded nanoparticles (34), and we similarly cannot definitively rule out potential contralateral effects induced by our stem cell injections. Thus, we cannot draw any definite conclusions from these additional IOP comparisons at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The purpose of the current manuscript was to investigate a magnetic cell steering technique for efficiency and tissue-specific targeting, using two types of stem cells, in a mouse model of glaucoma. As the authors point out, trabecular meshwork (TM) cell therapy is an active area of research for treating elevated intraocular pressure as observed in glaucoma. Thus, further studies determining the ideal cell choice for TM cell therapy is warranted. The experimental protocol of the manuscript involved the injection of either human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) or induced pluripotent cell derivatives (iPSC-TM cells) into a previously reported mouse glaucoma model, the transgenic MYOCY437H mice and wild-type littermates followed by the magnetic cell steering. Numerous outcome measures were assessed and quantified including IOP, outflow facility, TM cellularity, retention of stem cells, and the inner wall BM of Schlemm's canal.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>All of these analyses were carefully carried out and appropriate statistical methods were employed. The study has clearly shown that the hAMSCs are the cells of choice over the iPSC-TM cells, the latter of which caused tumors in the anterior chamber. The hAMSCs were shown to be retained in the anterior segment over time and this resulted in increased cellular density in the TM region and a reduction in IOP and outflow facility. These are all interesting findings and there is substantial data to support it.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, where the study falls short is in the MYOCY437H mouse model of glaucoma that was employed. The authors clearly state that a major limitation of the study is that this model, in their hands, did not exhibit glaucomatous features as previously reported, such as a significant increase in IOP, which was part of the overall purpose of the study. The authors state that it is possible that &quot;the transgene was silenced in the original breeders&quot;. The authors did not show PCR, western blot, or immuno of angle tissue of the tg to determine transgenic expression (increased expression of MYOC was shown in the angle tissue of the transgenics in the original paper by Zode et al, 2011). This should be investigated given that these mice were rederived. Thus, it is clearly possible that these are not transgenic mice.</p></disp-quote><p>All MYOC mice that were used in this study were genotyped and confirmed to carry the transgene as noted in the original version of the paper (see lines 590-2). However, the transgene seems not to have been active, based on the lack of ocular hypertension as well as the lack of differences in supporting endpoints such as outflow facility and TM cellularity. While it would have been possible to carry out their recommended assays to investigate the root cause of this loss of phenotype this was not an objective of our study. Thus we instead here focus simply on communicating the observed loss of phenotype to readers. We also refer the referee to the final paragraph of our response to Referee 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If indeed they are transgenics, the authors may want to consider the fact that in the Zode paper, the most significant IOP elevation in the mutant mice was observed at night and thus this could be examined by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. However, while the dark-phase IOP does exhibit a distinctly larger elevation (as previously observed in hypertonic saline sclerosis), Zode et al. also reported a notable 3 mmHg IOP increase during the light phase. The complete absence of such daytime (light phase) IOP elevation in our animals diminished our enthusiasm for pursuing darkphase IOP measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other glaucomatous features of these mice could also have been investigated such as loss of RGCs, to further determine their transgenic phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these other phenotypes could be studied, but in the absence of any detectable IOP elevation (and thus lack of mechanical insult on RGC axons), loss of RGC is extremely unlikely. We also note that the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the Myocilin model remains a subject of controversy. For example, despite a significant increase in IOP (&gt;10 mmHg) in this model across four mouse strains, three, including C57BL6/J, did not exhibit any signs of optic nerve damage (McDowell et al., 2012). In contrast, Zhu et al. observed considerable nerve damage in this model, which was reversed following iPSC-TM cell transplantation (Zhu et al., 2016). Given these conflicting findings, we directed our efforts toward outcome measures directly related to aqueous humor dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, while increased cellular density in the TM region was observed, proliferative markers could be employed to determine if the transplanted cells are proliferating.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that identifying the source of the increased trabecular meshwork (TM) cellularity we observed is interesting and we plan to pursue that in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The sham-injected transgenic animals showed elevated IOP 3-4 weeks after the baseline measurements in the transgenic mice. The authors justify this may be due to the increase in age in these animals. However, this seems unlikely due to the short duration of time between measurement of the baseline IOP and the Short time point (3-4 weeks). The authors do not provide IOP data for any WT sham injected eyes or naïve Tg eyes at these time points. These data are essential to determine if the elevation is due to the sham injection, age, or the transgene. Could it be that the IOP in this cohort of Tg mice didn't increase until 7-8 months of age instead of 6-7 months of age? The methods state only unilateral injections of the stem cells were done so it is assumed the contralateral eye was uninjected. What was the IOP in these eyes? These data would clarify the confusion in the data from sham-injected animals compared to baseline (naive) measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the average IOP in saline-injected groups is higher than in WT or non-treated Tg mice, although the difference is inconclusive due to a lack of statistical significance. It is important to note, however, that this difference is subtle and not comparable to the 3 mmHg light-phase IOP elevation previously observed in this model (Zode et al., 2011).</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include IOP data from the contralateral uninjected eyes, and we have now provided this information along with the comparative statistics in the supplementary materials. Additional details can be found in our response to a similar comment from Reviewer 2’s public review. In summary, the IOP difference in contralateral non-injected ten-month-old transgenic eyes was even smaller than in the original Tg group. IOP elevation following saline injection in mice has been reported previously (Zhu et al., 2016). As a potential confounding factor, we highlight possible contralateral effects of the injection itself (which is why we initially did not analyze IOP in the contralateral eyes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The hAMSC-treated eyes appear to lower IOP even from baseline (although stats were only provided compared to the sham-injected eyes, which as stated above appear to have increased).</p><p>However, the iPSC-TM-treated eyes had IOPs equal to that of the baseline measurements taken 3 weeks prior. The significance is coming from the &quot;sham-treated&quot; eyes which had elevated IOPs. The controls listed above should be included to make these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an astute observation. Please refer to our response to a similar observation by Reviewer 2 under public reviews, where we provide and discuss the comparative statistics noted by the reviewer. However, we feel very strongly that the most relevant IOP comparison is between cell-injected eyes and control-injected eyes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the transgenic mouse model truly did not have a phenotype, then the authors are testing the ability of the stem cells to lower IOP from baseline normal pressures. Therefore, the authors are not &quot;restoring function of the conventional outflow pathway&quot; as there is no damage to begin with. The language in the manuscript should be corrected to reflect this if the transgenics have no phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have adjusted the language accordingly. For further details, please refer to our response to your public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors noted in the iPSC-TM-treated eyes there was a high rate of tumorigenicity.

Apparently, it took only a few mis-directed iPSC-TM cells to lead to tumors in this work, which is a serious concern for future translational approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It appears that mice were injected unilaterally (Line 590).

We added the following statement to the Materials and Methods section (line 530): After breeding and genotyping, mice, regardless of sex, were maintained to age 6-7 months, when transgenic animals were expected to have developed a POAG phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) As noted in the public review, the use of PBS for a control seems to have resulted in a slight elevation in IOP (Figure 2) as well as a reduction in outflow facility (Figure 3B) when compared to WT or Tg mice. Was this difference statistically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>The differences between the sham (saline)-injected groups at any time point and untreated Tg mice did not reach statistical significance for IOP, facility, or TM cellularity and for facility, did not even show clear trends. For example, WT mice had, on average, 0.2 mmHg higher IOP and 0.6 nl/min/mmHg greater facility than the Tg group. Meanwhile on a similar scale, the long-term sham group exhibited 0.4 nl/min/mmHg higher facility compared to the Tg group. As the statistical tests indicate, these differences should be interpreted more as noise than meaningful signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so, then it should be noted as to whether the observed decrease in IOP following stem cell injection remained statistically significant when compared to these un-injected control animals. If significance was lost, then this should be appropriately noted and discussed. It is not apparently obvious why sham controls should have elevated IOP. This is a design and statistical concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to a similar observation by Reviewer 1. We believe that comparing the treatment (cell suspension in saline) with its age-matched vehicle (saline) is the appropriate approach which maintains rigor by most directly accounting for the effects of injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The tonicity of the PBS used as a vehicle control was not stated and I did not see within the methods whether the stem cells were suspended using this same PBS vehicle. I assume isotonic phosphate buffered saline was used and that the stem cells were resuspended using the same sterile PBS.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for catching this. We added “sterile PBS (1X, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)” to the Methods section of the manuscript (line 567).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to using PBS as an injection control, I wonder if a better comparable control might have been to use mesenchymal stem cells that were rendered incapable of proliferating prior to intracameral injection. This, of course, addresses the unexplained mechanism(s) by which mesenchymal stem cells elicit a decrease in IOP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea, and represents another level of control. However, we explicitly chose not to use non-proliferating hAMSCs as a control, for several reasons. Firstly, a saline injection is the simplest control and in this initial study with multiple groups, we did not feel another experimental group should be added. Second, this control would not rule out paracrine effects from injected cells, which our data suggested are an important effect. Third, rendering injected cells truly non-proliferative could introduce unwanted/unknown phenotypes in these cells that would need to be carefully characterized. That being said, if an efficient method could be developed to render an entire population of these cells irreversibly non-proliferating, the reviewer’s suggestion would be worth pursuing to better understand the mechanism of TM cell therapies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As noted in Figure 4C, TM cellular density as quantified was not altered in the sham control, so a loss of cellular density can not explain the elevated IOP with this group. Injecting viable (not determined?) mesenchymal stem cells did show, over the short term, a noted increase in TM cellular density.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. We agree that changes in cell density do not explain the mild IOP elevation in the sham group. As the referee certainly is aware, there are multiple reasons that IOP can be elevated (changes in trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix, changes in trabecular meshwork stiffness) that are not necessarily related to cell density. Since we do not know definitively the cause of this mild elevation, we would prefer to not speculate about it in the manuscript.</p><p>Thanks for pointing out our omission of a statement about injected cell viability. We have now included the following statement in the Materials and Methods section (564-566): “For all the experiments where animals received hAMSC, cell count and &gt;90% viability was verified using a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm confused, as clearly stated (Lines 431-432), mesenchymal stem cells accumulated close to, but not within, the TM. How is it that TM cellular density increased if these stem cells did not enter the TM? The authors may wish to clarify this distinction. Given that mesenchymal stem cells did not increase the risk of tumorigenicity, do the authors have any evidence that these cells actually proliferated post-injection or did they undergo senesce thereby displaying senescence-associated secretory phenotype as a source of paracrine support?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly noted, our observations show that hAMSCs primarily accumulated close to, but outside, the TM (likely caught up in the pectinate ligaments). Based on observations of increased TM cellularity, we think that the most likely explanation of these findings is paracrine signaling, as the reviewer suggests and which was discussed at length in the original version of the manuscript (lines 453-477).</p><p>We agree that, despite observing little signal from hAMSCs within the TM, labeling with proliferation markers (e.g., Ki-67) and searching for co-localization with exogenous cells, and/or labeling for senescence markers would have provided more mechanistic information. This is an excellent topic for future study, which we plan to pursue, but was outside the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) As noted in the public review, I think it is a bit of a stretch to even suggest that the findings of this study support stem cell restoration of TM function given that the model apparently did not produce TM cell dysfunction as anticipated. A restoration effect remains to be seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have adjusted the language accordingly.
