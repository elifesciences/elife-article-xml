These parasites need a molecule called haem to grow properly and are mostly spread by insects that feed on the blood of mammals. Most haem in mammals is found in red blood cells and is bound to a protein called haemoglobin. When it is released from these cells, haemoglobin forms a complex with another protein called haptoglobin as well.</p><p>The best-studied trypanosomes from Africa have a receptor protein on their surface that recognizes the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex and allows the parasites to obtain haem from their hosts. An African trypanosome called <italic>T. brucei</italic> causes sleeping sickness in humans, and has a receptor that can only recognize haemoglobin when it is in complex with haptoglobin. However, few trypanosome receptors have been studied to date, and so it was not clear if they all work in the same way.</p><p><italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> is a trypanosome that has a big impact on livestock farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and infects cattle, pigs and goats. Lane-Serff, MacGregor et al. now report that the receptor protein from <italic>T. congolense</italic> can bind to haemoglobin on its own. A technique called X-ray crystallography was used to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor and haemoglobin in fine detail. Further experiments then confirmed that the receptor actually binds more strongly to haemoglobin than it does to the haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex.</p><p>Experiments with living parasites showed that <italic>T. congolense</italic> produces its receptor when it is in the mouthparts of its insect host, the tsetse fly. This is unlike what occurs in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, which only produces its receptor while it is in the bloodstream of its mammalian host. Lane-Serff, MacGregor et al. suggest that <italic>T. congolense</italic>’s receptor is more like the receptor found in ancestor of the trypanosomes. This means that, at least once during the evolution of these parasites, this receptor evolved from being a haemoglobin receptor produced in the tsetse fly to a haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor produced in an infected mammal.</p><p>The next step is to investigate the details of the role played by the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor when the parasite is in the tsetse fly. It will also be important to understand how this parasite is still able to grow in the mammalian host’s bloodstream even though it does not produce much of the receptor during this stage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13044.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13044.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>trypanosome</kwd><kwd>congolense</kwd><kwd>brucei</kwd><kwd>haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101020/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane-Serff</surname><given-names>Harriet</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L008246/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGregor</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Macleod</surname><given-names>Olivia JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M008924/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ligand specificity and expression profile of the haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor has diversified throughout the evolution of trypanosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection of livestock by African trypanosomes has a significant effect on food production in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast to human disease, which is caused by a restricted set of subspecies of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laveran, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pays and Vanhollebeke, 2009</xref>), livestock disease is caused by at least six distinct species of African trypanosome, the most prevalent being <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>). While all share some common features, including antigenic variation and transmission by the tsetse fly, one of the most obvious differences between species is variation in the developmental cycle in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoare, 1972</xref>) and in particular the location of the epimastigote developmental stage. <italic>T. brucei</italic> epimastigotes attach to the epithelium in the salivary glands away from the digestive tract, whereas <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> attach in the proboscis within the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoare, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peacock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jefferies et al., 1987</xref>). The basis for these different tissue tropisms is not known.</p><p>The cell surface of an African trypanosome acts as the molecular interface with its host, and the developmental transitions of the life cycle involve radical changes in cell surface composition, presumably as adaptations to different host niches. The best understood stage is the mammalian bloodstream form where the cell surface is covered with a dense layer of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which acts to protect the plasma membrane, enhancing survival of individual cells and allowing antigenic variation to ensure population survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwede and Carrington, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horn, 2014</xref>). The density of packing of the VSG molecules on the surface of the bloodstream form trypanosome is thought to approach the maximum possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grünfelder et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the developmental stages found inside insects, including the procyclic and epimastigote forms, have less densely packed surface coats, and contain different sets of surface proteins, including GARP in <italic>T. congolense</italic> and procyclins and BARP in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayne et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roditi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urwyler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beecroft et al., 1993</xref>). Other cell surface proteins, including receptors and transporters, must operate in the context of these different cell surface architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stødkilde et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (TbHpHbR) is the best characterised trypanosome receptor. It is expressed in the mammalian bloodstream form and is used for the uptake of haptoglobin-haemoglobin complexes (HpHb) for haem acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). In humans and some other primates, TbHpHbR also plays a role in innate immunity. Human serum contains two complexes, trypanolytic factors-1 and -2 (TLF1 and TLF2), which cause trypanosome lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rifkin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hajduk et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomlinson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raper et al., 1996</xref>). TLF1 and TLF2 both contain the apolipoprotein L1 toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanhamme et al., 2003</xref>) and a complex of haemoglobin bound to haptoglobin-related protein (HprHb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raper et al., 1996</xref>). It is the binding of HprHb to TbHpHbR that provides the uptake route for TLF1 into the trypanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution structures of TbHpHbR, both alone and in complex with HpHb, have shown how it can function within the densely packed VSG layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stødkilde et al., 2014</xref>). The N-terminal domain of TbHpHbR is formed from an extended three α-helical bundle with a small, membrane-distal head, and is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidylinosotol-anchor at the C-terminus of a small C-terminal domain. HpHb binds along the membrane-distal half of the helical bundle. A striking feature of this helical bundle is a ~50° kink, which lies between the HpHb binding site and the membrane attachment point. This kink is likely to result in separation of the VSG molecules on either side of the receptor, holding them apart and presenting the HpHb binding site to the extracellular environment. It also allows two receptors to contact a single HpHb dimer, allowing greater avidity for the ligand and more efficient uptake into trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>). Specificity for HpHb results from direct, simultaneous contact between the receptor and both haptoglobin and the β-subunit of haemoglobin. Neither isolated haemoglobin nor haptoglobin binds significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the propionate chains of haem directly contact the receptor and contribute to binding, with a significant reduction in binding affinity for HpHb that lacks haem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stødkilde et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore TbHpHbR has evolved specific adaptations to function in the context of the VSG layer and to selectively bind to haem-loaded HpHb complexes.</p><p>The <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor (TcHpHbR) was identified by sequence homology to the receptor from <italic>T. brucei</italic> and also binds to HpHb with low micromolar affinity (a K<sub>D</sub> of 8 μM for TcHpHbR compared with 1 μM for TbHpHb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). Mutagenesis studies showed that TcHpHbR and TbHpHbR use overlapping binding sites to interact with HpHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of TcHpHbR has a similar architecture to TbHpHbR, with a long three α-helical bundle and small membrane-distal head. However, one striking difference is that the helical bundle of TcHpHbR lacks the kink found in TbHpHbR. With the kink suggested to play a critical role in the operation of TbHpHbR in the context of the VSG layer, it was surprising that TcHpHbR lacks this evolutionary adaption if it too operates in a similar, densely packed environment. For this reason, we set out to investigate the structure and function of the <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR, to understand its ligand binding specificity, its site of action and the evolutionary adaptations undergone by haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptors from different species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor has evolved from a haemoglobin receptor</title><p>To gain an understanding of ligand binding by TcHpHbR, we aimed to determine its structure in complex with HpHb. Human haemoglobin in complex with the SP domain of human haptoglobin (HpSP) was mixed with a small molar excess of TcHpHbR prior to gel filtration chromatography, in order to purify receptor-ligand complex. However, analysis of the resulting fractions from the chromatography column revealed a higher molecular weight peak containing TcHpHbR and Hb, but no HpSP. A lower molecular weight peak, at the elution volume expected for unliganded TcHpHbR, contained excess free TcHpHbR and HpSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore the presence of TcHpHbR led to disassembly of the HpSPHb complex and the formation of a complex containing TcHpHbR and Hb.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13044.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> HpHbRs are haemoglobin receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analytical gel filtration chromatography analysis showing the consequence of mixing HpSPHb and TcHpHbR. A mixture of TcHpHbR and HpSPHb was loaded onto the column, resulting in two peaks.

We therefore repeated the gel filtration experiment using native Hp in an HpHb complex. In this case, we found that the HpHb complex is not disassembled by incubation with the receptor, suggesting that the receptor does not disassemble native HpHb complexes during its physiological function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the complex that it forms with the receptor is not sufficiently strong to remain intact during gel filtration chromatography and HpHb and the receptor elute in separate peaks, confirming that the receptor has a low affinity for HpHb.</p><p>The discovery that TcHpHbR binds to Hb was unexpected as TbHpHbR had previously been shown to bind HpHb but not to free Hb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was therefore used to investigate the ligand specificity of HpHbRs from <italic>T. brucei, T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax.</italic> The receptors were immobilised on the chip surface through a C-terminal biotin moiety, causing them to be presented in the same orientation as on the cell surface. Binding was then measured for both Hb and HpHb. As expected, HpHbR from <italic>T. brucei</italic> interacted with HpHb, but not with Hb alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, HpHbRs from both <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> interacted with either HpHb or free Hb. Indeed, both receptors formed a far more stable complex with Hb than with HpHb, as shown by the lower off-rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition when Hb was mixed with TcHpHbR and subjected to gel filtration chromatography, the primary peak was a complex of TcHpHbR bound to Hb, indicating that TcHpHbR forms a more stable complex with Hb than with HpHb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>T. congolense</italic> is not a human infective pathogen, but is found in numerous livestock species. We therefore also tested the binding of TcHpHbR to bovine haemoglobin and observed a strong interaction with a slow off rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore TcHpHbR has a high affinity for Hb, while TbHpHbR does not bind to Hb alone. A similar change in specificity is seen in the mammalian scavenger receptor CD163, as mouse CD163 binds to Hb while human CD163 binds to HpHb alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etzerodt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As haemoglobin is a symmetrical tetramer of two α and two β subunits, each tetramer could potentially bind to two receptors and the SPR measurements described above would result from a mixture of monovalent and bivalent binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was therefore used to measure the monovalent K<sub>D</sub> and the stoichiometry of the interaction between TcHpHbR and Hb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This revealed that two receptors interact with one Hb tetramer. This follows the same pattern as the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex, where two receptors bind to each dimeric HpHb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stødkilde et al., 2014</xref>). The K<sub>D</sub> for the TcHpHbR:Hb interaction was estimated to be 3 nM by ITC. This is around 1000-fold tighter than the affinity of the same receptor for HpHb, previously measured by ITC to be 3 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> diverged from each other after their last common ancestor had diverged from <italic>T. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stevens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). As HpHbRs from both <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> bind to Hb, it is most likely that this property was lost from <italic>T. brucei</italic> after it diverged from <italic>T. congolense</italic> rather than separately gained in both <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic>. The ~1000-fold higher affinity of TcHpHbR for Hb than for HpHb also suggests that Hb binding is the major evolved function of this receptor in <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic>. Together these observations suggest that the ancestor of the HpHbRs was primarily a haemoglobin receptor and that evolutionary changes that have taken place during the evolution of <italic>T. brucei</italic> have led to an alteration in its binding specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of <italic>T. congolense</italic> is expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage</title><p>The finding that TcHpHbR is a haemoglobin receptor was unexpected in the light of our current knowledge of TbHpHbR.

In mammalian blood, free haemoglobin levels are extremely low due to the presence of haptoglobin as a scavenger. Haptoglobin binds free Hb, allowing it to be removed from the serum by endocytosis of HpHb complexes into macrophages, reducing the potential for oxidative damage caused by haem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kristiansen et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, except under conditions of exceptional haemolysis, there is little haemoglobin present in the blood, bringing into question the requirement for a haemoglobin receptor.

This binding site is similar in location, size and chemical nature to the membrane-distal binding site of TbHpHbR for HpHb, in which the same region of TbHpHbR makes direct contacts with the β-subunit of haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13044.014</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Description of interactions between TcHpHbR and Hb.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13044.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13044.014</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" valign="top"><italic>Tc</italic>HpHbR</th><th colspan="3" valign="top">Hb</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th valign="top">Residue</th><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">Chain</th><th valign="top">Residue</th><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">Interaction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hbα</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">S29</td><td valign="top">backbone CO</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">H46</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">S29</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">Haem</td><td valign="top">O1</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">I30</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">R37</td><td valign="top">side chain NH1/NH2</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">L92</td><td valign="top">backbone CO</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">K127</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">P45</td><td valign="top">backbone CO</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">K130</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">T166</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">Haem</td><td valign="top">O3</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Y168</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Y168</td><td valign="top">backbone CO</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">K91</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">D169</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">C/E</td><td valign="top">K91</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">Salt bridge</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hbβ</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">I41</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">R42</td><td valign="top">side chain NH2</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Haem</td><td valign="top">O1</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A44</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">T45</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">E47</td><td valign="top">side chain OE2</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">K96</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">Salt bridge</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">F48</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Patch</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Hydrophobic</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">K52</td><td valign="top">side chain</td><td valign="top">D/F</td><td valign="top">Haem</td><td valign="top">O3</td><td valign="top">Hydrogen bond</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The smaller, membrane-proximal part of the binding site contacts the β-subunit of haemoglobin with a total contact surface area of 650 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This interface is more hydrophobic in nature than the membrane-distal site. However, once again, the propionate chains of haem directly interact with the receptor. This membrane distal binding site is distinct in position and chemical nature from the region of TbHpHbR that contacts haptoglobin, which is closer to the membrane surface and is smaller (~505 Å<sup>2</sup>). The more extensive contact site between TcHpHbR and the β-subunit of Hb, than that between TbHpHbR and Hp, is likely to be a major contributor to the increased affinity of TcHpHbR for Hb.</p><p>TcHpHbR also interacts with HpHb, albeit with a significantly lower affinity. To understand the molecular basis for this interaction, we generated a model of the TcHpHbR:HpHb complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). One surprise from a comparison of the TcHpHbR:Hb structure with that of TbHpHbR:HpHb is that the membrane distal binding site of TcHpHbR interacts with the Hb α-subunit while the equivalent site of TbHpHbR interacts with the Hb β-subunit of HpHb. We modeled the TcHpHbR:HpHb structure by docking either Hb subunit from the structure of HpHb onto the interacting Hb α-subunit of the TcHpHbR:Hb complex. When the Hb α-subunit is docked onto the membrane-distal binding site, Hp makes no contacts with the receptor. In contrast, when the HpHb is ‘flipped’ so that the Hb β-subunit contacts the membrane-distal binding site, this positions Hp adjacent to the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, the residues from the Hb α-subunit that contact the membrane-distal binding site are replaced by chemically similar residues in the Hb β-subunit, allowing equivalent interactions to occur. The interaction between TbHpHbR and Hp is predominantly hydrophobic in nature, and a similar, but smaller, hydrophobic region in TcHpHbR, involving phenylalanine 48 is similarly positioned to interact with Hp. We therefore predict that HpHb interacts with TcHpHbR with a similar binding mode to that observed in the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex with the Hb β-subunit contacting the membrane-distal binding site, allowing haptoglobin to bind to a membrane-proximal site.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13044.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Understanding HpHbR ligand specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model of TcHpHbR bound to HpSPHb, based on the TcHpHbR:Hb structure. (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) The TcHpHbR:Hb and TbHpHbR:HpSPHb complexes have been aligned, with the haemoglobin subunit that interacts with the membrane distal binding site used for the alignment.

While an alignment of these structures shows little alteration in the membrane-distal binding site, the path of helix I of the receptor is altered in TbHpHbR so that it no longer forms the membrane-proximal binding site for the Hb β-subunit, thereby reducing the total interaction surface area by nearly half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). This change in the helical pathway could be a consequence of the adoption of a kink in TbHpHbR, which allows the receptor to function in the context of the VSG layer. Alternatively, it could be a result of changes that lead to the increase in the affinity of the receptor for HpHb, from 8 μM in <italic>T. congolense</italic> to 1 µM in <italic>T. brucei,</italic> as determined by SPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of <italic>T. brucei</italic> has been extensively characterised because of its role in the uptake of haptoglobin-haemoglobin into the bloodstream form parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>). This receptor also mediates uptake of trypanolytic factor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>) and to a lesser extent the uptake of trypanolytic factor-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bullard et al., 2012</xref>), contributing to the inability of most isolates of <italic>T. brucei</italic> to survive in human serum. It was a reasonable expectation that orthologues in other African trypanosome species, such as <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic>, would have a similar function. However, here it is shown that there are significant differences between the receptors from <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. congolense</italic>. Firstly, <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR has an approximately 1000-fold greater affinity for haemoglobin than for haptoglobin-haemoglobin and developmental forms expressing TcHpHbR are able to internalise Hb at low nanomolar concentrations. Secondly, the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor is expressed in the epimastigotes with a copy number approximately 1000-fold greater than that of <italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR in the bloodstream form. Finally, <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR is distributed over the whole cell surface, whereas in <italic>T. brucei</italic> it is concentrated in the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). Similar findings are seen for <italic>T. vivax</italic>, as TvHpHbR also binds haemoglobin preferentially over haptoglobin-haemoglobin and is, at the mRNA level, preferentially expressed in epimastigotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>). This, together with the evolutionary history of the trypanosomes, suggests that the receptors from <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. congolense</italic> represent the ancestral form, while the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor has adopted a modified function and cellular distribution.</p><p>The location of <italic>T. congolense</italic> epimastigotes in the tsetse fly mouthparts provides the parasite with the opportunity to acquire nutrients from bloodmeals obtained by the fly. The presence of TcHpHbR will allow epimastigotes to scavenge haem that is present in haemoglobin molecules released from lysed erythrocytes, or to bind more weakly to haptoglobin-haemoglobin. It is noteworthy that the predominant form of bovine haptoglobin adopts higher order multimers more complex than the dimeric HpHb used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2007</xref>) and it is possible that this may increase the avidity for TcHpHbR, as observed for multimeric human HpHb binding to scavenger receptor CD163 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kristiansen et al., 2001</xref>), making uptake of HpHb more efficient. Endocytosis of TcHpHbR bound to either Hb or HpHb would then provide the parasite with haem.</p><p>The expression level of TcHpHbR in the epimastigote form is surprising, with over 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> copies per cell. This is approximately 1000-fold greater than the level of TbHpHbR in the bloodstream form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drain et al., 2001</xref>). One possible explanation for this abundant expression is that the receptor must capture haemoglobin as it periodically and transiently flows over the cell surface when the blood meal passes through the tsetse fly mouthparts. This is in contrast with TbHpHbR expressed in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream stage, which will be constantly exposed to its ligand. It remains unknown how <italic>T. congolense</italic> bloodstream forms acquire haem. It may be that sufficient haptoglobin-haemoglobin enters the cell through fluid phase endocytosis or perhaps through an alternative receptor, such as the ortholog of the LHR1 haem transpoter utilized by <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huynh et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our knowledge of the structure and function of HpHbR in both <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> allows us to propose an evolutionary history for the changes that took place in the development of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor. First, perhaps to evade toxic components of the blood meal or to avoid niche competition with other trypanosome species in the proboscis, the developmental cycle of <italic>T. brucei</italic> altered, with the epimastigotes adopting a new location in the salivary glands, rather than developing in the mouthparts. As no haemoglobin is available from bloodmeals in the salivary glands, the receptor became redundant. A new pattern of expression then evolved in which the receptor was expressed in bloodstream forms instead of in epimastigotes. This switch conferred the ability to more efficiently acquire haem more efficiently in the bloodstream form. That this provides an advantage is evidenced by the attenuation of growth of a TbHpHbR null mutant in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>). However, free haemoglobin is not normally present in blood, where it rapidly assembles into HpHb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wada et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deiss and Lee, 1999</xref>). Evolutionary changes therefore took place in TbHpHbR that resulted in an increase in its affinity for HpHb, from 8 μM in <italic>T. congolense</italic> to 1 µM in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>). A decrease in expression levels and a change in primary location from the cell surface to being concentrated in the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhollebeke et al., 2008</xref>) was most likely a final adaptation, perhaps driven by the need to avoid detection by the mammalian acquired immune system.</p><p>The change in the developmental stage of expression also had significant effects on the structure of the receptor. On the epimastigote surface, TcHpHbR is free to interact with its ligand relatively unimpeded by other surface proteins. In addition, with a 3 nM affinity for Hb, monovalent binding will allow efficient uptake, and simple tilting of the receptor around its GPI-anchor will position the binding site to allow simultaneous binding of two receptors to one Hb if required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A switch to expression in the bloodstream form forced the receptor to function within the densely packed VSG layer. In addition, switching to a ligand with approximately 1000-fold weaker binding made bivalent binding important for efficient uptake. To operate in this new context, the <italic>T. brucei</italic> receptor evolved by gaining both a novel C-terminal domain that probably increases the distance of the ligand binding site from the plasma membrane and by evolving a significant kink between the ligand-binding site and the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane-Serff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stødkilde et al., 2014</xref>). This kink pushes the VSG molecules apart and presents the ligand-binding site at the surface. It also allows two receptors, both coupled to the membrane surface, to simultaneously bind to a single dimer of haptoglobin-haemoglobin, increasing avidity and uptake efficiency. A consequence of these changes was the loss of haemoglobin binding, which was no longer under positive selection.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13044.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A comparison of ligand binding by HpHbRs from different species.</title><p>Space filling models of (<bold>A</bold>) Two TcHpHbR molecules binding to a single haemoglobin tetramer. (<bold>B</bold>) Two TbHpHbRs bound to a single haptoglobin-haemoglobin dimer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13044.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13044.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13044-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>The evolution of the receptor has continued as some primates have acquired innate immune factors that kill trypanosomes.

For the majority of African trypanosomes this has had a minor effect on parasite survival as non-primates, which lack TLFs, are their predominant hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoare, 1972</xref>). However, in <italic>T. brucei gambiense</italic>, the one subspecies that has evolved to infect humans as the main host, the receptor has responded to this new selection pressure through a point mutation that reduces affinity for TLF1 and HpHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeJesus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Symula et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of African trypanosomes has undergone a remarkable set of adaptations in its co-evolution with its hosts.

With an important role at the host-parasite interface, and as a target of innate immunity, it continues to evolve and adapt, allowing it to provide the parasite with a source of haem, while evading destruction by innate immunity factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of <italic>T. vivax</italic> HpHbR</title><p>The gene TvY486 0024220 (tritrypdb.org) was identified as the closest homologue to <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR using Blastp.

Cells were stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 min, washed and mounted with Calbiochem FluorSave Reagent (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA). For immunofluorescent analysis of tsetse-derived <italic>T.congolense</italic>, dissected samples were air-dried and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 30 min, then processed as above.

Incubation in serum-free media was required to remove competing Hb ligand from the media. Coverslips were moved onto poly-l-lysine slides and incubated with no ligand, 10 nM Hb-488 or 10 nM-BSA at 27°C for 4 hr. At 2 hr post-addition of ligand, 2 µM protease inhibitor FMK-024 was added. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed 3x in PBS, stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI for 5 min and mounted.

Crystals were obtained after 18 hr in a sitting drop format with a well solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5, 8% w/v PEG 8000. After cryoprotection by transfer into well solution with the addition of 30% glycerol, the crystals were cryo-cooled. Data were collected on beamline I03 at the Diamond light source and were indexed and scaled using iMosflm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Battye et al., 2011</xref>) and Scala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans et al., 1993</xref>) respectively. Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) was used to determine a molecular replacement model, using the known structures of TcHpHbR (pdb: 4E40, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2013</xref>) and human oxygenated Hb (pdb: 1HHO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shaanan, 1983</xref>) as search models.

This strategy was designed to allow them to be immobilised with an orientation matching that found on the parasite surface, and to generate a surface that could be readily regenerated. Purified receptors were biotinylated by mixing 1 mg of protein at 30 μM with 20 μg of BirA (Sigma Aldrich), 5 mM ATP (Sigma Aldrich) and 300 μM biotin (Sigma Aldrich). They were incubated at room temperature overnight, before desalting using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess biotin.</p><p>SPR experiments were carried out on a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). All experiments were performed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween-20 at 25°C. Two-fold dilution series of human Hb, human HpHb or bovine Hb (Sigma) were prepared for injection over a receptor-coated chip with upper concentrations of 1 μM. For each cycle, biotinylated recombinant receptor was immobilised on a CAP chip using the Biotin CAPture Kit (GE Healthcare) to a total loading of ~250 RU. Binding partners were injected for 240 s with a dissociation time of 300 s. The chip was regenerated between cycles using regeneration solution from the Biotin CAPture Kit. The specific binding response of the ligands to receptors was determined by subtracting the response given by Hb or HpHb from a surface to which no receptor had been coupled. As both Hb and HpHb have the capacity to simultaneously interact with two receptors, this data was not fitted to obtain affinity measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>ITC measurements were carried out on a MicroCal iTC200 System (Malvern, UK). Samples were dialysed for 15 hr into 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl at 4°C. Experiments were performed at 25°C with 50 μl of <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR at 250 μM titrated into a cell containing 300 μl of Hb at 18 μM.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldti-Favre as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Ferguson and Søren Moestrup (peer reviewers).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study convincingly establishes that <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> haptoglobin haemoglobin receptor (TcHpHbR) acts primarily as a high affinity haemoglobin receptor in the epimastigote developmental stage. Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis showed the <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> HpHbR bound both HpHb and Hb but formed a far more stable complex with Hb alone. Based on these observations, the authors suggest that this receptor is tailored for the epimastigote forms to scavenge haemoglobin in the fly. Consistent with a role in the insect vector they found that the HpHbR is not expressed in bloodstream forms but rather in the epimastigote stage found attached to the proboscis. Further, based on IFA and western blot analysis they predict greater than 5 X 105 receptors distributed rather uniformly across the cell surface. Analysis of the structure of the TcHpHbR with bound Hb provided a clear understanding of the features that mediate this high affinity receptor-ligand interaction.</p><p>The authors further hypothesize that this ancestor receptor diverged during <italic>T. brucei</italic> evolution giving rise to the HpHb binding properties of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> HpHbR. In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, this receptor evolved to gain distance between ligand binding site and the membrane and also a kink to exclude VSG interactions. Importantly the receptor has morphed into a different shape and specificity to preferentially bind HpHb to satisfy the organisms need for iron – with the complication of host-range modulation through <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> lytic factor uptake.</p><p>Overall, this is a well-written paper with important findings that add significantly to our understanding of the crucial interplay between trypanosomes and host haemoglobin.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title may suggest that this is a phylogenetic study but it is in fact far more than that. The finding that the ancestral receptor binds the Hb tetramer as shown in the beautiful 3D structure is a key observation that should be included. For instance, 'Evolutionary diversification of the trypanosome haemoglobin-haptoglobin receptor from an ancestral haemoglobin receptor'.</p><p>2) Abstract, last sentence. This statement concerning the host immune defence against the <italic>T. brucei</italic> has little relevance for the present study and is confusing for the reader not familiar with the complex innate primate immune response. Further, the reason that some species can overcome this immune response and thereby become human infective is due to another line of evolution in the parasites than described here (evolvement of resistance proteins, mutations etc.).</p><p>3) Results: subsection “The <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor has evolved from a haemoglobin receptor”, first paragraph: The interaction between human Hp and Hb is extremely strong (K<sub>D</sub> = 10-15). The authors show that TcHpHbR is capable of dissociating the HpSP-Hb complex. However, the HpSP used in these experiments was expressed in insect cells and not processed correctly into α- and β-chains. Consequently, the recombinant HpSP may have a much lower affinity for Hb compared to native Hp. The authors should investigate if TcHpHbR can also dissociate native Hp-Hb. If TcHpHbR is in fact able to dissociate the native Hp-Hb complex, this suggest the TcHpHbR is entirely an Hb receptor and when it encounters an Hp-Hb complex it can wrest Hb from Hp and only take up Hb.</p><p>4) Results: subsection &quot;The haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of <italic>T. congolense</italic> is expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage”, third paragraph: It would be relevant to show that the in vitro-generated epimastigote forms that express the receptor bind Hb. Further, it would be relevant to investigate whether they take up Hb or use it as a kind of coating as discussed later.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Only human Hb is tested to the <italic>T. congolense</italic> receptor. In view of the structural data suggesting that Hb from other species may bind equally well, it would be relevant to include binding data of other species, e.g. rodent and bovine Hb.</p><p>6) Cattle and deer have multimeric Hp due to a duplication of the CCP domain. This may allow the Hp-Hb complexes to bind multiple receptors on the surface of the parasites. The authors should comment on how this may affect the claimed preference of TcHpHbR for Hb over Hp-Hb.</p><p>7) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, second paragraph: The authors describe that TcHpHbR interacts both the α- and β-subunits of tetrameric Hb. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> it is evident that TcHpHbR binds Hb across the dimer-dimer interface and contacts α1/β2 or α2/β1. This is quite interesting because it suggests that TcHpHbR have evolved to recognize only tetrameric Hb or that the Hb tetramer is perhaps formed on the receptor as a result of interaction with separate Hb dimers. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>8) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, third paragraph: The propionate side chains of both Hb subunits are recognized by TcHpHbR. A detailed figure showing these interactions should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>9) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, fourth paragraph. A model of the Hp-Hb interaction with TcHpHbR is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The statement that &quot;Hp is capable of forming a close interaction with TcHpHbR&quot; should be supported by a detailed figure either as a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> or as supplement. Is this interaction expected to involve similar contacts as those observed in the TbHpHbR-HpHb structures?</p><p>10) Western blots showed two anti-TcHpHb reactive bands, neither at the expected size for unmodified TcHpHb. Since the recombinant TcHpHb runs with the lower, less abundant band this would be consistent with glycosylation differences but this is not shown. The reason for concern is that no evidence is presented to show that the upper band is not an unrelated cross-reactive protein.</p><p>11) The IFA images clearly show that a sub-population in the cultures react with that anti-TcHpHb. From these images the authors indicate that all cells where kinetoplast repositioning had occurred reacted with the antibody. Unfortunately, the quality of the images and lack of labeling makes it difficult to see the relationship. Perhaps more important is that based on these images alone the authors conclude that TcHpHb is distributed across the cell surface. However, since the cells were alcohol fixed it remains possible that the IFA is also revealing intracellular protein. Experiments to demonstrate cell surface localization should be straightforward.</p><p>12) Discussion: The evolution of the trypanosome receptor from a Hb receptor to a Hp-Hb receptor may go in line with the development of an extended role of Hb as a protein protecting against Hb toxicity in mammalians. Furthermore, there is an interesting parallel between the present data and other date indicating the development of the human Hp-Hb receptor CD163 from a phylogenetic older Hb binding CD163 in mammals – and perhaps also from an older similar to the Hb-binding Pit54 protein in birds (last paragraph in discussion, Etzerodt et al. Antiox. Redox Sign. 18: 2254-63 (2013) and Wicher and Fries PNAS 103:4168-73 (2006)).</p><p>13) The role of TcHpHb during the life cycle of the parasite should be more extensively discussed.</p><p>13.1) In particular, the role of this receptor in haem acquisition by <italic>T. congolense</italic> is proposed but there is no mention of how, in the absence of the TcHpHbR, the bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes might acquire haem. If the authors porpose that <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> use transferrin receptors for iron, why does <italic>T. brucei</italic> need a transferrin receptor when it should be able to get iron in the form of haem via the HpHb receptor? How do the authors see the Tc and Tv surviving in the fly when they would be dependent on the fly's blood-meal – would that be frequent enough? – some discussion may be warranted.</p><p>13.2) The authors discuss the role of the TbHpHbR in susceptibility to trypanosome lytic factors, however, they clearly show that the HpHbR is not expressed in human serum susceptible bloodstream <italic>T. congolense</italic>.

The authors show that TcHpHbR is capable of dissociating the HpSP-Hb complex.

If TcHpHbR is in fact able to dissociate the native Hp-Hb complex, this suggest the TcHpHbR is entirely an Hb receptor and when it encounters an Hp-Hb complex it can wrest Hb from Hp and only take up Hb.</italic></p><p>At the start of the Results section of our manuscript we describe an experiment in which we mixed <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR with human HpSPHb complex and observed this to result in the formation of a complex of TcHpHbR with Hb and free HpSP. We describe this experiment as it was the observation that led to our discovery that TcHpHbR is an Hb receptor, rather than to imply that TcHpHR will disassemble HpHb as part of its physiological function. As the reviewers rightly point out, the HpSPHb used in this experiment is not identical to native HpHb complex, as native Hp is cleaved into α and β chains. While structural alignments show that this does not affect the position of residues involved in the interaction with the haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptors, it does alter the interface between Hp and Hb and could change the stability of the HpHb complex. We therefore performed the experiment suggested by the reviewers in which we incubated HpHb with TcHpHbR, and in this case we do not see disassembly of the HpHb. However, neither do we see the formation of a TcHpHbR:HpHb complex with sufficient stability to survive gel filtration chromatography. This is in contrast to what occurs when we mix TcHpHbR with Hb, when a stable complex is formed. This data is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. This supports our conclusion that TcHpHbR is primarily an Hb receptor and also shows that it is unlikely that TcHpHbR can disassemble HpHb during the acquisition of haem.</p><p> <italic>4) Results: subsection &quot;The haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor of T. congolense is expressed in the epimastigote developmental stage”, third paragraph: It would be relevant to show that the in vitro-generated epimastigote forms that express the receptor bind Hb. Further, it would be relevant to investigate whether they take up Hb or use it as a kind of coating as discussed later.</italic></p><p>The reviewers asked for further experiments in which we test the functional consequences of the expression of the receptor to see whether <italic>T. congolense</italic> epimastigotes can internalise haemoglobin or whether a coat of haemoglobin assembles on the parasite surface. Culture-derived epimastigotes were therefore incubated with fluorescently-labelled human haemoglobin. These data (now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) show clear internalisation of the labelled haemoglobin into epimastigotes, while there is no internalisation into trypomastigotes. In contrast, we did not observe any accumulation of labelled haemoglobin on the cell surface in these experiments. We have therefore confirmed that the <italic>T. congolense</italic> epimastigotes can use TcHpHbR to allow them to internalise haemoglobin.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Only human Hb is tested to the T. congolense receptor. In view of the structural data suggesting that Hb from other species may bind equally well, it would be relevant to include binding data of other species, e.g. rodent and bovine Hb.</italic></p><p>The reviewers point out that the original manuscript showed only the binding of TcHpHbR to human haemoglobin. As <italic>T. congolense</italic> is not human infective, they ask for confirmation that it also binds to haemoglobins from other species. In the original manuscript we presented a figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) showing that the haemoglobin residues that contact TcHpHbR are absolutely conserved between human and bovine haemoglobin. In this revised version we make two additions. We show experimentally that TcHpHbR does indeed interact with bovine Hb, with an affinity similar to that of human Hb, and we describe this data in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor has evolved from a haemoglobin receptor”. This is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also increase the range of species (all known to be infected by <italic>T. congolense</italic>) included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, showing that the residues contacted by <italic>T. congolense</italic> are conserved in cows, sheep, horses and camels.</p><p><italic>6) Cattle and deer have multimeric Hp due to a duplication of the CCP domain. This may allow the Hp-Hb complexes to bind multiple receptors on the surface of the parasites. The authors should comment on how this may affect the claimed preference of TcHpHbR for Hb over Hp-Hb.</italic></p><p>The reviewers mention that Hp from bovine and deer adopt higher order multimers than those present in the dimeric HpHb used in this study, and that this might increase the efficiency of uptake of HpHb. This is possible, although it is also possible that the arrangement of the binding sites in the larger HpHb complexes might not allow increased binding to receptors associated with the parasite surface for steric reasons. We have added a sentence in the second paragraph of the Discussion to raise this issue for the reader.</p><p> <italic>7) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, second paragraph: The authors describe that TcHpHbR interacts both the α- and β-subunits of tetrameric Hb. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> it is evident that TcHpHbR binds Hb across the dimer-dimer interface and contacts α1/</italic>β<italic>2 or α2/</italic>β<italic>1. This is quite interesting because it suggests that TcHpHbR have evolved to recognize only tetrameric Hb or that the Hb tetramer is perhaps formed on the receptor as a result of interaction with separate Hb dimers. The authors should comment on this.</italic></p><p>The reviewers ask whether the structure suggests that the receptor only interacts with a haemoglobin tetramer or whether two haemoglobin dimers can assemble together on the receptor. In the absence of affinity measurements for the haemoglobin dimer (which would require a stabilised haemoglobin dimer) we cannot present the quantitative analysis that we would have liked to include. However, we speculate that either is possible in the second paragraph of the subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding“.</p><p><italic>8) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, third paragraph: The propionate side chains of both Hb subunits are recognized by TcHpHbR. A detailed figure showing these interactions should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have remodelled the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, removing panels B and E and replacing them with close up views of the interactions that TcHpHbR makes with the haem groups of the haemoglobin α- and β-chains.</p><p><italic>9) Results: subsection “The structural basis for haemoglobin binding”, fourth paragraph. A model of the Hp-Hb interaction with TcHpHbR is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The statement that &quot;Hp is capable of forming a close interaction with TcHpHbR&quot; should be supported by a detailed figure either as a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> or as supplement. Is this interaction expected to involve similar contacts as those observed in the TbHpHbR-HpHb structures?</italic></p><p>To illustrate our model of the TcHpHbR:HpHb complex we have added a second view, taken from the bottom of the receptor, to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (originally <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This will show, in more detail, how close the loops of Hp come to the receptor in this configuration. In addition, the interaction between TbHpHbR and Hp in the TbHpHbR:HpHb complex is mostly hydrophobic in nature and we now point out that a similar, but smaller, hydrophobic patch is present in TcHpHbR, centred around Phe48, which can mediate an equivalent hydrophobic interaction with Hp. We prefer not to show the model in further detail (for example showing the side chains) as this would be an over-interpretation of the model. Instead it is presented to support our hypothesis that the β-subunit of Hb will interact with the upper binding site on TcHpHbR when it binds to the HpHb complex.</p><p><italic>10) Western blots showed two anti-TcHpHb reactive bands, neither at the expected size for unmodified TcHpHb. Since the recombinant TcHpHb runs with the lower, less abundant band this would be consistent with glycosylation differences but this is not shown. The reason for concern is that no evidence is presented to show that the upper band is not an unrelated cross-reactive protein.</italic></p><p>The reviewers also asked for some further experiments to confirm that the bands recognised by anti-TcHpHbR are not reacting with an unrelated protein. This comment was stimulated by the higher molecular weight of the antibody reactive band in the epimastigotes when compared with recombinant protein. In the absence of an epimastigote form of a <italic>T. congolense</italic> HpHbR<sup>-/-</sup> cell line, we tested this using <italic>T. brucei</italic> TbHpHbR<sup>-/-</sup> bloodstream forms carrying an inducible copy of a TcHpHbR transgene. Upon induction with doxycycline, the antisera detected two bands that again ran at a higher molecular weight than the recombinant TcHpHbR. This data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and shows that a fraction of <italic>T. brucei</italic> expressed TcHpHbR runs in the same position as the antibody-reactive band in the epimastigotes. This difference in mobility is probably due to differential modification of GPI-anchors in the bloodstream and insect cell stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. The insect stages are modified with sialic acid residues whereas the bloodstream forms, used here for the transgene expression, are not. In conjunction with our new data showing haemoglobin uptake into <italic>T. congolense</italic> epimastigotes, this gives strong support to our conclusion that TcHpHbR is expressed in epimastigotes.</p><p><italic>11) The IFA images clearly show that a sub-population in the cultures react with that anti-TcHpHb. From these images the authors indicate that all cells where kinetoplast repositioning had occurred reacted with the antibody. Unfortunately, the quality of the images and lack of labeling makes it difficult to see the relationship. Perhaps more important is that based on these images alone the authors conclude that TcHpHb is distributed across the cell surface. However, since the cells were alcohol fixed it remains possible that the IFA is also revealing intracellular protein. Experiments to demonstrate cell surface localization should be straightforward.</italic> </p><p>To confirm that the TcHpHbR is surface localised, we have collected further IFA images of epimastigotes, both culture-derived and dissected from tsetse flies. We have also conducted imaging experiments using paraformaldehyde-fixed, non-permeabilised cells. We see clear surface staining in both the permeabilise and non-permeabilised cells, clearly indicating surface localisation. We also confirm this in tsetse-derived epimastigotes, showing that receptor expression in eptimastigotes is not a consequence of in vitro differentiation. This data is now presented in a revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>12) Discussion: The evolution of the trypanosome receptor from a Hb receptor to a Hp-Hb receptor may go in line with the development of an extended role of Hb as a protein protecting against Hb toxicity in mammalians. Furthermore, there is an interesting parallel between the present data and other date indicating the development of the human Hp-Hb receptor CD163 from a phylogenetic older Hb binding CD163 in mammals – and perhaps also from an older similar to the Hb-binding Pit54 protein in birds (last paragraph in discussion, Etzerodt et al. Antiox. Redox Sign. 18: 2254-63 (2013) and Wicher and Fries PNAS 103:4168-73 (2006)</italic></p><p>We thank the referees for pointing out the interesting parallels in changes in ligand specificity between published findings on CD163 and our findings. We have mentioned these in the Results section (subsection “The <italic>T. brucei</italic> haptoglobin-haemoglobin receptor has evolved from a 149 haemoglobin receptor”, fourth paragraph) and by the addition of Etzerodt et al. in the references section. While the changes in the specificity of CD163 are interesting, we do not believe that there is evidence to suggest that these changes are related to the changes in specificity of HpHbR in their functional consequence, as alterations in HpHbR specificity correlated with a change in life cycle stage usage.</p><p><italic>13) The role of TcHpHb during the life cycle of the parasite should be more extensively discussed.</italic></p><p><italic>13.1) In particular, the role of this receptor in haem acquisition by T. congolense is proposed but there is no mention of how, in the absence of the TcHpHbR, the bloodstream and procyclic trypanosomes might acquire haem. If the authors porpose that T. congolense and T. vivax use transferrin receptors for iron, why does T. brucei need a transferrin receptor when it should be able to get iron in the form of haem via the HpHb receptor? How do the authors see the Tc and Tv surviving in the fly when they would be dependent on the fly's blood-meal – would that be frequent enough? – some discussion may be warranted.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the switch in expression stage of HpHbR leads to a number of questions. We have speculated in the manuscript (Discussion, third paragraph) that the high expression level of TcHpHbR is present to allow capture of Hb from the blood meal as it flows through the mouthparts of the tsetse fly and that lower expression levels are acceptable in the mammalian bloodstream where the parasite is more continuously exposed to HpHb and so does not need a transient capture mechanism. This adaptation might allow the parasite to acquire sufficient haem during its time in the tsetse fly, but an experimental demonstration of this will be challenging. It is also possibility that there are other mechanisms by which <italic>T. congolense</italic> acquires haem in the mammalian bloodstream, as not discussed in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p><italic>13.2) The authors discuss the role of the TbHpHbR in susceptibility to trypanosome lytic factors, however, they clearly show that the HpHbR is not expressed in human serum susceptible bloodstream T. congolense. This might be elaborated on.</italic></p><p>We have also implied that the susceptibility to trypanolytic factors will have been increased as a result of the switch in expression of HpHbR to the blood stream in our Discussion (for example in the sixth paragraph). However, the other methods for HpHbR-independent uptake of trypanolytic factors into trypanosomes mean that we prefer not to discuss this point at length.</p></body></sub-article></article>
