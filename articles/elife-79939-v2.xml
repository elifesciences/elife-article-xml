inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate hyperglycemia. Paradoxically, moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes. The exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. Here, by comparing exercise and antioxidant intervention on type 2 diabetic rats, we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling; therefore, ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, our results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state(s). These results indicate that the AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance that is linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Molecules known as reactive oxygen species or ROS play vital roles in healthy cells. However, ROS can act as a double-edged sword: if their levels become too high, they can be harmful and interfere with many physiological processes. Indeed, diabetes, high blood pressure and many other chronic diseases are associated with imbalances in the levels of ROS in the body. To counter high ROS levels, cells have antioxidant mechanisms that reduce the excess ROS in the cell and keep the ‘redox’ (from reduction and oxidation) balance of the cell.</p><p>Exercise and antioxidant nutritional supplements have attracted much attention as drug-free interventions for diabetes. Both strategies alter the levels of ROS in the body, with exercise increasing the levels of ROS, and antioxidant supplements reducing them. Individuals with diabetes and other metabolic health issues have different ROS levels depending on the severity of the disease, age, genetics and other factors, leading to different redox states in their cells. Thus, approaches that can accurately evaluate the redox balance status of individuals are necessary for clinicians to identify what types of exercise and antioxidant supplements are beneficial and which treatments are most appropriate for each patient.</p><p>Wu, Zhao, Yan, Gao et al. examined the effects of exercise and antioxidant supplements on rats with diabetes, with the aim of identifying molecules – also known as biomarkers – that reflect the bodies’ redox balance. They found that moderate exercise increased the levels of ROS in the liver, which, in turn, compensated by increasing the production of antioxidants to protect against the higher levels of ROS. This resulted in a healthy ‘high-level’ redox balance, in which both ROS and antioxidants levels were high in the rats. On the other hand, giving the rats antioxidant supplements decreased their levels of ROS, leading to a healthy low-level redox balance with low levels of ROS.</p><p>These findings indicate that regular moderate exercise may be appropriate for people with pre-diabetes symptoms to restore a healthy redox balance. This is because the compensatory antioxidant mechanisms that kick in during exercise may be enough to counteract the excessive levels of ROS in these people. For patients with mild diabetes, exercise, antioxidant supplements, or a combination of both may be appropriate treatment, depending on their levels of ROS. Finally, patients with severe diabetes, who already have high levels of ROS, may benefit from antioxidant supplements to help reduce their excessive levels of ROS.</p><p>In the future, the biomarkers identified by Wu, Zhao, Yan, Gao et al. may be used to monitor and assess the change in the redox balance status of various populations and guide personalized interventions to maintain health. Additionally, these findings provide a new strategy for precision prevention and treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox balance</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Dongyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a high-level redox balance, whereas antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress for treating diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease, that has emerged as a global public health problem. According to the latest epidemiological data from the International Diabetes Federation, the global diabetes prevalence in 20–79 year-old was estimated to be 10.5% (536.6 million people) in 2021, and is expected to rise to 12.2% (783.2 million) in 2045 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). With the development of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, it has been discovered by many studies that type 2 diabetes is associated with irreversible risk factors such as age, genetics, race, and ethnicity and reversible factors such as diet, physical activity, and lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heald et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Aerobic metabolism in glucose oxidation, mitochondrial damage, and oxidative stress have been considered to play a critical role in the occurrence and development of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iacobini et al., 2021</xref>). Exercise and antioxidant supplements are often suggested as essential therapeutic strategies in the early stages of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirwan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatti et al., 2022</xref>), with different mechanisms. It has been reported that chronic exercise training can alleviate oxidative stress and diabetic symptoms by improving cellular mitochondrial function and biogenesis in the diabetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stanford and Goodyear, 2014</xref>). Contradictorily, exercise also increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while prolonged or high-intensity exercise could result in mitochondrial functional impairment to aggravate complications of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flockhart et al., 2021</xref>). Since 1970s, studies have demonstrated that 1 hr of moderate endurance exercise can increase lipid peroxidation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dillard et al., 1978</xref>). In 1998, Ashton directly detected increasing free radical levels in exercising humans using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and spin capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashton et al., 1998</xref>). These results led to a great deal of interest in the role of ROS in physical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Powers and Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Powers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traverse et al., 2006</xref>). Regarding the contradiction of exercise on ROS scavenging or production, James D Watson also hypothesized that type 2 diabetes is accelerated by insufficient oxidative stress rather than oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watson, 2014</xref>), based on the effect of exercise on diabetes management. Although Watson’s opinions supported that exercise could treat diabetes by producing ROS, whether exercise-induced ROS production is beneficial or detrimental to diabetes is still being debated. The specific regulation of ROS produced by exercise on diabetic blood glucose <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear. In contrast, the general view of the antioxidant treatment for diabetes is that antioxidants reduce cytotoxic ROS and oxidative products, thus alleviating diabetes and achieving glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rahimi et al., 2005</xref>). Our previous study also found that hepatic mitochondrial ROS scavengers and antioxidant substances inhibited the oxidative products such as Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-HNE in diabetic animals and favored glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Exercise-induced oxidation and antioxidant administration, as two opposite approaches, could achieve the regulation of diabetes, respectively. However, the differences in redox mechanisms between these two approaches to diabetes treatment have not been fully understood.</p><p>It is well established that the increase of skeletal muscle glucose uptake during exercise is crucial in glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holloszy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holloszy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greiwe et al., 1999</xref>). Considering that the liver is another vital organ for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, including storing, utilizing, and producing glucose, exercise-induced hepatic redox metabolism is also significant. The activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which acts as a ‘metabolic master switch’, alleviates diabetes symptoms by reducing glycogen synthesis, increasing glycolysis, and promoting glucose absorption in surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viollet et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the activation of AMPK in the liver is significant for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in the blood. Zmijewski et al. found that AMPK could be activated by hydrogen peroxide stimulation through direct oxidative modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zmijewski et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, other studies suggested that oxidative stress could disrupt the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawley et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous study explored the mechanism by which redox status contributes to hepatic AMPK dynamic activation. Under a low ROS microenvironment, GRXs mediated S-glutathione modification activates AMPK to improve glucose utilization. In contrast, under an excessive ROS microenvironment, sustained high level ROS might cause loss of AMPK protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2016b</xref>). These studies indicate that oxidative modification can directly regulate AMPK activity in liver cells, thus activating downstream signaling pathways to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear why two seemingly contradictory phenomenon of antioxidant intervention and exercise-induce ROS can promote AMPK activation. Moderate exercise has been proved significantly elevate systemic ROS. At the same time, endogenous antioxidant defences also increased to counteract increased levels of ROS induced by exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parker et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that both antioxidants and exercise could reach either high- or low-level redox balance in diabetic individuals. Moreover, the activity and expression of AMPK might be a biomarker of redox balance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Hence, the present study was designed to understand the different mechanisms of exercise and antioxidant intervention in diabetes and verify the activation of hepatic AMPK as a hallmark of dynamic redox balance. First, we utilized the streptozotocin-high fat diet (STZ-HFD) induced type 2 diabetic model (T2DM) in rats to clarify the hepatic redox status in T2DM rats after the exercise or antioxidant intervention. Then, according to the exercise intensity and mode, we divided the exercise groups into three modes and found that AMPK activation could serve as a sentinel biomarker of redox balance and moderate exercise in diabetic management. In this study, we found that AMPK activation and its downstream pathways could reflect the threshold of exercise or antioxidant administration for diabetes management (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This study provides clues for the personalized management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A model of the different mechanisms of exercise and antioxidant intervention in diabetes.</title><p>A graphical abstract of this study.

The expressions of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and COX2 in the liver were increased in the diabetic group. After exercise intervention, NOX4 and COX2 level were further up-regulated compared with the diabetic group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). These results indicate the exercise intervention up-regulated ROS production.</p><p>Next, we detected the expression of antioxidant enzymes in liver tissue. Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the central regulator of the threshold mechanisms of oxidative stress and ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>). With the increase of ROS level in the development of diabetes, Nrf2 was activated to induce the transcription of several antioxidant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bitar and Al-Mulla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). We found an increase in Nrf2 expression in diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). After CE intervention, the level of Nrf2 levels further increased, indicating that exercise intervention could activate antioxidant system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Under stress conditions, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs), which results in the expression of diverse antioxidant and metabolic genes, such as thioredoxin (Trx), to relieve oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krajka-Kuźniak et al., 2017</xref>). Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), a type of cytosolic isoform of Trx, has been widely accepted to regulate glutathione metabolism with GRX and PRX. After CE intervention, we found the protein expression of GRX1 and TRX1 were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H J–K</xref>). Notably, the PRX expression also showed a trend of increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Sestrin2 is a cysteine sulfinyl reductase that plays crucial roles in regulation of antioxidant actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budanov et al., 2010</xref>). As an endogenous antioxidant, the hepatic sestrin2 level also showed a significant increase in the CE group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E G</xref>).</p><p>Since excess ROS can cause the increase of oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2022</xref>), we further detected the protein damage and lipid peroxidation to determine the redox status. 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and protein carbonylation are biomarkers of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and ROS modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahsan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong et al., 2010</xref>).

MDA, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, was also significantly up-regulated in the diabetic group but decreased in exercise group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). These results indicate that the high ROS production in the CE group could, instead, increase the antioxidant status to avoid oxidative damage. It suggests that CE can promote redox to reach a high level of balance. Therefore, even if exercise increases the ROS-generating enzymes NOX4 and COX2, the increase in ROS production does not lead to oxidative damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Antioxidant intervention alleviates blood glucose through reducing oxidative stress, leading to a low level of REDOX balance in the liver</title><p>Recent studies have suggested that NADPH oxidase is one of the primary sources of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Acosta et al., 2018</xref>).

Fructose-2,6-diphosphate (F-2,6-P2; also known as F-2,6-BP), which is a product of the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructose 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-diphosphatase 2 (PFK/FBPase 2, also known as PFKFB2), is a potent regulator of glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux. The phospho-PFKFB2 to PFKFB2 ratio represents the glycolytic rate. A high ratio of phospho-PFKFB2:PFKFB2 leads to an increase in the F-2,6-P2 level and the allosteric activation of phosphor-fructose kinase 1 (PFK1), while a low ratio leads to a decrease in F-2,6-P2 and an increase in gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okar et al., 2001</xref>).

John Holloszy’s studies found that exercise improved insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes and provided a better understanding of how muscle adapts to endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holloszy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holloszy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greiwe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirwan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 1998</xref>). Although the benefits of exercise are irrefutable, excessive exercise is harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flockhart et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting the importance of the amount and intensity of exercise. Recently, Chrysovalantou et al. found that NOX4 is a crucial exercise-related protein to regulate adaptive responses and prevent insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xirouchaki et al., 2021</xref>). We found that exercise could indeed increase NOX4 expression, but NOX4 was also upregulated in excessive exercise. Although Chrysovalantou’s study highlights the role of the redox environment in exercise, the biomarkers of effective intervention of moderate exercise on diabetes remain unclear.</p><p>The mechanisms of exercise for the management of diabetes have previously been studied mainly around the skeletal muscle, as the activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle during exercise is considered mainly caused by the increase of intracellular AMP:ATP ratio and phosphorylation of Thr172 on the ‘activation loop’ 7 of the α-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coughlan et al., 2014</xref>). The activation of AMPK leads to the inhibition of mTORC1 activity and activation of PGC-1α, which enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and further increases muscle uptake of glucose from the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawley et al., 2014</xref>). However, liver energy state also plays an essential role in the activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho et al., 2006</xref>) and liver is known to be critical in whole-body glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warner et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, AMPK is also considered as a redox-sensitive protein, and its cysteine 299 and 304 sites are likely to be regulated by the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zmijewski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinchy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, AMPK might be activated not only by the increase of AMP, but also by phosphorylation through ROS regulation during exercise.</p><p>Currently there is no appropriate biomarkers to differentiate moderate and excessive exercises. According to the exercise intensity and mode, we divided the exercise groups into three modes: CE, IE for moderate exercises and EE for excessive exercise. Our study, for the first time, found that hepatic AMPK activation could act as a biomarker of dynamic redox balance during exercise to improve glycemic control in diabetic rats. ROS generated by different exercise intensities could profoundly alter the cellular redox microenvironment and directly regulate the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK through a redox-related mechanism. Moderate exercise produced optimal ROS directly promoted AMPK activation via glutathionylation in hepatocytes. The activated AMPK signaling pathway can phosphorylate and activate PFK-2 to promote glycolysis and aerobic oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Furthermore, AMPK activation can phosphorylate and inhibit the CRCT2 and class IIa HDACs pathways in the liver, thus affecting the binding of class IIa HDACs to the FOXO-family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mihaylova et al., 2011</xref>). Since the gluconeogenesis related mRNA expression of PEPCK and G6Pase was mainly transcribed by FOXO1, the reduction of FOXO transcriptional activity induced by AMPK indicates the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Therefore, under moderate exercise, the metabolic balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is regulated through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation, which promotes glucose catabolism and inhibits gluconeogenesis. However, excessive ROS inhibits the activity and expression of AMPK in hepatocytes cells, which might be related with the oxidative stress induced protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In addition, the number of mitochondria and the function of aerobic oxidation in the EE group was significantly lower than those in the moderate exercise group. In the EE group, the autophagy and fission of liver mitochondria were also up-regulated as compared with the moderate exercise, accompanied by the increase of MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation damage. These results indicate that AMPK signaling and oxidative damage-related index could be investigated as sensitive biomarkers for redox status changes during exercise intervention in diabetic rats. This finding can be applied to analyze the thresholds of redox balance that discriminates moderate and excessive exercise.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of redox balance threshold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or decreased antioxidative capacity (AOD) cause an imbalanced redox state and declined AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in diabetic individuals. Moderate exercise promotes the activity of antioxidant enzymes by generating benign ROS to reach redox balance, and directly promotes AMPK signaling, thus reducing glucose levels in the blood and liver. Excessive exercise causes excess ROS and exceeds the redox balance threshold, inhibiting AMPK activity and expression, thus leading to exacerbation of diabetes. (AMPK and P-AMPK in gray circles indicate decrease, red circles indicate increase, blue circles indicate no significant changes). (<bold>B</bold>) Dose-response curve of diabetic individuals with exercise and antioxidant intervention.The state of diabetic individuals is applicable to the description of a S-shaped curve, due to the high level of oxidative stress and decreased reduction level in diabetic individuals. With the increase of ROS, the physiological function of diabetic individuals gradually decreases. Moderate exercise shifts the S-shaped curve upward and to the right, forming a bell-shaped dose-response curve, thus reducing the sensitivity to oxidative stress in diabetic individuals and restoring redox homeostasis. However, with excessive exercise, ROS production increases beyond the threshold range of redox balance, resulting in decreased physiological function. The ROS at the peak of the bell-shaped curve for antioxidant interventions (optimal physiological activity) is lower than the ROS at the peak for moderate exercise. The intervals on either side of the peak correspond to the range of redox balance thresholds, where antioxidant interventions are at low levels of redox balance and exercise is at high levels of redox balance.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79939-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Exercise is considered to improve blood glucose by promoting ROS levels, which seems to be contradictory to antioxidant interventions of inhibiting ROS. Zsolt Radak et al proposed a bell-shaped dose-response curve between normal physiological function and level of ROS in healthy individuals, and suggested that moderate exercise can extend or stretch the levels of ROS while increases the physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radak et al., 2017</xref>). Our results validated this hypothesis and further proposed that moderate exercise could produce ROS meanwhile increase antioxidant enzyme activity to maintain high level redox balance according to the bell-shaped curve, whereas excessive exercise would generate a higher level of ROS, leading to reduced physiological function. In this study, we found the state of diabetic individuals is more applicable to the description of a S-shaped curve, due to the high level of oxidative stress and decreased reduction level in diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). With the increase of ROS, the physiological function of diabetic individuals gradually decreases. Moderate exercise shifts the S-shaped curve into a bell-shaped dose-response curve, thus reducing the sensitivity to oxidative stress in diabetic individuals and restoring redox homeostasis. However, with excessive exercise, ROS production increases beyond the threshold range of redox balance, resulting in decreased physiological function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, see the decreasing portion of the bell curve to the right of the apex).</p><p>Nevertheless, the antioxidant intervention increased physiological activity by reducing ROS levels in diabetic individuals, restoring a bell-shaped dose-response curve at low level of ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Therefore, redox balance could be achieved either at low level of ROS mediated by antioxidant intervention or at high level of ROS mediated by moderate exercise, both of which were regulated by AMPK activation. Therefore, both high and low levels of redox balance can lead to high physiological function as long as they are in the redox balance threshold range. Then, the activation of AMPK is an important sentinel biomarker of exercise or antioxidant intervention to obtain redox dynamic balance which helps restore physiological function. Therefore, personalized intervention with respect to redox balance will be crucial for the effective management of diabetes patients. For example, we speculate that patients with mild diabetes may benefit from exercise or antioxidant supplements as an appropriate treatment, while patients with severe diabetes may benefit from antioxidant supplements, rather than exercise, to help reduce their excessive levels of ROS. Meanwhile, the antioxidant intervention based on moderate exercise might offset the effect of exercise, but antioxidants could be beneficial during excessive exercise. The human study also supports that supplementation with antioxidants may preclude the health-promoting effects of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ristow et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the intensity of exercise needs to be precisely adjusted to the patient's physical condition by tracking the dynamics of the redox state during exercise.</p><p>Together, our study reveals the seemingly contradictory ROS-related mechanisms of antioxidant intervention or moderate exercise for the management of diabetes. Moderate exercise promoted hepatic ROS production and up-regulated antioxidant capability, achieving a high-level balance of redox state. In contrast, antioxidant intervention scavenged the hepatic free radical to form a delicate low-level balance of redox state. Moreover, excessive exercise led to redox imbalance due to excess ROS levels. Hepatic AMPK signaling activation could act as a sign and hallmark of moderate exercise and dynamic redox balance to guide appropriate exercise or antioxidant intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results illustrate that it is necessary to develop a moderate exercise program according to the REDOX microenvironment of diabetes patients. This study provides theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes or other metabolic diseases by antioxidants and exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>TAOC kit was supplied by Changzhou Redox Biological Technology Corporation (Jiangsu, CN).

cellular pathways. There is always a debate whether ROS (reactive oxygen species) could be a friend or foe. There are several paradoxical studies (both animal and human) wherein exercise health benefits were reported to be accompanied by increases in ROS generation. Utilizing the in-vitro studies as well as rats models, this manuscript illustrates the different regulatory mechanisms of exercise and antioxidant intervention on redox balance/redox state(s) that are linked to improved glucose control and thereby effective management of diabetes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79939.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Balasubramanyam</surname><given-names>Muthuswamy</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00czgcw56</institution-id><institution>Madras Diabetes Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Balasubramanyam</surname><given-names>Muthuswamy</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00czgcw56</institution-id><institution>Madras Diabetes Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.15.491995">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.15.491995v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Muthuswamy Balasubramanyam (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some concerns that require attention by the authors are as follows:</p><p>1. In Figure 1 and Figure 3, the authors detect PRX1/TRX1/GRX1, NOX/COX2, protein carbonyl, Ace-SOD/SOD and lipid peroxidation (MDA) to overview the redox state in liver tissue. It would be better to have the result of protein oxidation / nitration in liver tissue.</p><p>2. In Figure 2H-I and Figure 3A-B, it is better to also include the graph of OGTT tests with the blood glucose level plot against time instead of showing the area under curve data. In addition, the authors also recommended to implement the fasting blood glucose in relation to the disease of interest.</p><p>3. In Figure 4I, the schematic diagram did not clearly show the effect of CE and IE on promoting TCA and glycolysis.
