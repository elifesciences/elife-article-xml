pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40538.001</object-id><p>Correlation among traits is a fundamental feature of biological systems that remains difficult to study. To address this problem, we developed a flexible approach that allows us to identify factors associated with inter-individual variation in correlation. We use data from three human cohorts to study the effects of genetic and environmental variation on correlations among mRNA transcripts and among NMR metabolites. We first show that environmental exposures (infection and disease) lead to a systematic loss of correlation, which we define as 'decoherence'. Using longitudinal data, we show that decoherent metabolites are better predictors of whether someone will develop metabolic syndrome than metabolites commonly used as biomarkers of this disease. Finally, we demonstrate that correlation itself is under genetic control by mapping hundreds of 'correlation quantitative trait loci (QTLs)'. Together, this work furthers our understanding of how and why coordinated biological processes break down, and points to a potential role for decoherence in disease.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

identify the coordinated regulatory processes that differ between individuals as a function of their disease state, environment, or genetic background. One powerful approach for doing so is to identify the effect of environmental or genetic perturbations on the degree to which genes are correlated at the mRNA level – a phenomenon known as ‘co-expression’. From a medical perspective, identifying factors associated with changes in co-expression between healthy and sick individuals should point toward key regulatory changes driving phenotypic differences between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mentzen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hudson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kostka and Spang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, work on decanalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Careau et al., 2014</xref>) indicates that gene regulatory networks evolve over many generations of stabilizing selection, and new mutations or novel environments may disrupt these fine-tuned connections. Decanalization has been hypothesized to explain the recent rise of non-communicable diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2016</xref>), with the idea being that recent major shifts in diet and lifestyle have led to dysregulation of regulatory programs that evolved under past environmental conditions. However, testing this hypothesis remains challenging in practice.</p><p>Our ability to move forward in understanding how environmental and genetic variation affect molecular correlations – in both humans and other organisms where this topic has been extensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Southworth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukushima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) – is limited by the available methodology (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Dam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2018</xref>)). In particular, most studies of differential co-expression to date have relied on two types of approaches: (i) building co-expression networks separately within each group of interest (e.g., diseased versus healthy) and contrasting their properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kostka and Spang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steiger, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watson, 2006</xref>); or (ii) asking whether predefined sets of genes are differentially co-expressed between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukushima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jen et al., 2006</xref>). Generally, these approaches are designed to compare population-level statistics (e.g., correlation coefficients) between two sample groups, and thus cannot test the effect of continuous predictor variables on variation in correlation. Further, these approaches are generally designed for datasets in which no individual-level covariates (e.g., age, sex, or batch) may bias co-expression estimates, which could lead to false conclusions if not accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsana, 2017</xref>). This limited flexibility has made it difficult to identify individual-specific factors that predict co-expression in humans or other organism that are not amenable to controlled manipulations.</p><p>To address this gap, we present a new approach for interrogating sources of variance in correlation. Our approach builds on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steiger, 1980</xref>), and is based on the fact that the Pearson correlation coefficient is equal to the average element-wise product of two traits measured across individuals, after each trait is mean centered and scaled; this value reflects the relationship between two traits within a population sample. By extension, to obtain a measure of the degree of correlation between two traits <italic>for each individual</italic> in a sample, we can simply keep the vector of products (i.e., we do not perform averaging across individuals). This vector of products can be used as the outcome variable in a linear model or linear mixed model, and consequently our approach can accommodate covariates and continuous predictor variables. We call our approach ‘<italic>Correlation by Individual Level Product’</italic> (CILP), because for each individual the product between two traits is estimated and modeled as a continuous outcome variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40538.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of decoherence and ‘Correlation by Individual Level Product’ (CILP).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Co-expression networks in two different environments.

(<bold>b</bold>) Environment 2 represents a stressful or unhealthy condition leading to lower correlation between the expression levels of gene 1 and gene 2. At the network level, this translates into a lower network degree (i.e., lower average correlation across genes or fewer connected nodes). We call this change in the correlation structure 'decoherence'. This is what we could expect if stressful conditions lower transcriptional robustness and lead to dysregulation of gene expression.

To assess the false positive rate under the null, a genotype was simulated with no effect, and CILP was applied to estimate the genetic effect on the degree of correlation between each gene pair. Panel B shows that the observed p-values from CILP both when adjusting for batch (by including it as a covariate in a linear model) as well as ignoring batch are not greater than p-values observed under the expected uniform distribution, suggesting that batch effects do not cause inflation or affect the estimation of the genetic effect.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40538-fig1-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Leveraging this approach, we explore the effects of environmental and genetic variation on the degree to which two molecular traits are correlated. First, we test the hypothesis that stressful physiological conditions (here, bacterial infection or metabolic syndrome) lead to a loss of correlation among molecular traits that are correlated under normal conditions. We refer to this loss of correlation in an infected or diseased state, relative to a baseline or healthy state, as ‘decoherence’. We test for decoherence using gene expression data derived from monocytes at baseline or following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>), a component of bacterial cells walls and a potent stimulant of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>). We also test for decoherence using blood-derived NMR metabolite data from the Young Finns Study (YFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raitakari et al., 2008</xref>). Strikingly, we find strong evidence in both datasets. Finally, we use CILP to map ‘correlation QTL’, defined as SNPs that affect the magnitude of the correlation between two mRNA transcripts. Using genotype and whole blood-derived gene expression data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Penninx et al., 2008</xref>), we identity and replicate hundreds of correlation QTLs.

We note that for our correlation QTL analyses, described later in the text, we use a modified version of CILP for computational efficiency and scalability.

We focused our simulations on the identification of ‘correlation QTL’, defined as SNPs that affect the magnitude of the correlation between two mRNA transcripts; however, we note that the results are generalizable to other predictor variables. For each simulation, we generated 10,000 gene pairs that differed in covariance as a function of genotypic class. We did so using the multivariate normal distribution to simulate pairs of continuous distributions (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for results where count data were simulated from a negative binomial distribution). Following simulation of gene expression data, we used CILP and linear models to detect differences in correlation as a function of genotype.</p><p>With an effect size of 0.3 and n = 1000, we detected 98.19% of simulated true positive correlation QTLs at a threshold of p=0.05, and 50.91% of true positives after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (using Bonferroni correction). Under the null, where the effect size was set to zero, we detect 5.19% of correlation QTLs at a threshold of p=0.05 and no correlation QTL after correcting for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ensure that changes in the mean, variance, or covariance of gene expression levels do not increase our false positive rate, we also assessed power to detect correlation QTLs when: (i) the focal SNP affected mean gene expression levels (e.g., through an eQTL or proportion QTL); (ii) the focal SNP affected the variance of gene expression levels (e.g., through a varQTL); (iii) the mean or variance of gene expression levels were affected by a variable unrelated to genotype (e.g., through batch, cell type, or environmental effects); and (iv) a variable unrelated to genotype affected the correlation structure of the entire transcriptome. None of these scenarios increased the false positive rate, though the presence of strong varQTLs did decrease power to detect correlation QTLs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Genotypic effects on co-expression could arise through several possible mechanisms. For example, a SNP that disrupts a transcription factor (TF) binding site in a promoter would lead to low levels of co-expression between the TF and the target gene, but only for individuals carrying the disrupting variant. In these individuals, increased expression of the TF would fail to increase expression of the target gene, leading to an association between SNP genotype and variation in co-expression. This is one mechanistic scenario that has been repeatedly proposed to generate variation in co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaiteri et al., 2014</xref>), with some empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nath et al., 2017</xref>).

We used a filtered set of 93,197 SNP genotypes and 33,302 gene expression measurements collected for 2477 individuals in our discovery dataset and 1337 individuals in our replication dataset (see Materials and methods). Because our dataset was not well-powered to test all possible pairwise combinations of gene expression measurements against all SNPs, and because we were interested in understanding co-expression patterns among genes important to metabolic diseases, we focused on the 475 probes most strongly associated with BMI. In total, we identified 484 associations between a SNP and variation in co-expression in our NESDA discovery dataset (at a 10% FDR threshold, corresponding to p&lt;4.6×10<sup>−9</sup>; linear model controlling for sex, age, smoking behavior, major depressive disorder, red blood cell counts, year of sample collection, study phase, and the first five principal components from a PCA on the filtered genotype call set). These 484 associations involved 247 unique probe sets and 51 genotyped SNP, each of which was involved in 1–424 (mean ±s.d.=3.91 ± 26.9) and 1–173 (mean ±s.d.=9.43 ± 34.1) correlation QTLs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40538.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CILP approach reveals hundreds of correlation QTLs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example of a correlation QTL, where the SNP rs10953329 controls the magnitude of the correlation between the mRNA expression levels of <italic>POC1B</italic> and <italic>RIOK3.</italic> (<bold>b</bold>) Gene pairs involved in significant (FDR &lt; 10%) correlation QTL.

First, we asked about the physical location of correlation QTLs relative to the genes for which they altered correlation structure (e.g., are the correlation QTLs acting in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>), as well as the degree to which correlations QTLs also had mean or variance effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we found that 73.76% of correlation QTL were located on the same chromosome as one of the two correlated genes, 14.57% were located on the same chromosome as both correlated genes, and 11.57% were acting in <italic>trans</italic> on both genes. Further, 87.81% of significant correlation QTL were also <italic>cis</italic> eQTL or varQTL for one of the correlated genes, but no correlation QTL had mean or variance effects on both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the set of genes involved in significant correlation QTLs were enriched for (i) particular biological processes and pathways (using Gene Ontology annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2004</xref>)), (ii) known TFs, or (iii) known targets of TFs. For analysis (ii) and (iii), we drew on a public database of known TF-target gene interactions created through sentence-based text-mining followed by manual curation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2015</xref>). We strongly expected genes involved in correlation QTLs to be enriched for TFs or known targets of TFs, given that the mechanisms that have been proposed to generate genetic effects on variation in correlation almost universally involve genotype-dependent TF activity or disruption of TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaiteri et al., 2014</xref>). In support of these ideas, genes involved in significant correlation QTLs were 1.90x more likely to be TFs (hypergeometric test, p=1.7×10<sup>−3</sup>) and 1.52x more likely to be known targets of transcription factors (p=6.7×10<sup>−4</sup>) relative to the background set of all genes tested. Additionally, genes involved in significant correlation QTLs were enriched for biological processes involved in metabolism and metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rani et al., 2016</xref>) such as cellular response to oxidative stress (hypergeometric test, odds ratio = 2.21, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), intracellular signal transduction (log<sub>2</sub> odds ratio = 1.44, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), and mitophagy (the selective degradation of mitochondria; log<sub>2</sub> odds ratio = 0.82, p=0.018; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-3"><title>Potential mechanisms generating correlation QTL</title><p>Many (87.81%) of the correlation QTL we uncovered involve three SNPs (rs1384673, rs333170, and rs829373), which have strong effects on the mean expression of one gene, <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The function of <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> is to convert the transcription factor <italic>RAP1</italic> from its active GTP-bound form to its inactive GDP-bound form, and genes involved in correlation QTL with <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> tend to be closer to <italic>RAP1</italic> binding sites (two-sided Wilcoxon-signed rank test, p=0.04) and to be bound <italic>in vivo</italic> by <italic>RAP1</italic> (Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 2.14, p=0.03; ChIP-seq data are from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez et al., 2010</xref>)). We hypothesize that the <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> correlation QTL ‘hotspot’ is thus generated because genotype controls whether <italic>RAP1</italic> and its targets are constitutively ‘on’ or ‘off’, and variation in <italic>RAP1</italic> activity levels only modulates the expression of <italic>RAP1</italic> target genes within the ‘on’ genotype (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition to uncovering a mechanism that can generate large-scale effects on correlation – specifically, cases where the targets of a given TF are constitutively repressed in one genotypic class, but dynamically regulated in another – this example is of interest because previous work has found evidence for converge of <italic>trans</italic> eQTL effects on <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> in whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fehrmann et al., 2011</xref>), and has also implicated <italic>RAP1</italic> in the development of insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaneko et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Though the correlation QTLs we uncovered near <italic>RAP1GAP</italic> were the only ‘hotspot’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we also found a number of other intriguing examples.

We note that in these cases the mechanism that induces a correlation QTL is unclear; nevertheless, our correlation QTL screen uncovers novel loci regulating the relationship between disease and metabolic genes that could be the focus of future follow-up work.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Patterns of transcriptional correlation are widely considered to arise from co-regulation between genes.

However, we still have a primitive understanding of the factors that shape correlations between genes. Specifically, how do environmental perturbations alter essential patterns of co-regulation? And, to what degree are some genotypes better than others at buffering these disruptive effects? To address these questions, we developed a novel, generalizable approach to test whether any predictor variable (e.g., environment, genotype, or another variable of interest) affects the degree of correlation between a pair of measured variables. This simple approach, which relies on calculating the product between two variables after normalization, allows us to produce an individual level estimate of correlation rather than a summary statistic for a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consequently, we are able to study correlation as a <italic>bona fide</italic> trait, and leverage the flexibility of statistical linear modeling approaches to identify factors associated with variation in correlation between individuals.</p><p>We begin by investigating the influence of two environmental perturbations on molecular co-regulation. First, we use data from a controlled experiment, where human monocytes were challenged with a simulated bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>). Second, we draw on a dataset of 159 metabolites collected from a population-based, longitudinal study of Finnish individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raitakari et al., 2008</xref>), and contrast correlation patterns between healthy individuals versus those suffering from metabolic syndrome. In both instances, we find that stressful environmental exposures (infection and disease) lead to decoherence, manifested as a widespread decrease in the magnitude of pairwise correlation coefficients between mRNA transcripts or metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although we expect the relationship between mRNA transcripts and metabolites to change following an environmental perturbation (e.g., both LPS stimulation and metabolic syndrome clearly affect mean gene expression or metabolite levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nath et al., 2017</xref>)), the consistent direction of effects we observe on the correlation is striking. Specifically, of all metabolite and mRNA transcript pairs that are significantly differentially correlated, there is a strong directional bias toward a decrease in correlation following the environmental perturbation: 61–74% of significant pairs follow this pattern. In other words, under stress, some genes and metabolites that are typically co-regulated no longer are. Similar biased loses in correlation have also been observed in miRNA pairs measured in the plasma of patients suffering from cognitive impairment versus healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kayano et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in gene expression data collected from aging versus young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Southworth et al., 2009</xref>) and in a wide range of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anglani et al., 2014</xref>). However, as this pattern has generally not been tested for explicitly, the degree to which it commonly characterizes disease, aging, or environmental perturbations remains to be seen.</p><p>The loss of transcriptional robustness we observe is an intuitive extension of decanalization models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson, 2009b</xref>). Decanalization models posit that, through many generations of stabilizing selection, biological systems evolve to maintain homeostasis under a certain range of environmental (or genetic) perturbations, and changing the environment beyond this range will result in homeostatic breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson, 2009b</xref>). This ‘breakdown’ has traditionally been thought of as an increase in variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson and Wagner, 2000</xref>), and we note that our discussion of decanalization as a change in correlation is a departure from traditional models. Nevertheless, we believe we are potentially seeing decanalization play out at the molecular level, where formerly co-regulated molecules become dysregulated following a shift in the environment. Importantly, the longitudinal nature of the YFS dataset allowed us to track the health status of the same individuals over time and test the hypothesis that decoherence at the molecular level is associated with disease risk. In support of decanalization models, we found that metabolite pairs that lose correlation following disease onset at the first-time point could be used to distinguish between perpetually healthy individuals and those that would develop disease later on. This set of metabolites are particularly interesting from a clinical perspective, as they appear to be especially sensitive to the homeostatic breakdown associated with metabolic syndrome, and could thus potentially serve as biomarkers.</p><p>In our final set of analyses, we investigated the role of genetic variation in driving variation in co-expression. To date, work on differential co-expression has largely focused on contrasts between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Dam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rotival and Petretto, 2014</xref>), between tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), or between individuals inhabiting different environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>), while the genetic basis of differential co-expression has received much less attention. Our ability to map correlation QTLs directly using CILP fills this gap, and reveals that correlation between mRNA transcripts is under genetic control. Our analyses build on three recent studies that came to similar conclusions using more indirect approaches and/or much smaller sample sizes. First, Nath et al. identified correlated groups of mRNA transcripts and metabolites (termed ‘modules’), and performed genome-wide scans to associate specific SNPs with variation in each module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nath et al., 2017</xref>). In a related analysis, Lukowski et al. demonstrated that mRNA transcripts with evidence for genetic correlations were more likely to be regulated by the same eQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lukowski et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, van der Wijst recently leveraged single-cell mRNA-seq data from 45 individuals to build personalized co-expression networks, and used these data to identify genetic variants that predicted inter-individual variation in correlation structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Wijst et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these studies point toward pervasive genetic control of co-expression, and CILP provides the tools to probe this form of regulation even further. In particular, mapping correlation QTLs across different environments, and compiling a more mechanistic picture of how genetic variation affects correlation dynamics (e.g., using ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq data integrated with correlation QTL scans) are major priorities for future work.</p><p>Our transcriptome analyses focused on pre-defined gene sets because of our need to limit the search space. In particular, we focused on differentially expressed or BMI-associated genes (in the Fairfax et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2014</xref>). and NESDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Penninx et al., 2008</xref>) datasets, respectively), because testing for variation in correlation across all genes expressed in a given tissue would require tens of millions of tests. Applying CILP using unbiased screens will require extremely large sample sizes to overcome the multiple testing burden. Importantly, power to detect variation in correlation using CLIP does increase with sample size. This would not be the case with other methods that compare group rather than individual-level variation in correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Fuente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Dam et al., 2017</xref>); for these methods, increasing sample size would increase the precision of the estimated correlation in a given group, but not directly the power to detect differential correlation.</p><p>Lastly, we focused on human genomics in this study because of the availability of large datasets with individual-level data. However, our study builds on extensive previous work in model systems investigating variation in co-expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2008</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Southworth et al., 2009</xref>), Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukushima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), and Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), all of which point to the critical importance of co-regulation in complex trait variation. The framework we outline here could be particularly useful in conjunction with a growing number of multi-parent mapping populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iraqi and Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Koning and McIntyre, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cubillos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pascual et al., 2016</xref>), which provide unprecedented statistical power in model systems. In particular, CILP paired with controlled manipulations in model systems could allow researchers to uncover genotype x environment effects on correlation, a problem that has been notoriously difficult to study in humans. Similarly, while here we focused exclusively on molecular traits, our approach could be paired with many additional data types. Moving beyond genetics, CILP could be used to identify the drivers of community level correlations in ecological datasets, tradeoffs (that manifest as negative correlations) between different fitness components or life history traits, and much more.

The 148 measures included molecules from 14 lipoprotein subclasses, two apolipoproteins, eight fatty acids, eight glycerides and phospholipids, nine cholesterols, nine amino acids, and ten small molecules (involved in glycolysis, as well as the citric acid and urea cycle). We refer to these metabolic measures as ‘metabolites’, but note they represent a more heterogenous set.

We used the follow features to generate the random forests: triglyceride levels, HDL cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, BMI, and sex. We removed individuals from the dataset that were not confidently assigned to either class (i.e., individuals for whom the probability of assignment to either class did not exceed 2/3) leaving us with the following sample sizes: n = 1564 in 2001, 1498 in 2007, and 1501 in 2011.

The parallel of this approach for mapping correlation QTLs would be to z-score normalize each transcript within each genotypic class before computing the product between two focal transcripts. Such an approach has the advantage of removing any mean or variance effects of the predictor variable on the outcome variables. However, this specific pipeline is infeasible for genome-wide QTL mapping, as it would require us to recalculate the outcome variable for every association test we performed (i.e., we would need to re-normalize each transcript pair and re-calculate the product every time we tested a new SNP for an association with correlation).

Our simulations confirm this intuition and show that the false positive rate does not exceed the expected 5% in the presence of increases in the mean or variance of expression levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we inferred 22 measures of cell type heterogeneity (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), and asked whether the correlation QTL results presented in the main text changed when cell type was regressed out of whole blood gene expression data prior to correlation QTL testing. To infer cell type proportions, we performed deconvolution by applying the program CIBERSORT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newman et al., 2015</xref>) to normalized gene expression data that had been corrected for batch effects (specifically, we regressed out year of sample collection and study phase and kept the residuals). We checked the accuracy of the deconvolution by comparing empirical and inferred estimates of the proportion of monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils (empirical measures of these 3 cell types were available for a subset of NESDA participants, n = 594). Across all 3 cell types, the empirical and inferred measures were highly correlated (Pearson correlations; monocytes: cor = 0.287, p=9.757×10<sup>−13</sup>, eosinophils: cor = 0.655, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>, neutrophils: cor = 0.652, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>). Finally, when we compared the p-values for the correlation effect obtained from the pipeline described in the main text, versus a pipeline that regressed out 22 measures of cell type heterogeneity from the gene expression data, the results were extremely similar (Pearson correlation, cor = 0.937, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Cell type proportion associations with BMI</title><p>Potential issue (ii) would also not produce false positive correlation QTL, but would complicate the biological interpretation of our results if we did not robustly identify BMI-associated genes. To explore this possibility, we gathered the dataset described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, which includes: seven empirical cell type proportion measures available for a subset of or all NESDA participants, 22 measures inferred through deconvolution as described above, and one measure inferred through PCA that is thought to be a proxy for reticulocyte count and has been previously associated with BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Preininger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wingo and Gibson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We used these 7 empirical and 23 inferred measures of cell type heterogeneity to test for an association between each measure of cell type composition and BMI, controlling for covariates (namely, sex, age, smoking behavior, diagnosis with major depressive disorder, year of sample collection, and study phase). BMI was associated most strongly with the PCA-based measure and with red blood cell counts, which was included as a covariate in all models presented in the main text (linear model, both p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; full results are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Importantly, however, these cell type associations with BMI generally did not change the relationship between BMI and gene expression among the set of genes tested for correlation QTLs: 84.2% of the transcripts we identified as BMI-associated in the absence of fine-grained cell-type data are still significantly associated with BMI when these covariates are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Genetic effects on cell type proportions</title><p>Finally, we used our set of 7 empirical and 23 inferred measures of cell type proportion to confirm that the correlation QTLs we identified are not in fact ‘proportion QTLs’ (i.e., we confirmed that SNPs that affect correlation do not also affect cell type proportion, which could produce false positives under scenario (iii); see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Across the 484 correlation QTLs we identify, we observed little evidence that genotype predicted cell type heterogeneity (using linear models that controlled for sex, age, smoking behavior, diagnosis with major depressive disorder, year of sample collection, and study phase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Only 2 SNPs were significantly (FDR &lt; 10%) associated with any measures of cell type proportion (rs139170 affects the proportion of plasma cells, p=3.38×10<sup>−4</sup>; rs2969125 affects the proportion of naïve CD4 +T cells, p=2.21×10<sup>−5</sup>). Importantly, in neither case are the expression levels of both transcripts also associated with cell type proportion, a condition that would be required to produce a false positive correlation QTL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the correlation QTLs we identified are likely not artifacts of cell type heterogeneity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The NESDA dataset is under controlled access due to confidentiality issues related to the handling of human subjects data, as indicated in the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter, peer reviews, and accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[<bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetic and environmental perturbations lead to regulatory decoherence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal identity: Greg Gibson (Reviewer #1). The other reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers, and I, are convinced of the value of your approach (as one reviewer points out, this is long overdue). We do indeed have a limited understanding of the factors that shape correlations between genes and your work addresses this problem. In particular your observation that decoherent metabolites are good predictors is noteworthy, as is your successful identification of 'correlation-QTLs'. Though perhaps it is not surprising that the degree of correlation is under genetic control, it's certainly good to have that confirmed and analysed, as you have done here. Altogether, your paper represents an important advance.</p><p>I want to highlight one issue, to do with unacknowledged confounds. As one of the reviewers points out, the inclusion of expression data from multi-cellular tissues like blood is problematic, and I expected you might incorporate into your method one of the more recent analytical approaches to decompose the contributions (e.g. Nat Methods. 2017 Feb 28;14(3):218-219. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4190). Would that improve the signal?</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript on decoherence by Amanda Lee and colleagues presents a novel, and in my view long over-due, framework for considering decay of modularity of gene expression in disease conditions (among other applications). Alternative approaches describing statistical support for conservation of modules do not have resolution to individual transcripts or metabolites, so this approach holds considerable promise. I thought that the Introduction and Discussion sections were particularly insightful. I also applaud <italic>eLife</italic> for the experiment in &quot;acceptance prior to review&quot; and am happy to support this in this case. I hope that two more major sets of comments, followed by some minor ones, are helpful to the authors.</p><p>My first comment goes to the transparency of the description of CILP and its relationship to canalization. I think the way it is presented is overly complicated. If I am not mistaken, CILP is simply a t-test (or potentially ANOVA) of the Pearson correlation coefficients for all pairs of biomarkers in an analysis. The formula at the start of the Results section is that quantity, but then you say it is correlate with some random variable x. In actuality x is a fixed effect in all your comparisons, and it would be clearer to call it a test of association with x since it is the biomarkers that are being correlated. Furthermore, in Figure 3 you switch to the Spearman correlation, which I can see being appropriate, but is at odds with the rest of the description. Also to this point, canalization is commonly used in reference to increase in variance, which I can see could lead to de-coherence, but that is neither necessary nor sufficient, and this could be remarked upon.</p><p>My second comment has to do with the effect of unaccounted for factors on covariance. All transcriptomes and metabolomes have a high correlation structure, due to a combination of trans-acting influences, environmental influences, and mixtures of cell types. As far as I can see, the opening simulation study does not incorporate overall correlation, it only models pairwise effects due to cis-acting variation and correlation-QTL as defined by the authors. This should be acknowledged: it is extremely hard to model true transcriptional variation, but I suspect it makes a big difference. (Parenthetically, why call the cis effects b1 and b2, and the correlation effects b – another symbol for the latter would also be less confusing). Regarding the blood gene expression datasets, in the Materials and methods you consider the possibility that cell-type mixtures matter but don't find any influence of available cell counts. However, I can tell you from extensive experience that the major impact on whole blood gene expression in relation to BMI is reticulocyte count, which surprisingly is unrelated to RBC count, but if you fit Axis 2 from Preininger et al. (PMID: 23516379), renamed as Axis R in PMID: 29950172 and PMID: 30223463 and shown to strongly associate with BMI in PMID: 25300922 and PMID: 23162571 and countless other studies we've looked at, it is basically reticulocyte count. I certainly am not asking you to reference these studies (!) but do suggest you fit Axis 2 and see if it has an effect, because it is one of the major components of whole blood expression. I agree that the other Axes that correlate with B and T cell or Neutrophils only weakly associate with BMI.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Here are a few more minor comments:</p><p>Figure 2. Panel (C) described in the Legend has been removed from the version in the manuscript</p><p>LPS study: Need to reference the Fairfax et al. dataset, in the text (you don't do so until the Discussion). Also note that they describe a number of eQTL that have significantly different effects at BL, 2hr LPS, and 24hr LPS, some switching between the two exposure times. Do your correlation QTL tend to be the same, or overlap with, those instances?</p><p>Metabolic study. It is not clear from the text whether the results in Figure 3A to 3C are from t0 or from a combined analysis. I suspect just t0, please clarify. But I am also concerned that there may be inflation of the prediction of disease progression in Figure 3D due to use of the discovery dataset in the testing phase (winner's curse), especially if you used t1 and t3 in the discovery. (There will in any case be a bias due to correlations across times within individuals). I'd rather see a more robust analysis that uses a subset of the individuals and then predicts expression in the remainder – there should be sufficient sample size for this.</p><p>Subsection “Identification of disease-associated variation in metabolite correlation”, instead of stating the percentages of the subset of genes (74.4 and 25.6), state the percentages of all genes, it will still be 3:1.</p><p>Is there any indication that the transcripts that encode the enzymes that regulate the de-coherent metabolite sets are also de-coherent? I guess you may need data of both types from the same individuals, or from liver.</p><p>Regarding the correlation QTLs in NESDA, the first thing I think you should report is what fraction of them are also main effect cis-eQTL for one or the other transcript in each pair. Concerning RAP1GAP specifically, is it a trans-eQTL hotspot (I have some vague recollection that it may be, in blood). The enrichment statistics for its binding sites do not convince me at all: P&lt;0.03 is a bit of a joke, and fibroblasts are not relevant, I don't think that result helps at all. Regarding the TF enrichment, I think you need to define what you mean by &quot;involved in&quot; since we now know that the locally regulated gene is usually not the closest one.</p><p>Finally, it would be interesting to know what happens to the expression in individuals who do not fall into the Healthy or MetS classes. Such ambiguous cases may have even more extreme de-coherence as they are transitional, at least at one of the time points. If the result is interesting it could be worth reporting.</p><p>Thanks for the opportunity to review such an interesting manuscript. Good luck with it.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>If the authors address some of the comments above, they will be addressing some rigor and reproducibility issues. I do not see a need for additional files.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this work, the authors start to investigate the potential for using the correlation between genes/metabolites as a distinct trait that may be parsable from the mean and variance of the same components. Overall, the approach seems solid albeit at points the strongest available support does not seem to be being used which does hinder the papers potential broad appeal. It is as if the need to write to clinical geneticists has slightly hamstrung the authors from really diving into the concepts that are actually very interesting and thought provoking. I have some specific questions and changes below.</p><p>On a general note, the paper is written in the general where this approach and its inferences are possibly of use in non-human systems. However, there isn't an obvious effort to discuss work in other systems, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yeast, Arabidopsis, Maize, etc, that might influence the ideas and conclusions of this paper. There is similar work in these systems (See below) that touches on these topics and if the goal is really a broad audience they should be cited. If the goal is just a human audience than every term should be caveated by the word human, i.e. evolutionary genetics should be human evolutionary genetics, biology should be human biology, etc. Human Genetics can benefit from reading and acknowledging the work in other systems especially as Human Genetics greatly benefits from the of excellent young senior authors who come from other systems like <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In the Introduction, the authors say &quot;asking whether predefined sets of genes are differentially co-expressed between groups. Almost universally, these approaches are only designed for comparisons between two groups, and none can accommodate continuous predictor variables.&quot; Isn't that really only true of some approaches for the predefined set? There are groups that use the predefined sets in nested generalized models that can be extended to any complex experimental design and can include confounders and covariates. Maybe not in human genetics but at the very least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Arabidopsis. This should probably be tempered.</p><p>In the first section on permutation analysis (Table 1). Because of the lack of replication on individuals, VarQTLs in human genetics are a blend of all non-additive sources of variance, especially epistasis and stochasticity. Is there a difference in how epistatic variance or stochastic variance influences the claims made in this section? I ask because mechanistically it would be possible for stochastic variance to be more localized to the gene in question and not spread to other genes while epistatic variance could influence the whole network.</p><p>In the section on immunity, what was the reasoning behind limiting their analysis to the 1460 genes that were differentially expressed at the 2 hour time point? I would think that the power of the correlation approach would be that it could get more directly at the interaction term than limit itself to single timepoint selection. This choice should be explained. Especially as I wonder if this choice could create the appearance of decoherence as it does not allow for genes showing a difference at the other time points but not at 24 hours.</p><p>The RAP1GAP focus of the final section of the results has me slightly off-kilter. The authors argue for correlation being separable from other traits but then the key example is a gene with a large effect cis polymorphism. This could lead to a change in correlation by shifting genes from regulated by RAP1GAP when RAP1GAP is well expressed to no-correlation when there is low to no RAP1GAP simply because RAP1GAP is not functional. I agree that this is a real observation and does show some utility of their approach. But it would be very helpful to provide some insight of the approaches ability to get at the deeper questions that drive this manuscript. Like some examples of TF-Target correlations that were affected by trans polymorphisms. Or even metabolic gene-metabolic gene correlations that mapped to novel loci. This would help illuminate how much novel information this approach is finding.</p><p>I may be wrong but if the authors ideas about decoherence are true, shouldn't this predict that the slope in Figure 3B is less than 1? I.e. there is lower general metabolite to metabolite correlation in the y-axis (metabolic syndrome) than in the x-axis (healthy). As such, it seems that the most direct use of this data to support their conclusion would be to test if the slope is significantly lower than 1 as my interpretation of the model predicts. The rest of the information in this section seems superfluous to the idea it is trying to test.</p><p>As a small aside, there has been some work in Arabidopsis on how endogenous single gene mutants can or cannot change the correlational network in response to immune stresses similar to what is proposed in Figure 1A/B and Figure 2. These citations help to support the claim that correlation is a genetically separable trait [1,2].

Would that improve the signal?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gene expression is cell type specific, and analyses of whole blood transcriptome data can thus be problematic. For our correlation QTL analyses (performed using whole blood expression data) there are two potential concerns, described below.</p><p>Concern #1: Whole blood gene expression levels are predicted by cell type composition. This is almost certainly true; however, while the presence of cell type effects alone may add noise and reduce our power to map correlation QTL, they cannot produce false positives unless they are connected to genotype. We demonstrate this through new simulations presented in revised Table 1. Specifically, we performed simulations where a variable that is random with respect to genotype affects the mean or variance of gene expression levels; in practice, this variable could be cell type composition, or an environmental or batch effect (see revised Table 1, paragraph two of subsection “Simulations reveal power to detect sources of variance in correlation across many scenarios”). In addition, to explore the effects of cell type composition in the NESDA dataset, we performed deconvolution and reanalyzed our correlation QTL after regressing out inferred cell type proportions from the gene expression data. Here, we find that our correlation QTL results are robust to correction for cell type heterogeneity (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Concern #2: False positive correlation QTL are produced by genetic effects on cell type heterogeneity. Specifically, if genotype affects cell type proportions, and the pair of genes tested for correlation QTL are expressed in a cell type specific manner, then individuals of a given genotype would have high expression levels of the two focal genes (and thus high values of their product) because of variation in cell composition, rather than genotypic effects on correlation. For the correlation QTL pipeline we used in the main text, this scenario would produce false positive correlation QTL. To examine this possibility in the NESDA dataset, we used inferred/deconvoluted measures of cell type heterogeneity to confirm that the correlation QTL we identified are not in fact ‘proportion QTL’ (i.e., we confirm that SNPs that affect correlation do not also affect cell type proportion). These results are presented in new Figure 4—figure supplement 6 and Supplementary file 9 (see also subsection “Genetic effects on cell type proportions”). Finally, it is worth pointing out that this source of error is not unique to correlation QTL, but is a common issue in even the most rigorous eQTL studies that use heterogenous tissues: specifically, if a gene is expressed in a cell type-specific manner, then any SNP affecting cell type proportion will be identified as a false eQTL.</p><p>We have greatly expanded the Materials and methods section titled ‘Cell type heterogeneity-related confounds’ to address the concerns described here, as well as a question from reviewer #1 about the relationship between cell type heterogeneity and BMI (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] My first comment goes to the transparency of the description of CILP and its relationship to canalization.

However, there seems to be some confusion as CLIP does not involve a t-test on Pearson correlations, but instead uses the product of two traits to generate a vector of correlation values that are specific to each individual. This vector is then modeled as a function of some predictor variable of interest. We’ve added additional text to the Introduction (third paragraph) to clarify the specifics of the method. We hope this clears up the confusion. We note that we do use Pearson correlations in Figure 3, but only for visualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also to this point, canalization is commonly used in reference to increase in variance, which I can see could lead to de-coherence, but that is neither necessary nor sufficient, and this could be remarked upon.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, we’ve added text to the Discussion (paragraph four) regarding this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My second comment has to do with the effect of unaccounted for factors on covariance.

The end result of all of these inputs (if they are orthogonal to the predictor variable of interest) would be to affect the mean or variance of each transcript and potentially reduce power. To explore this idea, we simulated a predictor variable (e.g., a batch or environmental effect) that affects the mean and variance of gene expression levels and evaluated our power to detect correlation QTL (see revised Table 1, subsection “Simulations reveal power to detect sources of variance in correlation across many scenarios”). In addition, we explicitly simulated batch effects on transcriptome correlation structure, and assessed our ability to detect variation in correlation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). These new simulations confirm our intuition: batch or environmental effects that change the mean or variance of gene expression levels, or that affect correlation structure, can reduce power. However, these effects do not produce false positive results if the batch/environmental effect is orthogonal to the predictor variable of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(Parenthetically, why call the cis effects b1 and b2, and the correlation effects b – another symbol for the latter would also be less confusing).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed these symbols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the blood gene expression datasets, in the Materials and methods you consider the possibility that cell-type mixtures matter but don't find any influence of available cell counts.

We note that our motivation for identifying BMI-associated genes was simply to limit the search space for correlation QTL mapping. While we agree we could more robustly identify BMI-associated genes if we accounted for cell type proportion, exploring BMI effects on transcription is not our main goal. Nevertheless, to understand how robust our set of BMI-associated genes are, we fit Axis 2 and found that it does indeed correlate with BMI (described in Supplementary file 8; subsection “Cell type proportion associations with BMI”). We’ve also added new analyses where we use deconvolution to estimate the proportion of 22 leukocyte cell types, and we checked whether these more fine-grained measures of cell type heterogeneity influence BMI. In general, the transcripts we originally identified as BMI-associated are still significant after accounting for cell type, though some of our original BMI-transcript associations do appear to be mediated by Axis 2/reticulocyte count variation (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 5 and Supplementary file 8, see also subsection “Cell type proportion associations with BMI”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Here are a few more minor comments:</p><p>Figure 2.

Almost universally, these approaches are only designed for comparisons between two groups, and none can accommodate continuous predictor variables.&quot; Isn't that really only true of some approaches for the predefined set? There are groups that use the predefined sets in nested generalized models that can be extended to any complex experimental design and can include confounders and covariates. Maybe not in human genetics but at the very least in Drosophila and Arabidopsis. This should probably be tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a rich literature on the analysis of differential correlation. We previously pointed to a review on this topic, but have now added primary references to place our work in context (Introduction paragraph two), including many references from model organism work. However, to our knowledge, these studies still rely on population-level estimates of correlation coefficients as opposed to the individual-level metric we describe in this manuscript. Without an approach to model an individual-level metric, individual-level covariates (e.g., age, sex) cannot be accounted for. We have revised the Introduction to make it clear that this is the type of covariate/confounder accounting we are referring to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the first section on permutation analysis (Table 1). Because of the lack of replication on individuals, VarQTLs in human genetics are a blend of all non-additive sources of variance, especially epistasis and stochasticity. Is there a difference in how epistatic variance or stochastic variance influences the claims made in this section? I ask because mechanistically it would be possible for stochastic variance to be more localized to the gene in question and not spread to other genes while epistatic variance could influence the whole network.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that genetic effects on gene expression variance (i.e., varQTLs) are an important potential mechanism that may contribute to or interact with corQTL. Our simulations (Table 1) show that the presence of varQTLs do not produce false positive corQTL, though they do substantially reduce power. To understand the role of varQTLs in our empirical data, we used dGLM to ask whether any of the corQTL we identified are also varQTL. We find a handful of examples, and describe these results in subsection “General characteristics of correlation QTLs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the section on immunity, what was the reasoning behind limiting their analysis to the 1460 genes that were differentially expressed at the 2 hour time point? I would think that the power of the correlation approach would be that it could get more directly at the interaction term than limit itself to single timepoint selection. This choice should be explained. Especially as I wonder if this choice could create the appearance of decoherence as it does not allow for genes showing a difference at the other time points but not at 24 hours.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that analyzing correlations among all genes, rather than just a subset, would be ideal. However, the sample size for the Fairfax et al. dataset is rather modest (n=214 individuals assayed across time points). Given that we tested for LPS effects on correlation across all possible gene pairs in a given set, interrogating the entire transcriptome would result in too many tests for the sample size at hand (e.g., interrogating pairwise correlations across 10,000 genes would involve 49,995,000 tests). In the future, larger datasets will be very useful for exploring correlations across the entire transcriptome. We point out the degree to which the testing burden scales with the number of genes analyzed in paragraph six of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The RAP1GAP focus of the final section of the results has me slightly off-kilter.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused the final section on RAP1GAP specifically, because 425/484 (88%) of the correlation QTL we identify involve this gene. For the subset of genes we tested for correlation QTL, a handful of RAP1GAP cis eQTL appear to be master regulators of large scale correlation structure. We felt it was therefore necessary to provide information about this gene and a potential mechanism. We have however shortened this section substantially, and have added additional examples to highlight other mechanisms that may generate correlation QTL (subsection “Potential mechanisms generating correlation QTL”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors argue for correlation being separable from other traits but then the key example is a gene with a large effect cis polymorphism. This could lead to a change in correlation by shifting genes from regulated by RAP1GAP when RAP1GAP is well expressed to no-correlation when there is low to no RAP1GAP simply because RAP1GAP is not functional. I agree that this is a real observation and does show some utility of their approach. But it would be very helpful to provide some insight of the approaches ability to get at the deeper questions that drive this manuscript. Like some examples of TF-Target correlations that were affected by trans polymorphisms. Or even metabolic gene-metabolic gene correlations that mapped to novel loci. This would help illuminate how much novel information this approach is finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the main example highlights the utility of our approach. We have added new text (subsection “Potential mechanisms generating correlation QTL”) to highlight additional examples, such as trans regulation of correlation for: (i) gene pairs annotated for involvement in the same GO terms (e.g., GLRX5 and RPS29); (ii) TF-TF target gene pairs (e.g., GATA2 and RAB24); and disease-associated genes pairs (e.g., SLC4A1 and TPM1). We note that in many cases the exact mechanism linking two genes involved in a correlation QTL is unclear, but our approach does map many novel loci regulating key disease and metabolic genes that could be mechanistically investigated in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I may be wrong but if the authors ideas about decoherence are true, shouldn't this predict that the slope in Figure 3B is less than 1? I.e. there is lower general metabolite to metabolite correlation in the y-axis (metabolic syndrome) than in the x-axis (healthy). As such, it seems that the most direct use of this data to support their conclusion would be to test if the slope is significantly lower than 1 as my interpretation of the model predicts. The rest of the information in this section seems superfluous to the idea it is trying to test.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, your intuition is correct, and we did not initially test this. We’ve added text to point out that the slope of the line in Figure 3B is &lt;1 for all points (β=0.814) and especially for just significant points (β=0.597; see revised legend for Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a small aside, there has been some work in Arabidopsis on how endogenous single gene mutants can or cannot change the correlational network in response to immune stresses similar to what is proposed in Figure 1A/B and Figure 2. These citations help to support the claim that correlation is a genetically separable trait [1,2]. I'm sure there are likely other similar citations in yeast and Drosophila.</p><p>1) Mine A, Seyfferth C, Kracher B, Berens ML, Becker D, Tsuda K: The Defense Phytohormone Signaling Network Enables Rapid, High-amplitude Transcriptional Reprogramming During Effector-Triggered Immunity. 2018.</p><p>2) Zhang W, Corwin JA, Copeland D, Feusier J, Eshbaugh R, Chen F, Atwell S, Kliebenstein DJ: Plastic transcriptomes stabilize immunity to pathogen diversity: The jasmonic acid and salicylic acid networks within the Arabidopsis/Botrytis pathosystem.
