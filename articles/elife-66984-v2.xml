Antigen encountered by B-cells is often tightly associated with the surface of pathogens and/or antigen-presenting cells. Internalization of such antigens requires myosin-mediated traction forces and extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes, but the mechanism triggering lysosomal exocytosis is unknown. Here, we show that BCR-mediated recognition of antigen tethered to beads, to planar lipid-bilayers or expressed on cell surfaces causes localized plasma membrane (PM) permeabilization, a process that requires BCR signaling and non-muscle myosin II activity. B-cell permeabilization triggers PM repair responses involving lysosomal exocytosis, and B-cells permeabilized by surface-associated antigen internalize more antigen than cells that remain intact. Higher affinity antigens cause more B-cell permeabilization and lysosomal exocytosis and are more efficiently presented to T-cells. Thus, PM permeabilization by surface-associated antigen triggers a lysosome-mediated B-cell resealing response, providing the extracellular hydrolases that facilitate antigen internalization and presentation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>surface antigen</kwd><kwd>resealing</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM064625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Norma W</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Wenxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM080201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Haaren</surname><given-names>Jurriaan JH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The strength by which mouse B-cells bind surface-associated antigen determines how much their plasma membrane is permeabilized and also the extent of a resealing response involving lysosomal exocytosis, which promotes antigen extraction for intracellular processing and T-cell presentation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B-cells are responsible for generating antibody responses that neutralize pathogens and attract other immune cells. B-cell activation is initiated by the B-cell receptor (BCR), which surveys antigen through its membrane-anchored immunoglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reth, 1994</xref>). Antigen-BCR interaction induces signaling cascades and antigen internalization, followed by intracellular processing and surface presentation to T-cells. Antigen presentation is essential for the activation of B-cells and their differentiation into high-affinity memory or antibody-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shlomchik and Weisel, 2012</xref>). A property that is critical for maximizing humoral protection is the ability of clonal-specific BCRs to recognize antigens in their different physical, chemical, and biological forms.</p><p>Antigen encountered by B-cells in vivo is often tightly associated with the surface of pathogens, such as parasites, bacteria, and viruses, and/or antigen-presenting cells, such as follicular dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>). Internalization, processing, and presentation of such surface-bound antigens are essential for specific B-cells to obtain T-cell help, which is critical for B-cell activation and differentiation. Follicular dendritic cells, which are uniquely present in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, internalize antigens that drain into these organs and present them to B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cyster, 2010</xref>). Competition between high and low-affinity B-cells to acquire antigen from follicular dendritic cells is a critical step in the selection of high-affinity cells that differentiate into memory B-cells and long-lived plasma cells.</p><p>B-cells, follicular B-cells in particular, are thought to have a limited ability to phagocytose large insoluble antigen particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vidard et al., 1996</xref>). However, B-cells are able to extract and endocytose antigen that is tightly associated with non-internalizable surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista and Neuberger, 2000</xref>). Importantly, the efficiency of antigen presentation by B-cells appears to depend more strongly on the BCR-antigen binding affinity when the antigen is associated with non-internalizable surfaces, compared to antigen bound to internalizable particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista and Neuberger, 2000</xref>). Recent studies using antigen-coated beads, planar lipid bilayers, or plasma membrane (PM) sheets revealed two major mechanisms by which B-cells extract antigen from non-internalizable surfaces for endocytosis. Mechanical forces, generated by non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activation at sites of antigen-BCR interaction, can directly pull antigen from presenting surfaces for endocytosis. When mechanical forces alone are not sufficient, hydrolases released from lysosomes cleave surface-associated antigen to facilitate internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spillane and Tolar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). Surface-associated antigen was previously shown to induce polarization of B-cell lysosomes towards antigen-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>), but the mechanism responsible for triggering lysosome exocytosis and release of hydrolytic enzymes was unknown.</p><p>When cells are permeabilized by physical tearing or pore-forming proteins, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers rapid exocytosis of lysosomes as part of the process that repairs the PM and prevents cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>). Since its discovery several decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodríguez et al., 1997</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis of lysosomes has been observed in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naegeli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Villeneuve et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ibata et al., 2019</xref>). We previously reported that permeabilization of the PM of mouse splenic B-cells with the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO) triggers lysosomal exocytosis, releasing hydrolases extracellularly and exposing the luminal epitope of the lysosome-associated protein LIMP-2 on the cell surface. B-cells rapidly reseal these PM lesions in a process that requires lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, in this study, we found that interaction of the BCR with surface-associated antigen can permeabilize the mouse primary B-cell PM, triggering a resealing mechanism that involves exocytosis of lysosomes. We investigated this process by determining if antigen-induced PM permeabilization depends on the BCR-antigen-binding affinity, BCR signaling and NMII motor activity, and if it influences the ability of B-cells to internalize and present surface-associated antigens to T-cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BCR interaction with surface-associated antigen induces B-cell PM permeabilization at antigen-binding sites</title><p>We initially utilized two experimental models previously used to study BCR-mediated internalization of surface-associated antigen: F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>-anti-mouse IgM+ G (αM, which binds and activates mouse BCRs) immobilized on beads or tethered to planar lipid bilayers (PLB) by biotin-streptavidin interaction. Beads or PLB coated with transferrin (Tf) at similar surface density as αM were used as controls, as Tf does not activate the BCR and interacts with the Tf receptor with similar affinity as the <italic>bona fide</italic> antigen hen egg lysozyme (HEL) binds to the BCR of transgenic MD4 mouse B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batista and Neuberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs and Gessner, 2002</xref>). Strikingly, live imaging revealed influx of the membrane-impermeable dye propidium iodide (PI) at sites of mouse splenic B-cell contact with αM-beads, indicating that PM permeabilization occurred at bead-binding locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). While similar percentages of B-cells bound αM- or Tf-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a significantly higher fraction of B-cells binding αM-beads became PI-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the increased PI entry in B-cells binding αM-beads when compared to Tf-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Addition of soluble F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>-anti-mouse IgM+ G (sαM, also capable of binding and activating the BCR) did not increase the frequency of PI entry in B-cells binding to Tf-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The percentage of cells positive for cleaved caspase-3, an early apoptotic marker, was similar in B-cells interacting or not with αM- or Tf-beads and only increased significantly after treatment with staurosporine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that PM permeabilization is not associated with apoptosis. Similar observations were made using the PLB system that allows lateral movement of the tethered antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dustin et al., 2007</xref>).

These fluorescent dyes have been used extensively to assess PM integrity, because they only label the outer PM leaflet of intact cells but rapidly stain intracellular membranes when entering the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bansal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNeil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demonbreun et al., 2019</xref>). After &gt;30 min of interaction with αM-PLB, we observed sudden, massive increases in FM1-43 staining of intracellular membranes, including the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Consistent with the PI entry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), significantly more B-cells showed a sudden increase in intracellular FM staining when contacting αM-PLB compared to Tf-PLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). This characteristic pattern of sudden FM influx with staining of the nuclear envelope was only observed in B-cells that eventually became PI-positive, not in cells that remained PI-negative during interaction with αM-PLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since FM lipophilic dyes can also be internalized through surface receptor endocytosis, we activated BCR endocytosis by cross-linking surface BCRs using soluble F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> goat-anti-mouse IgM+ G antibodies followed by fluorescent F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> anti-goat-IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogeboom and Tolar, 2016</xref>). Under these conditions, which did not cause PM permeabilization, we observed FM1-43 uptake appearing as small peripheral puncta that colocalized with BCR cross-linking antibodies. Such endosome-associated FM1-43 staining pattern was markedly different from the sudden, massive FM influx observed shortly before PI entry in permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Collectively, these data show that the sudden, massive influx of FM dyes during αM-PLB binding is caused by B-cell permeabilization, and not by a gradual endocytosis of the PM-associated tracer triggered by BCR engagement.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-66984-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Surface-associated ligand induces B-cell permeabilization and massive FM influx, while soluble ligand does not cause permeabilization but induces endocytosis, detected as puncta at the cell periphery.</title><p>Top: B-cells pre-labeled with FM1-43 (green) were added to αM-PLB (surface-associated ligand).

Instead of monitoring nuclear or intracellular membrane staining by membrane-impermeable fluorescent dyes, we determined the percentage of B-cells pre-loaded with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) that lost their cytosolic fluorescence as a consequence of Ponceau 4R entry during PM permeabilization. To validate this method, we first permeabilized B-cells with the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO). In the presence of Ponceau 4R, the percentage of B-cells with reduced CFSE fluorescence increased significantly after exposure to SLO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), mimicking what we previously observed for PI entry in SLO-treated B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, quenching of cytoplasmic CFSE by the membrane-impermeable Ponceau 4R is a potent indicator of PM permeabilization. Using this method, we compared B-cells incubated with αM- or Tf-PLB by live imaging. A significantly higher fraction of CFSE-labeled B-cells showed fluorescence quenching when interacting with αM-PLB, quantified as the percentage of cells that lost &gt;70% of their initial CFSE fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The average time for detection of αM-PLB-induced B-cell permeabilization measured by this quenching method was similar to what was observed for FM entry, while the average time for intracellular detection of PI showed a ~ 8 min delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). An analysis of the cumulative rate of influx of the three distinct tracers confirmed the small delay in PI detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, FM influx and Ponceau 4R-mediated quenching are more sensitive methods for detecting the onset of B-cell PM permeabilization when compared to PI influx, which is only clearly visualized after intercalation into double-stranded DNA inside the nucleus. Based on consistent results obtained with three different methods, we conclude that BCR binding to αM-coated surfaces (but not to soluble αM) causes localized permeabilization of the B-cell PM.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Extracellular Ponceau 4R quenches cytoplasmic CFSE in αM-PLB-permeabilized B-cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry histograms of CFSE FI in B-cells incubated with or without SLO for 10 min in the presence or absence of Ponceau 4R, showing 8500 cells per condition.

Importantly, transmembrane mHEL-GFP expressed on the surface of live COS-7 cells co-clustered with the BCR at sites of interaction with MD4 B-cells, followed by PI influx.

The MD4 BCR binds DEL-I with &gt;100 fold lower affinity than it binds HEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langley et al., 2017</xref>).

After contact with αM-PLB or αM-beads but not Tf-PLB or Tf-beads, surface BCRs became polarized toward PLB- or bead-binding sites within ~10 min, a period markedly shorter than what is required for detection of PM permeabilization through FM influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).

To determine if permeabilization by surface-associated αM or HEL triggered exocytosis of lysosomes in B-cells, we first examined whether luminal epitopes of the lysosomal membrane protein LIMP-2 were exposed on the cell surface. Flow cytometry detected surface LIMP-2 in a higher percentage of B-cells binding αM-beads than in B-cells binding Tf-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

Resealed cells were quantified by flow cytometry as the percentage of permeabilized cells binding αM-beads (stained intracellularly with FM4-64 kept throughout the assay) that excluded the membrane-impermeable dye SYTOX Blue (added only during the last 10 min of the assay) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Under these conditions, ~50 % of B-cells permeabilized by surface-associated antigen resealed their PM within the assay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis with bromoenol lactone (BEL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fensome-Green et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2010</xref>) significantly reduced the percentage of resealed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We found no evidence that the reduction in resealed cells after BEL treatment was due to toxicity of this inhibitor. B-cell populations with low forward-scatter versus side-scatter values typical of dead cells did not increase after BEL treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Exposure to BEL also did not increase the small fraction ( &lt; 7%) of Tf-bead-binding B-cells that was permeable to SYTOX Blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that lysosomal exocytosis is required for the resealing of B-cells permeabilized by binding to surface-associated antigen. To confirm that individual antigen-permeabilized B-cells resealed, we used live imaging to visualize cells incubated with αM-PLB in the presence of SYTOX Green. PI was then added for the last 10 min of the 4 hr incubation. Time-lapse images showed that B-cells that became permeable to SYTOX Green during interaction with αM-PLB subsequently excluded PI – a direct indication that their PM resealed during the 4 hr assay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>).

These results indicate that B-cell permeabilization resulting from high-affinity antigen-BCR interaction, with its corresponding lysosomal exocytosis response, facilitates the presentation of antigen associated with non-internalizable surfaces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes by B-cells was previously proposed to cleave antigens tightly associated with non-internalizable surfaces, facilitating internalization and presentation to T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spillane and Tolar, 2017</xref>). However, it was unclear which mechanism was responsible for inducing lysosomal enzyme release when B-cells engaged insoluble antigen. In this study, we show that interaction of the BCR with surface-associated antigen can permeabilize the B-cell PM, triggering lysosomal exocytosis as part of the PM repair response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodríguez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>). Antigen-dependent PM permeabilization occurs at antigen-binding sites and is reversible under conditions that allow lysosomal exocytosis. We further demonstrate that PM permeabilization and lysosomal exocytosis require high-affinity binding of the BCR to antigen, BCR signaling and activation of NMII motor activity, and that this process facilitates antigen internalization, processing, and presentation. Thus, our study identifies a critical novel step in the affinity-dependent process by which B-cells capture antigen tightly associated with surfaces, for effective internalization and subsequent presentation to T-cells.</p><p>Capture and internalization of antigen tightly associated with surfaces is an important immunological process, as B-cells encounter this type of antigen in vivo on parasites, bacteria and viruses, as well as immune cells such as follicular dendritic cells. Follicular dendritic cells capture antigen drained into lymph nodes and present it on their surface to germinal center B-cells. In this manner, follicular dendritic cells enhance BCR antigenic stimulation by increasing antigen avidity, in addition to providing costimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natarajan et al., 2001</xref>). While the exact percentage is unknown, studies have suggested that the majority of antigens that B-cells encounter in vivo are in a membrane-associated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Batista and Harwood, 2009</xref>). Importantly, the capture, internalization, and presentation of such surface-associated antigens to T-cells play a critical role in selecting specific B-cells for survival, clonal expansion and differentiation into long-lived high-affinity memory B-cells and antibody-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gitlin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that B-cell PM permeabilization induced by surface-associated antigen depends on the motor activity of NMII. Following BCR polarization, activated NMII accumulates at sites of B-cell binding to αM- or HEL-beads or PLB before permeabilization occurs. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that internalization of surface-associated but not soluble antigen requires NMII-mediated traction forces at antigen-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spillane and Tolar, 2018</xref>). Collectively, our results support the notion that NMII-mediated traction forces generated during BCR-antigen interaction are responsible for permeabilization of the B-cell PM. Whether this permeabilization is due to tearing of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>) or the opening of mechanosensitive membrane channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Ganguly, 2019</xref>) is currently unknown. However, our finding that three distinct membrane-impermeable probes, PI, FM lipophilic dyes, and Ponceau 4R readily gain access to the cytosol after B-cell interaction with surface-associated antigen suggest that NMII-mediated membrane tearing is the mechanism underlying antigen-dependent B-cell PM permeabilization. In this context, it is noteworthy that Endophilin A2, a protein that facilitates the resealing of PM wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corrotte et al., 2020</xref>), also contributes to BCR-mediated internalization of membrane-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malinova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We were initially surprised to observe B-cell PM permeabilization during BCR-mediated binding of surface-associated antigen, a process that is known to generate myosin-mediated forces as a mechanism to capture antigen. To confirm that permeabilization occurs, we utilized three different membrane-impermeable probes, two types of BCR ligands, and three types of presenting surfaces. All generated similar results. We first detected B-cell permeabilization during interaction with surface-associated antigen by following the entry of membrane-impermeable DNA-binding or lipophilic dyes. While these compounds bind to different intracellular structures, both showed sudden rather than gradual increases in intracellular staining, consistent with PM permeabilization. To strengthen these results, we designed an independent assay based on the ability of Ponceau 4R to enter B-cells and quench the fluorescence of CFSE, a widely used vital dye that covalently labels cytosolic molecules without affecting cell viability. Ponceau 4R has been used to reduce the extracellular background of fluorescence-based assays because it is membrane-impermeable and potently quenches the emission of fluorophores in the 490–560 nm range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tay et al., 2019</xref>). We found that Ponceau 4R influx rapidly quenches the fluorescence of CFSE-labeled B-cells, providing us with an independent and accurate tool to determine the kinetics of antigen-induced PM permeabilization.</p><p>We also showed that endocytosis does not account for the sudden, massive influx of lipophilic dyes that occurs in B-cells binding surface-associated antigen. Cross-linking surface BCRs with soluble antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cousin et al., 2018</xref>), which did not permeabilize the B-cell PM, induced the endocytosis of lipophilic dyes – as expected from a tracer that is associated with the outer leaflet of the PM. However, the endocytosed lipophilic dye appeared as small puncta that gradually accumulated at the cell periphery, in sharp contrast to the sudden, massive dye influx that reaches the nuclear envelope in antigen-permeabilized cells. Consistent with this result, endocytosed fluorescent Fab’ covalently attached to beads also appeared as small puncta in our live imaging assays. Thus, we conclude that the sudden, massive influx of lipophilic dyes is the result of PM permeabilization but not of dye endocytosis.</p><p>The PM of primary B-cells can be damaged by phototoxicity during prolonged live imaging, or by necrosis or apoptosis. To control for such events, in parallel to our assays with surface-associated antigen, we measured the permeabilization levels of cells interacting with Tf-beads or Tf-PLB, which bind the Tf receptor with similar affinity as antigen-BCR but without BCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuchs and Gessner, 2002</xref>). Low levels of non-specific permeabilization of B-cells were detected in these controls, not surprisingly given that primary splenic B-cells are often injured during the purification process. Furthermore, we did not observe an increase in apoptotic markers in B-cells interacting with surface-associated antigen. Importantly, our assays involving sequential exposure to membrane-impermeable dyes revealed that a significant fraction of the antigen-permeabilized B-cells subsequently resealed. Thus, our findings cannot be explained by a loss in B-cell viability, strongly suggesting that B-cells can become transiently permeabilized when binding antigen that is tightly associated with surfaces.</p><p>We found that two different model antigens, αM and HEL, can induce B-cell PM permeabilization when attached to surfaces. This shows that BCR binding through bona fide antigen-binding sites is not a requirement for generation of the mechanical forces leading to B-cell PM permeabilization. Since stiffness of the antigen-presenting surface appears to impact BCR signaling and antigen capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spillane and Tolar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>), it could be argued that antigen tethered to latex beads or PLB assembled on glass coverslips represent unnaturally stiff surfaces that might cause B-cell permeabilization. To investigate this issue, we utilized COS-7 cells expressing mHEL, a surface-associated antigen previously shown to engage MD4 B-cells in vivo when expressed in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartley et al., 1991</xref>). Our finding that BCR engagement of mHEL on the surface of COS-7 cells also induces PM permeabilization supports the notion that this process occurs under physiological conditions and is likely to be relevant in vivo.</p><p>Not all B-cells binding surface-associated antigen were permeabilized, possibly due to heterogeneity of the primary B-cell population used in our assays. Splenic B-cells are found at different stages of peripheral maturation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sagaert and De Wolf-Peeters, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allman and Pillai, 2008</xref>), binding antigen with variable affinities at different times and generating distinct responses. In subsequent studies, it will be interesting to determine which subsets of B-cells are more effective in capturing and presenting surface-associated antigen through NMII-dependent PM permeabilization.</p><p>The rapid exocytosis of lysosomes triggered by B-cell permeabilization uncovered in our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously reported affinity-dependent extraction and presentation of antigen associated with non-internalizable surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista and Neuberger, 2000</xref>). We showed that the low-affinity DEL-I antigen induces markedly lower levels of PM permeabilization, lysosome exocytosis, and antigen presentation when compared to the higher affinity HEL, when the two antigens are displayed on surfaces at similar densities. Surface association significantly enhances the avidity of antigens by increasing their valency, a process that can reduce the impact of BCR-binding affinity on BCR signaling, antigen internalization, and presentation when compared to soluble forms of the same antigen. However, this avidity effect is primarily observed with antigen associated with surfaces that B-cells are able to internalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Batista and Neuberger, 2000</xref>), and it is known that B-cell subsets such as native follicular B-cells have very low phagocytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vidard et al., 1996</xref>). We envision that when antigen is strongly associated with non-internalizable surfaces, low-affinity BCR-antigen interactions are disrupted before B-cells can extract antigen. In this scenario, high-affinity BCR interactions would be critical for sustaining antigen binding under NMII-mediated traction forces, to promote PM permeabilization, lysosomal enzyme release, and antigen extraction. High-affinity BCR-antigen binding is also expected to induce more robust signaling than low-affinity binding, enabling higher levels of NMII activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>) and polarization to drive PM permeabilization. Collectively, in addition to supporting the notion that tight antigen attachment to non-internalizable surfaces facilitates B-cell affinity discrimination, our results expand the mechanistic understanding of why different physical and chemical forms of immunogens impact the efficacy of vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann and Jennings, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Lysosomal exocytosis is acutely dependent on rapid elevations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaiswal et al., 2002</xref>). PM tears cause immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and massive lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2010</xref>), due to the markedly higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the extracellular space compared to the cytoplasm. BCR engagement of antigen also induces [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baba and Kurosaki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka and Baba, 2020</xref>), and we cannot rule out the possibility that BCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes might contribute to the initiation of lysosomal exocytosis, which would then be amplified by PM permeabilization and more robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, while BCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes occur in most antigen-binding B-cells within seconds of antigen binding, we found that the majority of lysosomal exocytosis and antigen internalization events occur &gt;30 min after antigen binding, a time frame that coincides with the period required for antigen-induced PM permeabilization. Thus, our data suggest that BCR-mediated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases are unlikely to be the primary driver of the lysosomal exocytosis events that facilitate endocytosis of surface-associated antigen. However, BCR-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes may have induced the small number of initial lysosomal exocytosis events that we detected during the first 15 min of B-cell interaction with surface-associated antigen. It is also conceivable that early BCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes contribute to antigen-induced B-cell PM permeabilization by activating NMII and actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izadi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results provide important insights into the spatiotemporal relationship of events initiated by interaction of the BCR with surface-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Our findings suggest that high-affinity binding stabilizes BCR-antigen interactions, inducing strong BCR signaling and NMII activation to locally generate traction forces that permeabilize the PM. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry would then trigger a localized PM repair response mediated by lysosomal exocytosis, releasing hydrolases that can cleave antigen off surfaces, facilitating endocytosis and presentation to T-cells. Our results support the notion that B-cells utilize a cellular mechanism that evolved for surviving PM injury to promote the acquisition, presentation, and possibly affinity discrimination of surface-associated antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Mayer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Maeda et al. report that B cell plasma membrane permeabilization following interaction with immobilized antigens triggers a lysosome-mediated plasma membrane resealing that leads to extracellular hydrolase release and facilitates antigen capture and presentation.</p><p>Strengths of this manuscript: The questions addressed are timely and interesting. Experiments are well conceived and technically well performed. Results are largely convincing. Images and videos are of high quality.</p><p>Weaknesses of this manuscript: While the role of B cell lysosomes in antigen capture is convincingly demonstrated and extends previously reported findings, the role of B cell membrane permeabilization in triggering lysosome secretion and in initiating antigen capture is not yet fully demonstrated and may be bolstered by some suggested additional controls. There were also some concerns about potential phototoxicity in the time lapse imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are the cells that undergo dramatic π uptake in the time lapse videos the same cells that are competent for antigen presentation? In these sequences, the cells with high π and FM signals appear to dramatically change volume that suggests lysis- perhaps due to a combination of membrane injury during antigen capture and/or phototoxicity from the imaging. Given that the bulk cells don't lose viability, but do take up the dyes, one solution might be to sort the π positive and negative B cells that are viable by a concurrent 7AAD test and assay for antigen presentation activity to confirm that the π or FM dyes positive cells present antigen better than negative cells.</p><p>2) – The use of FM dyes to monitor cell permeabilization is problematic since these dyes are also used to monitor vesicular trafficking during endo/exocytosis (Nat. Prot 2006;1(6):2916-21). Vesicular trafficking is expected to be triggered by BCR engagement and internalization. This point should be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To further clarify this issue, it would be important to trigger B cells with soluble anti-BCR antibodies followed by secondary fluorochrome- labelled crosslinking antibodies. Under these conditions, B cell plasma membrane should not be permeabilized. FM uptake might be limited to the area of antibody capping and exhibit localization that might not overlap with the FM staining show Figure 1 and subsequent figures. The simple experiment might allow to discriminate between permeabilization and vesicular trafficking.</p><p>Results in figure 1H are not fully convincing. The observed FM entry in B cells following stimulation with F(ab')2-anti-mouse tethered to planar lipid bilayers (PLB) is relatively slow and is compatible with a process of vesicle endocytosis. It would be important to monitor FM internalization in B cells interacting with F(ab')2-anti-mouse immobilized on beads to directly compare FM uptake kinetics with the kinetics of π entry shown in Figure in Figure 1A</p><p>3) Results obtained using BEL are interesting but not fully convincing. BEL treatment has several described effects on cells included cell death induction (https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M307209200). The fact that in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 cells present unaltered FCS/SSC cannot exclude the possibility that B cells might be in a cell death process and for this reason might have internalized the viability dye Sytox Blue. To address this point, it is important to test the impact of BEL on non-stimulated B cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66984.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are the cells that undergo dramatic PI uptake in the time lapse videos the same cells that are competent for antigen presentation?

However, it is important to note that these changes are gradually reversed, and do not lead to cell lysis. We have observed these transient morphological changes under rapid or slow image acquisition, which suggests they are not a result of phototoxicity. To further investigate the cell viability issue, we complemented our earlier flow cytometry analysis of B cells sequentially exposed to two different membrane impermeable dyes (now Figure 6A) with live imaging (new Video 11 and Figure 6C). These new results directly show that antigen-permeabilized cells undergo a surface area expansion as they become permeable to the first dye – but these same cells subsequently reseal, excluding the second dye (new Video 11 and Figure 6C). The live imaging results confirmed what we originally reported (antigen-permeabilized cells can reseal), while significantly strengthening our conclusions.</p><p>To further document the morphological recovery of antigen-permeabilized cells, we included a new supplemental figure (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2) and a new video (new Video 12) with representative examples of how permeabilized cells gradually recover their original shape and do not lyse, even when imaged for &gt;3 additional hours from the moment of antigen-induced permeabilization. We included a brief discussion of these findings in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As previously discussed in correspondence with Suzanne Pfeffer, we were not surprised to see these transient morphological changes in permeabilized B-cells. Prior work with different cell types revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during PM permeabilization triggers transient disassembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, which results in extension and/or protrusion of the PM. This change is not limited to the wound site, since elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly propagates through the cell. After the PM is repaired and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx ceases, PM extensions retract due to reassembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (such reversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulation of the actin cytoskeleton was previously described by Tim Mitchison’s lab – Charras et al. Reassembly of contractile actin cortex in cell blebs, J Cell Biol 175:477-90, 2006). In addition, the massive exocytosis that occurs in permeabilized cells has long been known to cause a transient increase in cell surface area (McNeil and Steinhardt J Cell Biol 137: 1-4, 1997), and in this case, recovery is slower since it requires sustained membrane traffic. Our imaging results suggest that both mechanisms (actin cytoskeleton reassembly and endocytic membrane traffic) are probably involved in the recovery of antigen-permeabilized B cells, and we are very interested in characterizing this process in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the bulk cells don't lose viability, but do take up the dyes, one solution might be to sort the PI positive and negative B cells that are viable by a concurrent 7AAD test and assay for antigen presentation activity to confirm that the PI or FM dyes positive cells present antigen better than negative cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion, since this experiment would allow us to directly link antigen-induced B-cell PM permeabilization to antigen presentation. We spent several months troubleshooting and optimizing protocols, and completed more than ten trials of the suggested sorting experiment. Unfortunately, we encountered two significant hurdles that prevented us from reaching our goal. The first hurdle was the need to avoid continued B-cell permeabilization during the 24-h incubation with T-cells, since sorting cannot remove cell-bound beads. We tried to address the issue by fixing cells immediately after sorting. However, even low fixative concentrations destroyed the T-cell recognition site in the MHCII-HEL peptide complexes presented by the primary B-cells used in our assay. We identified this problem by comparing the ability of fixed and unfixed B-cells to activate T-cells after incubation with HEL-beads for 2 h. The second hurdle we encountered was the low yield of the sorting procedure. Based on our data, with ~50% of B-cells binding HEL-beads at each given time, 15-20% of antigen-bead-bound cells are permeabilized, and ~50% of these permeabilized B-cells reseal their plasma membrane – which results in only 5% of the initial number of cells, even without considering the inevitable loss during sorting. Through our extensive trials, we learned that bead binding and incorporation of membrane impermeable dyes into the B-cell DNA significantly increased cell loss, further decreasing the sorting yield. Thus, despite numerous attempts we failed to obtain a sufficient number of sorted B-cells to perform reliable T-cell activation analysis. However, even though we could not directly confirm the relationship between antigen-induced B-cell membrane permeabilization and antigen presentation through cell sorting, our study has revealed a direct link between antigen-induced B-cell PM permeabilization and antigen internalization (Figure 7D-F), a critical step that initiates antigen presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of FM dyes to monitor cell permeabilization is problematic since these dyes are also used to monitor vesicular trafficking during endo/exocytosis (Nat. Prot 2006;1(6):2916-21). Vesicular trafficking is expected to be triggered by BCR engagement and internalization. This point should be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Discussion of this point has been included in the revised manuscript (lines 156 to 166 in Results and lines 518-528 in Discussion).</p><p>We are certainly aware that lipophilic dyes can also enter B-cells through receptor endocytosis (Cousin et al. Methods Mol Biol 1847:239-49, 2018), particularly when BCR endocytosis is induced by receptor cross-linking (Song et al. J Immunol 155: 4255-63, 1995). However, under our experimental conditions (see below), endocytosed lipophilic dyes appeared as puncta that gradually accumulated at the cell periphery. This pattern was in sharp contrast to the sudden, massive influx of lipophilic dyes that occurs ~8 min before PI influx.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To further clarify this issue, it would be important to trigger B cells with soluble anti-BCR antibodies followed by secondary fluorochrome- labelled crosslinking antibodies. Under these conditions, B cell plasma membrane should not be permeabilized. FM uptake might be limited to the area of antibody capping and exhibit localization that might not overlap with the FM staining show Figure 1 and subsequent figures. The simple experiment might allow to discriminate between permeabilization and vesicular trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer and included the data in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 6. We activated BCR endocytosis by cross-linking surface BCRs using soluble F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> goat-anti-mouse IgM+G antibodies and fluorescent F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> anti-goat-IgG. Under these conditions, which did not cause PM permeabilization, we observed FM1-43 uptake appearing as small peripheral puncta that colocalized with BCR cross-linking antibodies. Such endosome-associated FM1-43 staining pattern was markedly different from the sudden, massive FM influx observed shortly before PI entry in permeabilized cells (see a comparison of both conditions in the new Video 4). This experiment allowed us to clearly distinguish the influx of FM during B-cell permeabilization from the peripheral FM puncta formed during endocytosis – we thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results in figure 1H are not fully convincing. The observed FM entry in B cells following stimulation with F(ab')2-anti-mouse tethered to planar lipid bilayers (PLB) is relatively slow and is compatible with a process of vesicle endocytosis. It would be important to monitor FM internalization in B cells interacting with F(ab')2-anti-mouse immobilized on beads to directly compare FM uptake kinetics with the kinetics of π entry shown in Figure in Figure 1A</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the experiment above showing the distinct, exclusively peripheral endocytosis pattern triggered by BCR cross-linking by soluble antibodies clarified this point. We also added a new panel to Figure 1 (new Figure 1I) to emphasize that FM dye influx during antigen-induced permeabilization is a sudden event, with an influx kinetics similar to what is observed with PI (more examples are provided in the new Figure 1 supplement 4). Furthermore, unlike what is seen during endocytosis, in antigen-permeabilized cells FM influx frequently results in staining of the nuclear envelope (note the juxtaposition of FM staining and PI-stained nuclei in Figure 1H and Figure 1-supplement 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results obtained using BEL are interesting but not fully convincing. BEL treatment has several described effects on cells included cell death induction (https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M307209200). The fact that in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 cells present unaltered FCS/SSC cannot exclude the possibility that B cells might be in a cell death process and for this reason might have internalized the viability dye Sytox Blue. To address this point, it is important to test the impact of BEL on non-stimulated B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data showing unaltered FCS/SSC did not fully rule out potential cell death induction by BEL. To directly examine this issue, we incubated B cells with Tf-beads (our control condition that induces very low levels of B cell permeabilization) in the presence or absence of BEL and examined the cell’s susceptibility to SYTOX Blue staining. As shown in the new Figure 6-supplement 1C,D, treatment with BEL under our experimental conditions (12 µM for 30 min) did not increase the percentage of SYTOX-permeable B-cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
