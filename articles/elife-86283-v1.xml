Their fossil record is sparse, especially before the Cenozoic, thus little is known about their early host associations. This study reports 16 new mermithids associated with their insect hosts from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, 12 of which include previously unknown hosts. These fossils indicate that mermithid parasitism of invertebrates was already widespread and played an important role in the mid-Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem. Remarkably, three hosts (bristletails, barklice, and perforissid planthoppers) were previously unknown to be parasitized by mermithids both past and present. Furthermore, our study shows that in contrast to their Cenozoic counterparts, Cretaceous nematodes including mermithids are more abundant in non-holometabolous insects. This result suggests that nematodes had not completely exploited the dominant Holometabola as their hosts until the Cenozoic. This study reveals what appears to be a vanished history of nematodes that parasitized Cretaceous insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fossil</kwd><kwd>amber</kwd><kwd>nametode</kwd><kwd>insect</kwd><kwd>parasitism</kwd><kwd>Cretaceous</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42125201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program XDB26000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019QZKK0706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarzembowski</surname><given-names>Edmund A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UNESCO-IUGS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IGCP Project 679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarzembowski</surname><given-names>Edmund A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sixteen new mermithid nematodes associated with their insect hosts are discovered from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber and they are more abundant in non-holometabolous insect hosts, revealing what appears to be a vanished history of nematodes parasitism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nematodes (roundworms), a group of non-segmented worm-like invertebrates, are some of the most abundant animals on earth in terms of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lorenzen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>). They are distributed worldwide in almost all habitats and play key roles in ecosystems by linking soil food webs, influencing plant growth and facilitating nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yeates et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Hoogen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The earliest known definite nematode fossil occurs in the Lower Devonian Rhynie Chert inside the cortex cells of an early land plant and has been considered to be a plant parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poinar et al., 2008</xref>), but unconfirmed nematode-like fossils and trace fossils may date back to the Precambrian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poinar, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Parry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Baets et al., 2021a</xref>). Despite their abundance in many extant ecosystems, nematodes are exceedingly rare in the fossil record, since most of them are small, with soft bodies and concealed habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Mermithidae represent a family of nematodes that are obligate invertebrate parasites which occur in insects, millipedes, crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, and earthworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nickle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poinar, 1979</xref>). They can affect the morphology, physiology, and even the behavior of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petersen, 1985</xref>). The life cycle of mermithids comprises five stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Poinar and Otieno, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Poinar, 1983</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Poinar, 2001b</xref>). Eggs are deposited in the environment, and the developing embryos moult once and emerge from the eggs as second-stage juveniles. These juveniles are the infective stage that enter the hemocoel of potential hosts. After a relatively rapid growth phase (third stage), mermithids exit hosts as postparasitic juveniles (fourth stage). They then enter a quiescent phase and moult twice to become adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poinar, 2015a</xref>). They tend to exit their hosts even before maturation, though, if their hosts are stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poinar, 2015b</xref>). Hosts usually die when the mermithids exit, which is why mermithids have been widely studied as possible biological control agents, especially against aquatic stages of medically important insects like mosquito larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petersen, 1985</xref>). Although mermithids kill their hosts like parasitoids, they are commonly considered as parasites like other nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Baets et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Baets et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>Palaeontological records of parasitism provide critical clues about the origination and diversification of important nematode groups, and elucidate the synecology and coevolution of ancient parasites and their hosts. Due to their relatively large size and invertebrate-parasitic habits, mermithid nematodes are most likely of all nematodes to occur as recognizable fossils, especially in amber as they exited their invertebrate hosts that became entrapped in resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>). Their fossil record dates back to the Early Cretaceous with <italic>Cretacimermis libani</italic> from a chironomid midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) in Lebanese amber (~135 Ma; million years ago) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Poinar et al., 1994</xref>). However, there is a dearth of examples of other Cretaceous mermithids prior to the present study, with only <italic>Cretacimermis chironomae</italic>, also from chironomid hosts, <italic>Cretacimermis protus</italic> from biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and <italic>Cretacimermis aphidophilus</italic> from an aphid (Hemiptera: Burmitaphididae) in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poinar and Buckley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poinar and Sarto i Monteys, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poinar, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report 16 additional mermithid nematodes associated with their insect hosts in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (approximately 99 million years old). These examples triple the diversity of Cretaceous mermithids (from 4 to 13 species) and reveal previously unknown host–parasite relationships. Our study also shows that mermithids were widely distributed in a number of diverse insect lineages by the mid-Cretaceous, but they preferred to parasitize non-holometabolous rather than holometabolous insects, thus providing novel insights into the early evolution of nematode parasitism of insects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systematic palaeontology</title><p>Fossil nematodes can be attributed to the family Mermithidae based mainly on their relatively large size, coiled posture, and morphological comparison with extant mermithids (body shape, length, diameter, tail structure, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>). They can also be distinguished from nematomorphs due to the lack of small elevations of irregular areas (areoles) on their epicuticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Poinar, 2001b</xref>). Due to palaeontological inability to adequately detect all biological adult characters, it is impossible to place in or refer fossil mermithid nematodes to any natural extant genus. This is why fossil collective genera have been erected under the same guidelines as recent collective genera for difficult nematodes. The importance of placing nematode species in collective genera is to underpin or establish the time, place and hosts of these parasitic lineages. For Cretaceous Mermithidae not assignable to any previously known genus or lacking biologically preferred diagnostic characters, the collective genus <italic>Cretacimermis</italic> was erected (but invalidly, see remarks for <italic>Cretacimermis</italic> below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Poinar, 2001b</xref>). Putative hosts were determined by noting nematodes emerging from their bodies or completely emerged nematodes adjacent to potential hosts, especially if there is physical evidence that a particular insect was parasitized.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Family Mermithidae Braun, 1883</title><sec id="s2-1-1-1"><title>Collective genus <italic>Cretacimermis</italic> Poinar, gen. nov.</title><p>urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:152E262D-5A65-4EB8-A059-D380D53D32F8</p><p><bold>Etymology.</bold> The generic name is derived from the combination of the prefix, ‘cretac-’ meaning chalky referring to the Cretaceous age of the collective, and ‘Mermis’ is the name of the type genus of Mermithidae.

The hosts of nine species were previously unrecorded, which triples the diversity of Cretaceous Mermithidae (from 4 to 13 species). In today’s ecosystems, mermithids have been reported from a variety of arthropods, in a range of environments, and often infecting large percentages of host populations and causing mass mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Poinar, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poinar, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petersen, 1985</xref>). Despite their abundance in extant terrestrial ecosystems, mermithids are rare in the fossil record as they are not readily preserved as fossils. Twenty-two fossil mermithid species have been described from the Cenozoic with their hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table S1), mainly from Eocene Baltic amber (11 species) and Miocene Dominican amber (9 species), but only four pre-Cenozoic species associated with only two insect orders have previously been recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poinar and Buckley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poinar and Sarto i Monteys, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poinar, 2017</xref>). However, according to our new records, nine insect orders are now known to have been infested by mermithid nematodes in Kachin amber and this number is even higher than that of Baltic amber (~45 Ma) and Dominican amber (~18 Ma) (six and three insect orders, respectively), despite a much longer time spent searching for nematodes in the latter two amber deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>).

Mermithids species are usually characterized by strong host speciﬁcity, they are specific to a single species or to one or two families of insects, and are almost always lethal to their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoffolano, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Petersen, 1985</xref>), thus our study indicates that the widespread mermithid parasitism probably already played an important role in regulating the population of insects in Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The fossil record of Mermithidae plotted on the phylogenetic tree of insects.</title><p>The chronogram of the insect tree is modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Misof et al., 2014</xref> (thin black line); insect orders without a fossil record of mermithid parasitism are excluded.

Furthermore, our findings are the first fossil records of mermithids parasitizing dragonflies (Odonata), earwigs (Dermaptera), crickets (Orthoptera) and cockroaches (Blattodea), four host associations predicted from extant records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Poinar, 1975</xref>).</p><p>Nematode body fossils are scarce and mainly known from amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Baets et al., 2021b</xref>), sometimes together with their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>). To explore the evolution of nematode–host relationship, we compiled nematode–host records in the three best-studied amber biotas (mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, Eocene Baltic amber and Miocene Dominican amber; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table S1). Our results indicate that not only the mermithids, but also the nematodes as a whole, experienced a certain degree of host transition between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We cannot fully exclude the possibility of collection bias, but its influence is probably low because Kachin amber has been extensively studied in the last two decades and its biota has already become the most diverse known amber biota; moreover, holometabolous insects are much more diverse in the collections than non-holometabolous ones (1296 vs 465 species: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ross, 2023</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that holometabolous insects are underrepresented among the known hosts of mermithids. Among the insect hosts of mermithids preserved in Kachin amber, only one of the nine orders (Diptera) is holometabolous (i.e. insects with ‘complete’ metamorphosis), whilst it is four out of six (Hymenoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera) in Baltic amber and all three insect host orders (Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera) are holometabolous in Dominican amber. The situation is similar when referring to the amount of nematode parasitism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In Kachin amber, only about 40% of the hosts (in total, not only insects) are holometabolous, while this percentage increases to 80% in Baltic and Dominican amber and this result is acceptable when uncertainty is considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Diptera are the most common hosts of nematodes from all three amber biotas; also, the oldest fossil animal that was found to host a mermithid is a dipteran from Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Poinar et al., 1994</xref>). This is probably because most dipteran larvae develop in moist or aquatic environments that are particularly suitable habitats for nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poinar, 2011</xref>). It is evident that Holometabola are the most important hosts of extant mermithids as well as all invertebrate-parasitizing nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Poinar, 1975</xref>) and this hexapod subgroup dominated the insect fauna during the Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Labandeira and Sepkoski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Labandeira, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Our study suggests that, except for Diptera, nematodes had not completely exploited Holometabola as hosts in the mid-Cretaceous. This suggests that non-holometabolous insects (i.e. insects without ‘complete’ metamorphosis) were more available as hosts in the mid-Cretaceous and the widespread association between nematodes and Holometabola might have formed later.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The occurrence frequency of invertebrate–nematode associations from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (~99 Ma), Eocene Baltic amber (~45 Ma) and Miocene Dominican amber (~18 Ma).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pie diagrams, the quantity of fossil species is indicated below the orders.

Amber is a unique form of fossilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hsieh and Plotnick, 2020</xref>). Although amber is patchily distributed in space and time, it is still especially suitable for investigating the evolution of terrestrial parasites associated with arthropods due to preservation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">De Baets and Littlewood, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Leung, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Baets et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Baets et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leung, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poinar, 2021</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers including David Marjanović as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Two of the reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The abstract mentions statistical analyses, but only pie charts are presented. The data you present in the supplementary material could easily, and should, be used for a statistical analysis to test your hypothesis of a shift toward holometabolous insects as hosts. Please also briefly address, in the text, the possibility of collection bias: are, for example, beetles underrepresented in museum collections of insects in amber, and are such biases likely to be identical for all sources of amber (Baltic amber has been sampled for centuries, Kachin amber only for a decade or two)?</p><p>2) Please write for a slightly wider audience. For example, please explain how trophosomes are recognized, and how fossil mermithids can be differentiated from, for example, nematomorphs; please also mention if mermithids are known to exit their hosts as a panic reaction. If you can illustrate and describe the exit wounds, this would greatly strengthen the manuscript against the possibility that some of the associations might be accidental.</p><p>3) The nomenclature needs a few minor improvements. I also urge you to take this opportunity to publish the genus name Cretacimermis properly, because that has not been done so far – the original publication lacks a diagnosis, which is required even for collective groups, so the name &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; is not currently available and does not even compete for homonymy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am not familiar with nematodes or amber, so I only wrote my review after receiving and reading the other reviews, and I have focused on the topics I am more competent in.</p><p>Comments on science</p><p>Given the wide readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, it would be good to explicitly state the evidence that these rather featureless elongate fossils represent specifically the parasitic stage of, specifically, mermithids (and not for example nematomorphs or a whole new group of nematodes). In your descriptions you mention trophosomes (implying parasitism) and details of the cuticle; is any of this diagnostic for Mermithidae, or is something else that you can see? How are trophosomes recognized? (I see the brown fragments you point out in Figure 4H; why do you interpret them as a trophosome?) Is it possible to illustrate or at least describe the exit wounds in more detail in the specimens where the mermithids have fully exited?</p><p>Can you exclude collection bias as a factor in the apparent shift to holometabolous hosts?</p><p>Line 25: By &quot;statistical analyses&quot;, do you mean the pie charts in Figure 9? That's a presentation of data, not an analysis. The term made me expect mathematics.</p><p>64: Are mermithids known to exit their hosts as a flight reaction when the host is stressed?</p><p>Comments on nomenclature</p><p>I was wrong in my pre-review: collective groups are explicitly allowed under the ICZN; and diagnoses do not need to be limited to morphological characters, they can refer to behavior. However, collective species are not allowed – only collective genera and subgenera (ICZN Articles 10.3, 42.2.1). The species names you propose are therefore fine, just don't call them &quot;collective&quot;.</p><p>However, because genus names must be published with a diagnosis even if they're intended for a collective genus, &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; is actually unavailable: for purposes of zoological nomenclature, this name does not exist. I quote the original publication (Poinar 2001b: 262): &quot;Since the generic placement of this specimen was based in part on its host family, it is now prudent to transfer the species libani from Heleidomermis Rubstov into a new genus Cretacimermis Poinar. Thus, this nematode, which is the oldest definite fossil nematode, should now be called Cretacimermis libani Poinar, Acra and Acra (1994).&quot; This is not &quot;a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon&quot; (ICZN Art. 3.1.1). I therefore strongly recommend that you validly publish Cretacimermis here as a new name. (Interestingly, you don't need to select a type species, because collective groups do not have type species: ICZN Art. 13.3.2, 42.3.1, 66, 67.14. This must be precisely because species cannot be collective groups.)</p><p>I also strongly recommend against using times or places in diagnoses (if I find, say, a mermithid exiting an archaeognath in Late Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, do I really have to erect a new species name for it instead of referring it to &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; incredibilis…?), let alone the type of preservation (amber), but this is not forbidden by the ICZN. (&quot;Character&quot;, as used in Art. 3.1.1, is defined in the Glossary as: &quot;Any attribute of organisms used for recognizing, differentiating, or classifying taxa.&quot;)</p><p>Line 101: Why &quot;extraordinary&quot; and not simply &quot;incredible&quot;?</p><p>129: The species name itself is fine, but adelphos means &quot;brother&quot;, not &quot;sister&quot;; &quot;sister&quot; is &quot;adelphê&quot;.</p><p>144: Much simpler: &quot;The species epithet is the Latin 'directa' = arranged in a straight line.&quot;</p><p>172, 175, 193, 225: Another reviewer has pointed out that not all bugs are bedbugs, and that naming a planthopper parasite after bedbugs may therefore not be a good idea. Given that you name &quot;C.&quot; manicapsoci after the type genus of Manicapsocidae (not directly after Manicapsocidae) and likewise &quot;C.&quot; cecidomyiae after they type genus of Cecidomyiidae, you could also name the planthopper parasite &quot;C. perforissi&quot;, after the type genus of Perforissidae.</p><p>226: Being a valid name, Cecidomyia should be preceded by a comma rather than surrounded by quotation marks. You can also delete it entirely; you didn't spell out Manicapsocus in line 193.</p><p>286: Replace &quot;Archeognatha&quot; by &quot;Archaeognatha&quot;.</p><p>365: Is he Peter or Petr?</p><p>593-594 and Supplementary Table: As you correctly state in the text, the authors of &quot;C.&quot; chironomae are not Poinar, 2011, but Grimaldi et al., 2002.</p><p>Comments on style and language</p><p>Line 27-28: &quot;have […] exploited&quot; is from the point of view of the present, so it clashes with &quot;until the Cenozoic&quot;; replace it by &quot;had […] exploited&quot;.</p><p>34: Replace &quot;one&quot; by &quot;some&quot; to fit the plural &quot;Nematodes […] are&quot; in the preceding line.</p><p>40: Likewise, replace &quot;a plant parasite&quot; by &quot;plant parasites&quot; to stay in the plural.</p><p>41: Replace &quot;can&quot; by &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot;.</p><p>63: It took me a second to understand &quot;invertebrate parasitic habits&quot;; in this form it would mean that their habits are both parasitic and invertebrate. Please use a hyphen in &quot;invertebrate-parasitic habits&quot; (or reword entirely, e.g. &quot;parasitism of invertebrates&quot;).</p><p>292: Replace &quot;be&quot; by &quot;have been&quot; simply because the mid-Cretaceous is in the past.</p><p>294: Remove the comma; it wrongly implies that H. brownii is the only mermithid you're talking about here (and would need to be matched by another comma after the name).</p><p>313-315: &quot;depicted&quot; refers to literal pictures; replace it by &quot;shown&quot;, &quot;recorded&quot; or &quot;demonstrated&quot;. More importantly, however, the entire clause seems like it was incompletely edited; in its current form it states that mermithids parasitized dipterans before they parasitized anything else. I think you mean: &quot;also, the first fossil animal that was found to host a mermithid is a dipteran from Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber (Poinar et al., 1994)&quot; or something to that effect.</p><p>316: Replace &quot;developed&quot; by &quot;develop&quot;.</p><p>325: Replace &quot;be built&quot; by &quot;have formed&quot;.</p><p>Figure 8: Replace &quot;~&quot; by &quot;-&quot; (Ctrl+minus on the numeric block in MS Word, Alt+0150 on the numeric block in other software); &quot;~&quot; will not be understood as &quot;to&quot; outside of China – it will be mistaken as having its mathematical meaning of &quot;about&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I would highly recommend this manuscript be accepted for publication, however, I do have a few minor comments about the manuscript that I would like the authors to address before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>L62: &quot;their large size&quot; should be changed to &quot;their relatively large size&quot; since while it is true that mermithids are fairly large in terms of nematodes, there are also many nematodes which reach much, much larger sizes than mermithids.</p><p>L175: I question naming this species after bedbugs (Cimex) since the host was a planthopper. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to name the species after the host taxa?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As stated before this monumental description and valuable new data on fossil parasitic parasites is timely and very welcome. I just feel you could your own observations and work a bit short by not including a supporting statistical analysis of the shift in host exploitation (at minimum an analysis with error or confidence intervals would be appropriate). You alluded to a statistical analysis in the abstract but I could not find it in the manuscript. I feel this can be easily achieved with the new literature and data you compiled and would make your interpretations much more robust and fundamental. Here are my main suggestions on how you may achieve that goal:</p><p>Line 40-41: the statements need to be backed up by more recent publications – the authors could cite De Baets et al. 2021a in this context which reviewed the nematode fossil record and the authors already cite. In addition, the authors could cite Parry et al. (2017) who most recently reported sinusoidal traces which might reflect nematode activity but also cautioned for possible alternative interpretations.</p><p>Line 59: the fossils are also treated as parasitic nematodes in another publication in the same volumes by De Baets et al. (2021b); this chapter might be of interest as the authors also depict the nematode fossil record through the Phanerozoic and clearly demonstrate that amber provides one of the richest records of nematode body fossils including parasitic ones.</p><p>Line 76-79: Indeed, also the changes in proportion for heterometabolous to holometabolous insects could be mentioned. I feel that you undersell the importance of your study by dumping this information in the supplementary material. You also allude to a statistical analysis in the abstract but as far as I can see you are just naming percentages and have pie diagrams which can be widely deceiving (e.g., Rougier et al. 2014). Depicting the changing proportions of parasitic nematodes from heterometabolous to holometabolous insects would make your study easier to follow and reproduce as well as your interpretations more convincing.</p><p>Lines 100, 114, 128, 143, 157, 174, 192, 210, 224, Below each new species, the zoobank number should be added.</p><p>Line 300: You need to back up this statement with a reference. De Baets et al. 2021 (not to be confused with the other reference you already cite) recently depicted the known record of nematode body fossils and show that amber is one of its richest sources of nematodes backing up your statement.</p><p>Line 302-305: This is an important result and therefore the information should not be buried in the supplementary material. It is crucial to analyze/depict this information in a bar plot rather than pie diagrams which although graphically appealing might distort information (compare Figure 1.3 in De Baets et al. 2021) and I feel this could be done by separating those species in heterometabolous and holometabolous insects per amber deposit. To make your interpretations more robust and deal with differences in sampling heterometabolous versus holometabolous insects, at minimum binomial error or confidence intervals should be added to this plot (Raup 1991; Takeda and Tanabe 2014) if not more broadsweeping statistical analyses. Confidence intervals are more conservative and can easily be calculated in Matlab with Binofit function or R with the binom.confint function of the package Binom as well as other software.

The data you present in the supplementary material could easily, and should, be used for a statistical analysis to test your hypothesis of a shift toward holometabolous insects as hosts. Please also briefly address, in the text, the possibility of collection bias: are, for example, beetles underrepresented in museum collections of insects in amber, and are such biases likely to be identical for all sources of amber (Baltic amber has been sampled for centuries, Kachin amber only for a decade or two)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We fully agreed with the reviewer and revised this part. We have added a new Figure 9B and Table 1 to our paper. Indeed, collection bias is almost present in all amber biotas. However, we believe we have robust reasons to argue that the shift to holometabolous hosts does exist. Although Kachin amber has only been studied extensively in the last two decades (compared with centuries of study in Baltic amber or Dominican amber), it has become by far the most intensively studied amber biota since its Cretaceous age was appreciated, now comprising an exceptional 700 families (Ross, 2023). Also, the fossil record of holometabolous insects is clearly much better than non-holometabolous insects in Kachin amber (1296 spp. vs 465 spp. respectively). But as shown in our paper, the nematodes we found in Kachin amber are mainly associated with heterometabolous insects. Therefore, even if collection bias might exist, such as the presence of some unreported nematode-Holometabola associations, we believe our conclusion about the shift is robust. We also add some explanation in our paper, please see line 350–356 in the clean copy of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please write for a slightly wider audience. For example, please explain how trophosomes are recognized, and how fossil mermithids can be differentiated from, for example, nematomorphs; please also mention if mermithids are known to exit their hosts as a panic reaction. If you can illustrate and describe the exit wounds, this would greatly strengthen the manuscript against the possibility that some of the associations might be accidental.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. Please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The nomenclature needs a few minor improvements. I also urge you to take this opportunity to publish the genus name Cretacimermis properly, because that has not been done so far – the original publication lacks a diagnosis, which is required even for collective groups, so the name &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; is not currently available and does not even compete for homonymy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We formally erect this genus in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I am not familiar with nematodes or amber, so I only wrote my review after receiving and reading the other reviews (I am the Reviewing Editor), and I have focused on the topics I am more competent in.</p><p>Comments on science</p><p>Given the wide readership of eLife, it would be good to explicitly state the evidence that these rather featureless elongate fossils represent specifically the parasitic stage of, specifically, mermithids (and not for example nematomorphs or a whole new group of nematodes). In your descriptions you mention trophosomes (implying parasitism) and details of the cuticle; is any of this diagnostic for Mermithidae, or is something else that you can see? How are trophosomes recognized? (I see the brown fragments you point out in Figure 4H; why do you interpret them as a trophosome?) Is it possible to illustrate or at least describe the exit wounds in more detail in the specimens where the mermithids have fully exited?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out these issues. First, the parasitic stage of fossil mermithids is almost impossible to determine due to the lack of detailed structure. In fact, it is also very difficult to determine the stage of extant mermithids only based on morphological characters. It is a pity that the number of moults is based on experimental observation (Poinar, 1974), which is impossible to duplicate in fossil research.</p><p>The identification of fossil mermithids is based mainly on their relatively large size, the morphological comparison with extant mermithids (body shape, length, body diameter, tail structure, etc.), and their position and posture in relation to the insects. Other invertebrateparasitic nematodes are usually relatively short, not coiled, and much smaller than their hosts, but mermithids are relatively long, coiled, and large compared with their hosts (Poinar, 2011). Nematomorphs are also long and big, but their epicuticles are normally crossed by grooves or furrows, leaving small elevations of irregular areas (areoles) between them (Poinar, 1999, 2001, 2006). We have therefore added some explanation at the beginning of Systematic palaeontology. Please see line 86-90 in the clean copy.</p><p>Trophosome are intestines of mermithids. As mermithids develop, the intestine becomes detached from the remainder of the alimentary tract and serves as a food storage organ (trophosome) (Poinar, 2015). Trophosomes can usually be detected in fossil mermithids by their different hues (Poinar, 2011). In order to make it readable for a wider audience, we have added some arrows and explanations in our figures.</p><p>Finally, exit wounds are hard to detect even in extant insects because when mermithids have left, these wounds tend to close up. For our specimens, we indeed have evidence (direct or indirect) to argue these associations are not accidental. We revised our figures and also have added these comments as “Remarks” in Systematic palaeontology, please see lines 137–139, 154–156, 171–172, 205–207, 225–227, 245–249, 263–264, 278–279, 298 in the clean copy.</p><p><italic>Cretacimermis incredibilis</italic>: As we illustrated in Figure 2D, the tail end of the mermithids is adjacent to an exit wound on the host, indicating a true parasitic association.</p><p><italic>Cretacimermis calypta</italic>: Although no exit wound can be clearly found, this mermithid is closely coiled around the dragonfly, indicating that the nematode was just emerging from the host.</p><p><italic>Cretacimermis adelphe</italic>: The posterior part of the abdomen of this earwig has been damaged; it is most likely that these mermithids exited from the host through this wound.</p><p><italic>Cretacimermis directa</italic>: There is no distinct wound on this cricket’s body, but the nematode is adjacent to it, and there is no other insect nearby.

Yes, nematodes tend to leave their hosts when their hosts are threated, e.g., caught by resin flow. That is why many fossil nematodes that occur in amber are very close to their hosts or just emerging from their hosts. We also add some words to explain this. Please see lines 53–56 in the clean copy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on nomenclature</p><p>I was wrong in my pre-review: collective groups are explicitly allowed under the ICZN; and diagnoses do not need to be limited to morphological characters, they can refer to behavior. However, collective species are not allowed – only collective genera and subgenera (ICZN Articles 10.3, 42.2.1). The species names you propose are therefore fine, just don't call them &quot;collective&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We deleted all the “Collective species” before our new species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, because genus names must be published with a diagnosis even if they're intended for a collective genus, &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; is actually unavailable: for purposes of zoological nomenclature, this name does not exist. I quote the original publication (Poinar 2001b: 262): &quot;Since the generic placement of this specimen was based in part on its host family, it is now prudent to transfer the species libani from Heleidomermis Rubstov into a new genus Cretacimermis Poinar. Thus, this nematode, which is the oldest definite fossil nematode, should now be called Cretacimermis libani Poinar, Acra and Acra (1994).&quot; This is not &quot;a description or definition that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon&quot; (ICZN Art. 3.1.1). I therefore strongly recommend that you validly publish Cretacimermis here as a new name. (Interestingly, you don't need to select a type species, because collective groups do not have type species: ICZN Art. 13.3.2, 42.3.1, 66, 67.14. This must be precisely because species cannot be collective groups.)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We formally erect this genus in this paper. Collectives do not contain type species because they are not natural genera. Please see lines 104–123 in the clean copy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also strongly recommend against using times or places in diagnoses (if I find, say, a mermithid exiting an archaeognath in Late Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, do I really have to erect a new species name for it instead of referring it to &quot;Cretacimermis&quot; incredibilis…?), let alone the type of preservation (amber), but this is not forbidden by the ICZN. (&quot;Character&quot;, as used in Art. 3.1.1, is defined in the Glossary as: &quot;Any attribute of organisms used for recognizing, differentiating, or classifying taxa.&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We also do not want to simply use times or places in diagnoses; however, it is almost impossible to identify fossil nematodes at generic and/or specific level based on morphology and we therefore have to use some other information in diagnoses like times, places and hosts as valuable circumstantial evidence. The same method is widely used in fossil nematodes. For example, <italic>Heydenius</italic> Taylor, 1935 was erected as a collective genus for all fossil mermithids from the Cenozoic, and <italic>Heydenius neotropicus</italic> Poinar, 2011 is for those infecting Chironomidae from Dominican amber, <italic>Heydenius matutinus</italic> (Menge, 1866) Taylor, 1935 is for those infecting Chironomidae from Baltic amber. Thus, if we do find a mermithid exiting an archaeognathan in Late Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, a new species is reasonable as unlikely to have infected chironomids in Dominican amber. It is therefore a more natural solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 101: Why &quot;extraordinary&quot; and not simply &quot;incredible&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks.

I just feel you could your own observations and work a bit short by not including a supporting statistical analysis of the shift in host exploitation (at minimum an analysis with error or confidence intervals would be appropriate). You alluded to a statistical analysis in the abstract but I could not find it in the manuscript. I feel this can be easily achieved with the new literature and data you compiled and would make your interpretations much more robust and fundamental. Here are my main suggestions on how you may achieve that goal:</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have added a new Figure 9B and Table 1 to our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 40-41: the statements need to be backed up by more recent publications – the authors could cite De Baets et al. 2021a in this context which reviewed the nematode fossil record and the authors already cite.

(2017) who most recently reported sinusoidal traces which might reflect nematode activity but also cautioned for possible alternative interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have added these two references here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 59: the fossils are also treated as parasitic nematodes in another publication in the same volumes by De Baets et al.

You also allude to a statistical analysis in the abstract but as far as I can see you are just naming percentages and have pie diagrams which can be widely deceiving (e.g., Rougier et al. 2014). Depicting the changing proportions of parasitic nematodes from heterometabolous to holometabolous insects would make your study easier to follow and reproduce as well as your interpretations more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks.

It is crucial to analyze/depict this information in a bar plot rather than pie diagrams which although graphically appealing might distort information (compare Figure 1.3 in De Baets et al. 2021) and I feel this could be done by separating those species in heterometabolous and holometabolous insects per amber deposit. To make your interpretations more robust and deal with differences in sampling heterometabolous versus holometabolous insects, at minimum binomial error or confidence intervals should be added to this plot (Raup 1991; Takeda and Tanabe 2014) if not more broadsweeping statistical analyses. Confidence intervals are more conservative and can easily be calculated in Matlab with Binofit function or R with the binom.confint function of the package Binom as well as other software. I feel such analyses could be done for both mermithids and all (parasitic) nematodes in those 3 amber deposits. Particularly tabulated data and depiction of the distribution of mermithids in modern insects would be helpful to understand the context. This might be trivial to you but not so to the reader who does not necessarily has access to all relevant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out these issues.

For example, the parasite of <italic>Cretacimermis chironomae</italic> occurs five times in Kachin amber, but an extant dipteran-parasitized mermithid species can occur many times just in a single pond. However, it is evident that mermithids as well as all invertebrate-parasitized nematodes prefer to infect holometabolous insects rather than other invertebrates (Poinar, 1975; Poinar, personal observation).
