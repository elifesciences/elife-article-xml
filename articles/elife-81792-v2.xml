Here we show that deleting the focal adhesion protein Kindlin-2 expression in hepatocytes using the <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgenic mice causes a severe inflammation, resulting in premature death. Kindlin-2 loss accelerates hepatocyte apoptosis with subsequent compensatory cell proliferation and accumulation of the collagenous extracellular matrix, leading to massive liver fibrosis and dysfunction. Mechanistically, Kindlin-2 loss abnormally activates the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Blocking activation of the TNF signaling pathway by deleting TNF receptor or deletion of Caspase 8 expression in hepatocytes essentially restores liver function and prevents premature death caused by Kindlin-2 loss. Finally, of translational significance, adeno-associated virus mediated overexpression of Kindlin-2 in hepatocytes attenuates the D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury and death in mice. Collectively, we establish that Kindlin-2 acts as a novel intrinsic inhibitor of the TNF pathway to maintain liver homeostasis and may define a useful therapeutic target for liver diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TNFR/NF-kB</kwd><kwd>hepatocyte</kwd><kwd>liver failure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

multifunctional organ that plays critical roles in regulation of metabolism and detoxification and maintenance of the whole-body homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). Liver comprised parenchymal cells and non-parenchymal cells. The former includes hepatocytes and endothelial cells; the latter includes hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and Kupffer cells. Abnormal activation of the TNF signaling stimulates inflammation and apoptosis, which are intertwined during the development and progression of liver diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guicciardi and Gores, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tacke and Zimmermann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcia-Martinez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schuppan et al., 2018</xref>). TNFα exerts its actions through binding and activating two different types of receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wajant and Siegmund, 2019</xref>). It is known that NF-κB, a major TNFR downstream effector, plays a pivotal role in promoting inflammatory liver diseases, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ding and Yin, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is critical to keep the TNF/NF-κB signaling activity under strict check to maintain normal organogenesis and function. However, key signal(s) that restrict abnormal TNF/TNFR activation in liver under physiological conditions and if and how alterations of these signals contribute to development and progression of inflammatory liver diseases are incompletely understood.</p><p>Kindlin proteins are key components of the focal adhesion (FA) assembly and contain the FERM domain, which is responsible for binding to and activating integrins to regulate the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, migration, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirbawi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kadry and Calderwood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Michael and Parsons, 2020</xref>). Mammals have three Kindlin proteins, that is, Kindlin-1, Kindlin-2, and Kindlin-3, which are encoded by <italic>Fermt1</italic>, <italic>Fermt2,</italic> and <italic>Fermt3</italic> genes<italic>,</italic> respectively. Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-3 are expressed primarily in epithelial and hematopoietic cells, respectively, while Kindlin-2 is widely expressed. Up-regulation of Kindlin-2 expression is implicated in a number of pathological processes, such as tumor formation, progression, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhan and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sossey-Alaoui et al., 2019</xref>). Global deletion of Kindlin-2 expression causes early embryonic lethality at E7.5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, Kindlin-2 and other FA-related proteins are widely involved in the control of the development and function of skeleton, kidney, heart, and other organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wegermann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Eysert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) through both integrin-dependent and integrin-independent mechanisms. We have recently demonstrated that Kindlin-2 haploinsufficiency protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating the transcription factor Foxo1 in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2022</xref>).

Kindlin-2 loss in hepatocytes causes an acute liver failure and premature death in mice. We demonstrate that Kindlin-2 loss dramatically activates the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway, massive inflammation, and hepatocyte death with subsequent stimulation of proliferation of both biliary cells and HSCs, leading to ECM accumulation and fibrosis in liver. We further demonstrate that liver damages and lethality caused by Kindlin-2 deficiency are largely attenuated or completely rescued by either global ablation of TNFR or hepatocyte-selective deletion of Caspase 8 expression. We finally demonstrate that adeno-associated virus mediated OE of Kindlin-2 in hepatocytes attenuates the GalN/LPS-induced liver injury and death in mice.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that Kindlin-2 expression in hepatocytes is essential for liver development and function. Kindlin-2 deletion in hepatocytes using the <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgenic mice causes acute liver failure and lethality of 100% penetration in mice at ages between 4 and 5 weeks. Our results suggest that abnormal activation of the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway plays a major role in mediation of the liver lesions and lethality caused by Kindlin-2 deficiency. This notion is supported by the following lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence. First, results from our RNA-seq analyses from 4-week-old control and KO liver tissues reveal that TNF signaling pathway is activated in KO liver. Second, the levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic> mRNA in liver and serum level of TNFα protein were dramatically elevated in 4-week-old KO versus control mice. Consistently, massive macrophage infiltration is observed in KO but not control liver tissues, suggesting increased inflammation. Third, in vitro studies show that shRNA knockdown of <italic>Fermt2</italic> expression increases the mRNA levels of <italic>Tnfα</italic> and <italic>Birc3</italic> in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. Fourth, the increases in serum ALT and AST, hepatocyte apoptosis, ECM deposition, inflammatory infiltration, proliferation of both biliary cells and HSCs, and liver fibrosis caused by Kindlin-2 deficiency were largely reversed by <italic>Tnfr</italic> genes deletion. Most importantly, <italic>Tnfr</italic> genes deletion completely rescues the lethality caused by Kindlin-2 deficiency. These findings also indicate the necessity to keep the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway in hepatocytes under precise control in order to maintain normal liver development and function as well as the whole-body metabolic homeostasis. We demonstrate that Kindlin-2 plays a pivotal role in this regard.</p><p>Kindlin-2 loss induces massive hepatocyte apoptosis. The expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein is up-regulated and that of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein is down-regulated in mutant liver. A number of apoptotic hepatocytes are observed throughout the mutant liver. Strikingly, genetic ablation of <italic>Caspase 8</italic> expression in hepatocytes essentially rescues the liver lesions and lethality caused by Kindlin-2 loss. These results suggest that the Caspase 8-dependent death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway plays a critical role in mediating the liver damages and lethality caused by Kindlin-2 loss. Abnormal inflammation induced by Kindlin-2 loss should largely contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis in the mutant mice.</p><p>Notably, Kindlin-2 loss greatly promotes proliferation of both biliary cells and HSCs and stimulates accumulation and deposition of excessive collagenous ECM, which leads to liver fibrosis in the mutant mice.</p><p>It should be noted that KO mice display a splenomegaly and severe cholestasis. These results along with the severe fibrosis strongly suggest the presence of portal hypertension in the mutant mice. It should also be noted that Kindlin-2 loss causes a significant reduction in bone mass. This could be in part due to the dyslipidemia induced by liver dysfunction, which is known to induce hepatic osteodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zaidi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Of translational significance, AAV8-mediated expression of Kindlin-2 in liver significantly blocks the D-GalN/LPS-induced liver inflammation and death in mice. In the future, it would be important to investigate whether Kindlin-2 loss plays a role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory liver diseases.</p><p>In summary, we establish that the FA protein Kindlin-2 is a potent intrinsic inhibitor of the TNF/NF-κB-Caspase 8 inflammatory pathway and plays an important role in the maintenance of normal liver development and function. We may define a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory liver diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal study</title><p>Generation of <italic>Fermt2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2019</xref>).

However, little attention is paid to underlying changes in liver structure which are clearly disrupted in knockouts. Given the known roles of this protein in focal adhesion organization and integrin signaling, it would be important to examine the properties of kindlin-deficient hepatocytes such as focal adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, and ECM distribution.</p><p>2) No obvious connection is made between Kindlin loss and increased inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis. Is it possible that overall disruption of the liver structure due to focal adhesion or related disruptions leads to generalized tissue necrosis, inflammation, and cell apoptosis versus Kindlin having a more direct repressive effect on TNFalpha-mediated inflammation?</p><p>A possible insight into the relationship between these events might be gained by comparing the time course of kindlin-2 inactivation with TNF and caspase activation.</p><p>3) Figure S2 shows loss of bone volume, bone mineral density, and trabecular parameters in Fermt2 KO mice. However, no comment is made concerning the relationship between this observation and the loss of kindlin in hepatocytes, which implies an indirect effect on bone.</p><p>4) Figure 3 shows that kindlin-2 loss increases fibrosis as measured by increased collagen staining, Col1a1 mRNA, Timp1, and α SMA levels. Is this fibrosis an early or late response to kindlin loss or Is it a secondary response to increased TNF and inflammation? If hepatocytes are undergoing apoptosis, what is the source of the increased collagen?</p><p>5) The study shown in Figure 7 shows a small protective effect of Kindlin-2 overexpression on the acute liver toxicity induced by D-galactosamine/LPS treatment. The experiment only compares liver parameters between D-galactosamine/LPS treated control and kindlin overexpression mice. Does Kindlin2 overexpression affect liver parameters in the absence of D-galactosamine/LPS treatment or does it selectively protect against D-galactosamine/LPS-induced inflammation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81792.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The disconnect between known functions of kindlin2 in focal adhesions and cytoskeletal architecture and the reported liver dysfunction.

Results from IF staining showed that Kindlin-2 loss markedly altered the focal adhesion formation and impaired the cytoskeleton, cell spreading and attachment. These new results are now added as the new Figure 4o and 4p and described in the text (page 11, lines 233-236).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relationship between kindlin2 loss, inflammation, and apoptosis. Specifically, does kindlin loss rapidly induce initiators of these events (TNFalpha, caspase 8), or is this secondary to a generalized destabilization of liver structure? I think the authors could do this relatively easily by comparing the time course of changes in hepatocyte structure with TNF and caspase induction.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision, we have performed time-course experiments by IHC staining of livers sections of the two genotypes to measure expression of p65 and active caspase 3 proteins at 2-, 3- and 4-weeks of ages. The results showed that Kindlin-2 loss did not cause marked alterations in expression of p65 and active caspase 3 proteins and liver histology at 2-week of age. Kindlin-2 loss caused a significant elevation in expression of p65 and active caspase 3 proteins without causing marked liver injure at 3-weeks of age. At 4-weeks of age, Kindlin-2 loss caused significant up-regulation of p65 and active caspase 3 and marked structural damage in KO livers. These results clearly show that alterations in inflammation and apoptosis occur before the destabilization of liver structure in KO mice. Thus, our results support the notion that Kindlin-2 loss rapidly induces inflammation and apoptosis not due to secondary to a generalized destabilization of liver structure. These results are now added as the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and 1c and described in the text (page 8, lines 173-175). We thank the reviewer and editor for raising this critical issue and the suggested experiments to address it!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Needs careful editing for typos and grammar.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision, we have tried our best to fix typos and grammar errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With ascites and splenomegaly, associated with severe fibrosis, the kindlin-2 deficient mice clearly developed portal hypertension. This should be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short discussion regarding this point in the revised manuscript (page 17, line 353-355). Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Massive inflammatory cell infiltrate in the livers of kindlin-2 def mice included macrophages. What other cells were present? Based on gene expression data (Figure 4), we expect to see increased B cells and neutrophils.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed new experiments and found that both CD19 (B cell marker) and Ly6G (neutrophils marker) were up-regulated in KO versus control livers. These new results are now added as the Figure 4f and 4g and described in the text (page 10, lines 219-221).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is kindlin-2 def mice developed cholestasis (line 124). Need alkaline phosphatase or GGT and is desirable to have bile acid levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Results from our new experiments showed that the levels of alkaline phosphatase, GGT and bile acid levels were increased in KO relative to those in control mice. These results are now added as the Figure 1—figure supplement 3b and described in the text (page 7, lines 146-149).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Interestingly, kindlin-2 def mice develop increased cholesterol but have low HDL cholesterol. This is very interesting. The same group has recently published in Nature Communications (vol 13, 1025, 2022) that kindlin-2 haploinsufficiency protects against fatty liver. I don't understand why this paper is not cited or discussed. The discrepancy between an apparent protective effect of haploinsufficiency in NAFLD vs fulminant liver injury/fibrosis in homozygous KO needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The finding from our previous study is now described and cited (pages 5-6, lines 108-112). Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Data are presented to show osteopenia in kindlin-2 def mice which is not discussed although multiple papers on bone effects of kindlin-2 def are cited. In view of the striking dyslipidemia seen in these mice, the authors should address the links between hepatic osteodystrophy and cholesterol transport (Cell Metabolism https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2022.02.007)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, a short discussion regarding the raised point (page 17, lines 355-358) and the reference are now added. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the data on complete blood count, there is no mention of platelet counts – with portal hypertension, platelets are likely to be lower. Please provide</p></disp-quote><p>Our new results showed that the platelet number was reduced in KO versus control mice. These results are now added as the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and described in the text (page 11, lines 222-224).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The study provides strong evidence that kindlin-2 loss in hepatocytes leads to profound disruption of liver function and associated fibrosis. However, little attention is paid to underlying changes in liver structure which are clearly disrupted in knockouts. Given the known roles of this protein in focal adhesion organization and integrin signaling, it would be important to examine the properties of kindlin-deficient hepatocytes such as focal adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, and ECM distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to above point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) No obvious connection is made between Kindlin loss and increased inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis. Is it possible that overall disruption of the liver structure due to focal adhesion or related disruptions leads to generalized tissue necrosis, inflammation, and cell apoptosis versus Kindlin having a more direct repressive effect on TNFalpha-mediated inflammation?</p><p>A possible insight into the relationship between these events might be gained by comparing the time course of kindlin-2 inactivation with TNF and caspase activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to above point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure S2 shows loss of bone volume, bone mineral density, and trabecular parameters in Fermt2 KO mice. However, no comment is made concerning the relationship between this observation and the loss of kindlin in hepatocytes, which implies an indirect effect on bone.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to above point 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3 shows that kindlin-2 loss increases fibrosis as measured by increased collagen staining, Col1a1 mRNA, Timp1, and α SMA levels. Is this fibrosis an early or late response to kindlin loss or is it a secondary response to increased TNF and inflammation? If hepatocytes are undergoing apoptosis, what is the source of the increased collagen?</p></disp-quote><p>The enhanced fibrosis in KO liver is probably a late response to Kindlin-2 loss. Along with hepatocyte apoptosis, a large number of nonparenchymal cells, including macrophages (Figure 4e), astrocytes (Figure 2i) and cholangiocytes (Figure 2h), were observed in KO liver. This may contribute to the increased collagen accumulation in KO liver. We have discussed this in the revised manuscript (page 16, lines 350-352).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The study shown in Figure 7 shows a small protective effect of Kindlin-2 overexpression on the acute liver toxicity induced by D-galactosamine/LPS treatment. The experiment only compares liver parameters between D-galactosamine/LPS treated control and kindlin overexpression mice. Does Kindlin2 overexpression affect liver parameters in the absence of D-galactosamine/LPS treatment or does it selectively protect against D-galactosamine/LPS-induced inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results showed that Kindlin-2 overexpression did not markedly alter the liver function without the D-galactosamine/LPS treatment. These new results are now added in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and described in the text (page 14, lines 295-296).</p></body></sub-article></article>
