in a high-throughput manner. Parallel capture of TCR transcripts and peptide-MHC is enabled through the use of reagents labeled with DNA barcodes. However, analysis and annotation of such single-cell sequencing (SCseq) data are challenged by dropout, random noise, and other technical artifacts that must be carefully handled in the downstream processing steps. We here propose a rational, data-driven method termed ITRAP (improved T cell Receptor Antigen Paring) to deal with these challenges, filtering away likely artifacts, and enable the generation of large sets of TCR-pMHC sequence data with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity, thus outputting the most likely pMHC target per T cell. We have validated this approach across 10 different virus-specific T cell responses in 16 healthy donors. Across these samples, we have identified up to 1494 high-confident TCR-pMHC pairs derived from 4135 single cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell immune profiling</kwd><kwd>epitope specificity</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>sequence similarity</kwd><kwd>evaluation methods</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7014-00055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadrup</surname><given-names>Sine Reker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R322-2019-2445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bentzen</surname><given-names>Amalie Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R324-2019-1671</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bentzen</surname><given-names>Amalie Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R190-2014-4178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadrup</surname><given-names>Sine Reker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG 677268 NextDART</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadrup</surname><given-names>Sine Reker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>713683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Povlsen</surname><given-names>Helle Rus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>75N93019C00001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Povlsen</surname><given-names>Helle Rus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bioinformatics approach shows how to reduce noise in single-cell TCR-pMHC specificity data while retaining sensitivity toward cross-binding events to facilitate investigation of the rules governing TCR-pMHC binding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cells are essential for immune protection and play a critical role in the immune response to pathogens or cancer, where they directly kill infected or malignant host cells or orchestrate the response of other immune cells. Recognition is mediated through the heterodimeric T-cell receptor (TCR) expressed on the surface of T cells, which engages specifically with a peptide antigen (p) displayed in the MHC. Accurate specificity and broad coverage of antigen recognition are obtained through somatic recombination of the genetic loci, V(D)J, that encodes the α (VJ) and β (VDJ) chains of TCR. The process creates an extensively variable and dynamic repertoire, with an estimated 10<sup>7</sup> distinct αβTCRs in an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arstila et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Bjorkman, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Due to this diversity, the individual TCR transcripts can be used as endogenous cellular barcodes inherited by the T cell progeny. This has been utilized for providing quantitative insight into TCR diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robins et al., 2009</xref>), to trace lineage decisions of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerlach et al., 2013</xref>) and to monitor the dynamics of T cells across immune-related diseases, such as infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dziubianau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherwood, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acha-Orbea et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madi et al., 2014</xref>). Most of such TCR repertoire studies have been confined to bulk experiments, tracing the TCR β chain because of its greater diversity (compared to the alpha chain) and because it is less ambiguous due to allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergman, 1999</xref>). However, accurate pairing of the variable TCR α and β regions is valuable for uncovering the biological function of a T cell and is generally lost in bulk experiments since the transcripts are separately encoded. Moreover, we and others have earlier demonstrated that paired α and β TCR data are essential for the characterization and learning of the relationship between the TCR sequence and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montemurro et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To accurately obtain TCR αβ-sequence-pair, single-cell sequencing platforms can be applied to simultaneously capture both TCR chains, while retaining cell origin information. To further assign specificity information to such TCRs, T cells can be stained with barcode-labeled pMHC multimers to simultaneously identify pMHC specificity and TCR sequence of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, via DNA barcoded antibodies, the platform facilitates screening of surface proteins to distinguish cellular subtypes and enables cell hashing to trace origin of a given cell to, for example, a given donor, sample, or time point, which is highly valuable in patient studies.</p><p>Here we thus applied single-cell sequencing to describe the T cell specificities toward a set of viral-derived peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. The pMHCs were selected with the purpose of generating data to expand the current knowledge of TCR-pMHC interactions, and hence covered pMHCs with limited or no paired TCR coverage in the public-domain databases such as IEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vita et al., 2019</xref>) and VDJdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagaev et al., 2020</xref>). We deployed the droplet-based single-cell platform from 10x Genomics. Ideally a droplet contains a single cell with all its analytes and a gel-bead in emulsion (GEM). The gel-bead contains barcoded primers that ensures tracing of transcripts back to the cell of origin, referred to as GEMs. While the platform is highly promising, the sequence deconvolution is associated with substantial noise, and challenging to discriminate true from false signals. Common confounding factors include stochastic gene expression, cell cycle variations, apoptosis, and technical artifacts such as multiplet capture, contamination, dropout, and batch effects. Dropout and stochastic gene expression both result in zero-inflated gene counts and are typically insensitive to low expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buettner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Multiplet capture is the event of capturing two or more cells in a single GEM, and it is proportional to the capture rate of cells introduced to the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). The capture rate is determined by the rate of pulsing cells relative to the rate of gel-beads. Thus, to include even low-frequency cell populations, the capture rate must be high at the expense of introducing more multiplets. Contamination is particularly an issue when including analytes such as pMHC multimers, which may be dissolved in cell suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaublomme et al., 2019</xref>). The platform has no means of controlling how ambient analytes and their barcodes are partitioned with GEMs, which leads to GEMs that appear like multiplets or consist of ambiguous annotations from multiple analyte barcodes. The reverse issue arises from the risk that analytes may dissociate from the cell before capture. The listed confounders may result in both false-positive and false-negative discoveries.</p><p>The main concerns when screening for TCR specificity are nonspecific binding of pMHC and/or cell hashing analytes, incomplete TCR annotation, and T cell multiplets. Nonspecific binding and T cell multiplets may completely dilute the signal from actual interactions, while incomplete TCRs that are missing the annotation for either α- or β-chain render the single-cell setup superfluous. To ensure that a screening is fully exploited and interpreted correctly, we set out to develop a data-driven algorithm that facilitates a consistent and reproducible TCR categorization (clonotyping), peptide-MHC (pMHC) annotation, and antibody-based cell hashing referencing of the donors and their HLA profile.</p><p>We applied this algorithm to a dataset derived from screening PBMCs from 16 healthy donors for T cell recognition against common viruses. In total, we evaluated TCR recognition against 10 different pMHC multimers, each labeled with their unique barcode. We demonstrate that following the filtering steps described here we can obtain a confident pairing of pMHC specificity and TCR sequence. This strategy will open novel opportunities to evaluate the structural interplay and the sequence-driven signatures of pMHC recognition at large scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Parallel capture of TCRɑβ sequences, peptide-MHC specificity, and sample origin from single cells</title><p>To obtain single-cell-derived triad information on TCR sequence, pMHC specificity, and sample origin, we stained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a total of 16 different healthy donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We sorted only the APC-labeled pMHC multimer binding T cells (and hence deselected the PE-labeled T cells) and included these in the downstream single-cell processing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental strategy. All samples are incubated with the same library of barcode-labeled pMHC multimers and subsequently with a sample-specific barcode-labeled hashing antibody to individually label cells derived from a given sample. Multimer-binding cells from all samples are sorted in bulk and processed through the 10x Chromium workflow. The sequencing output simultaneously captures the sample barcode, the pMHC barcode, and the TCR sequences, which are all matched to a single cell based on the 10x barcode. This also provides the means of retrospectively assigning each cell to their sample of origin via the sample-specific hashing barcode.

This is done to enable mixing of cells from different samples, while retaining the information of sample origin, and utilizing the capacity of capturing 6000–10,000 cells per lane in the 10x Genomics workflow. This is essential when capturing T cells based on their specificity since the MHC multimer-positive population is generally of low frequency (&lt;1% of CD8 T cells). When several samples are mixed in the process of running the single-cell analysis, all mRNA and DNA barcodes (derived from hashing antibodies or the MHC multimers) associated with a given cell will be encoded with the same 10x barcode, proving the GEM association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Total data from simultaneous capture of cell, TCR, pMHC, and sample ID</title><p>The single-cell data is annotated using 10x Chromium Cellranger multi v6.1. This results in each GEM being quantified by a count of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kivioja et al., 2011</xref>) for the three components (TCR, pMHC, and sample hashing) based on transcripts of TCR α- and β-chains, barcodes co-attached to pMHC multimers and barcodes co-attached to cell hashing antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>To obtain the data presented here, a total of 1800 pMHC multimer-positive cells were sorted per donor irrespective of the frequency or the number of different antigen-specific T cell responses in a given sample, accumulating to a total of 28,800 cells sorted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All sorted cells were loaded into a single lane for 10x processing. Based on experience with pre-sorting of low frequent cell populations, this equals a total of 6000–9000 captured cells per lane after running the full 10x Genomics 5′ pipeline, and an acceptable doublet rate. This indicates that an appropriate proportion of cells are loaded on the Chromium. Initially, each GEM was annotated based on the most abundant transcripts from TCRαβ, pMHC, and cell hashing. However, this can lead to erroneous annotations as the noise level can differ substantially for the different reagents, resulting in different levels of UMIs.</p><p>Based on raw, unfiltered data, we found 6073 GEMs that contained all three components, that is, TCR, pMHC, and sample hashing, corresponding to 40% of the loaded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A total of 716,069 GEMs only contained one or two of the components, with the majority containing only the cell hashing barcode (n = 677,502) and the second largest share containing cell hashing as well as pMHC barcodes (n = 37,277). This number vastly exceeds the number of cells in the assay (15,700 cells loaded) and indicates contamination from ambient barcodes in suspension. This is further supported by the observation that the sample hashing UMI count was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0005, Mann–Whitney U) in the 6073 GEMs containing a TCR compared to the GEMs void of TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). A total of 43,455 GEMs captured a DNA barcode associated with the pMHC library and only 14% of these were completed with TCR transcripts and sample hashing barcodes. In the GEMs containing a TCR, 84% were completed with all three components, that is, included hashing and pMHC barcodes, while less than 0.05% of these GEMs were void of both sample hashing and pMHC barcodes. In the following, we will only consider the 6073 GEMs containing all three components, while taking into account that the high degree of noise also affects these seemingly completely mapped GEMs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of raw data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Venn diagram of the content of all gel-beads in emulsion (GEMs) from 10x Chromium drop-seq.

Few GEMs were detected with multiple TCR α- or β-chains (6%). This may be caused partly by naturally occurring multiplets of α-chain (4%) due to the incomplete gene restriction of the thymocyte during negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott and Altmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrie et al., 1993</xref>) or due to experimental features of the 1ox platform causing an expected 6.9% of multiplets based on the number of cells loaded in our experiment.</p><p>Without further filtering, the pMHC-TCR pairing is subjected to extensive noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), and we capture all the 10 DNA barcodes associated with the APC-labeled pMHCs in a varying number of GEMs. Importantly, the three negative control responses (GIL A0201, GLC A0201, and NLV A0201), which were present in the donors but not sorted, are only captured in a few GEMs; both as the most abundant pMHC (GIL: 4 GEMs/clonotypes; GLC: 17 GEMs/clonotypes; and NLV: 12 GEMs/clonotypes) and as presumed contamination (i.e., examples where the UMI count of the negative control(s) was not the most abundant). In this latter case, the vast majority (84%) of the negative control pMHCs had UMI counts of 1. Four of the abundant negative control responses matched known IEDB/VDJdb responses. This indicates that the cell isolation via sorting is effective in terms of capturing only the desired cells and relevant pMHC-associated barcode labels. The most frequently detected pMHC across all GEMs is RVR A0301, which is present with high UMI counts across all GEMs. Only RPH(10-mer) B0702-associated UMIs was consistently detected at low numbers per GEM. It was also evaluated whether the HLA allele of the pMHC matches the HLA haplotype of the donor(s) given via cell hashing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Typically, the mismatches are found in GEMs where the most abundant pMHC is detected at low UMI counts while the matches consist of GEMs with higher pMHC UMI counts. Of the 65% GEMs containing pMHC multiplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), 13% contained two or more pMHCs at the exact same UMI level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which may either represent noise or true cross-binding events.</p><p>The detected specificities in our data have been cross-referenced with the IEDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vita et al., 2019</xref>) and VDJdb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagaev et al., 2020</xref>) databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Based on the unfiltered data, we found five TCR-pMHC matches (across nine GEMs) and one TCR (one GEM), which was annotated with a different pMHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This latter is a case of a GEM with multiple pMHCs present with almost equal number of UMIs, where the most abundant pMHC is RVR A0301 (11 UMIs) and the second most abundant pMHC is GLC A0201 (9 UMIs), which is the peptide registered as target in IEDB and VDJdb.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> suggests that most of the captured T cells interact with several of the screened pMHCs to a degree that exceeds the level expected from natural cross-recognition.

Initial clonotypes were called using 10x Genomics Cellranger, which defines a clonotype as a set of cells that share identical receptor sequences at the nucleotide level, spanning the entirety of the V(D)J-C genes as well as the junction segments. Assuming reliable gene and CDR3 sequence calls by 10x Cellranger, we redefine clonotypes based on TCR annotation. Subsequently, GEMs with no clonotype annotation from 10x were annotated to existing clonotypes conditioned on matching VJαβ-genes and CDR3αβ sequences or as novel clonotypes. Similarly, clonotypes with identical VJ-CDR3αβ were merged to form larger groups of theoretically identical TCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Merging GEMs of the same TCR is essential to make statistical inference based on those groupings, for example, determine expected pMHC target per clonotype. The outcome was a set of 2441 TCR clonotypes across the 6073 GEMs containing both TCR and pMHC. For the 337 GEMs containing TCR chain multiplets, the most abundant chain per GEM was for the subsequent analyses selected to represent the true TCR. Note that this annotation was made post the definition of clonotypes and was applied for the TCR inter- versus intra-similarity comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Defining pMHC recognition for selected TCR clonotypes</title><p>As we have seen earlier, not all GEMs within a given clonotype support the same pMHC target, and defining the pMHC target of a TCR based on individual GEMs thus results in contradicting annotations. The key to identify the expected target for a clonotype is therefore to determine which pMHC identity represents the majority of UMIs across all GEMs within a given clonotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates an example from a pilot study that accentuates the importance of studying GEMs in ensemble rather than individually. Most GEMs are annotated with multiplets of pMHCs and across all GEMs the most abundant pMHC varies. While all pMHCs are found most abundant in at least one GEM, three pMHCs (TPR B0702, VTE A0101, and RAK B0801) are more often found most abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Although TPR B0702 is detected in fewer GEMs (136) than VTE A0101 (260) and RAK B0801 (186), TPR B0702 is present at generally higher UMI counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). It is evident that there is a difference in UMI distributions between the different pMHC within the GEMs of a given clonotype, and that TPR B0701 is the significantly most abundant pMHC across the ensemble of GEMs even though this pMHC is only present in a minority proportion of the GEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Based on these observations, we argue that the significantly most abundant pMHC should be annotated as the expected binder for the given clonotype rather than annotating based on the majority.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>An example of pMHC concordance in clonotype 1 (example from pilot study).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) All detected pMHC (y-axis) in each gel-bead in emulsion (GEM) (x-axis, n = 467) of clonotype 1.

Within each clonotype, one can compute a specificity concordance, that is, the fraction of GEMs detected with a certain specificity (defined by most abundant pMHC, i.e., highest pMHC UMI per GEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In many cases across the full data set, the expected specificity for a clonotype coincides with the specificity, defined on a per-GEM level, resulting in high concordance. However, for some clonotypes, for example, clonotype 1, GEMs have diverging annotations and therefore lower concordance dispersed across multiple specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The clonotype visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is specifically chosen to exemplify how this lower concordance can affect the analysis. For clonotype 1, the fraction of GEMs that support VTE A0101 (0.33) is higher than the fraction of GEMs that supports TPR B0702 (0.26). This results in an overall low concordance, and only by considering the complete ensemble of clonotype 1 GEMs can the correct pMHC target be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Improving concordance between GEM and clonotype annotation based on grid search on UMI features</title><p>To rationally filter data, an accuracy metric was defined and optimized through the filtering process. For all specificities belonging to clonotypes with an assigned expected target, we calculated the overall accuracy as the proportion of GEMs where highest abundance pMHC annotation corresponds to the expected target of the clonotype. The raw unfiltered data yielded accuracy and average concordance scores of 69.6 and 83.8%, respectively. Next, we set out to investigate how different data-driven UMI filters could improve these performance values, removing noise and artifacts from the data. This removal would also reduce the number of included observations, hence the performance of different thresholds for filtering the data was evaluated based on a tradeoff between increased accuracy and discarded number of GEMs.</p><p>We tested various thresholds on UMI count and UMI ratios, that is, the ratio between the most abundant and second most abundant UMI feature, for pMHC and TCRαβ, respectively. The optimal thresholds were chosen to maximize the weighted average between accuracy and fraction of retained GEMs to favor increase in accuracy above losing some GEMs. This filtering analysis resulted in optimal thresholds of two pMHC UMI counts and a ratio pMHC UMI counts between top one and two &gt;1. The latter results in the removal of GEMs where two pMHC were equally abundant for low UMI counts. The search did not result in thresholds imposing restrictions on neither TCR UMI counts nor TCR UMI ratio, which underpins that the TCRs with a missing chain as well as multiple chains also contribute to good performance. Imposing this filter yielded 4986 GEMs (82% of total), 1494 clonotypes (61% of total), and resulted in 95.3% accuracy, and a mean concordance of 90.6%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Additional filters</title><p>Additional filters can be added to further clean the data. We investigated how an integrated filter in the 10x Genomics software, Cellranger, performed in removing potential noise from our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The filter (labeled ‘is cell’) evaluates whether a GEM has captured a cell based on full level of transcriptome data, when available, and otherwise solely on TCR transcript level. The filter was tested with both levels of transcript data, full level and TCR transcript level, which are respectively referred to as ‘is cell (GEX)’ and ‘is cell.’ Alternatively, viable cells are identified from the transcript data, independently of Cellranger, based on mitochondrial load and a minimum and maximum gene count per GEM. All three filterings are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and taken into account in the further evaluations. It is worth noting that, while the filterings based on the full transcript data might remove slightly more noise, the economic costs associated could propose that this should only be applied when the transcript data is required for additional purposes.</p><p>Cell hashing is generally a much simpler task to resolve than pMHC multiplets because one hashing entry most often has much higher counts compared to the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, due to the experimental design, where only one hashing antibody is added to each sample, it is expected that only a single hashing signal is associated with each GEM, that is, this does not mirror the complex nature of the pMHC data, where cross-reactivity could result in more than one pMHC be a true binder to a given TCR. Given this simplicity, we opted for utilizing the existing Seurat hashtag oligo (HTO) tool to demultiplex and annotate cell hashing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoeckius et al., 2018</xref>). In this setup, cell hashing also enables filtering based on matching HLA between the donor haplotypes and the HLA of the detected pMHC. Including this additional filter reduces the number of GEMs to 4135 (covering a set of 1494 clonotypes). Additionally, depending on the subsequent use of the data, retaining only complete TCRs containing both α and β may be desirable. Including only GEMs where the TCR-pMHC pair is observed more than once, that is, specificity multiplets, reduces the uncertainty described above. Below we investigate the impact of imposing such filters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Impacts of filtering</title><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Evaluating filters by comparing TCR similarity across specificity</title><p>To objectively evaluate the performance impact of the presented filters, we define a quantitative evaluation based on the hypothesis that T cells binding the same pMHC (intra-specificity) will share a higher sequence similarity compared to TCRs of different specificities (inter-specificity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, filtering away artifacts should increase intra-similarity while decreasing the inter-similarity. Here, the similarity score between two TCRs was calculated from the summed score of the pairwise α- and β-chain similarities calculated using a kernel method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2012</xref> and applied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chronister et al., 2021</xref>.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Intra- and inter TCR similarity scores per peptide of the (<bold>a</bold>) total (unfiltered) data set and (<bold>b</bold>) the data filtered by the optimized threshold.</title><p>The similarity per peptide plots (<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) illustrates the distribution of paired similarity scores for each clonotype (containing both α- and β-chain).

The general trend is that TCRs with the same specificity are more similar to each other than to TCRs of different specificities, when computing the intra- and inter-similarities per pMHC before and after filtering on the optimized UMI thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). Before filtering, 9 out of 13 pMHCs displayed a higher mean intra-similarity than inter-similarity scores, whereas this number was 11 out 13 pMHCs when applying the UMI thresholds. The outliers before filtering were GIL A0201, VLE A0201, CLG A0201, and RPP B0702, while the outliers were reduced to VLE and RPP after filtering. Generally, the similarity scores often have a wide, overlapping range between the intra- and inter-categories. The three pMHCs that were deselected during sorting, GIL A0201, GLC A0201, and NLV A0201, are only detected in a few TCR binding events. To enhance the power of comparison, the intra- and inter-scores were pooled respectively across the individual pMHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). The results demonstrate that intra-similarity is significantly higher than inter-similarity at each filtering step, both individually and combined. Moreover, we observe that the differences between intra- and inter-similarity appear to increase as filters are cumulatively added and fewer observations are left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

When the most strict filtering is imposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), there are 77 GEMs (out of 2833) with a binding concordance of 0.5 or lower, which will be referred to as outliers. Also, 72 of those GEMs contain pMHC multiplets. And 93% of the multiplet outliers actually do contain the pMHC, which defines the high-concordance GEMs, however, at a lower UMI count. In the GEMs with multiple pMHC annotations, the HLA is conserved across the pMHCs in 7% of the cases. In 82% of the cases, the HLAs are different, but still match the HLA haplotype of the donor given by the cell hashing. Of the 77 outliers, the most dominant pMHCs are RVR A0301 (38%) and TPR B0702 (30%). These values are in line with the overall contribution of these pMHCs in the GEMs with a binding concordance above 0.5 (34 and 21%). This suggests that the observed GEMs with low concordance are a result of noise and not a reflection of TCR cross-reactivity. Prior to filtering the data, six clonotypes were identified, which were already registered in IEDB and VDJdb, five with matching pMHC, and one with a different annotation than in our observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The five matching clonotypes (nine GEMs) were successfully retained, while the mismatching clonotype (one GEM) was filtered away.

All pMHCs were detected with UMI counts ranging from 17 to 46.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparing single-cell data with fluorescent-based pMHC multimer screening</title><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Investigating dominant clones</title><p>Beyond mapping the landscape of known TCR-pMHC interactions, single-cell screening enables investigation of T cell repertoire diversity. The high resolution both reveals the specificity and the TCR clonality within the individual T cell populations, which is not possible to recover in classical stainings using fluorescent-labeled pMHC multimers (fluorescent multimers). The T cell diversity in the nine donors toward the set of analyzed pMHCs reveals a clear hierarchy with dominant responses in fluorescent multimer staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>); however, the clonality of each specificity is only available via single-cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Here ITRAP represents data filtered by optimal UMI thresholds and matching HLA between pMHC and donor haplotype (given via cell hashing). Single-cell screening further enables comparison of the clonal distribution and the total clonal size per specificity. In this respect, the samples BC328 and BC62 are strikingly similar in their distribution of expanded clones. They both display a large and broad response toward RVR A0301 and two smaller responses toward RPP B0702 and TPS B0702, which are both dominated by a single clonotype. Further, most peptides elicit diverse relative responses between samples. For example, RPP B0702 is the dominant response in samples BC328 and BC62, but the minority response in sample BC314. Sample BC300 contains primarily small clones, that is, fewer cells in each clonotype; however, this sample is generally represented with low amounts of total data (46 GEMs). Of note, small clones might be a result of suboptimal single-cell capture or because high-frequency responses can potentially mask any lower frequency responses present in a given donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) when only 1800 cells are sorted from each sample. Samples represented with many GEMs are expected to be fully covered and therefore may contain more different expanded clonotypes, as sample BC360.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>T cell diversity per peptide across the individual samples.</title><p>The nine samples, PBMCs from nine individual donors are represented on the x-axis.

Most of the T cell populations detected by fluorescent multimers are also captured in the single-cell screening, reflected by a recall of 0.95. However, the single-cell capture of small T cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) that were not detected using fluorescent multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) negatively impacts the precision, yielding a score of 0.71. For fluorescent-labeled MHC multimers, a detection threshold of 10 events is applied, which may account for the difference observed for the very rare clone, of which most were only represented by one GEM per clonotype (demonstrated by a light gray outer circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). In only two cases, T cell populations were detected with fluorescent multimers but not captured in single cells: BC316/CLG A0201 and BC62/RPH(10mer) B0702 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The large T cell population of BC316/CLG A0201 was likely a technical artifact related to the barcode-labeled pMHC multimers.</p><p>We calculated the number of antigen-specific T cells sorted per donor, based on the total number of sorted cells/donor (n = 1800) and the frequency of each T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This number of sorted cells for a given specificity was strongly correlated with the numbers of single-cell GEMs assigned to the same specificity (Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.73, p&lt;0.0005). Hence, even though many of the TCR-pMHC pairs are found across low numbers of GEMs, the strong correlation indicates that we can confidently assign pMHC specificity to the TCR sequence using ITRAP even in these cases. This is an essential feature of such analyses tool since individual antigen-specific T cell responses are often present at very low frequencies and patient material is often scarce. Hence, to conduct biologically relevant studies, strategies that enable the investigation of the breadth of antigen-specific T cell responses are required. We also fitted a linear regression for T cell populations sorted and assigned with at least one adjusted cell count or GEM in the log-log space (R2 = 0.56). The regression indicates that ~10% of sorted cells will be captured in a single-cell screening with TCR-pMHC information yielded by ITRAP.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have described and validated ITRAP, a data-driven approach for Improved Pairing of T cell Receptor and Antigen. We have successfully filtered single-cell 10x Genomics data to identify reliable TCR-pMHC interactions of up to 1494 clonotypes. The method can be adapted to any single-cell immune profiling data set and is highly transparent in the steps taken, allowing the user to choose appropriate stringency of filtering.</p><p>Our recommended approach of cleaning data with minimal elimination of GEMs is obtained by two sets of filters: (1) the optimized data-driven UMI thresholds combined with (2) information on matching HLA specificity (as obtained from donor-specific hashing). Increasing filtering is naturally at the expense of the number of GEMs that might reflect the trade-off between specificity and sensitivity of the assay. However, any benchmarking or validation is made difficult without a golden standard. Our best attempt at quantifying the impact of filtering is based on three metrics: annotation accuracy, binding concordance, and AUC of clonotype similarity for which ITRAP yielded the scores 96.2, 92.3, and 66.7, respectively. Evaluation of ITRAP with responses from fluorescent pMHC multimer staining revealed strong correlation (PCC = 0.73, MCC = 0.63) between the number of sorted T cells and the number of detected GEMs across all specificities.</p><p>Accuracy of pMHC annotation was based on selected clonotypes where the expected target was statistically distinct and UMI thresholds were set to optimize the annotation accuracy. Rare clonotypes are not considered in this metric and clones are not expected to display cross-reactivity amongst the included pMHC multimers. The optimal UMI thresholds are intended to remove observations deviating from the expected target. The thresholds are based on the assumption that contamination will predominantly exist at lower UMI counts than actual binding events. This limits the sensitivity of the method in cases of low-affinity low-frequency interactions that otherwise might be of great scientific and clinical interest. It is, however, essential to underline that ITRAP does not explicitly exclude cross-reactivity, and cross-reactive events are maintained after threshold filtering if such GEMs exist with proper UMI count values. This is in contrast with other tools where cross-reactive events are explicitly excluded.</p><p>The binding concordance is a metric that highlights cross-reactive clonotypes. In assays where cross-reactivity is not an expected outcome, binding concordance can be useful to evaluate the clonotypes where an expected target could not be identified. On the contrary, for data where T cell cross-recognition is of particular interest, the binding concordance can be used to establish the relative TCR binding contribution of each of the attributed pMHC targets. Growing evidence points to the relevance of T cell cross-recognition in both infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowell et al., 2022</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fluckiger et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, novel tools to interrogate this phenomena on a single T cell level are highly warranted.</p><p>The last evaluation metric, AUC of clonotype similarity, is based on the assumption that T cells sharing specificity have more similar TCR sequences than T cells of different specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chronister et al., 2021</xref>). This approach showed increasing separation of intra-specificities and inter-specificities as filters were cumulatively added, indicating that nonspecific binders were effectively removed. To further increase the AUC, discarding clonotype singlets (i.e., TCR clonotypes represented by only one GEM) was the best single filtering step to improve the AUC of similarity scores (AUC = 70.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This likely reflects that a fraction of such clonotype singlets represents nonspecific binding events. However, removing these as a standard procedure of ITRAP results in a substantial loss of TCR capture, represented by all T cell specificities with a light gray outer circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>. Thus, when aiming for capture of very low-frequency T cell specificities, a balance should be made between including this more stringent filtering step, or including such events, as demonstrated here.</p><p>The UMI thresholds identified by ITRAP are data specific and cannot be universally applied but must be fitted for individual experiments. To investigate this and the robustness of ITRAP further, we have in a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Povlsen et al., 2023</xref>) applied the method to the large 10x Genomics data set available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets</ext-link>. In short, we find that the ITRAP method also for this data set was capable of accurately denoising the raw data. This accuracy was manifested not only through highly improved internal performance (concordance, accuracy, and AUC) metric values, but also in improved predictive power of a NetTCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montemurro et al., 2022</xref>) machine learning method trained on the denoised data. Due to the very different experimental settings in the two data sets, the obtained UMI-based filtering thresholds as expected varied between the two studies. This indicates the high strength of ITRAP being robust at being applied to data generated in very different biological and technical settings.</p><p>Other than investigating the robustness of ITRAP, the paper also benchmarked ITRAP performance against ICON (Integrative COntext-specific Normalization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). ICON was similarly developed for denoising and discriminating true TCR-pMHC binding signal from nonspecific background noise in single-cell data. The results from this benchmark suggested an overall superior performance of the ITRAP method compared with the ICON method in terms of both data consistency and performance.</p><p>ICON was developed based on the public 10x Genomics data that includes 6 negative control pMHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutet et al., 2019</xref>) and 44 pMHC for positive selection of T cell populations. Comparing our method with ICON suggests that we present a more flexible and customizable approach. Where ICON yields a specific data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), the ITRAP method allows varying yields, depending on the level of filtering applied. The ITRAP method requires haplotype information for optimal filtering, which ICON does not consider resulting in ~15% mismatched HLAs of their specificity annotations. Further, we believe that negative control pMHCs may provide false confidence as we do not know the limits to T cell specificity. For both methods, a particular awareness should be assigned to properly handle the range of affinity displayed by different clonotypes. One clonotype may display natural low affinity toward its cognate target, which might appear like noise in the comparison to other high-affinity clonotypes. This diversity in signals is challenging to handle in a one-fit-all filtering process, and for projects with specific interest in low-affinity cell interactions, a specific focus should be addressed not to lose such information.</p><p>Effective pairing of TCR and pMHC will open new avenues to interrogate T cell recognition and the role of different T cell populations in pathogenic processes. Intensive efforts have been made to identify antigen specificity based on the TCR sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gielis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montemurro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sidhom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and access to both TCR α- and β-chain is important to improve such prediction strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montemurro et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The coveted data is ensured via the ITRAP framework for single-cell data of TCRs and associated barcodes. The perspectives of further exploiting the transcriptomic information, allowing in-depth tracking of specific T cell subsets based on the clonotypes, suggest that we are on the verge of achieving substantial novel insight to T cell involvement and behavior in health and disease.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ITRAP is a highly flexible tool for denoising sc-pMHC TCR data to identify the most likely pMHC-TCR pairs. The validation of the tool will benefit from future studies where the pMHC specificities of TCRs may be experimentally validated. Here, we provide a first important step toward this by enabling researchers identifying the most likely pair to proceed with also for very low frequent T cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All healthy donor material was collected from the central blood bank at the university hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen (under the agreement no.

The pMHC that had significantly higher mean UMI was annotated as the expected target and specificity annotations of the GEMs were individually evaluated. True interactions were then defined as GEMs where the most abundant pMHC matched the identified expected target. The GEMs where the most abundant pMHC did not match the expected target were labeled as false interactions. The GEMs belonging to clonotypes where no expected target was identified were left out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Defining specificity concordance</title><p>Concordance is an indirect measure of how cross-reactive a certain clonotype is. Specificity concordance is defined as the ratio of GEMs of a single clonotype that are annotated to bind a particular pMHC. The more GEMs in a clonotype annotated to the same pMHC the larger concordance. If a clonotype is only detected with one pMHC, the specificity concordance is 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Grid search on UMI features</title><p>Based on the labels of the training set, a performance metric, o, was defined to evaluate the accuracy at increasing thresholds for UMI count and UMI ratio of pMHC, α-chain, and β-chain.

Each feature was tested in the range of 0 to the median value, determined ad hoc from the experience that thresholds never approached the median value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Comparing TCR similarity</title><p>Effects of filtering were also evaluated through a comparison of TCR similarity. The similarity score is based on the kernel similarity score underlying the TCRmatch method between CDR3 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chronister et al., 2021</xref>). This score can be calculated for CDR3s of variable length and takes a value between 0–1, with the value of 1 representing identical pairs. As both the α- and β-chain partake in the pMHC interaction, TCRs will be compared based on the summed similarity between the α- and β-chains, and GEMs missing a chain will be excluded to avoid bias. Two similarity scores are computed for each unique TCRαβ-pair (per clonotype): an intra-score and an inter-score. The intra-score is based on the maximum similarity of the given clonotype to all other clonotypes sharing its pMHC target (intra-specificity). The inter-score is based on the maximum similarity of the given clonotype to an equal-sized set of clonotypes specific to other pMHC targets (inter-specificity). The computation is done peptide-wise, such that clonotypes with maximum concordance for a given peptide will, for that peptide, be included in an intra-similarity score, but for another peptide be included in an inter-similarity score. Clonotypes consisting of GEMs causing diverging specificities were limited to the expected target pMHC or, if nonexisting, to the specificity of highest concordance to avoid potential overlaps from ‘cross-reactive’ clonotypes in the computation.</p><p>The similarity difference between intra- and inter-specificity clonotypes was tested for the hypothesis that intra-similarity is greater than inter similarity (Wilcoxon, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05). The similarity test was performed on all filtering methods described in the paper.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Validating single-cell capture against fluorescent multimer staining responses</title><p>The 16 donors were known to respond to the panel of peptides used in the screening. Response proportions of sorted CD8+ T cells were detected by fluorescent multimer staining, as described previously. A total of 1800 cells were selected from each donor and, based on the detected response proportions, an adjusted count of cells could be computed. Cells were selected based on two criteria: ≥10 cells and ≥0.002% of total CD8 T cells, or ≤10 cells but ≥0.01% of total CD8 T cells. The multimer responses were compared to GEMs filtered on UMI thresholds and matching HLA. To visually compare the two screening methods, the responses were normalized within each sample and plotted side-by-side. The methods were also quantitatively compared, both in absolute counts of responses and as binary classes with multimer responses as true labels and single-cell responses as query labels.</p><p>The correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref> was also fitted via linear regression on log10 transformed data, resulting in the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.86</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.18</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.56</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The equation was used to estimate the yield of single-cell captured cells relative to multimer screening.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael E Birnbaum (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper is of interest to immunologists conducting single–cell analyses of T–cell recognition. It provides a means of curating datasets to ensure T cell–antigen pairs are identified. However, the data generated through this method often suffers from a relatively high background. The authors present a computational approach to enhance signal–to–noise of this type of analysis. However, from the reviewer's comments, it is unclear if the thresholds and filtering steps described by the authors can be generally applied to other datasets of different qualities than the one used here. The reviewers make suggestions to better stress–test the robustness of the method. Overall this is a potentially valuable contribution but requires additional benchmarking and more clarity on the limitations of the approach.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is more suitable for an <italic>eLife</italic> Resource given that it is entirely methodological and does not shed new biological insight.</p><p>2) There is a need for benchmarking the data against other datasets to assess the robustness and optimal threshold selection.</p><p>3) Ensure that the code and data used in the manuscript are publicly available so others can use the method.</p><p>4) Address reviewer comments about other technical concerns.</p><p>5) Consider the limitations of the study in the revised manuscript and title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It will be helpful for the figures in the manuscript to be of higher quality (vectorized) for publication – there are areas where figure quality made data interpretation difficult.</p><p>2. Line 34 – MHC should be defined.</p><p>3. Line 55 – a and b should be changed to α and β.</p><p>4. In figure 2, it is difficult to distinguish between HLA match True and False. May it be worth having the two in different colors?</p><p>5. Lines 116 – 121: It would help to clarify the use of the PE–multimers a bit more, than by using them while sorting for APC–only, it ensures that any PE–based signal is purely due to solution–based noise rather than cellular contamination. This was something I only fully understood after reading through the paper once.</p><p>6. In lines 160–168, the authors state that 28000 cells were sorted and 45% of the cells were lost in the loading process. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify how were these numbers generated. Were 28000 cells a proxy for 28000 sorted events? How did the authors know that 45% of cells were lost in the process and only 15,700 cells were loaded on the 10X?</p><p>7. Based on the observations and discussion in lines 288 through 298, it might be helpful if the authors explicitly stated that they are defining true binders = expected binder=significantly most abundant pMHC for a given clonotype, rather than as defined through orthogonal means.</p><p>8. On line 204 the authors mention that the three negative control pMHCs were only present in a few GEMs. However, are these barcodes were captured as ambient contamination or were they captured with distinct clonotypes?</p><p>9. Line 274–275: The authors state that for GEMs with TCR multiplets, they take the most abundant chain for analyses. It would help if this were clarified. Is this the most abundant UMI per GEM (so if a given GEM has ⍺1 with 10 UMIs and ⍺2 with 8 UMIs, it counts as ⍺1 ), or the most abundant call per clonotype? (so if there are 5 GEMs with ⍺1 with the most UMIs and 3 GEMs with ⍺2 with the most UMIs, the entire clonotype is called for ⍺1 )? Does this analysis already remove any ⍺ transcripts that are recombined but out of frame or contain stop codons?</p><p>10. Line 479–482: The percentages for HLA match and mismatch are provided – what would the probabilities be expected if by chance?</p><p>11. Lines 531–535: The authors should further clarify why differences in fluorescence signal may account for differences in analysis for the single–cell sequencing vs FACS, especially given the fact that the sequenced cells are also sorted via FACS before 10x analysis. Is there a difference in avidity and/or concentration between the two staining reagents used?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Please explain what was the motivation for doing the experiment. Are the donors seropositive/seronegative for CMV/EBV/Flu? Why were these particular epitopes selected? What was the phenotype of sorted cells? What was the hypothesis?</p><p>2) Please make the raw data, processed data, and code available. The main strength of the paper is the robust code which could be potentially used to clean up other datasets of the same kind. The link to github returns 404 error.</p><p>3) It seems that the approach is not robust in the presence of cross–reactivity. If there are two different pMHC complexes loaded with highly similar peptides recognized by the same clone (and thus two pMHCs with different barcodes bound to the same cell), how the specificity will be assigned (and how will it influence UMI threshold selection, lines 344–345)?</p><p>4) It seems that TCR similarity metrics (both for inter and intra–similarity) are defined as maximal similarity values across all the comparisons within the same peptide assignment, or others, lines 888–891. This value should be systematically biased by the sample size (the more pairwise comparisons we do, the more extreme similarity we will find, even if the underlying sequence distance distribution is the same). It is not clear to me, how authors normalize this effect (do they downsample to the minimal number of unique clonotypes across all epitopes)?</p><p>5) Figure S1 shows sharing of VJCDRab between GEMs. How will this plot look if we consider sharing of a single chain nucleotide sequence (VJCDR3a_nucleotide or VJCDR3bnucleotide) between GEMs? If a clone has two alphas, will the proposed pipeline split it into two different clonotypes?</p><p>6) Please discuss and compare the data analysis strategy to the one from the following recent manuscripts:</p><p>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abk3070</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590–022–01184–4</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9184244/</p><p>7) Line 318 mentions Figure 1d (probably instead of 2d)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– It will be clearer if the authors could provide a workflow of ATRAP that describes the key steps in the bioinformatic process.</p><p>– The cell number loaded on the 10X Chromium for each donor shown in supplementary table 4 indicated the GEM counts for each donor were less than 264. It would be important for the authors to comment on cell numbers and what threshold would be sufficient to perform this method. This would enable future users of the technique to have more guidance in decision–making.</p><p>– For experimental control, the authors only use three additional pMHC multimers bearing a different fluorochrome (PE). However, it would be more interesting to see if the authors could include negative pMHC multimers bearing the same fluorochrome (APC) to estimate the background binding noise for each donor and to check if the ATRAP could successfully remove those negative pMHC multimers.</p><p>– In this study, the author only used IEDB (Vita et al., 2019) and VDJ (Bagaev et al., 2020) databases to prove the detected specificities in their data have been cross–referenced on only five clonotypes. However, the author did not provide experimental evidence showing the pMHC selected by the ATRAP is a real target of a specific clonotype and that those pMHCs removed by the ATRAP are not the target of that clonotype. This may be a rather intensive set of experiments to show this, but the authors could consider it or at least make some statements/caveats if they choose not to do such additional validation.</p><p>– At lines 654–659, the authors write that low–avidity clonotypes might appear like noise, but this method is only able to detect the binding affinity, not the avidity. The binding affinity of TCR is not always correlated with avidity. I wonder if the information in their dataset really provides avidity measurements.</p><p>– At lines 344–345, it said that &quot;This filtering analysis resulted in optimal thresholds of 2 pMHC UMI counts and a ratio pMHC UMI counts between top one and two &gt;1&quot;. Is it possible if the sequence results are deeper that it might result in more noise or background pMHC UMI counts, in such a case, how would one adjust the optimal thresholds?</p><p>– In general, I think readers would find the V and J gene usage, along with other immune repertoire information interesting for all pMHC binders. The authors should consider this, perhaps as supplementary data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81810.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is more suitable for an eLife Resource given that it is entirely methodological and does not shed new biological insight.</p></disp-quote><p>We have no objections to this if the editor agrees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a need for benchmarking the data against other datasets to assess the robustness and optimal threshold selection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described such benchmark comparisons in a separate manuscript submitted for publication and currently available in BioRxiv doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.01.526310.

We are naturally very happy that <italic>eLife</italic> finds our work of interest. Regarding the specific question related to if the thresholds and filtering steps described in the current can be applied to other data sets, we have, as described above, conducted an analysis on the 10X Genomics data set in a separate manuscript. Here, we demonstrate that the method is both generally applicable to any single cell data set with UMI count information related to pMHC and TCR. We also demonstrated how the denoising can be highly improved if information about donor origin is included in terms of cell-hashing. Further, we find that the impact of the different filtering steps contained in ITRAP aligns well between the two studies. In one aspect the results however are somewhat different. This is with respect to the actual thresholds identified for the UMI filtering. Here, the values from the 10X data as expected were different compared to the values found in the current manuscript (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). These differences however in our view indicate the high strength of ITRAP being robust at being applied to data generated in very different biological and technical settings.

They are highly dominant pMHC specificities deselected in the sorting prior to the 10x single cell sequencing. It is hence expected that a small proportion of true positive TCRs towards these pMHCs can be found in the data. This is indeed the case, as 4 of the identified TCRs against the control peptides had identical matches within the IEDB/VDJdb database. As stated in the text, the three negative controls were only captured in a few GEMs. We have added the actual numbers (GIL:4 GEMs/Clonotypes, GLC: 17 GEMs/Clonotypes, and NLV: 12 GEMs/Clonotypes) to the manuscript to better underline this. Note, further from these numbers, that all negative control clonotypes are singletons, i.e one GEM per clonotype. -We also observe 107 cases where these pMHCs appear like contamination (i.e. with an UMI count lower than the top one pMHC). In 91 (85%) of these GEMs the negative control was present with 1 UMI, while the UMI counts range from 2-20 in the remaining GEMs. In comparison, a similar proportion of ambient contamination was observed for the CLG peptides. This peptide was found as a “contaminant” in 618 GEMs of which 523 (85%) had an UMI count of 1. These observations strongly suggest that the background of control pMHC barcodes is due to ambient contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Does this analysis already remove any ⍺ transcripts that are recombined but out of frame or contain stop codons?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a detailed observation, and a very good question. We assume the reviewer is referring to the text in lines 269-270 of the original submission. Clonotypes are defined from the TCRs present in the GEMs. This means that individual GEMs within a given clonotype can be TCR multiplets and have ambiguous TCR associations. The ITRAP pipeline does not resolve such ambiguities. This is done by the user and any given point in the filtering pipeline. In our case, this was done prior to conducting the similarity analysis. Here TCR annotations for individual GEMs were generated from the highest UMI count values. We have updated the text to clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

We have previous compared detection using these different types of pMHC reagents, and did not observe any differences for T cells recognizing viral epitopes (Bentzen, Nat Biot 2016). However, the two measures were runned on two different flow cytometers, and used different fluorophores, which can impact the fluorescent separation and cell identification. Furthermore, a threshold of 10 events was applied to the T cell detections strategy using the combinatorial-encoded tetramers, while in the single cell platform, all GEM that passed our filtering process was included. This discrepancy has been clarified in the manuscript (lines 564-567).</p><p>Moreover, we would here again like to refer to figure 7, where we demonstrate a very high concordance between the two approaches, reflected by the vast majority of the responses detected by fluorescent multimer staining also being captured in the single-cell screening, (recall of 0.95).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Please explain what was the motivation for doing the experiment. Are the donors seropositive/seronegative for CMV/EBV/Flu? Why were these particular epitopes selected? What was the phenotype of sorted cells? What was the hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the text above related to the selection of donors and epitopes. It was not essential for us to know the phenotype of the cells in this study, hence we have not investigated this parameter. However, this could be explored looking more into the transcriptomic data which is available and in future experiments by including TotalSeq antibodies for simultaneous staining of surface markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please make the raw data, processed data, and code available. The main strength of the paper is the robust code which could be potentially used to clean up other datasets of the same kind. The link to github returns 404 error.</p></disp-quote><p>All data and code has been made available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/suppl/immunology/ITRAP</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It seems that the approach is not robust in the presence of cross–reactivity. If there are two different pMHC complexes loaded with highly similar peptides recognized by the same clone (and thus two pMHCs with different barcodes bound to the same cell), how the specificity will be assigned (and how will it influence UMI threshold selection, lines 344–345)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important question. As described above, ITRAP does not exclude cross-reactivity. The filtering thresholds are defined from a subset of clonetypes with well-defined single specificities. While one can argue that a minor limitation of ITRAP is that such well-defined single specificity clonotypes are needed, we believe this will most often be the case. And if not, a limited set of prevalent pMHC targets can be included to ensure this. Once these thresholds are defined, clonotypes with multiple specificities can trivially be identified and analyzed. Note that this is in contrast to what can be archived with for instance the ICON method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It seems that TCR similarity metrics (both for inter and intra–similarity) are defined as maximal similarity values across all the comparisons within the same peptide assignment, or others, lines 888–891. This value should be systematically biased by the sample size (the more pairwise comparisons we do, the more extreme similarity we will find, even if the underlying sequence distance distribution is the same). It is not clear to me, how authors normalize this effect (do they downsample to the minimal number of unique clonotypes across all epitopes)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important and insightful observation. In the inter versus intra similarity analysis, all clonotypes within a given plateau (with a given annotated peptide specificity) are compared against all other clonotypes within the plateau and against the same number of clonotypes randomly sampled from all other plateaus. It is clear that this sampling approach could result in biases associated with the size of the given plateau. It is however not to us trivially clear whether this bias would be in favor of larger or short plateaus having a significant difference between inter and intra similarity scores. It is trivially clear that the intra similarity score will be biased towards higher values for larger plateaus, but the same is the case for the inter similarity score (since we here also are comparing against a larger set of TCRs from other plateaus). Given this we believe our current simple approach is fair and suitable for capturing the proposed signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure S1 shows sharing of VJCDRab between GEMs. How will this plot look if we consider sharing of a single chain nucleotide sequence (VJCDR3a_nucleotide or VJCDR3bnucleotide) between GEMs? If a clone has two alphas, will the proposed pipeline split it into two different clonotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>The pipeline does as such not refine clonotypes. Clonotypes are defined from the TCR annotations of 10X CellRanger. The only modifications are the cases listed in the section “Clonotype annotation” and covers “we redefine clonotypes based on TCR annotation. Subsequently, GEMs with no clonotype annotation from 10x were annotated to existing clonotypes conditioned on matching VJαβ-genes and CDR3αβ sequences or as novel clonotypes. Similarly, clonotypes with identical VJ-CDR3αβ were merged to form larger groups of theoretically identical TCRs”.</p><p>While we agree that a further analysis of the sharing of VJCDR between GEMs is interesting, we believe that such an additional analysis split on VJCDR3a_nucleotide or VJCDR3b_nucleotide is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please discuss and compare the data analysis strategy to the one from the following recent manuscripts:</p><p>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abk3070</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590–022–01184–4</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9184244/</p></disp-quote><p>All these studies are related to data generation rather than data denoising. As stated above, we are currently in the process of analyzing these data using the ITRAP framework. We however believe these analyses are beyond the scope of the current publication. Note also that we, as stated above, have conducted a benchmark experiment of the data set provided by 10x Genomics. The results is this study described in an separate publication [BioRxiv doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.01.526310]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Line 318 mentions Figure 1d (probably instead of 2d)</p></disp-quote><p>Resolved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– It will be clearer if the authors could provide a workflow of ATRAP that describes the key steps in the bioinformatic process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added a workflow of ITRAP to the revised manuscript (new Supplementary figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The cell number loaded on the 10X Chromium for each donor shown in supplementary table 4 indicated the GEM counts for each donor were less than 264. It would be important for the authors to comment on cell numbers and what threshold would be sufficient to perform this method. This would enable future users of the technique to have more guidance in decision–making.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of GEMs captured in a single 10X run is expected to be of the order 8000-10000. Of these only a proportion will end up containing signals for both pMHC and TCR (in our case ~6000). Upon filtering this number is further reduced to ~4000. Splitting these responses among the individual donors (hashing) results in ~200 GEMs per donor (note that hashing entry 10 covers multiple donors, and hence take up a higher proportion of the GEMS). The observed GEM count of 264 or less per donor is hence what should be expected when conducting an experiment with a complexity like the one performed here. Note however, that even with these low GEMs counts per donor, we were able to detect responses that strongly align both qualitatively and quantitatively with what has been observed in the same donors using conventional fluorescent multimer staining. We have elaborated briefly on this in the text, by indicating that the number of captured GEMs with a given TCR-pMHC pair is directly proportional with the input. Hence low numbers of cells included from one sample will result in lower numbers of GEMs for any given pMHC-TCR pair.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to include a discussion of this (lines 579-585).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For experimental control, the authors only use three additional pMHC multimers bearing a different fluorochrome (PE). However, it would be more interesting to see if the authors could include negative pMHC multimers bearing the same fluorochrome (APC) to estimate the background binding noise for each donor and to check if the ATRAP could successfully remove those negative pMHC multimers.</p></disp-quote><p>The PE labeled pMHC multimers were only included as internal controls for us to get a first qualitative estimation of the specificity of the 10X technology. Also refer to previous response for the rationale for including the PE labeled pMHCs, i.e. to actively deselect certain specificities.</p><p>We actively chose not to be dependent on experimental controls in the ITRAP method. We believe this is an advantage of the ITRAP approach over for instance ICON where negative controls are explicitly needed in order to define background noise. This requirement imposes an additional cost for barcode MHC-multimer reagents. We agree with the reviewer that it can be valuable for users to investigate their data broadly to “estimate” background signals. However, in most experimental setups where several samples are screened in parallel (including the one included in this manuscript) indirect negative controls will be included. This includes HLA mismatches for the samples, and the notion that no sample is expected to recognise all pMHCs (based on previous screens). Our experience is that these might be more relevant as negative controls, since we can in fact not be sure that a given epitope is not recognised due to cross-recognition events or binding of T cells from the naive repertoire.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In this study, the author only used IEDB (Vita et al., 2019) and VDJ (Bagaev et al., 2020) databases to prove the detected specificities in their data have been cross–referenced on only five clonotypes. However, the author did not provide experimental evidence showing the pMHC selected by the ATRAP is a real target of a specific clonotype and that those pMHCs removed by the ATRAP are not the target of that clonotype. This may be a rather intensive set of experiments to show this, but the authors could consider it or at least make some statements/caveats if they choose not to do such additional validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further experimental validation is needed to fully confirm the specificities of the TCRs identified/removed by ITRAP. However, we believe it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript to conduct such experiments. As stated earlier, we have however in a separate publication demonstrated that applying ITRAP to denoise SC pMHC-TCR data, results in high predictive power on TCR-specificity predictors compared to training on the raw unfiltered data. We have expanded the discussion to underline this, and clarify that additional validations are needed to fully confirm the identified TCR specificities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At lines 654–659, the authors write that low–avidity clonotypes might appear like noise, but this method is only able to detect the binding affinity, not the avidity. The binding affinity of TCR is not always correlated with avidity. I wonder if the information in their dataset really provides avidity measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the use of the word “avidity” is misleading. We have updated the manuscript and replaced this work with affinity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At lines 344–345, it said that &quot;This filtering analysis resulted in optimal thresholds of 2 pMHC UMI counts and a ratio pMHC UMI counts between top one and two &gt;1&quot;. Is it possible if the sequence results are deeper that it might result in more noise or background pMHC UMI counts, in such a case, how would one adjust the optimal thresholds?</p></disp-quote><p>It is clear that the optimal filtering thresholds are somewhat dependent on the setup applied in the given experiment (see further above). This setup includes the sequencing approach and depth. However, as described in the responses to reviewer 2, one of the powers of ITRAP is the step where the optimal filtering thresholds are defined. The step makes the method flexible with respect to such experimental variations. We have demonstrated this in a benchmark study based on the publicly available 10x data, where we applied ITRAP for denoising of the data. Here slightly different filtering threshold values were identified reflecting the differences in the experimental setup between the two studies. We have included a section to the revised manuscript briefly summarizing these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, I think readers would find the V and J gene usage, along with other immune repertoire information interesting for all pMHC binders. The authors should consider this, perhaps as supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is a very interesting suggestion, we believe such an analysis will add limited value to the current study (where denoising is the prime focus). We have nonetheless made the analysis from the data included in figure 6C (i.e. filtered by UMI thresholds, HLA match, and complete TCRs). The result is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Here, the gene usage for each positive pMHC multimer is displayed as a Sankey diagram for the 10 most frequent gene-pairs. We suggest including such analyses in future studies where a biological interpretation of the denoised data is of interest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
