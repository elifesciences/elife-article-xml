identified. Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are strongly induced in the liver by systemic infection and in the intestine by bacterial colonization, but their exact functions remain unclear. Here we show that mouse and human SAAs are retinol binding proteins. Mouse and human SAAs bound retinol with nanomolar affinity, were associated with retinol in vivo, and limited the bacterial burden in tissues after acute infection. We determined the crystal structure of mouse SAA3 at a resolution of 2 Å, finding that it forms a tetramer with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. Our results thus identify SAAs as a family of microbe-inducible retinol binding proteins, reveal a unique protein architecture involved in retinol binding, and suggest how retinol is circulated during infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vitamins are nutrients that organisms require in order to survive and grow. If an organism is unable to synthesize a vitamin in sufficient quantities, it is essential that it obtain the vitamin through its diet instead.</p><p>Vitamin A is found in foods such as eggs, animal liver and carrots, and a diet that is lacking in this vitamin can cause blindness and an increased risk of microbial infections. Vitamin A is not a single compound, but rather a collection of compounds with similar molecular structures. One of these is retinol, which plays a vital role in the body's response to microbial infection. Retinol must bind to specific proteins to be able to move through the bloodstream and be transported around the body.</p><p>Serum retinol binding protein transports ingested retinol from the intestine to the liver and other tissues. However, during microbial infection—when retinol transport is particularly important—the amount of this protein dramatically decreases; as such it is unclear how retinol is transported when the body is under attack from pathogens.</p><p>It had been suggested that Serum Amyloid A (SAA) proteins, a family of proteins made by some liver and intestinal cells, could be involved in the response to infection, because these proteins' levels increase during infection. However, their exact functions were unknown. Derebe, Zlatkov et al. found that mice fed a diet poor in vitamin A produced fewer SAA proteins in their liver and intestinal cells. However, treating the cells with retinol or the molecule it is broken down into—called retinoic acid—caused more SAAs to be made. Derebe, Zlatkov et al. also discovered that SAAs are associated with retinol in blood samples taken from mice infected with salmonella; and that both mouse and human SAAs bind tightly to retinol. Combined, this evidence suggests that SAAs are the retinol binding proteins that transport retinol during infections.</p><p>Derebe, Zlatkov et al. went on to solve the crystal structure of a mouse SAA protein, and showed that four SAA molecules bind together to form a ‘pocket’ that can hold a retinol molecule. Future work will focus on understanding exactly how the transport of retinol by SAAs affects the development of immunity to infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03206.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03206.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retinol transport</kwd><kwd>serum amyloid A</kwd><kwd>acute phase response</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK070855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Minority Enrichment Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derebe</surname><given-names>Mehabaw G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UNCF/Merck Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derebe</surname><given-names>Mehabaw G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001063</institution-id><institution>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaishnava</surname><given-names>Shipra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AI005284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zlatkov</surname><given-names>Clare M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serum amyloid A proteins bind retinol with nanomolar affinity, and do so by forming oligomers that create a hydrophobic pocket that shields retinol from the aqueous environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinol plays a vital role in the physiological response to microbial challenge. Retinol is derived from dietary vitamin A and can be converted enzymatically to retinoic acid, which complexes with nuclear receptors to regulate gene transcription programs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Germain et al., 2006</xref>). In this way, retinol promotes the maturation of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawson and Berliner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stephensen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>), governs the differentiation of adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mucida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2011</xref>), and facilitates the regeneration of epithelial barriers damaged by infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osanai et al., 2007</xref>). A hallmark of vitamin A deficiency in humans is a markedly increased susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34a">Sommer 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40a">Underwood, 2004</xref>), underscoring the broad impact of retinol on immunity.</p><p>As a small lipid-soluble compound, retinol cannot freely circulate but is instead transported among cells and tissues by specialized retinol binding proteins. Serum retinol binding protein (RBP) facilitates transport of retinol among the intestine, which is the site of retinol acquisition, the liver, which is the major site of retinoid storage, and other tissues that require retinol for their physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaner, 1989</xref>). Despite the increased requirement for retinol, serum RBP is markedly reduced following microbial challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosales et al., 1996</xref>), leaving open the question of how retinol is transported among tissues during infection.</p><p>Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are a family of proteins that are expressed in the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reigstad and Bäckhed, 2010</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999</xref>) and circulate in the serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whitehead et al., 1992</xref>). SAA family members are encoded in the genomes of virtually all vertebrates and are highly conserved among species, suggesting essential biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uhlar et al., 1994</xref>). Expression of SAAs is strongly induced by microbial exposure. SAAs are induced in intestinal epithelial cells by the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reigstad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reigstad and Bäckhed, 2010</xref>), and have been implicated in promoting Th17 cell development in response to specific microbiota components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, liver and serum SAAs are markedly elevated following systemic bacterial or viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meek and Benditt, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiba et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although it has been proposed that SAAs generally contribute to inflammation and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckhardt et al., 2010</xref>), the exact functions of SAAs remain poorly defined. Interestingly, SAAs have characteristics that suggest they could bind hydrophobic ligands. First, all SAAs are predicted to form amphipathic helices with a hydrophobic face that could interact with non-polar molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stevens, 2004</xref>). Second, SAAs circulate in the serum associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which transports lipid-bound lipoproteins amongst tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whitehead et al., 1992</xref>). However, the identity of potential SAA ligand(s) remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that mouse and human SAAs are retinol binding proteins. We demonstrate that SAA expression in mice requires dietary vitamin A, that mouse and human SAAs bind tightly to retinol, and that SAA recovered from serum following bacterial infection is associated with retinol. We find that <italic>Saa1/2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, which harbor deletions of both the <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>Saa2</italic> genes, have higher bacterial burdens in spleen and liver following an acute bacterial infection, supporting an essential role for SAAs in the response to microbial challenge. Finally, we provide structural insight into the binding interaction by solving the mouse SAA3 crystal structure, which reveals a tetrameric assembly with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. These studies thus identify SAAs as a family of retinol binding proteins and reveal a new protein architecture supporting retinol binding. Our findings suggest that SAAs mediate retinol transport during microbial challenge and thus constitute a key component of the physiological response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SAA expression requires dietary vitamin A</title><p>Initially we uncovered a relationship between SAA expression and dietary vitamin A status in mice. Microarray analysis disclosed that mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet exhibited lower abundances of serum amyloid A (<italic>Saa</italic>) 1 and 2 transcripts in the intestine as compared to mice fed a vitamin A-replete diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Real-time quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence analysis verified that expression of small intestinal SAA1, 2, and 3 was reduced in mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Liver expression of SAA1 and 2 was also reduced in mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet, although the reduction in expression was less pronounced than in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This is likely because dietary vitamin A deficiency does not completely deplete stored retinoids in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Gudas, 2005</xref>). We also observed elevated expression of intestinal <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>Saa2</italic> following addition of retinol directly to the epithelial surface of small intestinal explants, and of liver <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>Saa2</italic> after intraperitoneal supplementation with retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings support the idea that retinoids directly impact <italic>Saa</italic> expression. Addition of retinol or retinoic acid to cultured HepG2 cells (a human liver cell line) enhanced expression of <italic>SAA1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> in the presence of IL-1β and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), suggesting that the impact of dietary vitamin A on SAA expression is due to cell-intrinsic effects of retinoids. Collectively, these results show that full expression of SAAs in the intestine and liver requires dietary vitamin A.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Primers used in Q-PCR analysis</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03206.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03206.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Primer name</th><th>Primer sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>mouse SAA1 F</td><td>5ʹ-CATTTGTTCACGAGGCTTTCC</td></tr><tr><td>mouse SAA1 R</td><td>5ʹ-GTTTTTCCAGTTAGCTTCCTTCATGT</td></tr><tr><td>mouse SAA2 F</td><td>5ʹ-TGTGTATCCCACAAGGTTTCAGA</td></tr><tr><td>mouse SAA2 R</td><td>5ʹ-TTATTACCCTCTCCTCCTCAAGCA</td></tr><tr><td>mouse SAA3 F</td><td>5ʹ-CGCAGCACGAGCAGGAT</td></tr><tr><td>mouse SAA3 R</td><td>5ʹ-CCAGGATCAAGATGCAAAGAATG</td></tr><tr><td>human SAA1 F</td><td>5ʹ-GGCATACAGCCATACCATTC</td></tr><tr><td>human SAA1 R</td><td>5ʹ-CCTTTTGGCAGCATCATAGT</td></tr><tr><td>human SAA2 F</td><td>5ʹ-GCTTCCTCTTCACTCTGCTCT</td></tr><tr><td>human SAA2 R</td><td>5ʹ-TGCCATATCTCAGCTTCTCTG</td></tr><tr><td>mouse 18S F</td><td>5ʹ-CATTCGAACGTCTGCCCTATC</td></tr><tr><td>mouse 18S R</td><td>5ʹ-CCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGGA</td></tr><tr><td>mouse Gapdh F</td><td>5ʹ-TGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC</td></tr><tr><td>mouse Gapdh R</td><td>5ʹ-AAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCCG</td></tr><tr><td>human Gapdh F</td><td>5ʹ-CCTGGTCACCAGGGCTGCTTTTAAC</td></tr><tr><td>human Gapdh R</td><td>5ʹ-GTCGTTGAGGGCAATGCCAGCC</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SAA expression requires dietary vitamin A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice were maintained on a normal (Vit.

To understand how SAAs bind retinol, we therefore determined the three-dimensional structure of recombinant mSAA3 by X-ray crystallography. The protein was crystallized in a P6<sub>2</sub> space group with two subunits in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was determined to a resolution of 2 Å by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing using a selenomethionyl-derivatived crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Like the SAA1.1 structure, the mSAA3 structure consists of four α-helices, designated α1-4 from the N- to the C-termini, forming a cone-shaped four-helix bundle with a comparatively longer α1. The helices form two sets of antiparallel helices, α1-α2 and α3-α4, connected by a very short loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The monomer is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonding interactions among conserved residues and water molecules in the interior of the monomer. As in the SAA1.1 structure, the C-terminal tail wraps around the helix bundle making a number of hydrogen bonding interactions that add to monomer stability, underscoring the importance of the C-terminal tail.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of mSAA3 and molecular contacts within the tetrameric unit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the mSAA3 monomer (side view), with helices and termini labeled.

This is in contrast to the hexameric structure derived for SAA1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). There are several potential reasons for the discrepancy in the oligomeric structures. First, it has been suggested that different SAAs can adopt different oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2011</xref>). SAA1.1 was also observed to produce a ∼43 kDa species in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that SAA1.1 may in part adopt a tetrameric state.

The dimers pack against each other through an aromatic interface formed by W71, as well as a non-polar interaction involving V75 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). The dimer is formed by two identical chains oriented pseudo-anti-parallel to each other, and is held together by two pairs of tight hydrogen bond interactions between K74 and D78 residues on oppositely oriented α3 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The interaction is also supported by a set of aromatic interactions between F99 and W103 of the α4 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These interactions result in tightly held α3 helices composed primarily of non-polar residues, thus forming the inside hollow pocket of the tetramer. The hollow pocket is surrounded by the remaining helices, creating a hydrophobic interior that is protected from the external aqueous environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The mouse SAA3 central channel is predicted to accommodate retinol</title><p>Retinol is a highly apolar lipid-like molecule consisting of a β-ionone ring, an isoprenoid tail, and a hydroxyl group. Thus, it requires a non-polar environment for transport among tissues and within cells. Structures of known retinol binding proteins, including serum RBP, indicate that these proteins consist mainly of β-sheet secondary structures forming a β-barrel tertiary structure, with the retinol molecule held in an interior non-polar binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newcomer et al., 1984</xref>). In contrast, mSAA3 is α-helical and oligomerizes to form a hollow, largely non-polar interior that could serve as a binding pocket for a non-polar small molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We were unable to obtain mSAA3 crystals with the bound retinol ligand as retinol is highly unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barua and Furr, 1998</xref>) and the crystals required several weeks to grow. However, a ligand docking analysis using SwissDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosdidier et al., 2011</xref>) indicated that retinol can be docked in this hydrophobic pocket with favorable free energy (∼ −7 kcal/mol) and FullFitness values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zoete et al., 2010</xref>) (∼ −2400 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, introducing a Trp71Ala (W71A) mutation in the mSAA3 hydrophobic core reduced the affinity of mSAA3 for retinol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, the mSAA3 structure supports our biochemical data showing a retinol binding function for SAAs and explains how mSAA3 could bind retinol.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The mSAA3 tetramer forms a hollow hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A surface rendering of the tetramer showing the interior cavity, with the electrostatic potential displayed using a color gradient ranging from negative (red) to neutral (white) to positive (blue).

Retinol and retinoic acid are critical for the development of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawson and Berliner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mucida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>), and also promote maintenance and repair of epithelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osanai et al., 2007</xref>). However, a prominent response to acute infection is the marked decline in serum RBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosales et al., 1996</xref>), which paradoxically occurs at a time of increased demand for retinol to support development of immunity and barrier defense. Thus, it has been unclear how retinol is transported among tissues following an acute microbial challenge.</p><p>We propose that SAAs fulfill this role, supported by several lines of evidence. First, SAAs are strongly induced by microbial exposure at sites of retinol uptake (intestine) and storage (liver), and are present at high levels in the circulation following microbial challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reigstad et al., 2009</xref>).

Third, the three dimensional structure of mSAA3 exhibits a hollow hydrophobic binding pocket, providing structural insight into how SAAs bind retinol.</p><p>Although the precise tissue targets of circulating retinol-bound SAAs remain under investigation, several observations support the idea that SAAs promote immunity to infection.

SAA4 circulates at concentrations that are markedly lower than those observed for SAA1 and 2 following acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Beer et al., 1995</xref>) but are similar to the concentrations of RBP in uninfected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Willett et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman et al., 1986</xref>). SAA4 is 54–56% homologous to SAA1, 2, and 3, and retains the hydrophobic amino acids that are predicted to line the hydrophobic binding pocket in SAA3. Further, homology modeling using the mouse SAA3 structure and the mouse SAA4 sequences yields a SAA4 model with a highly similar predicted structure (alignment score of 0.1 and a Global Model Quality Estimate of 0.73). Thus, the possibility that SAA4 is a retinol binding protein that functions to transport retinol in healthy, non-infected animals will be a subject for future investigation.</p><p>SAA1, 2, and 3 are markedly induced in the intestinal epithelium by the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reigstad and Bäckhed, 2010</xref>), and thus our findings may provide insight into how the intestinal microbiota regulates host immunity and inflammation. Previous studies have suggested that SAAs promote Th17 cell development in response to specific components of the microbiota, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with a function for SAAs in retinol binding and transport, retinol/retinoic acid is required to elicit Th17 cell responses to infection and mucosal vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2011</xref>). A key question is whether there are tissue-specific effects of intestinal epithelial SAAs, or whether the intestinal SAAs enter the circulation with bound retinol acquired directly from the diet. For example, intestinal epithelial SAAs could be involved in the direct delivery of retinol from epithelial cells to underlying immune cells in the lamina propria, or from epithelial cells to mucosal lymphoid tissues.</p><p>Altogether, our results provide insight into the biological function of SAAs, reveal a new protein architecture that supports retinol binding, and suggest how retinol is transported among cells and tissues during infection. These findings may prove useful in designing new strategies for enhancing resistance to infection and/or controlling inflammation during disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 wild-type mice were maintained in the barrier at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. <italic>Saa1/2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were obtained from Dr Frederick C de Beer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckhardt et al., 2010</xref>) at the University of Kentucky and were maintained in the barrier at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 6–12 weeks old mice were used for all experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Andrew MacPherson, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Derebe et al describe the induction of the family of serum amyloid A proteins by vitamin A and their role in the transport of retinol and its derivatives. This is a novel and interesting study that has important implications for understanding of the multiple functions of vitamin A in infection and immunity. The work has been carefully performed to a very high standard work and is suitable for publication essentially in its present form.</p><p>The starting point of the paper was an Affy transcript abundance analysis that captured the coincidence of ileal gene expression alterations comparing germ-free and colonised mice with alterations depending on whether colonised mice were maintained on a vitamin A-deficient or -sufficient diet. The genes that show consistent expression differences include saa 1 and 2 (please note that I assume that saa 3 should be substituted for one of the saa1 labels, which appear twice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The interpretation that SAA (1 and 3) are transport proteins for retinol is justified by direct binding studies, by elution from serum using the authentic retinol standard to calibrate LC MS and the use of SAA (1 and 2) deficient mice in a strain-combination setup. There is also a neat demonstration of a non-polar binding pocket in crystallographic analysis of SAA3, which is shown directly to form a tetramer through crosslinking studies.</p><p>The binding and structural studies are strong and represent the major advance of the paper. The link between vit A and SAA expression provides some valuable functional insight but this part is not as well-developed. The final experiment showing that SAA-deficient mice are less able to clear experimental <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> challenge at 24 hours is not directly linked to the earlier results mechanistically, although there is abundant evidence of retinoid shaping of immunity that makes this beyond the scope of the paper.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors nicely show that intestinal and liver SAA expression is reduced following a vitamin A deficient diet. To support a direct effect, do the authors know if Vitamin A supplementation reverses these changes?</p><p>2) The list of other transcripts in the list presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> is intriguing and it would be helpful if the authors could comment on this a little more. H-Antigen, dual oxidases, the NHE antiporter and the granzymes all have interesting disease associations.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> the open bars for IL-1beta + IL-6 without retinol appear to be identical for both SAA1 and SAA2: this may be coincidence, but I wondered whether an error had crept in?</p><p>4) Can the authors add any further information on how retinol/RA induces SAA in HepG2 cells?</p><p>5) Further information on the route of infection is required for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. What is the impact of SAA deficiency on the intestinal response to <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>? It would also be better to show the geometric means in view of the log scale.</p><p>6) What role might the constitutive (SAA5) play in the process of retinol transport? Given the role of SAA as an acute phase protein, what are the consequences of induction during non-infectious inflammation (e.g. autoinflammatory syndromes) from retinoid signaling?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03206.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The starting point of the paper was an Affy transcript abundance analysis that captured the coincidence of ileal gene expression alterations comparing germ-free and colonised mice with alterations depending on whether colonised mice were maintained on a vitamin A-deficient or -sufficient diet.

To support a direct effect, do the authors know if Vitamin A supplementation reverses these changes</italic>?</p><p>This is a great question, and we have performed additional experiments to address this point. To test whether retinoids directly impact intestinal <italic>Saa</italic> expression we performed experiments with intestinal explants supplemented with retinol directly delivered onto the mucosal surface. We initially tried this experiment with explants from vitamin A-deficient mice but found that the tissue viability was extremely poor. However, we were able to detect increased <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> expression in small intestinal explants harvested from vitamin A-replete mice that were supplemented with direct mucosal delivery of retinol. (While we can detect <italic>Saa3</italic> in vivo, we were unable to detect it in our explant system, likely due to its substantially lower levels of expression relative to <italic>Saa1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>.)

There is a known role for retinoic acid in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation (Allie et al., J. Immunol<italic>.</italic>, vol. 190, p. 2178-2187), which could explain the lowered abundance of granzyme transcripts (GzmA and GzmB) in the vitamin A-deficient mice. More interestingly, the array unexpectedly revealed that expression of three mucus-modifying glycosyltransferases (Fut2, Gcnt1, and B3galt5) is sensitive to dietary vitamin A, suggesting that vitamin A status could impact mucus glycan structure. The potential significance of the increased abundance of sodium:hydrogen antiporter (Slc9a3) transcripts is less apparent as there are no prior reports of its transcriptional regulation by retinoids. We have now added a comment about these findings to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref> <italic>the open bars for IL-1beta + IL-6 without retinol appear to be identical for both SAA1 and SAA2: this may be coincidence, but I wondered whether an error had crept in</italic>?</p><p>We double-checked our data, and this is a coincidence.

Given the amount of data that we have accumulated on this point, we are planning to prepare a separate manuscript that describes this mechanism in detail, and are hoping that the reviewers agree that this lies outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Further information on the route of infection is required for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>.</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

This was a key reason for our focus on the response of the <italic>Saa1/2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to systemic rather than oral bacterial challenge. When we challenge the <italic>Saa1/2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice orally with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, we detect no statistically significant differences in luminal colonization levels or dissemination to mucosal or systemic sites, as might be predicted by the presence of intestinal SAA3 in these mice. Ongoing work is focused on generating mice that lack all SAA isoforms, as these will likely produce better insight into the role of SAAs in immunity to mucosal infections.</p><p><italic>It would also be better to show the geometric means in view of the log scale</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and now show the geometric means in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) What role might the constitutive (SAA5) play in the process of retinol transport</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. SAA5 (now designated as mouse SAA4, and equivalent to SAA4 in humans) is expressed in the livers of uninfected mice and humans and secreted into the bloodstream at concentrations of ∼50 ug/ml. This is well below the concentrations of &gt;1 mg/ml that are observed for SAA1 and SAA2 after acute infection, but similar to the serum concentrations of retinol binding protein in healthy individuals. SAA4 shows 54-56% homology to SAA1, 2, and 3, so it is more distantly related. However, it retains the hydrophobic amino acids that are predicted to line the hydrophobic binding pocket in SAA3. Further, we performed homology modeling using the mouse SAA3 structure and the mouse SAA4 sequence that yielded a SAA4 model with a highly similar predicted structure. We therefore predict that SAA4 is also a retinol binding protein. If so, it is possible that SAA4 functions in retinol transport in healthy, non-infected animals. We have added additional text discussing this point to the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Given the role of SAA as an acute phase protein</italic>, <italic>what are the consequences of induction during non-infectious inflammation (e.g. autoinflammatory syndromes) from retinoid signaling?</italic></p><p>Liver SAA expression is upregulated by cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, and thus could also be induced during inflammatory states that are independent of infection. Supporting this idea, elevated serum SAA levels have been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., Arthritis Res 2, 142-144). We speculate that SAAs mediate retinol transport during such inflammatory states just as they do during infection, and plan to investigate this possibility in our future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
