However, the exact involvement of these neurochemical mechanisms in the chain of information processing, and across human development, is unclear. In a cross-sectional longitudinal design, we used a computational approach to dissociate cognitive, decision, and visuomotor processing in 293 individuals spanning early childhood to adulthood. We found that glutamate and GABA within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) explained unique variance in visuomotor processing, with higher glutamate predicting poorer visuomotor processing in younger participants but better visuomotor processing in mature participants, while GABA showed the opposite pattern. These findings, which were neurochemically, neuroanatomically and functionally specific, were replicated ~21 mo later and were generalized in two further different behavioral tasks. Using resting functional MRI, we revealed that the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is mediated by functional connectivity in the visuomotor network. We then extended our findings to high-level cognitive behavior by predicting fluid intelligence performance. We present evidence that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing. However, this evidence was obtained using an uncorrected alpha and needs to be replicated in future studies. These results provide an integrative biological and psychological mechanistic explanation that links cognitive processes and neurotransmitters across human development and establishes their potential involvement in intelligent behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visuomotor processing</kwd><kwd>fluid intelligence</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>frontoparietal network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203139/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen Kadosh</surname><given-names>Roi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>338065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen Kadosh</surname><given-names>Roi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

However, little is known about the neurochemical mechanisms shaping these processes across development in humans. An influential computational framework has been extensively applied in recent years as it allows the behavioral dissection between cognitive, decision, and visuomotor processes. This framework is based on the drift–diffusion model and analyzes reaction time and accuracy, usually in two-choice response time tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wagenmakers et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The diffusion parameters, which we describe in detail in the following paragraph, have shown satisfactory retest reliability and the diffusion paradigm has been widely utilized in a wide range of behavioral tasks assessing various cognitive processes, including attention, lexical decision, recognition memory, priming, and numerical cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Bueren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang-Pollock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lerche and Voss, 2017</xref>). Moreover, this robust diffusion framework has been widely applied in non-clinical and clinical domains, including schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), visual impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moustafa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Metin et al., 2013</xref>), and in brain-based interventions to target specific mental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Bueren et al., 2021</xref>). It has been suggested that diffusion models can facilitate the understanding of clinical disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">White et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the application of this model has spanned disparate fields and holds the promise of illuminating the elusive function and malfunction processes of the central nervous system.</p><p>While different types of drift–diffusion models exist, one of the models, the EZ-diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wagenmakers et al., 2007</xref>), generates three unobserved variables: mean drift rate (cognitive processing), boundary separation (decision processing), and non-decision time (visuomotor processing). The mean drift rate is typically computed in simple binary choice tasks where humans accumulate evidence in favor of the different alternatives before committing to a decision, reflecting cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pisauro et al., 2017</xref>). The mean drift rate is a computational construct that assesses the quality of information processes or speed of information uptake processes, where an increase in mean drift rate is believed to induce more accurate and faster decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang and Rowe, 2014</xref>). Boundary separation is a computational construct that assesses response conservativeness regarding the decision criterion. The trade-off between decision speed and accuracy is thought to be created by changing the boundary separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang and Rowe, 2014</xref>). Non-decision time is a computational construct that assesses the subset of the reaction time devoted to perceptual processes and motor response execution. Namely, non-decision time is the time spent on processing other than the decision process, and it is usually referred to as reflecting the early perceptual processing of the stimulus of interest and the implementation of the motor response once the decision process is completed, reflecting visuomotor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Philiastides and Ratcliff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mulder et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to mean drift rate and boundary separation, non-decision time exhibits well-characterized developmental shifts. Children exhibited lower mean drift rate, higher boundary separation, and longer non-decision time compared to college-aged adults in numerical discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">von Krause et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>Which brain regions are involved in the diffusion parameters?</italic> Frontal and parietal regions are thought to track evidence accumulation before reaching a decision in a task-independent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pisauro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, a study combining functional MRI fMRI and the drift–diffusion model identified that frontoparietal areas corresponded to the decision variables resulting from the downstream stimulus–criterion comparison independent of stimulus type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">White et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of mainly frontal and parietal regions in encoding the diffusion parameters raises the possibility that neurodevelopmental changes within frontoparietal network regions may shape the well-documented developmental fluctuations in diffusion parameters, especially in tasks that mainly recruit the frontoparietal network, such as attention and numerical processing.</p><p>In a similar vein, a recent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study revealed that glutamate and GABA profiles within the classic frontoparietal network regions, namely, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>) and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), explained current and predicted future mathematical achievement levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>).</p><p>Given the well-established developmental fluctuations in the diffusion parameters over the life span, it has been proposed that developmental shifts in all three diffusion parameters are possible explanations for the corresponding developmental shifts in cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">von Krause et al., 2020</xref>). For example, several studies found that individual differences in intelligence are primarily related to the mean drift rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schmiedek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schubert and Frischkorn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schulz-Zhecheva et al., 2016</xref>). In a recent study on aging (ages 18–62) using 18 different response time tasks, age differences in intelligence were accounted for age differences in non-decision time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">von Krause et al., 2020</xref>). If this latter relationship also extends to earlier developmental windows, this raises the intriguing possibility that the link between the frontoparietal regions and cognition across development is at the visuomotor level (i.e., non-decision time), rather than the more cognitive level (i.e., mean drift rate). To assess these open questions, we utilized an attention network task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref><bold>,</bold> Task 1) because (i) it relies mainly on the frontal and parietal regions, (ii) it is suited for the calculation of the three diffusion parameters, and (iii) its performance is sensitive to developmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petersen and Posner, 2012</xref>). We focused primarily on glutamate and GABA as these neurotransmitters were shown to be involved in attention and attention-related pathologies, including ADHD, in both human and animal work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pehrson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rüsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; for extended text and references, see ‘Materials and methods’ section).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scanning, cognitive session, neurochemical spectra plots, and visuomotor network connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of T1-weighted images collected during the first assessment (A1) and the second assessment (A2, ~ 21 mo later) in each of the five age groups (at A1: 6-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds, and 18+-year-olds).

(ii) Do these associations between frontoparietal neurochemicals and visuomotor processing exist in a task-independent manner? In other words, do the associations between frontoparietal neurochemicals and visuomotor processing replicate across different tasks such as numerical processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Task 2) and mental rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Task 3)? (iii) Do the associations between frontoparietal neurochemicals and visuomotor processing explain individual differences in fluid intelligence?</p><p>An informative way to address these questions is by using MRS. Several advantages of this technology make it suitable for studying these processes in the context of development. MRS has shown great promise in the classification and prediction of certain medical conditions in prior investigations. Therefore, it is possible to utilize and extend this unique predictive ability of MRS to discern which of these key neurobiological processes (cognitive, decision, visuomotor) are associated with highly specialized neurochemical concentrations across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Porges et al., 2021</xref>). As mentioned above, our main aims were to examine whether neurochemical concentration within key frontoparietal regions can explain cognitive (mean drift rate), decision (boundary separation), and visuomotor processing. By testing participants from early childhood to early adulthood, we were able to examine whether these associations are static or dynamic across the life span.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Developmental trajectories of the mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing</title><p>As a first step, we tracked the developmental trajectories of each of the three diffusion parameters (mean drift rate, boundary separation, visuomotor processing) during the first and the second assessment (for scatterplots, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; for statistical values, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

For brevity, we present the neurochemical results that survived FDR correction and were neurochemically, neuroanatomically, and diffusion-parameter specific (i.e., the results from assessing a given diffusion parameter hold even after controlling for the other two diffusion parameters) and replicated during the second assessment (see ‘Materials and methods’ section for a complete description of this selection process).</p><p>There was a significant interaction between age and neurochemical measures in tracking visuomotor processing, which was replicated in the second assessment: IPS glutamate * age (first assessment: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>β</italic> = –0.22, t(252) = –5.38, P<sub>BO</sub>&lt; 0.001, CI = [–0.31, –0.11]; second assessment: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>β</italic> = –0.24, t(174) = –4.47, P<sub>BO</sub> &lt; 0.001, CI = [–0.35, –0.11]) and IPS GABA * age (first assessment: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>β</italic> = 0.23, t(252) = 5.71, P<sub>BO</sub> &lt; 0.001, CI = [0.14, 0.32]; second assessment: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <italic>β</italic> = 0.24, t(175) = 4.41, P<sub>BO</sub> = 0.002, CI = [0.11, 0.41]).

Across three cognitive tasks, we showed that high glutamate predicted shorter visuomotor processing time in mature participants and longer visuomotor processing time in younger participants, while GABA showed the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA and visuomotor processing across development is task-independent.</p><p>Even though not clearly established yet, the age trajectories of GABA and glutamate during childhood and early adulthood have been examined in several studies to date. For example, there is evidence for increasing GABA and macromolecules during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Porges et al., 2021</xref>), but this has been ascribed to macromolecules rather than GABA itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell et al., 2021</xref>). In a separate investigation using this study’s sample, we have found increases in GABA and decreases in glutamate from early childhood to early adulthood (for extensive discussion on the age trajectories of MRS-based metabolites literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021a</xref>). Importantly, previous studies have examined the role of developmentally dependent glutamate levels in cognitive, emotional, and, importantly, motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cobo and Mora, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collingridge and Bliss, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cotman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mora and Cobo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nicolle et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicolle and Baxter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schmidt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Segovia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zahr et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies focused primarily on adulthood and suggested that alterations in the availability of biochemical glutamate might contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive and motor impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zahr et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings that in later developmental stages higher levels of IPS glutamate are associated with better visuomotor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and C, 3A and C, and 4A and C</xref>) are overall in line with the previous studies in older adults and extend them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zahr et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, we obtained a negative relationship in the early developmental stages, where higher levels of IPS glutamate were associated with poorer visuomotor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and C, 3A and C, and 4A and C</xref>). A possible explanation, as we also mention below, is that these glutamate-induced visuomotor transformations within the human IPS from early childhood to early adulthood may specifically occur within the IPS neurons, identified both in the human and in the non-human primate brain, that respond to the visuomotor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grefkes and Fink, 2005</xref>). The accuracy of this working hypothesis can be tested in future animal pharmacological studies capable of reaching the necessary neuronal resolution that was beyond the reach of this study using analogous tasks. Although the measurements from both the MFG and the IPS yielded high spectral quality, due to degraded shimming conditions in MFG, the line width of MFG was slightly higher (MFG = 0.027, IPS = 0.022, p&lt;0.001). Due to the excellent spectral quality, we think that these differences are unlikely to explain the lack of effect of MFG GABA and glutamate, but the reader should be aware of such a possibility. This study was conceptualized and conducted based on the assumptions of a linear relationship between diffusion parameters and age. However, as one of the reviewers has highlighted, more complex nonlinear relationships may exist between diffusion parameters and age. We, therefore, present in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> linear quadratic and cubic fits between between diffusion parameters and age (see also, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>), and future studies can be conceptualized and optimized for assessing nonlinear associations.</p><p>Regarding GABA, the maturation of GABA circuits and in particular the maturation of parvalbumin cells, a positive subtype of GABA neurons, is thought to be one of the molecular signatures triggering the onset of sensitive periods and plasticity, where an experimental increase or reduction of GABA triggers a precocious or delayed onset of sensitive periods/plasticity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Werker and Hensch, 2015</xref>). One possibility, which we had suggested previously in the context of high-level cognition and we extended here to visuomotor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>), is that elevated GABA in early development may indicate greater plasticity, leading both to better visuomotor processing (i.e., shorter non-decision time) and less positive connectivity in the visuomotor network. Regarding the relation between GABA levels and visuomotor processing in mature individuals, our findings indicate the opposite pattern of associations: elevated GABA leads both to poorer visuomotor processing (i.e., longer non-decision time) and more positive connectivity in the visuomotor network. Previous studies on GABA and cognition in adults, using modest sample sizes, yielded some conflicting results in that some studies found reduced GABA levels to be associated with cognitive improvement while others found the opposite pattern. For example, reduced GABA was associated with learning improvement in the motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kolasinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stagg et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Floyer Lea et al., 2006</xref>) and the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lunghi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frangou et al., 2019</xref>), although some types of visual learning, and sensory learning in the tactile system, were associated with increased GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frangou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frangou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>). There are several reasons for these apparent discrepancies. For example, it is important to mention that the target MRS brain regions vary between these studies, and one cortical area may not represent or generalize to other cortical areas in terms of the association of neurotransmitter levels with the process under investigation. Besides these discrepancies, our findings in the mature participants suggest that lower GABA concentration within the IPS is associated with enhanced visuomotor processing, thus extending the involvement of GABA in the acquisition of visuomotor abilities. In addition to our suggestion of the involvement of GABA in visuomotor processing during development, administration of GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen was shown to impair visuomotor processing in healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnstone et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this, we showed here that elevated GABA levels in the IPS are associated with poor visuomotor processing in later developmental stages. Importantly, because we employed a cross-sectional design, we were able to show that the relationship between GABA and visuomotor processing changes between early childhood and early adulthood. Although our sample included healthy individuals with a varied range of abilities, this finding can have implications for methods and applications aimed at detecting developmental atypicalities, and at altering GABA levels in earlier developmental stages in the case of visuomotor disorders.</p><p>The obtained results highlight the involvement of the IPS, but not the MFG, in visuomotor processing. These findings are in line with previous studies that have shown that visuomotor processing in the macaque and human IPS supports goal-directed behavior in a modality-general manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grefkes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Culham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Our findings support and extend this observation by identifying specific neurobiological markers within the IPS (i.e., glutamate and GABA) that are associated with goal-directed behavior from childhood to adulthood across four tasks. Moreover, our findings extend the results of previous studies, which were conducted using several modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stagg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kolasinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stagg et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Floyer Lea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnstone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachtiar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">O’Shea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Petitet et al., 2018</xref>), by showing that the involvement of GABA in visuomotor processing extends beyond the sensorimotor cortex and into the IPS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Visuomotor connectivity mediates the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing</title><p>To delve deeper into the mechanistic network level, we employed resting fMRI and calculated the within-network connectivity of the visuomotor network for each participant. This visuomotor connectivity was associated with visuomotor processing and with IPS neurochemicals, providing a novel mechanistic account by which IPS neurochemicals, visuomotor networks, and development may interact to track the visuomotor functions of the human brain. Our findings support previous accounts suggesting that IPS serves as an interface between the sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grefkes et al., 2004</xref>), thereby revealing a developmentally dynamic and dissociable function of glutamate and GABA in shaping visuomotor processing that is replicable in multiple cognitive tasks.</p><p>The multimodal moderated mediation analyses revealed that IPS GABA and glutamate track visuomotor processing, as reflected by non-decision time scores, via visuomotor connectivity in a developmentally dependent manner that builds on previous studies. In particular, several previous studies reported animal and human evidence on the role of IPS in visuomotor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grefkes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Snyder et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battaglia-Mayer and Caminiti, 2002</xref>). Importantly, the human IPS was shown to subserve visuomotor transformation independently of the modality-specific processing of visual or proprioceptive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grefkes et al., 2004</xref>). Here, we propose a generic, resting-state mechanistic model by which the levels of excitation and inhibition within the left IPS shape task-independent visuomotor functions through the visuomotor resting-state connectivity across development. However, several aspects of this proposed model are still not known. For example, are there specific time windows during visuomotor processing when the levels of IPS excitation and inhibition regulate the activity of visuomotor regions? Do the levels of IPS excitation and inhibition regulate the activity of visuomotor regions by regulating local GABA and glutamate within visuomotor regions? Addressing these questions is beyond the scope of this study but can be examined in an investigation combining functional MRS and task-based fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koolschijn et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Visuomotor processing mediates the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and fluid intelligence depending on the developmental stage</title><p>In a previous study, age differences in intelligence were accounted for by age differences in visuomotor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">von Krause et al., 2020</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that the developmental link we found between the IPS glutamate and GABA and fluid intelligence may be mediated by visuomotor processing. Indeed, we found that individual variation in visuomotor processing mediated the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA levels and fluid intelligence in a developmentally dependent manner. Specifically, visuomotor processing mediated the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA and fluid intelligence only for the older participants. Therefore, our study provides the neurobiological root that may drive this association: IPS glutamate and GABA. It is currently an open question why this relationship was observed only for the older participants. One potential explanation is that visuomotor processing becomes relevant and mediates the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and fluid intelligence only when the individual’s visuomotor processing has matured to the point that it becomes relatively automated and stabilized, which is the case with the older participants in our sample. Regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, visuomotor processing becomes relevant in tracking fluid intelligence only when the visuomotor functions of the IPS have reached relative maturity. Specifically, the GABA- and glutamate-dependent maturity of IPS neurons that respond to the visuomotor domain may determine the onset of the influence of visuomotor processing on fluid intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grefkes and Fink, 2005</xref>). An alternative suggestion is that the strategies used to solve fluid intelligence tasks (such as the one used in the current study) differ as a function of development and are subserved by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Quantitative and qualitative differences in how participants solve fluid intelligence problems</title><p>It is noteworthy that even though the other two diffusion parameters (mean drift rate and boundary separation) are not related to IPS neurochemicals, the relationship between all three diffusion parameters and fluid intelligence was moderated by age(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). In particular, mean drift rate explained fluid intelligence only for the younger and the mean age groups, boundary separation explained fluid intelligence only for the younger age group, and visuomotor processing explained fluid intelligence only for the older age group. Moreover, the IPS is involved in fluid intelligence and visuomotor processing in later developmental stages (i.e., for the older but not the younger participants in our sample). Please note that even though lower signal quality may explain the failure to detect these relationships for certain groups of participants (e.g., younger participants in this instance), as can be seen in ‘Materials and methods,’ this was not the case as the average signal quality was higher in younger participants (where this relationship was not detected) compared to older participants (where this relationship was detected).</p><p>Taken together, our results show that some of the mechanisms in fluid intelligence are based on cognitive (mean drift rate), decision (boundary separation), and visuomotor processing (non-decision time), and the involvement of each of these mechanisms depends on age. These findings suggest qualitative and quantitative differences in the way that participants across development solve fluid intelligence problems of the kind presented in our research.</p><p>A limitation of this study, also common to other MRS studies, relates to the difficulty in distinguishing between intracellular and extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations or even a portion of these based on the MRS signal alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dyke et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, making direct inferences of cortical excitability/inhibition based on the neurotransmitter concentrations alone should be done cautiously. Similar limitations concerning the exact nature of the neural signal are not specific to MRS but exist with other modalities, for example, diffusion and structural MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zatorre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation stems from the fact that using an unedited sequence is not ideal if one aims to merely quantify GABA. We chose an unedited approach since we wanted to acquire metabolite data (not only the GABA) with the shortest possible acquisition duration to minimize possible motion artifacts during acquisition. The unedited method provided high-quality spectra from an 8 mL VOI in a procedure that takes 10–15 min. In addition, the unedited method minimizes the vulnerability of the acquisition method to system imperfections (i.e., magnetic field drift), subject motions, and magnetic field inhomogeneity. Alternatively, one can choose to use an edited method with a larger VOI (27 mL) and a longer acquisition duration. Because our study was focused on quantifying both GABA and glutamate, we utilized a sequence capable of detecting both these neurotransmitters. For example, previous studies have shown the method we employed can detect GABA in a valid and reliable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frangou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ip et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kolasinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barron et al., 2016</xref>), and a study demonstrated that short-TE MRS can be employed for the reproducible detection of GABA at 3T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Near et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, as was discussed in the article, we excluded cases where the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) was poor based on previously established criteria, thus ensuring that our quantification of single metabolites (e.g., GABA) was appropriate.</p><p>Another related issue of low spectral resolution is the challenge of reliably separating certain metabolites which exhibit substantial spectral overlap with each other and with other strong signals as well as the underlying macromolecular background. Of note, the mean cross-correlation between the neurotransmitter pairs glutamate-Gln and glutamate-GABA in both regions of interest (MFG and IPS) was &lt;0.5, suggesting that there was no significant overlap between these neurotransmitters and allows to report these concentrations separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021a</xref>). Furthermore, the cross-correlation between GABA concentration and the concentration of any other metabolite in both regions was not particularly high (i.e., &lt;0.5). Taken this empirical evidence together, our sequence was able to detect and quantify GABA and glutamate appropriately.</p><p>Another limitation of this study regarding the computation of the mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing from the relatively low number of trials (although a larger number of participants) and the high accuracy rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>) of the tasks used, both of which can negatively impact the reliability of parameter estimates. However, it was previously demonstrated that the EZ-diffusion model’s ability to accurately reflect individual differences in model parameters (both in large, 800 trials, and in small, 80 trials, data sets) and its ability to recover the experimental effects on parameter means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van Ravenzwaaij and Oberauer, 2009</xref>) often outperformed that of other diffusion models such as fast-dm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Voss and Voss, 2007</xref>) and DMAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vandekerckhove and Tuerlinckx, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Visuomotor processing, which previously showed limited evidence of psychometric validity as a task-general trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schubert et al., 2016</xref>), is (theoretically) the summation of a wide array of different processes such as perceptual encoding, visual search, and motor responding, and this study does not dissociate between these. Therefore, it is difficult to assert that visuomotor processing assessed by this study alone indexes a unitary mechanistic process. Rather, future work that further dissociates the components of visuomotor processing can shed some light on the underlying visuomotor processes that drive the effects observed here.</p><p>In sum, we have shown that glutamate and GABA within the IPS track visuomotor functions across development. Using additional analyses, we have established that visuomotor resting-state connectivity mediates the relationship between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing, and that visuomotor processing mediates the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA and fluid intelligence. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the involvement of GABA and glutamate in the IPS, and their potential contribution to other cognitive functions, such as mathematical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>), which has been suggested to be subserved partly by visuomotor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Walsh, 2003</xref>). In addition, our study provides support for the view that fluid intelligence is also subserved by visuomotor processes, in this case, in the older participants in our sample, and the involvement of glutamate and GABA. It is known that the brain develops and specializes to support such high-level cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dehaene and Cohen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson, 2001</xref>). An integrative and robust understanding of psychology and biology across the different developmental stages, as we show in this study, would allow the researcher to progress toward personalized learning and precise diagnosis and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dockterman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schork, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 293 participants, and the demographic information for both the first assessment and the second assessment is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Raw neurochemical concentrations (i.e., metabolite-to-water amplitude ratios) were extracted from the spectra using a water signal as an internal concentration reference. We used the LCModel default output with the following parameters: ATTMET = 32, ATTH2O = 1, WCONC = 55555, PPMSHF = 0.0, PPMEND = 0.5, PPMST = 4.2, DKNTMN = 0.25, RFWHM = 2.5, SDDEGP = 5.00, SDDEGZ = 5.00, DOWS = TRUE, DOECC = FALSE, DELTAT = 0.0001666, NUNFIL = 2048, HZPPPM = 123.2571, DEGPPM = 0, DEGZER = 0.

We aimed to follow a relatively unbiased approach, avoid using hard thresholds issues, and adopt the suggested procedure highlighted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kreis, 2016</xref>). In addition, since GABA concentration is relatively low (compared to glutamate), which usually induced high CRLB values, and since this study was mainly focused on GABA and glutamate, a good compromise was to exclude CRLB &gt; 50%. Additionally, we excluded cases with an SNR beyond 3 SDs per region. By performing bivariate correlations, we found that older (vs. younger) participants exhibited lower SNR (p&lt;0.001), higher line width (p&lt;0.001), and higher glutamate CRLB (p&lt;0.001) across both regions, which is expected as we have shown previously that older participants exhibit lower T2 values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zacharopoulos et al., 2021c</xref>). We also excluded cases with a neurochemical, connectivity (see below), or behavioral score beyond 3 SDs (per age group), and cases where the standardized residuals in a given analysis were beyond 3 SDs.</p><p>Raw neurochemical concentrations were then scaled based on the structural properties of the selected regions and based on the predefined values shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1 and 2</xref> (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Provencher, 2001</xref>); these predefined correction values were therefore determined before the data collection.

To quantify the structural properties, we segmented the images into different tissue classes including GM, WM, and CSF using the SPM12 segmentation facility. Next, we calculated the number of GM, WM, and CSF voxels within the two masks of interest separately around the left IPS and MFG in native space. Subsequently, we divided these six numbers (GM, WM, and CSF for IPS and MFG, respectively) by the total number of GM, WM, and CSF voxels to obtain the corresponding GM, WM, and CSF fraction values per participant and region.

These concentration values were scaled based on the T2 of tissue water values as can be seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> below. Fully relaxed unsuppressed water signals were acquired at TEs ranging from 32 to 4040 ms (TR = 15 s) to water T2 values in each region of interest (32 ms, 42 ms, 52 ms, 85 ms, 100 ms, 115 ms, 150 ms, 250 ms, 450 ms, 850 ms, 1650 ms, 3250 ms, 4040 ms). The transverse relaxation times (T2) of tissue water and the percent CSF contribution to the region of interest were obtained by fitting the integrals of the unsuppressed water spectra acquired in each region of interest at different TE values with a biexponential fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piechnik et al., 2009</xref>), with the T2 of CSF fixed at 740 ms and three free parameters: T2 of tissue water, amplitude of tissue water, and amplitude of CSF water.<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The results showed the same general pattern across all quantification methods as can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11 supp12 supp13">Supplementary files 11–13</xref>.

Functional volumes were motion-corrected, slice-time corrected, segmented, normalized to a standardized (MNI) template, spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (8 mm FWHM), and pass filtered (0.01 Hz to Inf). The low-pass portion of the filter (0.01 Hz) was used to reduce the physiological and noise components contributing to the low-frequency segment of the BOLD signal, and the high-pass portion of the filter was set to Inf to additionally allow higher frequencies to be included (above 0.1 Hz) given our fast acquisition. This also increased the degrees of freedom, thereby improving the quality of denoising and connectivity estimation. We also accounted for physiological noise in the time series by regressing out the confounding effects of WM, CSF, realignment, and scrubbing that were automatically calculated in CONN. We calculated the functional connectivity of the visuomotor network (which is featured in CONN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schubert et al., 2016</xref>), which consisted of seven regions, four of which were derived from the visual network (networks.Visual.Medial (2, −79, 12), networks.Visual.Occipital (0, –93, –4), networks.Visual.Lateral [L] (−37, –79, 10), networks.Visual.Lateral [R] (38, −72, 13)), the three of which were derived from the motor network (networks.SensoriMotor.Lateral [L] (−55, –12, 29), networks.SensoriMotor.Lateral [R] (56, −10, 29), networks.SensoriMotor.Superior (0, –31, 67)), yielding a single visuomotor functional connectivity score for each participant, which we refer to as visuomotor connectivity. The motion scrubbing threshold was 2 mm. We excluded cases where more than 5% of the scans were removed, and the number of cases removed for each age group was as follows: early childhood = 29, late childhood = 4, early adolescence = 1, later adolescence = 3, and early adulthood = 0. After selecting the regions making up the visuomotor network, we used the CONN toolbox to calculate the within-network connectivity (averaged across all the ROIs within the visuomotor network) for each participant. The connectivity values presented are Fisher r-to-z-transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Attention network task (Task 1)</title><p>Participants completed the child version of the original attention network task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2002</xref>), and the stimuli were presented using E-Prime on a desktop computer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We included a single block of trials in the analyses (96 trials, 12 conditions) as this was the block that all age groups completed. We excluded trials with (i) a reaction time of &lt;200 ms and/or with (ii) a reaction time that was beyond 3 SDs from the individual mean reaction time across all conditions. We calculated three behavioral measures (three diffusion parameters: mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing). The three diffusion parameters were calculated following the procedure outlined in the original work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wagenmakers et al., 2007</xref>) by averaging the mean reaction time of all correct trials without focusing on predefined conditions (i.e., they were estimated from trial-level data that were collapsed across conditions). For the results of the three attention network tasks separately, see the supplementary experiment below. The motivation of the supplementary experiment was to provide the reader with complementary information of not only how the generic diffusion parameters (i.e., quantified across all trials without taking into account the condition) reported in the main text are related to neurochemicals over development but rather how the condition-based diffusion parameters (e.g., in response to a particular attention network) are related to neurobiology and development.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Digit comparison task (Task 2)</title><p>In the digit comparison task, participants were asked to choose the larger of two single-digit Arabic numbers as quickly and accurately as possible by clicking the mouse button corresponding to the side of the selected number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

There were two practice trials followed by 72 test trials entailing all 36 possible comparisons of numbers between 1 and 9 repeated twice. The larger number appeared on the left side of the screen in half of the trials.

Each trial began with a black fixation cross in the center of the white screen for 1000 ms. Thereafter, the two figures (upright and rotated) appeared on the screen, and participants responded by pressing the left or right mouse button, where the mouse button presses associated with the labels ‘same’ and ‘different’ were counterbalanced. The labels ‘same’ and ‘different’ appeared at the bottom left and bottom right of the screen, respectively, to remind participants which mouse button to press if the figures were the ‘same’ or ‘different.’ Participants were instructed to avoid mistakes and respond as fast as they could. The figures remained on the screen until response and then were followed by a scrambled mask for 150 ms. There were two sets composed of three figures each (animals set: giraffe, zebra, raccoon; letters set: R, F, G). There were 24 trials for each figure, in which the rotated figure changed its pointing direction (left and right), degree of rotation (45, 90, 135), direction of rotation (clockwise and anticlockwise), and the rotated figure was either the same or different (non-mirrored or mirrored) compared to the upright figure. At the beginning of each block, participants completed 10 practice trials, and they were allowed to take a break in the middle of each block. We focused on the ‘animal trials’ as only these trials were present in all age groups. For the results of the distance effect, see the supplementary experiment in ‘Materials and methods’ section.

The subset of matrix reasoning is a 30-item (of increasing difficulty) assessment tool that requires identifying a logical pattern in a sequence of visuospatial stimuli. The subtest is interrupted when the participant provides three consecutive wrong responses. We calculated the number of correct answers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Chronological age, which was treated as a continuous variable in the statistical analyses, spanned from early childhood (6–7 y), late childhood (10–11 y), early adolescence (14–15 y), late adolescence (16–17 y), to early adulthood (18+ y). For additional information on the mean age, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Since chronological age was the main moderator in this study, we termed +1 SD above the mean as ‘older participants,’ –1 SD below the mean as ‘younger participants,’ and the mean as the ‘mean.’ Since our cohort was based on a developmental sample spanning from early childhood to early adulthood, ‘younger participants’ refer predominantly to early and late childhood and ‘older participants’ refer predominantly to late adolescence and early adulthood. The dependent variables were three behavioral measures (i.e., the three diffusion parameters: mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing). For the primary neurochemical analyses, the independent variables of interest were (i) the neurochemical concentration and (ii) the interaction between the neurochemical concentration and age. The former independent variable assesses whether there is an overall effect of neurochemical concentration on each diffusion parameter, while the latter independent variable considers the moderating role of age in shaping the relation between neurotransmitter concentration and that diffusion parameter. In the text we present the standardized coefficients. These were obtained by z-scoring the continuous predictors and continuous dependent variables. Importantly, in every model with a diffusion parameter (e.g., mean drift rate) as the dependent variable, we controlled for the other two diffusion parameters (e.g., boundary separation and visuomotor processing), as can be seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3 equ4 equ5">Equations 3–5</xref>, as this helped to assess whether the results for one diffusion parameter were not confounded by the other two diffusion parameters. To assess these effects during the first assessment (A1), we employed <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> (see below); to assess the same associations during the second assessment (A2), we employed <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>; and to assess the same associations during the prediction/longitudinal analyses, we employed <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>. The prediction/longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess whether neurochemical concentration and its confluence with age during the first assessment can predict three behavioral measures (i.e., mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing) obtained during the second assessment. In the following equations, the ‘behavioral score’ is always one of the three diffusion parameters, and the control behavioral scores 1 and 2 are the other two diffusion parameters.<disp-formula

assessment, we performed FDR correction correcting for 36 comparisons [diffusion parameters (3: drift rate, boundary separation, visuomotor processing) * neurochemical (3: GABA, glutamate, NAA) * region (2: IPS, MFG) * type of effect (2: neurochemical * age interaction, the main effect of neurochemical)]. To correct for multiple comparisons during the prediction/longitudinal analyses, we performed FDR correction correcting for 36 comparisons [diffusion parameters (3: drift rate, boundary separation, visuomotor processing) * neurochemical (3: GABA, glutamate, NAA) * region (2: IPS, MFG) * type of effect (2: neurochemical * age interaction, the main effect of neurochemical)]. From the longitudinal analyses (Task 1), the only association that survived the FDR correction was the IPS GABA statistical model predicting visuomotor processing, but this did not survive neurochemical and neuroanatomical specificity.</p><p>Since we applied a separate FDR multiple comparison correction for the first assessment analyses in Task 1 and for the prediction/longitudinal analyses in Task 1, we did not correct for multiple comparisons for all replication analyses, nor did we assess the (neurochemical, neuroanatomical and diffusion-parameter) specificity in the replication analyses of Task 2 and Task 3 to reduce type 2 errors. Regarding the supplementary experiment (for details, see ‘Materials and methods’ section), we applied a separate FDR multiple correction correcting for 180 comparisons during the first assessment and a further separate FDR multiple correction correcting for 180 comparisons during the longitudinal/prediction analyses [diffusion parameters (3: mean drift rate, boundary separation, visuomotor processing) * neurochemical (3: GABA, glutamate, NAA) * region (2: IPS, MFG) * type of effect (2: neurochemical * age interaction, the main effect of neurochemical) * cognitive function (5: alerting network, orienting network, executive network, distance effect, SNARC effect)].</p><p>Apart from correcting for multiple comparisons, we assessed the neurochemical and neuroanatomical specificity of our findings that survived the aforementioned FDR correction. To this end, we ran multiple regression models with several independent variables, namely the main effect of all six neurotransmitter measures (i.e., IPS glutamate, IPS GABA, IPS NAA, MFG glutamate, MFG GABA, MFG NAA) and their interactions with age, as well as the main effect of age as can be seen in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref>(A1), <xref ref-type="disp-formula"

Namely, the visuomotor processing in Task 1 was computed based on the attention network task (Task 1), the visuomotor processing in Task 2 was computed based on the digit comparison task (Task 2), and the visuomotor processing in Task 3 was computed based on the mental rotation task (Task 3). Since we obtained the same pattern of findings regarding visuomotor processing across Tasks 1–3, which was one of our earlier aims, for the visuomotor connectivity analyses and all moderated mediation analyses, we computed a composite visuomotor processing score that was obtained based on Tasks 1–3. Specifically, we z-scored the visuomotor processing in each of the three tasks separately and calculated the mean of these three scores which represents a generic or task-independent visuomotor processing score for each participant (of note, we ran related and complementary factor analyses reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file

Altered attention processing manifests in severe disorders including, but not limited to, ADHD, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and brain injury (e.g., stroke) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fan and Posner, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Several models have presented attention as a multifaceted construct typically divided into several functional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petersen and Posner, 2012</xref>). In particular, Posner’s model of attention entails three systems: (i) alerting, (ii) orienting, and (iii) executive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2003</xref>). The altering system is divided into two subcomponents: tonic and phasic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rueda et al., 2015</xref>). Tonic alerting corresponds to sustained attention or vigilance, which is needed to respond to low-frequency events rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, phasic alertness corresponds to the advantage in processing stimuli preceded by warning cues compared with those that are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2002</xref>). The orienting system represents individuals’ ability to move attention to a spatial location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rosario Rueda et al., 2015</xref>). The executive system allows allocating attention to objects or events despite conflicting information and allows switching among tasks.</p><p>All three attention systems exist to some degree in infancy and change over life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rueda et al., 2004</xref>). Cross-sectional studies have suggested that the executive system stabilizes around the age of 7, alertness improves even beyond the age of 10, whereas orienting remains stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rueda et al., 2004</xref>). Other studies, examining children from 6 to 12 y, concluded that the alerting system matures early in development and the orienting and executive networks continue developing throughout childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pozuelos et al., 2014</xref>). Later in life, alerting decreased with age, whereas the other two systems remained stable in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jennings et al., 2007</xref>). Recent longitudinal studies revealed that alerting kept developing between the ages of 8 and 10, while orienting stabilized at 6 and executive stabilized at 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). Another longitudinal study in children with and without ADHD, who were assessed four times between the ages of 7 and 11, revealed improvement in all attention systems apart from orienting. Moreover, typically developing children showed superior executive functioning compared to children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Suades-González et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence supports the existence of five brain networks underpinning the three attention systems, one brain network for the alerting system, and two brain networks each for the orienting and the executive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petersen and Posner, 2012</xref>). The locus coeruleus and its projections to the frontal and parietal regions underpin alerting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrison and Foote, 1986</xref>). The ventral attention network and the dorsal network, including the frontal eye fields and the IPS, underpin bottom-up orienting and top-down visuospatial functions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petersen and Posner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corbetta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubbard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lindner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>). The cingulo-opercular network and the frontoparietal network, mainly featuring the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the IPS, underpin the executive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Petersen and Posner, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several pharmacological studies have been conducted to date to examine the three attention systems. Pharmacological manipulation has shown that blocking norepinephrine decreases alerting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marrocco and Davidson, 1998</xref>), whereas acetylcholine, via nicotine administration, reduces orienting performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wignall and de Wit, 2011</xref>). The administration of Adderall and Ritalin, which increase the concentration of dopamine and norepinephrine, improves executive control in individuals with ADHD. Animal work revealed the important role of glutamate and GABA, the brain’s major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pehrson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As discussed in the ‘Introduction,’ MRS has emerged as a valuable tool to investigate the role of neurochemicals across development. MRS studies on attention mainly compared individuals with and without ADHD symptoms. Children (8–12 y) with ADHD exhibit reduced concentration of GABA in the somatosensory/motor cortex compared to typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edden et al., 2012</xref>), possibly suggesting a deficit in short intracortical inhibition in ADHD. Glutamate was also investigated in the context of ADHD, where children with ADHD exhibited higher glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moore et al., 2006</xref>). Other MRS studies focused on N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity and health, yielding conflicting findings. For example, individuals with ADHD compared to controls exhibit below-normal NAA levels in some studies and above-normal levels in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rüsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). A meta-analysis identified a higher concentration of NAA in the prefrontal cortex in children with ADHD, but not in adults with ADHD, showing that the abnormal excess in NAA dropped linearly with increasing age, potentially resolving previous discrepancies between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The assessment of the three attention systems is typically done using the Attention Network Task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which allows comparing reaction times in different conditions (see below) to obtain for each participant the altering, orienting, and executive network indexes. The experimental difference scores in these cognitive tasks, which are based on the cognitive subtraction logic, are in alignment with the guidelines on how to compute these scores and are considered a standard and traditional way of quantifying these metrics. However, we acknowledge that recent psychometric work suggests that experimental difference scores from cognitive tasks can suffer from poor measurement properties, such as low reliability and unaccounted speed–accuracy interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Draheim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, the use of these metrics prevents the researcher from discerning the underlying processes of attention. To put it simply, if 14-year-old children exhibit superior executive systems scores compared to 6-year-old children, the researcher cannot determine whether this difference depends on the cognitive, perceptual, motor, decision processing, or a combination of these from the single reaction time measure alone.</p><p>Apart from regulating the processing of the attention system, the frontoparietal network is also engaged when we compare quantities in the context of nonsocial comparisons (e.g., which of two numbers is larger in magnitude, which of two dogs is taller) as well as in the context of social comparison (e.g., which of two women is more attractive). A classic effect in the literature that applies in the context of the frontoparietal network is the distance effect, which states that the closer two compared magnitudes (e.g. two numbers, physical attractiveness in two faces), the more difficult the comparison, and the greater the activity of this frontoparietal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nieder and Dehaene, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kedia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zacharopoulos et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Aims of the supplementary experiment</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Given the crucial role of the frontoparietal network in regulating attention processing (see above) and for complementing the analyses of Task 1, we conducted a supplementary experiment that aimed to assess whether frontoparietal neurochemical concentration tracks and predicts the three diffusion parameters (i.e., mean drift rate, boundary separation, and visuomotor processing; for details, including multiple comparison corrections, see the ‘Materials and methods’ section) within each of the three attention networks separately.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissecting the chain of information processing and its interplay with neurochemicals and fluid intelligence across development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Georg Oeltzschner (Reviewer #1); Reuben Rideaux (Reviewer #2); Alexander Weigard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers highlight many strengths of the work including the extensive nature of the dataset, they raise some substantial concerns that significantly weaken the interpretability of the results. There are two major areas of concern.</p><p>1) There is a need for more transparency regarding the analytic decisions made in the manuscript and greater justification for those decisions. While there are aspects of compelling robustness (e.g., large sample size, test re-test replication), these are weakened by factors suggesting unreliability (e.g., multiple comparisons, liberal α values, selective reporting). All three reviewers have provided clear and concrete suggestions for improving the reporting of the methods and analyses and the implicit assumptions made in those decisions.</p><p>R1's comment regarding the choice of metabolite quantification methods provides a good example. There are many different methods for MRS processing and quantification, and each decision in the pipeline produces a different set of estimates at the end. While there may be justifiable reasons for using the analysis presented in the manuscript, these decisions are currently opaque, which prevents an assessment of their legitimacy. Reporting the results of using alternative processing/quantification methods (e.g., those previously used by the group on this dataset) would give an indication of the robustness of the findings.</p><p>2) Reviewer 3 highlights a number of concerns about the interpretation and use of the DDM parameters and the associated mediation analyses. In particular, they highlight the weak conceptual link between the t0 parameter and intelligence in prior work and are concerned about the α value of 0.10 that seems to have been chosen post hoc in the mediation analyses. The claims with regard to both of these aspects of the manuscript may need to be weakened.</p><p>In addition, you should include greater consideration of age trajectories of MRS-derived metabolite estimates during childhood and early adulthood.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I have found the MRS methodological section to be largely inadequate at this stage – there is a considerable lack of detail regarding acquisition and data analysis, as well as some unresolved confusion, particularly with respect to the exact corrections being made. In addition, the terminology is a little ambiguous and potentially misleading.</p><p>a. &quot;Absolute neurochemical concentrations were then scaled based on the structural properties of the selected regions and based on the predefined values shown in MRS-eq1 and MRS-eq2 (see below) (84); these predefined scaling values were therefore determined before the data collection.&quot; This sentence is very troubling and unclear, particularly the part &quot;these predefined scaling values were therefore determined before the data collection&quot;. Tissue correction of water-scaled MRS levels is done on a subject-specific basis, i.e. by co-registering the MRS voxel to the structural image, and determining the (subject-specific) fractional tissue volumes for GM/WM/CSF. You describe how you have implemented precisely this routine – and it is, therefore, difficult for me to understand why you state &quot;the scaling values were determined before the data collection&quot;. Does this mean that co-registration has only been done once, and the segmentation is then assumed to be valid (and identical) for all subjects? This would counteract the benefits of individual tissue and relaxation correction. Please clarify, and if necessary, please repeat the analysis with subject-specific tissue and relaxation correction.</p><p>b. Generally, the term &quot;absolute concentrations&quot; is advised against, because absolute quantification relies on a lot of assumptions. As stated in a recent consensus paper on MRS terminology: &quot;The term absolute quantification was originally coined for the conversion to standard concentration units, where the conversion includes all corrections needed based on measurements and calibrations for the currently reported case to contrast with relative quantification. However, this narrow meaning is an idealization that normally cannot be realized in practice, and &quot;absolute quantitation&quot; today is also used for plain conversion to standard units with calibrations from earlier studies or literature values, but this usage is not encouraged&quot; (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nbm.4347).</p><p>c. In this paper, you are using the term &quot;absolute neurochemical concentrations&quot; equivalent to un-corrected metabolite estimates with respect to the internal tissue water, as output by LCModel, starting with the sentence &quot;Absolute neurochemical concentrations were extracted from the spectra using a water signal as an internal concentration reference&quot;. This is unclear at best, and misleading at worst, and should be changed to avoid confusion. You need to explicitly state that you start with the &quot;raw&quot; metabolite-to-water amplitude ratios that LCModel returns, and describe in greater detail how they are produced. By default, LCModel assumes pure white matter as water concentration reference, and already performs an extremely basic relaxation correction using the parameters WCONC, ATTH2O, and ATTMET. Please describe how all of these parameters were set in the control file.</p><p>d. Likewise, the term &quot;scaling&quot; is not often used to describe the procedure of tissue and relaxation corrections. Please use the appropriate term &quot;correction&quot;.</p><p>e. Quality control. You mention that cases with CRLB&gt;50% or SNR or concentration value beyond 3 SD were excluded from further analyses. How many cases were excluded according to each criterion? Is Figure 1 showing the spectra before or after exclusion? If a GABA CRLB was &gt;50%, was the entire spectrum discarded, or did you keep the Glu value (which was likely never &gt;50%)?</p><p>f. There is no mention of the MRI field strength, vendor, or scanner type. The MRS paragraph gives it away with the sentence &quot;Simulations were performed using the same RF pulses and sequence timings as in the 3T system described above&quot;, but the system is not described above (unlike in the other papers published with identical methods sections). Please also provide more information about the MRspa process, specifically about the processing steps that were being taken (coil combination, alignment of individual transients, etc.).</p><p>g. The experimental description is a little misleading. If my calculations are correct, the pure measurement time per voxel should have been roughly 2 minutes, but you state that sequence planning and shimming took 10-15 minutes. This is because you don't mention the acquisition of the water T2 series in every participant, except for the one paragraph during data processing.</p><p>h. Please show a complete LCModel fit, not just a single GABA and Glu model. This should include the spectrum itself (primarily to judge single-spectrum SNR), the fit, the residual, the baseline estimation, and the individual contributions from all basis functions (for example, as a stacked plot).</p><p>i. To illustrate the variability of the GABA and Glu fits, you could consider showing their mean +/- SD as well, not just a single example (or even all of them on top of each other).</p><p>2. Introduction</p><p>a. &quot;In other words, do the associations between frontoparietal neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is replicated across different tasks such as numerical processing (Figure 1, Task 2) and mental rotation (Figure 1, Task 3)?&quot;- This should probably read &quot;replicate across different tasks&quot;.</p><p>b. Reference (34) in &quot;For example, it is known that neurochemical changes may precede anatomic changes (34)&quot; is a study on brain tumors. It is a bit of a stretch to derive from this a &quot;unique predictive ability of MRS&quot; to discern how neurochemicals shape the developmental trajectory of neurobiological processes. I would suggest removing this particular reference – or adding ones that are more relevant to development and metabolite age trajectories (e.g., https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34061022/).</p><p>3. Figures</p><p>a. The caption of Figure 5 includes descriptions of panels A-D, but only shows three panels A-C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 105: &quot;…explained current and predicted future developmental changes in numerical cognition…&quot; – I think it would be more accurate to state that ref 26 found a relationship between GABA/Glu concentration and mathematical achievement.</p><p>Figure 1a: Are these examples of anatomical T1-weighted images? I think more information on what is being shown in this panel would be useful in the figure caption. Also, the contrast seems quite low, these images may be easier to interpret if the luminance is increased.</p><p>Figure 1: The resolution of this figure is very low, which makes it difficult to assess it. For example, the text below the attention network task is barely legible.</p><p>Line 129: &quot;In other words, do the associations between frontoparietal neurochemicals and visuomotor processing is replicated…&quot; – a typo here.</p><p>Line 134: &quot;A more optimal and informative way to address these questions is by using…&quot; This is a strange way to begin a paragraph given that you have not discussed an alternative – less optimal – way of addressing those questions in the previous paragraph. Consider rewriting for clarity.</p><p>Line 139: &quot;Therefore, it is possible to utilize and extend this unique predictive ability of MRS to discern which of these key neurobiological processes (cognitive, decision, visuomotor) are shaped by highly specialized neurochemical concentration across development.&quot; – This language seems to imply that finding a correlation between MRS detected metabolite concentrations and task performance is indicative of a causal relationship. I think it's important to be clear that correlations, even those that are predictive of future states, are not necessarily indicative of causal relationships.</p><p>Supplementary File 2: This file could be made clearer. Including more than two plots on each page, and grouping them according to either task or model parameters would allow for easier comparison. Some of the y-axis labels have typos, e.g., DISTANCEFARMINUSCLOSE, which I think are probably due to the way MATLAB treats underscores in text. Perhaps try using different clearer or correct these issues in a separate figure editing package. I think it would be useful to include an explanation of all the terms (e.g., alerting, orienting, executive, etc.) at the top of the file.</p><p>A large number of correlations were tested in this study. I appreciate that the authors performed an FDR correction and tested the test-retest reliability with a 1.5-year gap. I think that it would also be useful to see the distribution of all the correlation values, i.e., in a histogram, to get an idea of how distinguishable those that were categorized as meaningful are from those that were categorized as not meaningful.</p><p>I understand the choice of colour schemes for the scatterplots in the main text (blue and red for excitation and inhibition, respectively), however, the individual datapoints are difficult to parse between groups because they are all the same colour and semi-transparent. To improve the clarity of the plots, you could use different colours for each group, or something similar. Also, making the dots smaller will reduce the overlap and probably make them easier to distinguish from one another.</p><p>Figures 2-4: Please indicate the units of the x and y labels. Also, please indicate in the figure caption whether higher scores in visuomotor processing are associated with better or worse task performance.</p><p>Figures 2-4: &quot;For visualization purposes, we did not control for boundary separation and mean drift rate when plotting these panels.&quot; – I don't understand how not controlling for the variability helps visualization, could the authors please clarify?</p><p>The authors find a correlation between IPS GABA and Glu and visuomotor processing in three different tasks. It would be interesting to test whether there is independent variability explained by the neurotransmitters in each task or not. For example, how correlated are the visuomotor processing scores between tasks, and if you control for the variability in one/two tasks, is there still a correlation between GABA/Glu and visuomotor processing in the third task?</p><p>Line 367: &quot;These findings suggest that the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA and visuomotor processing across development is task-independent.&quot; – This is related to the previous comment. This may have very little to do with GABA/Glu and more to do with the reliability of measuring the same latent construct with these three tasks. I think that the analysis suggested above could help to test this and to put this assertion into a better context.</p><p>A recent study found evidence for a brain-wide positive relationship between GABA and Glu concentration in adults (Rideaux et al., 2022, NeuroImage). Thus, one might predict that if GABA were positively correlated with task performance, then Glu would also be positively correlated. By contrast, in the current study it appears that for the majority of correlations between GABA and task performance, there appears to be an inverse relationship with Glu. This seems quite interesting, could the authors speak to this? For example, does the relationship between GABA and Glu change with age?</p><p>The authors found relationships between IPS GABA/Glu and task performance, but not MFG GABA/Glu. This could be due to poorer signal-to-noise in the MFG measurements. Can the authors test this possibility by comparing measures of signal quality between the voxel locations, i.e., FWHM, CRLB, SNR, and fitting residuals?</p><p>Line 310: &quot;Since we identified a strong and task-independent developmental effect between IPS neurochemicals and visuomotor processing…&quot; – By what categorization method is this effect strong? Most of the β values seem relatively weak (e.g., between 0.15-0.20). Perhaps the authors mean reliable?</p><p>Line 447: &quot;…through the visuomotor resting-state connectivity depending on the individual's developmental stage.&quot; – This claim relies on both positive results, e.g., evidence of a relationship at some ages, and negative results, e.g., evidence of no relationship at other ages. However, the latter can only be established by directly testing the likelihood of the null hypothesis, e.g., with Bayesian statistics.</p><p>The paragraph starting at line 461: Related to the above point, several explanations are provided for why the relationship was only found for older participants. Another explanation is that the data may have been noisier for younger participants which led to a failure to detect the relationship.</p><p>Please provide a plot showing the positioning of the voxels, ideally with the degree of overlap between participants.</p><p>Please report the following MRS information: spectral width, number of data points acquired, and number of water-unsuppressed averages.</p><p>Please report the phase and frequency alignment method used on subspectra prior to averaging.</p><p>Please report the test-retest reliability of the GABA and Glu concentration estimates and compare them with previously reported test-retest reliability studies, e.g., Saleh et al., 2016, Magn.

Related to this, FDR correct was performed on the attention network task correlations, but not on the subsequent &quot;replication&quot; correlations with the other two tasks (digit comparison and mental rotation).

Your revised article has been evaluated by two of the original reviewers and by Chris Baker as Senior/Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>While the reviewers appreciate the detailed responses to the initial comments, there remain a number of specific issues that you need to address in a revision (see detailed comments from the two reviewers below). In particular, both reviewers think you need to be more open about the limitations of the data and analyses and temper some of the claims. This applies to issues such as correlations between GABA/Glu and task performance (R1), analyses of signal quality (R1), and mediation analyses (R2).</p><p>Additional analyses and careful revisions will be required for a positive decision on the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript is an improvement on the original and the authors have addressed most of my previous reviews. However, there remain a number of outstanding issues, which will need to be addressed.</p><p>There are both red and pink data points in Figures 2-6, yet these don't appear to be labelled or described. Please fix this if it is a visualization error, otherwise please explain the distinction.</p><p>The authors misunderstood my previous request. I wasn't asking whether task performance is correlated. I had asked if there were independent relationships between GABA and task performance and Glu and task performance. For example, if you partial out the variability of GABA from Glu, does the relationship between Glu and task performance disappear? If so, this would make it difficult to infer specific associations between GABA/Glu and these tasks. In particular, Glu and GABA measurements tend to share variance, due to both metabolic (e.g., synthesis cycles) and non-metabolic factors (e.g., signal quality, frequency drift, subject age). If task performance is associated with this shared pool of GABA-Glu variance, then it is difficult to say which neurotransmitter is involved or (worse) if the task isn't simply correlated with the variance associated with non-metabolic factors. I think this is an important point and should be addressed.</p><p>The authors found that the signal quality in MFG was significantly poorer than that in IPS, as indicated by multiple indicators of signal quality. Please report this in the main text of the manuscript and acknowledge that this could explain why a relationship was not detected between MFG GABA/Glu and task performance. I appreciate that the authors feel confident that this is not the explanation; however, I think it's important that readers be made aware of the significantly lower signal quality of the MFG spectra.</p><p>The authors indicate that they are confident that the MRS measurements from all age groups have sufficient signal quality to detect meaningful relationships with their additional measures because they have excluded the datasets with poorest signal quality. This point is also offered in R2.R11. Matching the datasets in terms of their minimum signal quality is not sufficient to show that signal quality differences cannot explain the failure to detect relationships with other measurements. To make this claim, the authors need to demonstrate that the average signal quality is similar between groups. Please compare the average signal quality between groups, as was done between IPS and MFG in R2.R11. and report whether there are significant differences in the main text of the manuscript. If the average signal quality is significantly lower in groups where relationships were not detected, please acknowledge that lower signal quality may explain the failure to detect these relationships.</p><p>Please increase the luminance of the T1-weighted images to make the structure more visible and provide axial, sagittal, and coronal views for each voxel.</p><p>I think that the authors have misinterpreted my request – I agree that LCModel is an established method of metabolite quantification. I requested that the authors show the test-retest reliability of the GABA/Glu measurements for two reasons: (1) this is useful comparative information regarding MRS measurements and will be of interest to a broad range of readers and (2) because it provides the reader with an indication of the dynamic reliability/consistency of these measurements, which is influenced by many factors other than the quantification algorithm applied. Thus, could the authors please provide the test-retest reliability of the measurements (not simply the p-values for the correlation between them)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my view, the authors were moderately responsive to reviewer comments. I appreciate the authors' clarifications of prior work on DDM parameters and intelligence, the motivation for the supplemental experiment, and the resting state fMRI analysis procedures. I also think that the addition of the parameter correlation tables and the supplemental EFA increase confidence that the Ter parameter being measured is a task-general construct. I cannot speak as to whether the additional details about the MRS aspects of the study would impact the other reviewers' concerns, but it does seem like there is now greater transparency about the MRS procedures. I still disagree with the choice to investigate DDM parameters across the three tasks as three manifest variables rather than a single latent variable and the choice to visualize effects by binning ages rather than showing age as a continuous factor, but in both cases, I could see why there are reasonable arguments for the choices the authors made. However, I still have several concerns that I do not think were adequately addressed.</p><p>Simply showing the fits of nonlinear models to age differences in DDM parameter values in supplemental materials does not really address the possibility that non-linear effects of age could impact the main analyses reported in the paper, in which linear age appears to moderate the associations between DDM parameter values and MRS measures. There appears to be clear nonlinearity in relationships between age and Ter, the parameter that received the greatest focus. Unless there is a clear reason why sensitivity analyses that include nonlinear age terms would not be possible, such sensitivity analyses would be very valuable for determining whether the primary findings of the study are robust to these considerations.</p><p>The evidence from the mediation analysis is still concerningly weak. The authors now acknowledge the post hoc nature of the analyses and the liberal, uncorrected α level (although the other reason for concern, the inconsistency of effects across age groups, does not seem to be acknowledged as a limitation of the evidence for these effects). However, the mediation effects are still framed as a central claim of the paper. I think it makes sense to report the mediation results for completeness and to describe them as preliminary findings that could be replicated, but given the weakness of the evidence I don't think it makes sense to describe these results as a central finding. For example, the statement in the abstract that &quot;We showed that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing&quot; seems like much too strong of a claim given the available evidence and the inconsistency in the details of the mediation effects across age groups. The age moderation effects of associations between DDM parameters and MRS measures that are reported seem to be robust and interesting in their own right, which makes me question the need to highlight a mediation analysis that provides evidence that, in my view, can be thought of as preliminary at best.</p><p>I appreciate the authors' addition of key details about how the DDM parameters were estimated. It seems like several of these details would be appropriate to mention as limitations in the discussion, including the relatively low number of trials and the high accuracy rate of the tasks, both of which can negatively impact the reliability of parameter estimates. However, a parameter recovery study would greatly increase confidence in the assumption that these features of the task data did not impede the accurate estimation of DDM parameters.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84086.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Line 367: &quot;These findings suggest that the relationship between IPS glutamate and GABA and visuomotor processing across development is task-independent.&quot; – This is related to the previous comment. This may have very little to do with GABA/Glu and more to do with the reliability of measuring the same latent construct with these three tasks. I think that the analysis suggested above could help to test this and to put this assertion into a better context.A recent study found evidence for a brain-wide positive relationship between GABA and Glu concentration in adults (Rideaux et al., 2022, NeuroImage). Thus, one might predict that if GABA were positively correlated with task performance, then Glu would also be positively correlated. By contrast, in the current study it appears that for the majority of correlations between GABA and task performance, there appears to be an inverse relationship with Glu. This seems quite interesting, could the authors speak to this? For example, does the relationship between GABA and Glu change with age?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in our sample, the GABA and glutamate change with age. We have also reported that in the manuscript:</p><p>“Even though not clearly established yet, the age trajectories of GABA and glutamate during childhood and early adulthood have been examined in several studies to date. For example, there is evidence for increasing GABA and macromolecules during childhood (Porges et al., 2021), but this has been ascribed to macromolecules rather than GABA itself (Bell et al., 2021). In a separate investigation using the same sample we have found increases in GABA and decreases in glutamate from early childhood to early adulthood (for extensive Discussion on the age trajectories of MRS-based metabolites literature see (Zacharopoulos, Emir, et al., 2021)).” (page: 22, paragraph: 3, line: 22)</p><p>We have also checked whether the relationship between glutamate and GABA within the IPS is moderated by age. To do that, we predicted glutamate concentration from three predictors (i) GABA concentration, (ii) age and (iii) the GABA concentration*age interaction. Moreover, we predicted GABA concentration from three predictors (i) glutamate concentration, (ii) age and (iii) the glutamate concentration*age interaction. None of the two metabolite*age interaction terms was significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors found relationships between IPS GABA/Glu and task performance, but not MFG GABA/Glu. This could be due to poorer signal-to-noise in the MFG measurements. Can the authors test this possibility by comparing measures of signal quality between the voxel locations, i.e., FWHM, CRLB, SNR, and fitting residuals?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now run these additional analyses. MFG (vs IPS) exhibited lower SNR (T(272)=-19.4898, P&lt;0.0001, CI=[-10.0704 , -8.2226]), higher line width (T(274)=8.0696, P&lt;0.0001, CI=[0.0044 , 0.0072]), higher GABA CRLB (T(275)=11.2841, P&lt;0.0001, CI=[6.1168 , 8.7021]) and higher glutamate CRLB (T(275)=2.5673, P=0.0108, CI=[0.1310 , 0.9922]), suggesting a poorer signal in the MFG. However, the data from both regions used in this study were scrutinised against a set of well-defined exclusion criteria, and we only used the ones deemed reliable. Therefore we believe that the data from both regions have a good level of signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, in a separate investigation using different measures and a subset of the sample used in the current study, we found robust effects for the neurochemical concentration within the MFG but not IPS (Zacharopoulos, Sella, and Cohen Kadosh, 2021). Taken together, this set of evidence suggests that our neurochemical measures from both regions are overall robust enough to detect the effects of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

However, the latter can only be established by directly testing the likelihood of the null hypothesis, e.g., with Bayesian statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed that claim to accurately reflect the empirical data, and the text now reads, “Here we propose a generic, resting-state mechanistic model by which the levels of excitation and inhibition within the left IPS shape task-independent visuomotor functions through the visuomotor resting-state connectivity across development. However, several aspects of this proposed model are still not known. For example, (i) are there specific time windows during visuomotor processing when the levels of IPS excitation and inhibition regulate the activity of visuomotor regions? Do the levels of IPS excitation and inhibition regulate the activity of visuomotor regions by regulating local GABA and glutamate within visuomotor regions? Addressing these questions is beyond the scope of the present study but can be examined in an investigation combining functional MRS and task-based fMRI (Jia et al., 2022; Koolschijn et al., 2021).” (page: 26, paragraph: 2, line: 14)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

Even though more data from younger participants were excluded (as expected), the data from all participants used in this study were scrutinised against a set of well-defined exclusion criteria, and we only used the ones deemed reliable. Therefore we believe that the data from all age groups exhibit a good level of signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, in a separate investigation using different measures, we found robust effects in the case of early childhood compared to later developmental (Zacharopoulos et al., 2022).

In that study, the authors examined raw (GABA<sub>H2O</sub>) and GABA-to-Creatine ratio (GABA/Cr). The current study assessed test-retest reliability for 3T using the approach described elsewhere (Terpstra et al., 2016). Since we utilised arguably one of the most established methods in the literature since the early 2000s including the LCModel analysis (Tkáč et al., 2001), we believe that our methods represent reliable tools for neurochemical analyses.

For example, if the SNR of a given case (output by the lcmodel) was deemed removable (given our SNR-based exclusion criterion), then this case was excluded before tissue correction because it was problematic from the start. However, other exclusion criteria, for instance, if a case fell beyond 3SD per tissue-corrected metabolite score, then this case would have been excluded AFTER the tissue correction because the standard deviation was based on the tissue-corrected metabolite score (not the raw scores).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19.

The authors misunderstood my previous request. I wasn't asking whether task performance is correlated. I had asked if there were independent relationships between GABA and task performance and Glu and task performance. For example, if you partial out the variability of GABA from Glu, does the relationship between Glu and task performance disappear? If so, this would make it difficult to infer specific associations between GABA/Glu and these tasks. In particular, Glu and GABA measurements tend to share variance, due to both metabolic (e.g., synthesis cycles) and non-metabolic factors (e.g., signal quality, frequency drift, subject age). If task performance is associated with this shared pool of GABA-Glu variance, then it is difficult to say which neurotransmitter is involved or (worse) if the task isn't simply correlated with the variance associated with non-metabolic factors. I think this is an important point and should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion which we have now implemented (which we pasted below). Our analysis indicates that the first option is the correct one, as both predictors were significant when included in the regression model. The text now states: &quot;Additional analyses presented in Supplementary File 15 revealed that there were independent relationships between IPS glutamate*age and IPS GABA*age with task performance, as both predictors (i.e., IPS glutamate*age and IPS GABA*age) explained unique variance in task performance (non-decision time) even when both were added in the same multiple regression model.&quot; (page: 9, paragraph: 2, line: 17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors found that the signal quality in MFG was significantly poorer than that in IPS, as indicated by multiple indicators of signal quality. Please report this in the main text of the manuscript and acknowledge that this could explain why a relationship was not detected between MFG GABA/Glu and task performance. I appreciate that the authors feel confident that this is not the explanation; however, I think it's important that readers be made aware of the significantly lower signal quality of the MFG spectra.</p></disp-quote><p>We now report this in the main manuscript, and the text now reads, &quot;Although the measurements from both the MFG and the IPS yielded excellent spectral quality, due to degraded shimming conditions in MFG, the line width of MFG was slightly higher (MFG=.027, IPS=.022, P&lt;0.001). Due to the excellent spectal quality, we think that these differences are unlikely to explain the lack of effect of MFG GABA and glutamate, but the reader should be aware of such possibility.&quot; (page: 23, paragraph: 1, line: 20)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors indicate that they are confident that the MRS measurements from all age groups have sufficient signal quality to detect meaningful relationships with their additional measures because they have excluded the datasets with poorest signal quality. This point is also offered in R2.R11. Matching the datasets in terms of their minimum signal quality is not sufficient to show that signal quality differences cannot explain the failure to detect relationships with other measurements. To make this claim, the authors need to demonstrate that the average signal quality is similar between groups. Please compare the average signal quality between groups, as was done between IPS and MFG in R2.R11. and report whether there are significant differences in the main text of the manuscript. If the average signal quality is significantly lower in groups where relationships were not detected, please acknowledge that lower signal quality may explain the failure to detect these relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have examined the relationship between average signal quality and age, which we now report in the main text, &quot;By performing bivariate correlations, we found that older (vs younger) participants exhibited lower SNR (P&lt;0.001), higher line width (P&lt;0.001), and higher glutamate CRLB (P&lt;0.001) across both regions, which is expected as we have shown previously that older participants exhibit lower T2 values (Zacharopoulos et al., 2021).&quot; (page: 34, paragraph: 1, line: 6).</p><p>Moreover, the text now states, “Please note that even though lower signal quality may explain the failure to detect these relationships for certain groups of participants (e.g., younger participants in this instance), as can be seen in Materials and methods, this was not the case as the average signal quality was higher in younger participants (where this relationship was not detected) compared to older participants (where this relationship was detected).” (page: 28, paragraph: 1, line: 9).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th><bold>Spearman's Rho</bold></th><th><bold>P</bold></th><th><bold>se</bold></th><th><bold>CI_L</bold></th><th><bold>CI_U</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS_SNR</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.222</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.059</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.334</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.103</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG_SNR</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.329</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.055</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.434</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.215</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS_lw</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.338</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.054</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.227</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.439</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG_lw</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.403</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.05</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.299</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.495</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS_GABA_CRLB</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.12</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.058</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.064</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.244</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.008</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS_Glutamate_CRLB</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.506</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.046</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.413</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.592</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG_GABA_CRLB</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.02</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.757</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.064</td><td align="left" valign="top">-0.144</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.105</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG_Glutamate_CRLB</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.486</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;.001</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.047</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.391</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.575</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In Author response images 2-8, we plotted line graphs with error bars (95% confidence intervals) for each age group (1 = Younger, 5 = Older).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84086-sa2-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

I think that the authors have misinterpreted my request – I agree that LCModel is an established method of metabolite quantification. I requested that the authors show the test-retest reliability of the GABA/Glu measurements for two reasons: (1) this is useful comparative information regarding MRS measurements and will be of interest to a broad range of readers and (2) because it provides the reader with an indication of the dynamic reliability/consistency of these measurements, which is influenced by many factors other than the quantification algorithm applied. Thus, could the authors please provide the test-retest reliability of the measurements (not simply the p-values for the correlation between them)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this clarification. We report the relevant details in the text, stating: &quot;Moreover, as shown previously, our methods produced robust test-retest reliability in a previous study (Terpstra et al., 2016) where glutamate NAA, tCr, tCho, and Ins were quantified with between-session coefficients of variance of ≤5% even at 3T, and GSH mimicking the same GABA condition had a coefficient of variance of ~10%.&quot; (page: 33, paragraph: 2, line: 10)</p><p>Of note, the overall signal of the current study is expected to be higher than the Terpstra et al. study since the age group used in the Terpstra et al. study was older, and as we showed in the current study age is negatively associated with signal quality. Our data examined the effect of GABA and glutamate over an average of approximately 21 months, rather than at a much shorter scale (minutes to days). Therefore the effect of development does not allow us to address test-retest reliability. However, as seen in the table below, we calculated the between-subject coefficients of variation (CoV) for each age group (G1: Youngest, G5: Oldest), each region, and each metabolite. CoV values are lower than previously published between subject CoVs (Wijtenburg and Knight‐Scott, 2011). In our study, the average CoV was comparable or lower to the average CRLB for GABA and glutamate, suggesting that relatively small variations in concentrations may be detectable at different ages (Van de Bank et al., 2015), which is line with our previous test-retest findings (Terpstra et al., 2016). These findings, together with previous findings in the field, increase the confidence in the reliability of our measure.</p><p>This was calculated as follows:</p><p>CoV=(standard deviation of metabolite across participants)/(mean of metabolite across participants)*100</p><table-wrap id="sa2table4" position="float"><label>Author response table 4.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>G1</th><th>G2</th><th>G3</th><th>G4</th><th>G5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS GABA</td><td align="left" valign="top">11.48</td><td align="left" valign="top">14.08</td><td align="left" valign="top">16.25</td><td align="left" valign="top">13.43</td><td align="left" valign="top">16.83</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IPS glutamate</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.74</td><td align="left" valign="top">7.13</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.34</td><td align="left" valign="top">7.54</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG GABA</td><td align="left" valign="top">18.32</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.28</td><td align="left" valign="top">17.05</td><td align="left" valign="top">20.22</td><td align="left" valign="top">18.68</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MFG glutamate</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.46</td><td align="left" valign="top">7.25</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.48</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.00</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.33</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In my view, the authors were moderately responsive to reviewer comments. I appreciate the authors' clarifications of prior work on DDM parameters and intelligence, the motivation for the supplemental experiment, and the resting state fMRI analysis procedures. I also think that the addition of the parameter correlation tables and the supplemental EFA increase confidence that the Ter parameter being measured is a task-general construct. I cannot speak as to whether the additional details about the MRS aspects of the study would impact the other reviewers' concerns, but it does seem like there is now greater transparency about the MRS procedures. I still disagree with the choice to investigate DDM parameters across the three tasks as three manifest variables rather than a single latent variable and the choice to visualize effects by binning ages rather than showing age as a continuous factor, but in both cases, I could see why there are reasonable arguments for the choices the authors made. However, I still have several concerns that I do not think were adequately addressed.</p><p>Simply showing the fits of nonlinear models to age differences in DDM parameter values in supplemental materials does not really address the possibility that non-linear effects of age could impact the main analyses reported in the paper, in which linear age appears to moderate the associations between DDM parameter values and MRS measures. There appears to be clear nonlinearity in relationships between age and Ter, the parameter that received the greatest focus. Unless there is a clear reason why sensitivity analyses that include nonlinear age terms would not be possible, such sensitivity analyses would be very valuable for determining whether the primary findings of the study are robust to these considerations.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this possibility, we added the analysis below to Supplementary File 16. We hope that this analysis addresses the reviewer's feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The evidence from the mediation analysis is still concerningly weak. The authors now acknowledge the post hoc nature of the analyses and the liberal, uncorrected α level (although the other reason for concern, the inconsistency of effects across age groups, does not seem to be acknowledged as a limitation of the evidence for these effects). However, the mediation effects are still framed as a central claim of the paper. I think it makes sense to report the mediation results for completeness and to describe them as preliminary findings that could be replicated, but given the weakness of the evidence I don't think it makes sense to describe these results as a central finding. For example, the statement in the abstract that &quot;We showed that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing&quot; seems like much too strong of a claim given the available evidence and the inconsistency in the details of the mediation effects across age groups. The age moderation effects of associations between DDM parameters and MRS measures that are reported seem to be robust and interesting in their own right, which makes me question the need to highlight a mediation analysis that provides evidence that, in my view, can be thought of as preliminary at best.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer's concern. At the same time, we included the fluid intelligence test as this was one of the main aims of our study. To address the reviewer's concern, we toned down the wording in the abstract, stating, &quot;We present evidence that fluid intelligence performance is explained by IPS GABA and glutamate and is mediated by visuomotor processing. However, this evidence was obtained using an uncorrected α and needs to be replicated in future studies.&quot;. We hope that this provides more balance and will allow to push the field forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate the authors' addition of key details about how the DDM parameters were estimated. It seems like several of these details would be appropriate to mention as limitations in the discussion, including the relatively low number of trials and the high accuracy rate of the tasks, both of which can negatively impact the reliability of parameter estimates. However, a parameter recovery study would greatly increase confidence in the assumption that these features of the task data did not impede the accurate estimation of DDM parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed these issues, and the text reads, &quot;Another limitation of the current study regarding the computation of the mean drift rate, boundary separation and non-decision time stems from the relatively low number of trials (although a larger number of participants) and the high accuracy rate of the tasks used, both of which can negatively impact the reliability of parameter estimates. However, it was previously demonstrated that the EZ ability to accurately reflect individual differences in model parameters (both in large, 800 trials, and in small, 80 trials, data sets) and its ability to recover the experimental effects on parameter means (van Ravenzwaaij and Oberauer, 2009) often outperformed that of other diffusion models such as fast-dm (Voss and Voss, 2007) and DMAT (Vandekerckhove and Tuerlinckx, 2007).&quot; (page: 30, paragraph: 2, line: 4)</p><p>References</p><p>Terpstra, M., Cheong, I., Lyu, T., Deelchand, D.
