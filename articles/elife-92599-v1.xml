A disturbed GABAergic interneuron function is implicated in the progression to DS but the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, in particularly at the chromatin level. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from DS cases and healthy donors were used to model disease-associated epigenetic abnormalities of GABAergic development. Chromatin accessibility was assessed at multiple time points (Day 0, Day 19, Day 35, and Day 65) of GABAergic differentiation. Additionally, the effects of the commonly used anti-seizure drug valproic acid (VPA) on chromatin accessibility were elucidated in GABAergic cells. The distinct dynamics in the chromatin profile of DS iPSC predicted accelerated early GABAergic development, evident at D19, and diverged further from the pattern in control iPSC with continued differentiation, indicating a disrupted GABAergic maturation. Exposure to VPA at D65 reshaped the chromatin landscape at a variable extent in different iPSC-lines and rescued the observed dysfunctional development of some DS iPSC-GABA. The comprehensive investigation on the chromatin landscape of GABAergic differentiation in DS-patient iPSC offers valuable insights into the epigenetic dysregulations associated with interneuronal dysfunction in DS. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the chromatin changes induced by VPA in iPSC-GABA holds the potential to improve the development of personalized and targeted anti-epileptic therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>dravet syndrome iPSC</kwd><kwd>GABAergic neurons</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-00658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xingqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-01947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>Niklas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003792</institution-id><institution>Hjärnfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FO2020-0171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>Niklas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003792</institution-id><institution>Hjärnfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FO2022-0042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>Niklas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212119Pj</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xingqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xingqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023.0046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xingqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses of epigenetic profiles using ATAC-seq provide a comprehensive investigation of the chromatin landscape in hampered GABAergic differentiation in a DS-patient iPSC-derived disease model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DS is an early onset and intractable epilepsy with an unfavorable long-term outcome. The first seizures are usually triggered by fever within the first 12 months of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dravet, 2011</xref>). Characteristic clinical features are age-related progression of seizures, cognitive decline, behavioral problems, and movement disorder. The complex neurological symptoms associated with DS suggest underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that interfere with brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dravet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ragona, 2011</xref>). Approximately 80% of DS cases carry heterozygous variants in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene encoding the α-subunit voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunklaus and Zuberi, 2014</xref>). Prior insights on the neuropathophysiology in DS have come from the <italic>Scn1a</italic> heterozygous mice, indicating a vital role of cortical interneurons in the pathogenesis. Mice with Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency in GABAergic interneurons exhibit spontaneous seizures and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalume et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2012</xref>) that are associated with subnormal sodium currents and impaired excitability of inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tai et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, human iPSC-derived neural cells carrying distinct pathogenic <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants have recapitulated electrophysiological and molecular perturbations in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higurashi et al., 2013</xref>). In combination, these studies have confirmed that <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants cause delayed sodium currents in activated and mainly inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, supporting the notion that seizures in DS are caused by deficient cortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interneuronal progenitors emerge from the embryonic subpallium, mainly the median ganglionic eminence, and migrate tangentially to cortical progenitor zones. The second half of gestation is a period of rapid development of the human cortical GABAergic system that continues after term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arshad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). The extended developmental processes into mature GABAergic interneurons require continuous and complex remodeling of the chromatin structure for transcriptional adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaway et al., 2021</xref>). While it is now clear that the distinct features in DS are associated with a reduced sodium current density in Nav1.1 haploinsufficient interneurons and a disinhibition of the cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>), the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are poorly understood.</p><p>Treatment of DS patients is challenging and seizure control is rarely attainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aras et al., 2015</xref>). The most frequently used first-line drug is valproic acid (VPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>). However, more than 50% of DS patients are drug resistant without any decrease in seizure-frequency upon treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>), indicating endogenous and subject-specific responses to VPA. The mechanisms by which VPA acts are not fully understood, but studies suggest that the drug inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) with an impact on chromatin structure and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghodke-Puranik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ximenes et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a direct interaction of VPA with sodium- or calcium-gated ion channels (e.g. Nav1.1) and enzymes crucial for GABA turnover has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghodke-Puranik et al., 2013</xref>). While these studies have brought important information on the mode of action of VPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balasubramanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang and Li, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian et al., 2015</xref>), the specific effects of VPA on the chromatin architecture of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons have not yet been investigated to the knowledge.</p><p>iPSC lines, carrying distinct disease-causing variants in the <italic>SNC1A</italic> gene and modeled GABAergic interneuron development in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster et al., 2019a</xref>), were recently established. The DS-patient iPSC-derived GABAergic neurons recapitulated electrophysiological abnormalities and gene expression analysis showed enrichment for histone modifications, suggesting epigenetic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>). The dynamics of open chromatin in the DS-model of GABAergic development in DS were investigated by using the assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq). The methodology has previously been used to investigate chromatin accessibility of annotated genes during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trevino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>) and, specifically, in interneuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaway et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inglis et al., 2020</xref>). Herein, ATAC-Seq was employed to investigate the dynamics of chromatin accessibility in iPSC of DS-patients and healthy donors at four different time points (Day 0, Day 19, Day 35, and Day 65) of GABAergic development. Moreover, the effect of VPA on chromatin accessibility in GABAergic neurons was explored.</p><p>Accelerated chromatin changes in DS patient cells during the initial phase of GABAergic development (up to Day 19) were revealed when compared to cells of healthy donors. Further differentiation revealed that DS-patient GABAergic cells acquire a distinct chromatin profile when compared to that of control cells. Notably, VPA treatment of GABAergic neurons leads to unspecific genome-wide changes in chromatin architecture that predict a promoted GABAergic development in some iPSC lines. The comprehensive investigation of the chromatin dynamics of GABAergic development in DS-patient iPSC sheds light on the underlying epigenetic abnormalities. Moreover, the in-depth characterization of chromatin changes in GABAergic neurons induced by VPA may bring important information for the development of individualized anti-seizure therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic chromatin accessibility in an iPSC model of GABAergic development</title><p>A protocol for GABAergic interneuronal differentiation of iPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster et al., 2019a</xref>) was previously established. Analysis of RNAseq data at D19 and D65 of GABAergic differentiation revealed <italic>SCN1A</italic> expression in neuronal cells derived from healthy donors and from patients with Dravet disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

ATAC-Seq was applied to investigate the dynamics of chromatin accessibility in GABAergic development associated with <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants. Firstly, a reference was obtained for chromatin accessibility changes during GABAergic interneuronal differentiation in iPSC from three healthy donors (Ctl) using ATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The differentiating cultures were collected at four distinct time points of differentiation at day 0 (D0; termed iPSC), D19 (neural progenitor cells; NPC), D35 (intermediate neuronal cells; imN), and D65 (GABAergic interneurons; GABA). The cultures displayed expression of marker genes confirming the development into GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>). As previously shown, cultures stained positive for pluripotent stem cell markers such as NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4 at D0. The expression of these markers decreased upon neural induction and disappeared with further differentiation. Markers for neural progenitor cells (FOXG1, PAX6) were expressed at D19 followed by the expression of immature neuronal cell markers (DCX and NKX2.1) at D35 and of markers for GABAergic interneurons (GAD1, TUBB3) at D65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatin accessibility dynamics during GABAeric interneuron differentiation of control induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of GABAergic interneuron differentiation protocol.

Accessible chromatin peaks were captured at each time-point of differentiation: 58,382 peaks at D0 (Ctl-iPSC), 68,002 peaks at D19 (Ctl-NPC), 52,933 peaks at D35 (Ctl-iMN), and 74,561 peaks at D65 (Ctl-GABA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Genomic annotation of the accessible chromatin sites with respect to promoters, introns, and exons revealed a heterogenous distribution in iPSC, NPC, imN, and GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) of chromatin accessibility at the four-time points demonstrated that the three biological replicates separated into four clusters corresponding to each of the four-time points of GABAergic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), albeit with some degree of variability at the intermediate time points (D19 (NPC) and D35 (imN)), possibly reflecting cell line specific and endogenous differences reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strano et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the three Ctl-iPSC lines were treated as biological replicates for downstream analysis. Genome-wide correlation of ATAC-Seq with the previously published RNA-Seq data was also performed at D19 and D65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). The correlation ranged between 0.52 and 0.57, further indicating the good quality of the ATAC-Seq data.</p><p>Next, changes in chromatin accessibility during GABAergic development in Ctl-iPSC were characterized. The ATAC-Seq peaks in iPSC (D0) were used as reference and compared to the accessible peaks in NPC, imN, and GABA. To avoid capturing the dynamic changes of accessible regions caused by variability across individuals, the dynamic changes of chromatin accessibility cell line by cell line across differentiation were initially compared. Subsequently, the common changes were extracted observed and across different cell lines at each time point (Methods). In total, 19,931 significant differential peaks (|log2(fold change (FC))|&gt;1, false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.01) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>, Methods). Next, an unbiased cluster method was employed to investigate the dynamics of these differentially accessible peaks, resulting in the identification of four distinct clusters (Cluster 1–4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Cluster 1 (n=9565) consisted of peaks that were open D0 (cluster Ctl-iPSC) and that gradually closed during differentiation. Cluster 2 (n=3285) contained peaks that were predominantly open at D19 (cluster Ctl-NPC). Cluster 3 (n=3533) exhibited a high chromatin accessibility at both D19 and D35 (cluster Ctl-imN) but more closed at D65. Cluster 4 (n=3545) displayed the highest accessibility specifically at D65 (cluster Ctl-GABA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A genomic annotation of the differential peaks in the four clusters with respect to promoters, exons, introns, and distal regulatory sequences revealed differences mainly in introns and promoter regions. The Ctl-NPC cluster and Ctl-GABA cluster showed the highest proportion of open chromatin in introns (45.6% and 43.4%, respectively) whereas in the Ctl-iPSC and Ctl-imN clusters, most accessible peaks were located in promoter regions (41.9% and 50.8%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, the transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis was performed on the differential peaks specific to each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The Ctl-iPSC cluster showed specific enrichment for motifs of TFs for pluripotency, such as BRN1, and OCT6, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas motifs for the SOX family of TFs were enriched in the Ctl-NPC-cluster. Ctl-NPC-specific transcription factor motifs (e.g. SOX family TFs) were detected in the NPC-specific cluster. Notably, motifs for common TFs (e.g. LHX family TFs, NKX6, RFX) as well as unique TFs (e.g. SOX9, NF1, and DLX3) were enriched in both the Ctl-imN-specific cluster and the Ctl-GABA specific cluster. The SOX family of TFs are important regulators of neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stevanovic et al., 2021</xref>) and DLX factors function in orchestrating transcriptional activity during cortical GABAergic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindtner et al., 2019</xref>). The temporal pattern of accessible and enriched TF motifs in the differentiating Ctl-iPSC cultures is thus consistent with the TFs required for neuronal and cortical GABAergic development in vivo, confirming the model system to be relevant.</p><p>Furthermore, the biological processes associated with each cluster was examined by assigning each differential peak to the nearest gene. The annotated genes were then used for KEGG analysis of each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In the Ctl-iPSC cluster, enrichment of pathways related to pluripotency, such as signaling regulating pluripotency of stem cells was identified, while the Ctl-GABA cluster showed exclusive enrichment for pathways for GABAergic neurons, such as GABAergic synapse and Neurotrophin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Genome traces of annotated genes in each cluster validated the differential accessible chromatin, e.g., for <italic>NANOG</italic> in the Ctl-iPSC cluster, <italic>PAX6,</italic> and <italic>GAD2</italic> in the Ctl-NPC and Ctl-imN clusters, respectively, and <italic>GABRG3</italic> in the Ctl-GABA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Gene expression analysis of RNA-seq data at D19 and D65, as well as with qPCR at D0, D19, D35, and D65, indicated that expression levels of the four genes were consistent with the chromatin accessibility patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

In total, 89,363 peaks in DS-iPSC, 79,270 peaks in DS-NPC, 113,519 peaks in DS-imN, and 41,665 peaks in DS-GABA were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The genomic distribution of these accessible chromatin peaks with respect to promoters, introns, and exons showed deviations when compared to Ctl-iPSC lines, mainly at D35 (DS-imN) and at D65 (DS-GABA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the PCA of chromatin accessibility in DS-iPSC replicates showed that they clustered together at D0, D19, and D35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Notably, the clusters at D19 (iPSC-NPC) and at D35 (iPSC-imN) showed a strong overlap in contrast to the well-distributed clusters at all four time points in Ctl-iPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

The different dynamics of chromatin accessibility of DS-iPSC lines when compared to that of Ctl-iPSC lines thus suggest a disrupted developmental trajectory into DS-GABAergic interneurons consistent with an altered function of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in <italic>Scn1a</italic> heterozygous mice.</p><p>To further characterize chromatin changes in GABAergic differentiation of DS-iPSC lines, the same strategy was used as for Ctl-iPSC lines by using the profile of chromatin accessibility in DS-iPSCs (D0) as a reference. To avoid capturing the dynamic changes of accessible regions caused by variability across individuals, the same strategy was applied as described for the control samples (Methods). In total, 19,896 differential peaks were identified (|log2(FC)|&gt;1, FDR &lt;0.01) (Methods) that were clustered into four groups using an unbiased approach. The four DS-specific clusters showed similar patterns as those of the Ctl group. The number of accessible peaks were 8517 at D0 (DS-iPSC), 4317 at D19 (DS-NPC), 3579 at D35 (DS-imN), and 3483 at D65 (DS-GABA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). The differences in the genomic distribution of the DS-iPSC clusters were identified when compared to that in the Ctl-iPSC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). In the control group, 42.0% of the peaks were located in promoter regions, whereas in the patient group, the proportion was slightly lower at 37.3%. Additionally, a slightly higher proportion of DS-iPSC-specific peaks were found in intron regions (26.5%) compared to Ctl-iPSC (24.6%). The genomic features of the DS-NPC-specific cluster were similar between the Ctl group and the DS group. In the DS-imN-specific cluster, a lower proportion of peaks were located in promoter regions when compared to that of the Ctl group (50.8% vs 23.1%), while a lower proportion of peaks were from intron regions in the Ctl group (27.8%) when compared to the DS group (46.2%). In the DS-GABA and Ctl-GABA specific clusters, 34.7% and 25.9% of the peaks were located in promoter regions, respectively, while 38.7% and 43.4% of the peaks were in intron regions in the Ctl and DS groups, respectively.</p><p>Next, the enrichment of motifs for trans-acting TFs within the differential peaks of each DS-cluster at each time-point was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The DS-iPSC cluster-specific peaks showed enrichment of motifs from pluripotency-related TFs, such as BRN1 and OCT4, whereas TF motifs for the SOX family of TFs were enriched in both the DS-iPSC cluster and DS-NPC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Peaks at TF motifs for LHX3 and NKX, specific for GABAergic neurons were enriched only in the DS-NPC cluster but not in the DS-GABA cluster. However, the DS-GABA-specific peaks were enriched at motifs for the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of TFs, including JUN, FRA, and FOSL. Enriched motifs for the BACH2 TF were observed only in the DS-GABA specific peaks and not in the Ctl-GABA peaks. Together, these data further support that DS-iPSC, although they initially respond to the protocol for GABAergic induction with accessible motifs for the SOX family of TFs, have a disrupted trajectory into GABAergic interneurons as shown by the loss of motifs for DLX and LHX at D65.</p><p>Next, the differential accessible peaks were annotated to nearby genes and performed KEGG pathway analysis for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Similar to Ctl-iPSC, the peaks of the DS-iPSC-specific cluster were enriched for pathways related to pluripotency. However, and in contrast to the control group, pathways related to GABAergic synapse were enriched already in the DS-NPC-specific clusters but not in the later appearing clusters specific for DS-imN and DS-GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, the pathway of long-term potentiation, a hallmark for mature GABAergic cells, was specifically enriched in the DS-imN specific cluster but not in the DS-GABA clusters. Furthermore, representative annotated genes for Ctl-iPSC lines, PAX6 and GAD2 in the Ctl-NPC and Ctl-imN clusters, and GABRG3 in the Ctl-GABA cluster, exhibit a different tendency of chromatin accessibility in DS-iPSC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), also shown by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

However, the genomic distribution of accessible peaks was very similar in the Com-2 and Com-3 clusters.</p><p>Then, KEGG analysis on genes within peaks of the four Com-clusters to understand the common biological features of the Ctl- and DS-iPSC lines was conducted.

Then, a non-hierarchical clustering of TFs enriched in the distinct groups was performed and three clusters were identified (Dis-1, Dis-2, Dis-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Cluster Dis-1 comprised two subclusters of TFs: Subcluster 1 included the OCT family of TFs (OCT2, OCT4, OCT6) and BRN1, with enrichment restricted to D0 (iPSC) in the DS group whereas in the Ctl group, the enrichment was observed at D0, D35, and D65 but not at D19. Subcluster 2 included the GABAergic-specific TFs OLIGO2, ASCL1, NEUROD1, NEUROG2, NKX6.1, LHX2, and others. These TFs were not enriched at any time-point in the DS group but enriched in the control group at D35 and D65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In cluster Dis-2, TFs such as JUNB, AP-1, RUNX2, and others were enriched in the DS group from d0 (iPSC) to D65 (GABA). However, in the Ctl group enrichment for the Dis-2 cluster was observed only at D0 (iPSC). Cluster Dis-3 is enriched in both Ctl- and DS-iPSC for TFs of the TEAD family, AP-2, and NF-kappa beta. In the Ctl group, the TFs enrichment increased significantly in NPC and decreased (disappeared) in imN and GABAergic neurons. Interestingly, the enrichment of these TFs in cluster Dis-1 persisted in the DS group with development from NPC to GABA. The absent enrichment of GABA -specific TF motifs at D65 in the DS group brings further support for a disrupted chromatin remodeling during interneuron development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>VPA induces changes in the chromatin landscape of iPSC derived GABAergic interneurons</title><p>VPA is a broad-spectrum anti-epileptic drug commonly used in the treatment of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>). However, the response to VPA treatment varies considerably among affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunklaus et al., 2020a</xref>). Prior reports suggest that the drug acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and thereby impacts chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghodke-Puranik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ximenes et al., 2012</xref>). Those studies suggested that chromatin changes induced by VPA in GABAergic cells may uncover processes contributing to therapeutic effects of the drug. Hence, Ctl- and DS-iPSC-derived GABAergic interneurons at D65 with and without VPA supplementation at therapeutic concentrations for six days were cultured, and ATAC-Seq was performed on three sample pairs of Ctl-GABA and on two pairs of DS-GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Subsequent PCA analysis of the ATAC-Seq data showed that VPA exposure induced variable changes in accessible chromatin that were seemingly iPSC-line specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Then, the analysis was focused on the sample pairs showing the most extensive VPA-induced changes in chromatin accessibility, including two Ctl-GABA pairs (Ctl1B and Ctl7C) and one DS-GABA pair (DD5A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Genomic annotation revealed that chromatin changes induced by VPA were distributed in promoters, introns, and distal regulatory elements and at a variable extent when comparing individual Ctl and DS pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The regions showing VPA-induced changes in accessible chromatin were distributed in promoters, introns, and distal regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The changes in chromatin accessibility after VPA treatment observed in both the Ctl- and DS-GABA may reflect unspecific effects of the drug. To validate the hypothesis on chromatin-specific effects of VPA, the enrichment analysis of differentially accessible peaks for each iPSC-GABA pair was performed. The enrichment in chromatin-relevant pathways in both Ctl and DS pairs was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The comprehensive analysis of open chromatin in response to VPA in Ctl- and DS-GABA thus suggests drug-induced changes that are unspecific and genome-wide.

The pathways relevant for GABAergic cells became enriched in the chromatin regions that become accessible after VPA treatment in the DS-GABA sample pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A specific analysis of TF motifs becoming accessible in VPA-treated DS-GABA uncovered enriched motifs for TFs relevant for GABAergic development, such as LHX3, SOX, and the RFX families of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Conversely, Ctl-GABA pairs showed an opposite enrichment pattern for these TF motifs upon VPA treatment. Furthermore, both Ctl- and DS-GABA showed a VPA-induced increase in chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions of GABAergic-specific genes, such as GAD1 and GABRG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, the iPSC model suggests that VPA has the potential to dramatically interfere with and change chromatin structure in GABAergic cells. These changes are likely unspecific and may affect genes important for interneuronal development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The majority of cases with DS are pharmaco-resistant and there is an urgent need to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms for the development of targeted anti-seizure treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dravet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunklaus et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunklaus et al., 2020b</xref>). Hence, the iPSC-based model of GABAergic development in DS caused by heterozygous <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants was used. The model system recapitulates hallmarks of the disease and it is, therefore, reasoned that it may improve the knowledge on DS-associated epigenetic changes as well as chromatin modifications induced by the commonly used anti-seizure drug VPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster et al., 2019a</xref>). Specifically, the iPSCs from healthy donors (Ctl) and DS-cases were differentiated towards GABAergic cortical interneurons and characterized the dynamic chromatin conformational changes using ATAC-Seq. The comprehensive analysis reveals chromatin accessibility changes in DS-patient-derived iPSC neurodifferentiation. Both common and distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were identified when comparing iPSC of DS patients and healthy donors at different time points of GABAergic development. As expected, the chromatin profiles of undifferentiated iPSC are similar in the two groups, with accessible peaks for TF genes maintaining a pluripotent state, such as <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>POU5F1</italic>. Differentiation towards a GABAergic fate shows that both Ctl and DS iPSC-lines acquire accessible chromatin peaks associated with genes enriched in pathways relevant for interneuronal development (e.g. signaling pathways, GABAergic synapse and long-term potentiation). However, the comprehensive analysis uncovered increased changes in accessible peaks at the early phase (D19) of GABAergic development in DS-patient cells when compared to the control group. At the same time-point (D19), the expression of SCN1A was also detected, providing a link between altered sodium flux and aberrant chromatin dynamics in DS-iPSC derived neurons. The genes associated with the distinct temporal changes of open chromatin in DS-patient cells are enriched in KEGG terms such as GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, and Long-term potentiation, suggesting a perturbed and seemingly accelerated initial GABAergic induction before D35. The enrichment in these pathways is lost with further differentiation of DS-derived iPSC-lines and they fail to acquire the chromatin profile of Ctl GABAergic cells at D65. The aberrant chromatin profiles in the iPSC model comply with previous studies on iPSC and mice models of DS showing both transcriptional and electrophysiological changes in interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In the prior reports, the transcriptional changes emerged predominantly after D19, the ATAC-Seq analysis shows alterations in chromatin structure already at D19. The observation also confirms that epigenetic changes detected by ATAC-Seq precede the transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the unbiased analysis defines differential accessible chromatin regions and TF motifs associated with heterozygous and pathogenic <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants, bringing further insights into disturbed interneuronal differentiation in DS. In control iPSC lines, the chromatin accessibility of motifs for TFs relevant to drive neurogenesis, such as NEUROG2, OLIG2, BRN1, increase with differentiation whereas the same regions are closing in DS-derived iPSC. On the other hand, motifs of more general TFs, such as TEAD4, FOXM1, AP-2GAMMA, become either accessible or un-accessible with differentiation in control iPSC but remain closed or open in differentiating DS iPSC. The observation is consistent with the previous observations in DS-GABA showing dysregulated expression of <italic>FOXM1</italic> and of genes enriched in pathways for histone modification and cell cycle pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>). Moreover, similar to the <italic>Scn1a</italic>+/- mice model, showing an intact density of cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons despite impaired functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>), the immunostainings revealed a comparable number and morphology of DS-patient and Ctl GABAergic neurons. These observations suggest that the proliferative capacity is relatively preserved during GABAergic interneuron development in DS.</p><p>Currently, VPA is commonly used as one of the first line drugs in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2022</xref>) but the response on seizure frequencies is highly variable among affected cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dressler et al., 2015</xref>). The mode of action of VPA is not fully understood but it is believed to inhibit histone deacetylases, leading to changes in chromatin states and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumann et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the epigenetic effect of VPA administration on iPSC-derived GABAergic neurons derived from DS patients and healthy donors is critically important to understand the effect of VPA treatment. The GABAergic interneurons exposed to therapeutic concentrations of VPA for 6 days showed extensive changes in accessible chromatin peaks in the cultures. Projection of the chromatin changes using KEGG uncovered pathways that reflect the expected mode of action of VPA, such as <italic>histone acetylation</italic> and <italic>deacetylation</italic> and <italic>rRNA acetylation</italic>, of importance for transcriptional activity.</p><p>However, the VPA-induced chromatin modifications in iPSC-GABA varied considerably with biological origin and the accessibility changes linked to GABAergic development were specific or shared for individual iPSC-GABA-lines. For example, the enrichment for LHX1-3 and DLX3 motifs in Ctl-GABA was observed changing from open to closed after VPA exposure. In contrast, DS-GABA show a somewhat opposite enrichment pattern for LHX and DLX binding motifs after VPA exposure that changes from closed to open. In mice, motifs for the LHX and DLX family of TFs are enriched in the late interneuronal development that extends postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaway et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, Ctl-GABA shows a reduction in accessible SOX-binding motifs after VPA treatment whereas DS-GABA shows an opposite response, acquiring a profile more similar to the untreated Ctl-GABA. The SOX-family of TFs has a global impact on both embryonic and adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stevanovic et al., 2021</xref>) and enrichment of SOX binding motifs are enriched in migratory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaway et al., 2021</xref>). These observations may suggest a mechanism by which VPA, at least in some cases, facilitates accessibility for TFs with beneficial effects on postnatal GABAergic function. Moreover, VPA-treated DS-GABA uncovered enriched changes for TF motifs for AP-1 and BRN1 that made the cells acquire a pattern more similar to that in control lines. It may, therefore, be hypothesized that VPA induces unspecific changes in chromatin structure of iPSC-GABA that, at least in some cases, may lead to an increased accessibility for TFs linked to GABAergic development. Such a variability in response to VPA exposure in the iPSC model is consistent with the unpredictable effects of VPA on seizure-frequencies, even in cases with identical <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunklaus et al., 2020a</xref>), mediated by epigenetic factors that are specific to individuals. Finally, the iPSC model of GABAergic development has limitations that should be considered. The model system applies a directed protocol during 65d that may not fully recapitulate the maturation of GABAergic cells in vivo. Functional maturation of GABAergic interneurons occurs postnatally in humans, and models using direct differentiation from iPSC typically do not reach into cellular states comparable to postnatal cell types. More complex neuronal systems, such as 3D organoids from isogenic iPSC lines and in long-term cultures, in combination with single-cell analysis, will be needed to confirm the data. Nevertheless, these findings represent an important step forward to clarify epigenetic changes in inhibitory interneurons that are associated with the progression to DS, adding data to a frame-work of knowledge for the development of targeted and personalized therapies. Further studies are now required to increase the number of independent iPSC lines with pathogenic <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants to validate these findings on epigenetic changes in DS and the effects of anti-seizure drugs such as VPA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, GABAergic differentiation, and sampling</title><p>Dravet syndrome iPSC derived GABAergic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuster et al., 2019a</xref> from three patients (DD1C, DD4A, DD5A) and three controls (Ctl1B, Ctl7C, Ctl8F) are all from the previous publication.

Image processing was carried out using FIJI software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bioinformatic and statistical analyses</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>ATAC-Seq data processing and quality analysis</title><p>After the Adapter sequence trimming, the ATAC-Seq sequencing reads were mapped to genome hg38 using bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). Mapped paired reads were corrected for the Tn5 cleavage position by shifting +4/–5 bp depending on the read strand. All mapped reads were extended to 50 bp centered around the Tn5 offset. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broad Institute, 2014</xref>, MarkDuplicates), and sequencing reads from chromosome M were filtered out. The Peak calling of each ATAC-Seq library was performed with MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with parameters -f BED, -g hs, -q 0.01, <monospace>--nomodel</monospace>,<monospace> --shift 0</monospace>. Peaks were merged into a matrix using bedtools merge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramírez et al., 2014</xref>). Raw reads within peaks were normalized using EdgeR’s cpm function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Log transformation was applied to these normalized peaks to calculate the Pearson correlation among duplicates. Differential ATAC peaks for clusters were selected using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with the following cutoffs: false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05, |log2 fold change|&gt;1, and peak average intensity &gt;16. FDR values are Benjamini-Hochberg procedure corrected per default settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Chromatin accessibility dynamic across differentiation</title><p>To avoid capturing the dynamic changes of accessible regions caused by variability across individuals, the dynamic changes of chromatin accessibility cell line by cell line across differentiation were compared. Subsequently, the common changes observed across different cell lines at each time point were extracted. Cluster analysis was conducted on both control and patient groups of ATAC-Seq data at different time points during differentiation (D0, D19, D35, and D65). The raw data were processed with background correction and normalization using Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM). Clustering analysis was performed separately for the control and patient groups of ATAC-Seq data using the Mfuzz package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Futschik and Carlisle, 2005</xref>), with minimum standard deviation and Z score parameters set at 1 and 0.5, respectively. Clusters were assigned based on the chromatin accessibility patterns of differential chromatin accessible peaks. Subsequently, clusters exhibiting significant changes were selected for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Annotation of unique ATAC peaks to genes and KEGG pathway analysis</title><p>Genomic annotation of each ATAC-Seq peak to its nearest gene for the differential accessible regions was done using ChIPseeker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). A gene promoter region was defined as 3 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the transcription start site. The peaks were annotated to their nearest gene within a 10 kb distance from the transcription start site (TSS). Subsequently, Clusterprofiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) was used to perform the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, and the results were ranked by false discovery rate (FDR). An FDR of less than 0.05 was set as significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>TFs motif enrichment analysis</title><p>TF motif enrichment was performed with HOMER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinz et al., 2010</xref> using the differential accessible regions as input. For TF binding prediction, chromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) was employed. In brief, the Homer vertebrate TF database was used as input for TF motifs in chromVAR, and then TF accessibility deviation values were calculated for each sample across the entire sample set. TF deviations with a threshold greater than 2 were retained, and TF motifs with a positive correlation with one group/cluster were selected to represent that group/cluster. TFs were ranked based on their variability within each group/cluster, and z-scores of deviations from each TF were visualized in a heatmap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Detailed information for statistical tests performed, p-values, sample sizes, and other descriptive statistics is included in the text and/or in the source data.

The revised manuscript adds RNAseq and qPCR measurements of the expression of the gene SCN1A, however these do not appear to agree, perhaps because of the way the qPCR measurements are normalized, and there is no measurement of Nav1.1, the gene product thought to be responsible for the majority of DS cases. Hence the evidence that there is reduced expression of SCN1A or its gene product is not complete and therefore it is difficult to evaluate whether or not the observed epigenetic changes are causal.

The authors detect a potential intriguing development defect in the patient-specific neurons, however the correlation with gene expression or protein abundance is not compelling and the variability of the data is still difficult to determine.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This is a novel and interesting study that aims to investigate the epigenetic changes that occur in a sodium channel model of epilepsy, these are oft ignored, but also an interesting area for future therapeutics.</p><p>(2) The paper is well written with good graphics and flow.</p><p>(3) With caveats noted below, there is an intriguing developmental defect in GABAergic neuron differentiation in this model. It would be interesting to see how this correlated with the expression of SCN1A, and I was surprised this was not addressed in the manuscript via RNA/protein abundance, nor how the absence of a sodium channel can accelerate differentiation when a priori I might expect the opposite (as less 'neuronal' signal)</p><p>(4) There is exploratory analysis that VPA alters chromatin accessibility at an individual-specific level. Though it was not noted if any of the DS patients,</p><p>Weaknesses addressed:</p><p>(1) Representative images for cell-identity markers are now shown for D19 and D65.</p><p>(2) The methods now state that three differentiations were performed.</p><p>(3) The authors address a possible role for cell death in data obtained from their cultures by assessing viability with trypan blue staining.</p><p>(4) Some features of ATAC signal normalization and enrichment analysis have been better documented.</p><p>(5) Some of the variability in key results is better documented.</p><p>Weaknesses poorly or not addressed:</p><p>(1) Although the authors include prior RNAseq data and report on qPCR measurements for SCN1A (Supp Fig 1)these do not on the surface appear to agree, with the RNAseq showing little apparent difference between patients and controls, while the qPCR seems to show a two-fold difference at D65. This is likely a misleading artifact of normalizing PCR expression to that at D0 when the gene is not expressed but has mildly different low levels in patients and controls. No measurement of the protein product or its function is included.

The authors report accelerated GABAergic maturation to a point, followed by further differentiation into a perturbed chromatin profile, in the cells from patients. In a preliminary analysis, valproic acid, an anti-seizure medication commonly used in patients with DS, increased open chromatin in both patient and control iPSCs in a nonspecific manner, and to different degrees in cultures derived from different patients. These findings provide new information about DS-associated changes in chromatin, and provide further evidence for developmental abnormalities in interneurons with DS.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a novel study that aims to investigate the epigenetic changes that occur in a sodium channel model of epilepsy; these changes are often ignored but may be an interesting area for future therapeutics. In general, the flow of the paper is good, and the figures are well-designed. Reply: Thank you for your positive feedback about our work.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The most substantial weakness relates to the observation that DS is often viewed as a monogenic form of epilepsy. It is directly linked to SCN1A gene haploinsufficiency (Yu et al, 2006; Ogiwara et al, 2007). The gene product is Nav1.1, the alpha subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel type I that regulates neuronal excitability. Yet, analysis was conducted at time points of GABAergic interneuron differentiation in which SCN1A is likely not expressed. The paper would be strengthened if SCN1A expression and Nav1.1 protein were examined across the experimental time course. If SCN1A is not yet expressed, this would complicate any explanation of how the observed epigenetic changes might arise. It also seems counterintuitive that the absence of a sodium channel can accelerate differentiation, when, a priori, one might expect the opposite (a 'less neuronal' signal).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this is an important point! In our revised manuscript, we have incorporated data on the expression of <italic>SCN1A</italic> at d19 and d65 of GABAergic development in both the control and patient groups. We first retrieved data from our previous RNA-Seq analysis, showing <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene expression in our cells at both d19 and d65. We have now updated our text on the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene expression in the revised manuscript (Revised Supplementary Figure 1A, revised text Line 108-109). Second, we confirmed the dynamics of <italic>SCN1A</italic> expression by real-time quantitative RT/PCR analysis at four time-pionts of GABAergic development (d0, d19, d35 and d65). Notably, expression of <italic>SCN1A</italic> was detected by qRT-PCR from d19 and the expression increased with differentiation. We have now included this information in the revised manuscript (Revised Supplementary Figure 1B, revised text Line 112).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, another important limitation of the study is that the controls are cells derived from healthy individuals and not from isogenic lines. The usage of isogenic lines is extremely relevant for every study in which iPSC-derived somatic cells are used to model a disease, but specifically in diseases like DS, in which the genetic background has an ascertained impact on disease phenotype (Cetica et al, 2017 and others). This serious limitation should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we fully agree that isogenic and edited patient-derived iPSC would have been the ideal controls. At an early stage we therefore invested considerable time and efforts in order to generate isogenic lines from patientderived iPSC. However, editing of the <italic>SCN1A</italic> variants in patient-derived iPSC turned out unsuccessful after several trials and modifications so we finally turned to iPSC from healthy donors. This is now discussed together with other limitations of our study in the revised manuscript (end of discussion section, lines 499-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should provide data on variability across cell lines and differentiations to help convince the reader that the results can be attributed to genetic defects, rather than variability across individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable point. In the revised manuscript, we have now added plots and IF staining from individual samples to give the readers a complete picture on how they are distributed (Revised Supplementary Figure 1C, Revised Supplementary Figure 2, and Revised Supplementary Figure 4).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we incorporated an explanation on the strategy used to compare the two groups (cases <italic>vs</italic>. controls) in more detail. In our analysis, we first compared the dynamic changes of chromatin accessibility cell line by cell line across differentiation. We then extracted the common changes from different cell lines at each time point (Revised text line 152-155, line 226-228). Using this strategy, we extracted the common changes confined to the control and patient groups, respectively. With this approach we avoid to capture the variability across individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors acknowledge the variability of the differentiations and cell lines, which is commendable, and they attribute this to &quot;possibly reflecting cell line specific and endogenous differences reported previously&quot;, but could also have to do with cell death. This is a large confounding factor for ATAC-seq. Certainly, Sup Fig 1C shows lower FrIP scores, consistent with cell death, and there seems to be a lot of death in the representative images. Moreover, the iGABA neurons are very difficult to keep alive, especially to 65 days, without co-culturing with glia and/or glutamatergic neurons. The authors should comment on how much these factors may have influenced their results.</p></disp-quote><p>With this point in mind, we re-examined QC of our ATAC-Seq across all samples: As shown in revised</p><p>Supplementary Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 4C, our cutoff for FRiP is 15%, and all of samples have an FrIP of more than 15%. At the later time points (d35 or d65), we did not observe a FRiP &lt;15%. We therefore feel confident that the quality of ATAC-Seq is good enough for downstream analysis and data interpretation.</p><p>Regarding the differentiation protocol, we are following a directed protocol of iPSC towards interneurons. The protocol is described in detail by Maroof et al (reference 34) and slightly modified in our lab (described in reference 13). With our modified protocol, GABAergic cells are viable beyond day 65 without the need of co-cultures with astrocyte or microglia. This is also reflected by the electrophysiological activity of interneurons at d65 and at later time points (reference 13). Additionally, our ambition was to obtain a homogeneous cell population for further analysis. Adding other cell types to the cultures would have interfered with downstream processes and a need for cell sorting. Using our protocol, we obtain viable GABA interneurons after up to 100 days in culture. To assess the viability of our cells at the point of sampling (other than by morphological assessment), we used Trypan blue staining and an automated cell counter. Only samples with a viability &gt;90% were processed for ATAC seq. which is a commonly used cut-off for cell viability. We have now modified the method section in the revised version to describe the GABAergic differentiation and sampling (line 519-529).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, changes in gene expression are only inferred, as no RNA levels were measured. If RNA-seq was not possible it would have been good to see at least some of the key genes/findings corroborated with RNA/protein levels vs chromatin accessibility alone, particularly given that these molecular readouts do not always correlate.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we include our recently published RNA-seq performed at d19 and d65. We also correlated the RNAseq and ATACseq data obtained from the same samples. The Pearson correlations between gene expression and chromatin accessibility were within the range 0.49-0.57 (Revised Supplementary Figure 2G, Revised supplementary Figure 4G), which is acceptable according to standard criteria. The results confirmed that the quality of ATAC-Seq is good enough for analysis of expression levels and chromatin openness in key genes. We also added gene expression levels from RNA-seq (d19 and d65) in our revised manuscript (Revised Figure 1G, Revised Figure 2G). Finally, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of key genes in each cluster and the results are now included in the revised version (Revised Supplementary Figure 3E, Revised Supplementary Figure 5E)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Points:</p><p>(1) Representative images for cell-identity markers for only D65 are shown, and not D0, D19, and D35 though it is stated in the text that this was performed. At a minimum, these representative images should be shown for all lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now added images for cell identity markers of all iPSC lines in the revised version (Revised Supplementary Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What QC was performed on iPSC lines, i.e. karyotype/CNV analysis and confirmation of genotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>All iPSC lines used in this study have been fully characterized according to standard and state-of-the art procedures: Expression of pluripotency and stemness genes has been shown by immunostaining, flow cytometry and scorecard analysis; integrity of the genome has been assessed by karyotyping using g-banding; differentiation capacity was characterized using an embryoid body assay in combination with scorecard analysis; and genotypes were verified by Sanger sequencing. Please, see the following publications for full datasets: Schuster et all, Neurobiol Dis 2019, Schuster et al Stem Cell Res 2019, Sobol et al Stem Cells and Development 2015. In our lab, the integrity of iPSC lines are routinely verified using flow cytometry (expression for TRA-1-60 and SSEA4), immunostaining (expression of NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4), Sanger sequencing (targeting variants in SCN1A gene), cell morphology analysis and analysis of mycoplasma by MycoAlert (Lonza).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Were all experiments performed on a single differentiation? Or multiples? Were the differentiations performed with the same type? If not, was batch considered in the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this question. The text Material and Methods has been modified as follows, to better describe the differentiation and sampling procedure:</p><p>“GABAergic interneuron differentiation from iPSCs was performed as previously described (reference 13). The protocol utilizes DUAL SMAD inhibition to induce neurogenesis towards neural stem cells for 10 days, followed by patterning with high levels of sonic hedgehog for nine days towards cortically fated neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) and subsequent maturation for 46 days, i.e. a total of 65 days (Figure 1A). Neuronal cells at day 65 and onwards are healthy and viable as judged by morphological assessment by light microscopy. Differentiation was performed at least 3 times per cell line.</p><p>Cell cultures were sampled at days 0 (D0), D19, D35 and D65, respectively, by harvesting cells with TryplE and centrifugation (300 x g, 3 min). Harvested cells were counted and assessed for viability using trypan blue staining and an automated EVE cell counter (Nano Entek). Samples with a viability of &gt;90% were chosen for ATAC-Seq library preparation (see below).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also assume that technical replicates were merged, and then all three biological replicates were kept for each analysis and outliers were not removed, e.g. Control_D19_8F seems like an example of an outlier.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable point. We agree on that there is variability across three health donors and patients, respevtively, but the quality of ATAC-Seq is good after multiple assessment of QC (Revised Supplementary Figure 2B-D). The color code in Supplementary Figure 1C may be mis-leading as the Pearsson correlation of all samples was displayed. Overall, the correlation from all ATAC-seq among replicates are over 0.8. At the same time, we observed that samples at d0 are clustered together, but not at the later time points. We interpret this as related to the cell-line specific plasticity of chromatin dynamic during differentiation. The observation agrees with our results from PCA (Revised Supplementary Figure 2F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 1C, it is intriguing that the ATACseq signal gets stronger in imN. One might expect it to be strongest in the iPSCs which are undifferentiated and have the highest levels of open chromatin. Is this a function of sequencing depth, or are all the Y-axes normalized across all time points?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another valuable point. Figure 1C present the average chromatin openness for clusters specific regions- not of chromatin openness from the entire genome, which is a reason for why the chromatin openness at</p><p>D35 is higher than at other time-points. The genome-wide chromatin openness is presented in revised</p><p>Supplementary Figure 2D and we have now updated the figure legend to avoid any potential misunderstanding.</p><p>The sequencing depth for each sample is extracted in a similar range. To give the readers a complete picture, we also present the depth of sequencing reads for each sample (Revised Supplementary Figure 2A and Revised Supplementary Figure 4A). The Y-axes of genome browser tracks were normalized, and we added the normalized value in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 1F, are these all enriched terms, or were they prioritized somehow?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the enriched terms are prioritized based on biological meanings, and we have now clarified this in the updated legend of the manuscript. In addition, all enriched terms are now included in revised Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Figure 1G (also the same plots in Fig 2/3), are all these images normalized i.e. there is no scale bar for each track, and do they represent and aggregate BAM/bigwig?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the genome browser tracks were normalized and we have now revised the figures by adding scale bars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be good to show in supplement the variability across cell lines/diffs - particularly given the variability in the heatmap/PCA - and demonstrate the rigor/reproducibility of these results. This comment applies to all these plots across the 3 figures, particularly as in some instances the samples appear to cluster by individual first and then time point (Sup Fig 3B).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have now revised the figure with plots showing individual samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How confident are the authors that these effects are driven by genotype and not a single cell line? In the Fig 3D representation of NANOG, it is very difficult to see any difference between patient and control.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3D, we showed <italic>common</italic> chromatin dynamics in the control and patient groups. To avoid any misunderstanding, we have now updated our legend in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) For the changes in occupancy annotation (UTR/exon/intron etc), are these differences still significant after correcting for variability from cell line to cell line at each time point? I.e. rather than average across all three samples, what is the range? Reply: Revised accordingly.</p><p>(8) The VPA timepoint is not well-justified. Given that VPA would be administered in patients with fully mature inhibitory neurons, it is difficult to determine the biological relevance. I appreciate that this is a limitation of the model, but this should at least be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on that our model system of GABAergic interneuron development has limitations and that cells may not fully recapitulate the development and physiology in vivo. Obvious factors to consider in our system are the directed protocol to enrich for GABAergic interneurons and the differentiation time-line restricted to 65d. This is now discussed (lines 499-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) The term 'mutation' has been replaced with the term ' pathogenic variant' or likely pathogenic variant depending on the context, please see PMID: 25741868</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have replaced all instances of “mutation” with “pathogenic variant” throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear what the nomenclature for sample labelling is in Supplementary Figure 1, e.g. 7C, 8F, 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. There are cell lines names. We labeled all data and images according to cell line name, i.e. control lines: Ctl1B, Ctl7C and Ctl8F; patient lines: DD1C, DD4A, DD5A. To avoid any potential confusion, we have added a note in the revised legend of Supplementary Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Can the authors confirm that the Deseq2 FDR values are Benjamini-Hochberg procedure corrected per default settings? If so, this should ideally be added to methods or legend for clarity</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, default settings were used in Deseq2 FDR values, which is added in the method part of revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While it makes sense that the authors present the data in the order of Figure 1, and Figure 2, this actually makes it quite difficult to compare the two datasets, especially for the functional enrichment in the &quot;F&quot; figures. It may be helpful to consider re-organizing the figure order. For instance, for the long-term potentiation signal in the DS-iPSCs, what does this mean in terms of biological relevance? Or maybe Figure 2 needs to be supplementary given that Figure 3 is a more direct comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We attempted to reorganize during our revision. We still believe it is easier for the audience to grasp the main message if we organize it according to our current workflow—first presenting an individual differential landscape for controls and patients, and then comparing the common and unique aspects among them.</p></body></sub-article></article>
