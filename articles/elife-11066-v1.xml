Here, we patch clamp single motile cilia of mammalian ependymal cells and examine their potential function as a calcium signaling compartment. Resting motile cilia calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ~170 nM) is only slightly elevated over cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~100 nM) at steady state. Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes that arise in the cytoplasm rapidly equilibrate in motile cilia. We measured Ca<sub>V</sub>1 voltage-gated calcium channels in ependymal cells, but these channels are not specifically enriched in motile cilia. Membrane depolarization increases ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but only marginally alters cilia beating and cilia-driven fluid velocity within short (~1 min) time frames. We conclude that beating of ependymal motile cilia is not tightly regulated by voltage-gated calcium channels, unlike that of well-studied motile cilia and flagella in protists, such as <italic>Paramecia</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11066.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11066.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11066.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Certain specialized cells in the brain, airways and Fallopian tubes have large numbers of hair-like structures called motile cilia on their surface. By beating in a synchronized manner, these cilia help to move fluids across the surface of the cells: for example, cilia on lung cells beat to clear mucus away, while those in the brain help the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate.</p><p>Motile cilia in mammals are structurally similar to the flagella that propel sperm cells and certain single-celled organisms around their environments. These flagella have specialized pore-forming proteins called ion channels in their membrane through which calcium ions can move. This flow of calcium ions controls the beating of the flagella. However, it is unclear whether a similar movement of calcium ions across the cilia membrane regulates motile cilia beating in mammals.</p><p>Doerner et al. have now used a method called patch clamping to study the movement of calcium ions across the membrane of the motile cilia found on a particular type of mouse brain cell. This revealed that unlike flagella, these motile cilia have very few voltage-gated calcium channels; instead, the vast majority of these ion channels reside in the main body of the cell. Furthermore, the level of calcium ions in the motile cilia follows changes in calcium ion levels that originate in the cell body.</p><p>Overall, Doerner et al. demonstrate that the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels does not control the beating rhythm of the motile cilia in the mouse brain or how quickly the fluid above the cell surface moves. Future work should investigate whether this is also the case for the cells that line the trachea and Fallopian tubes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11066.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11066.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>motile cilia</kwd><kwd>patch clamp</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clapham</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct patch clamp of ependymal motile cilia reveals that voltage-gated calcium channels in the cell body dominate their electrical and calcium signaling properties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia are ancient microtubule-based cellular appendages found in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satir et al., 2008</xref>). Motile cilia, like flagella, drive fluid flow via dynein-ATPase action on their 9 + 2 microtubular structure, while most primary cilia are solitary, nonmotile, and lack central microtubular pairs (9 + 0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lindemann and Lesich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). In mammals, almost all cells possess a single primary cilium that houses the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drummond, 2012</xref>) and mediates aspects of cell-cell signaling. Other nonmotile cilia are found in specialized sensory cells, such as rods and cones of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). In contrast, multiple copies of motile cilia sprout from ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles, and epithelial cells in the airways and Fallopian tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). A distinct type of motile cilium (9 + 0) additionally protrudes from cells in the embryonic node during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babu and Roy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Motile cilia are much like eukaryotic flagella that drive locomotion in spermatozoa and protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx modulates motility in the flagella of spermatozoa through specialized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective, pH-sensitive CatSper channels to produce hyperactivated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2001</xref>).

Analysis of <italic>Paramecium</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutants and electrophysiological recordings identified voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) in cilia/flagellar membranes as required regulators of ciliary beating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck and Uhl, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunlap, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kung and Naito, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuda et al., 1998</xref>). These observations suggest a conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent mechanism regulating flagellar/ciliary beating. Whether ion channels in motile cilia of mammalian cells changes their beat frequency is not clear, but intraciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent changes in motile cilia beating has been reported by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Benedetto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girard and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lansley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid and Salathe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verdugo, 1980</xref>). The question that we seek to answer in this study is whether Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels are present in motile cilia, and if so, do they change motile cilia behavior.</p><p>Successful whole-cilia patch clamping of fluorescently-labeled immotile primary cilia revealed nonselective cation currents (PKD2-L1 + PKD1-L1 heteromeric complexes) in primary cilia membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we examined ion currents in fluorescently-labeled, voltage-clamped motile cilia of brain ependymal cells and demonstrate that motile cilia are well coupled electrically and by diffusion to the cellular compartment. We show that few Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are present in the cilia membrane, that resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is only slightly elevated in motile cilia, and that motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is driven primarily by changes in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Excitation of the ependymal cell by membrane depolarization increases ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] with only minor changes in motility and fluid movement, suggesting that beating of ependymal motile cilia is not significantly regulated by the activity of ciliary or cytoplasmic Ca<sub>V</sub> channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ependymal motile cilia identification and patch clamp</title><p>We initially examined ependymal cell GFP-labeled motile cilia from immunolabeled brain sections of transgenic <italic>Arl13b-EGFP<sup>tg</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>).

In other words, currents recorded in the whole-motile-cilium configuration can be attributed to channel openings in the cell and/or cilia membrane. Finally, we measured an only slightly depolarized resting membrane potential for motile cilia as compared to the ependymal cell body (-77 ± 3 mV, motile cilia; -88 ± 2 mV, cell body; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>-mediated currents in ependymal cells</title><p>When K<sup>+</sup> currents were blocked in the TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub> bath, we frequently observed relatively small voltage-dependent inward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

However, we were unable to detach and record from isolated motile cilia, as we were able to do in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we recorded from cell and motile cilia membranes in the membrane-attached configuration. Prolonged single channel openings in the presence of BayK8644 averaged 1.4 pA at 0 mV (from the record shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and were frequently observed in cell-attached recordings, but were typically not detected in cilium-attached recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Despite many attempts, brief single channel openings reminiscent of L-type channel openings in the absence of BayK8644 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess et al., 1984</xref>) were recorded from only a single motile cilium patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Full-length ciliary recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kleene and Kleene, 2012</xref>), were also not feasible given the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the cell membrane. Nevertheless, the low percentage of motile cilium patches in which we observed Ca<sub>V</sub> channel openings suggests that Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are not enriched in ependymal motile cilia. If channel densities are identical in cell and cilia membranes, we would only expect ~3 channels in a motile cilium (see Materials and methods). These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels and currents in motile cilia are clearly distinct from the nonselective currents recorded from primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can be modified by cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]</title><p>To further examine the potential functional consequences of Ca<sub>V</sub> channel activity, we evaluated motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] by targeting a genetically encoded ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor to these cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work established Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3) transgene expression in ependymal motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>). We fused GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) with mCherry to the C-terminus of SSTR3 and transduced cultured ependymal cells with a recombinant adenoviral vector (pAd-mSSTR3-mCherry-GCaMP6s), resulting in abundant expression of the sensor in motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Addition of ionomycin evoked a rapid increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence, confirming the ability of the sensor to report changes in ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). We calibrated the ratiometric sensor (see Materials and methods) and determined the average ratio of F_GCaMP6s and F_mCherry in motile cilia under basal conditions (aCSF, 1.4 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). To avoid offsets in the position of beating cilia, we scanned non-sequentially and corrected ratios for bleed-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, and Materials and methods). Consistent with a relatively low number of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (at which Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are inactive), we determined the resting motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as 165 nM (average ratio: 0.2 ± 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>).

Moreover, unlike primary cilia in which specialized ciliary channels (polycystins) predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>), we found that Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the cell body primarily determine changes in motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Although we could not accurately quantify the relative Ca<sub>V</sub> channel densities in motile cilia compared to the cell body or test the possibility of non-uniform channel distribution along the cilium shaft, these channels were not enriched at the ciliary tip. Whether sparsely ciliated cells are less well differentiated or represent a subclass of ciliated ependymal cells is unclear, but the low abundance of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels revealed by patch clamping of these cilia is consistent with a cytoplasmic control of ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in imaging experiments from multiciliated cells. We thus conclude that ependymal cilia have distinct electrical properties as compared to flagella (cilia) that are used for locomotion in mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) and protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck and Uhl, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunlap, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kung and Naito, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuda et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Based on direct measurements of cell body and motile cilia membrane potentials, and voltage-activated Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in both compartments, we hypothesize that the motile cilium compartment is passively coupled and primarily controlled by channel activity and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the cell body, rather than being independently regulated. Thus, a cellular response would promote simultaneous signaling to all cilia, perhaps slowly entraining the cilia and enabling signal propagation to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanderson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid and Salathe, 2011</xref>). Unlike primary cilia, ependymal cilia had only slightly elevated resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], thus enabling smaller changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> to equilibrate within cilia. Indeed, membrane depolarization triggered activation of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, which resulted in a robust change in ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. While we could not differentiate the onset of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the cilium from that in the cell body, the results suggest that ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] follows cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><p>Previous studies suggest that different sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (internal stores, cell membrane flux) can modify the beat frequency of mammalian motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Benedetto et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lansley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salathe and Bookman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid and Salathe, 2011</xref>). ATP-activated P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx made a minor contribution to the ATP-induced increase in beating frequency of ependymal cilia, while activation of the adenosine A2B receptor made a more significant change, perhaps via slower G protein-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Genzen et al., 2009b</xref>). In contrast, we observed that membrane depolarization, or application of ATP, did not significantly alter ependymal motile cilia function. We observed only a slight decrease in bead velocity in the lateral ventricles of acute brain slices that correlated with depolarization and Ca<sub>V</sub> channel activation. Since we did not detect a change in ciliary beating frequency in in vitro cultures of ependymal cells, we suspect that coupling to other cell types or factors mediates the observed reduction. The variability in velocities of individual beads, however, leads us to question the physiological relevance of the observed changes. Finally, although previous studies suggest that ependymal cell differentiation in vitro reflects in vivo conditions (i.e. postnatal maturation into multiciliated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Zein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guirao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spassky et al., 2005</xref>]), we cannot exclude the possibility of altered channel expression. Since we did not observe significant changes in ciliary beating in response to membrane depolarization in either acute brain slices or in vitro cultures, we suspect that control mechanisms are similar.</p><p>As molecular oars, 9 + 2 motile cilia power fluid flow across the surface of epithelia.

This stems naturally from a relative paucity of ion channels in the cilia compared to the nonselective channels in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Second, voltage-dependent calcium channels change [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the cytoplasm that propagates readily into the motile cilia, but only marginally alters beat frequency or fluid flow.

Ependymal cell cultures were derived from a transgenic <italic>Arl13B-EGFP<sup>tg</sup></italic> mouse pup and tissue collected from a 2 week-old heterozygous <italic>Arl13B-EGFP<sup>tg</sup></italic> male. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III (Life Technologies). The reverse transcriptase was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction in controls for cultured ependymal cells. PCR products were amplified with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) using a touchdown PCR protocol with decreasing annealing temperatures (3 cycles at 68, 65, and 62 degrees; and 25 cycles at 58 degrees). The following intron-spanning primers were used:</p><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 (Cacna1s), fw 5’ ATGACAACAACACTCTGAACCTC 3’ and rv 5’ GGAAGCCGTAGGCTATGATCT 3’ (PrimerBank ID 189409135c2); Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (Cacna1c), fw 5’ CCTGCTGGTGGTTAGCGTG 3’ and rv 5’ TCTGCCTCCGTCTGTTTAGAA 3’ (PrimerBank ID 192322a1); Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (Cacna1d), fw 5’ GCTTACGTTAGGAATGGATGGAA 3’ and rv 5’ GAAGTGGTCTTAACACTCGGAAG 3’ (PrimerBank ID 134288874c2); Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 (Cacna1f), fw 5’ TACTAATCCCATTCGTCGGTCC 3’ and rv 5’ CATAGGCTACGATCTTGAGCAC 3’ (PrimerBank ID 115648150c2); GAPDH, fw 5’ TGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTAC 3’ and rv 5’ GAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCA 3’ (PrimerBank ID 126012538c3).</p><p>A 2-Log DNA ladder (NEB) and PCR samples were loaded on 1% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gels (Lonza) and images acquired with the Syngene GBox system and processed using ImageJ.

In contrast to those of whole cell plasma membranes, which have been studied for &gt;70 years, the biophysical properties of organelle membranes are generally very little understood, partially because of the difficulty of applying electrophysiological recording techniques. The authors overcame the difficulty by developing a quite neat set of tools, and painstakingly recorded whole-cilium currents from ependymal cells. Two of the major findings in the paper are quite surprising. First, the biophysical properties of the motile cilia are intriguingly very different from those of primary cilia that the authors characterized before. For example, the motile cilia do not seem to have the PKDL Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels abundantly present in primary cilia. In fact, the motile cilia don't seem to have significant number of channels at all. The apparent lack of major ion channels in the cilia is consistent with the authors' finding of tight electrical and chemical (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-diffusion) coupling between the cilia and cell body. Second, the beating of the cilia do not seem to be affected by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases. This again is quite surprising given that most of us would expect the beating of 9+2 -structured cilia to be like that of e.g. the flagella of sperm cells found in both vertebrates and invertebrates and to be highly influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The experiments and the quantitative analysis in the paper are well done and the conclusions are reasonably convincing. The results are novel and surprising. I do not have any major criticism.</p><p>Minor suggestions:</p><p>1) Because it's not possible to record motile cilia pulled off from cell bodies, like the authors have previous done for sperm flagella and primary cilia, the authors used cilium-attach to record cilium-restricted channels. The recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) used BaCl<sub>2</sub>-containing pipette that is presumably optimized for Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Have the authors tried similar cilium-attach recordings with other pipette solutions more suitable for other channels?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>, it's surprising that the only currents (presumably from whole cell and whole cilium) are the &quot;leak-like&quot; K<sup>+</sup> currents. Did the authors test voltages beyond +60 mV? The outward PKD-like currents reported in the DeCaen 2013 paper appear to be more obvious in voltages of ~ +50 to +100 mV.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the authors might want to indicate E<sub>K</sub> values on the X-axis for each [K<sup>+</sup>] condition.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the PCR reactions for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 &amp; Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 need negative controls if available.</p><p>5) Paragraph four, subheading “Data Analysis”, &quot;where ρ is the resistivity (150<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mtext>Ω</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula>.cm)&quot;. It's not clear to me where the cilium resistivity number is from.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>This important manuscript uses ciliary patch-clamp electrophysiology and optical methods to provide one-of-a-kind insight into the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within the motile mammalian cilia. Because the same laboratory has previously provided similar characterization for flagellum and primary cilium, they are uniquely positioned to provide a comparison between these three ciliary structures. This reviewer thinks that the data and conclusion contained within the manuscript are solid, but would like to obtain answers/comments to the following points:</p><p>1) Subheading “Ependymal motile cilia identification and patch clamp”: It would be appropriate to provide an explanation of why, from the authors' point of view, seals were formed much easier with sparsely ciliated cells.

The recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) used BaCl<sub>2</sub>-containing pipette that is presumably optimized for Ca<sub>v</sub> channels. Have the authors tried similar cilium-attach recordings with other pipette solutions more suitable for other channels?</italic></p><p>We mainly focused on Ca<sub>V</sub> single channel currents using BaCl<sub>2</sub> in the pipette solution and voltage protocols optimized for Ca<sub>V</sub> channel recordings. Many TRP channels, including PKD2-L1 channels conduct Ba<sup>2+</sup> (DeCaen et al., 2013). If PKD2-L1 channels were enriched in motile cilia as they are in primary cilia, we should have observed single channel openings at hyperpolarized potentials (we did not). If the reviewer is referring to the possibility that K<sup>+</sup> channels may be blocked in presence of Ba<sup>2+</sup>, we used K<sup>+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-based pipette solutions in some experiments and occasionally observed single channel openings, indicating the presence of other ion channels in motile cilia. While we have not extensively tested the presence of ligand-gated ion channels such as P2X7 receptors, the small number of patches in which we observed single channel openings (with different pipette solutions) suggests that motile cilia have many fewer ion channels than primary cilia. <italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>, it's surprising that the only currents (presumably from whole cell and whole cilium) are the &quot;leak-like&quot; K<sup>+</sup> currents. Did the authors test voltages beyond +60 mV? The outward PKD-like currents reported in the DeCaen 2013 paper appear to be more obvious in voltages of ~ +50 to +100 mV.</italic> </p><p>We did not extensively test voltages beyond +60 mV. The observed leak-like K<sup>+</sup>-conductance obscures identification of currents. For example, the outwardly rectifying TEA-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> current in ependymal cells became evident only after cell uncoupling by flufenamic acid. While flufenamic acid and other fenamates reversibly block gap junctions (ependymal cells grow in a monolayer), they also modulate (i.e. activate/inhibit) many ion channels (Harks et al., 2001; Guinamard et al., 2013). The electrical coupling between motile cilia and cellular compartments precludes more quantitative comparison. This would have been possible if motile cilia could be detached from the cell without rupture, but this proved impossible despite many attempts. <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the authors might want to indicate E<sub>K</sub> values on the X-axis for each [K<sup>+</sup>] condition.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We now indicate E<sub>K</sub> values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>. <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, the PCR reactions for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 &amp; Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 need negative controls if available.</italic> </p><p>We repeated the PCR reactions to include negative controls for ependymal cell cDNA (synthesis reaction minus reverse transcriptase) and replaced the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. <italic>5) Paragraph four, subheading “Data Analysis”, &quot;where ρ is the resistivity (150 ohm.cm)&quot;. It's not clear to me where the cilium resistivity number is from.</italic></p><p>The intrinsic internal resistivity of cilia is unknown. The value for ρ (150 Ω·cm) is based on the assumption that the internal cilia solution resistivity is similar to cytoplasmic resistivity (basically, physiological saline). We state this in the Methods. Reviewer #2<italic>1) Subheading “Ependymal motile cilia identification and patch clamp”: It would be appropriate to provide an explanation of why, from the authors' point of view, seals were formed much easier with sparsely ciliated cells. Do you think that slower motility of the cilia of sparsely ciliated cells makes them not representative of normal motile cilia? How do beat frequencies of normal and sparsely ciliated cell compare?</italic> </p><p>We now explain why sparsely-ciliated-cell motile cilia were most amenable for patch clamp. The main obstacles for patch clamping motile cilia are visualization, motility and multiciliation. Approaching a heavily ciliated cell with the patch pipette and applying light suction typically attracted more than one cilium to the pipette tip preventing seal formation on a single cilium. While we cannot exclude the possibility that cilia of sparsely ciliated cells present a subclass of cilia, we show that they retain motility and stain positive for a central pair marker, Spag6. We also carried out new experiments in which we compared the beat frequencies of cilia of in vitro cultured sparsely- and multiciliated ependymal cells. The cilia beat frequency of sparsely ciliated cells is ~2-3 fold less than that of multiciliated cells – we now state this in the text. Many groups have shown that extracellular hydrodynamic forces synchronize the movement of individual motile cilia in the group into metachronal waves. Cilia of sparsely ciliated cells experience different fluid dynamics (reduced flow) as compared to multiciliated cells, which likely affects their beat coordination and motility (Guirao &amp; Joanny 2007, Guirao et al., 2010).</p><p><italic>2) Paragraph three, subheading “Ependymal motile cilia identification and patch clamp”: Would not it be better to say &quot;carried by K<sup>+</sup>&quot; rather than &quot;K<sup>+</sup>-dependent&quot; to indicate the fact that the reversal potentials for the current seem to be very close to K<sup>+</sup> Nernst potentials?</italic> </p><p>Certainly correct. We changed the wording accordingly.<italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Why does the capacitance transient recorded through the cilium does not saturate at the zero current level?</italic> </p><p>We assume the reviewer means that the apparent capacitance current does not return to zero. This is because the time-independent current is seal leak in this trace. Despite bath substitution with TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>, the resistance was often &lt; 1GΩ in whole-motile cilium recordings (seal leak after break-in). We now refer to the leak in the figure legend.<italic>4) Why is the calculated ciliary resistance (~350 M</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mtext>Ω</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>, paragraph two, subheading “Electrical coupling of motile cilia with the cellular compartment”) twice as low as measured (~180 M</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mtext>Ω</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>,)? Which one should the reader take as the actual ciliary resistance?</italic> </p><p>Neither represents the actual cilia resistance – they are boundaries and neither is terribly correct. The calculated (theoretical) ciliary resistance is an estimate based on the average dimensions of an ependymal motile cilium and the assumption that the cilium is a perfectly insulated cable with an internal resistivity of 150 Ω·cm. The measured resistance is the series resistance. Series resistance is the sum of the pipette resistance in series with the resistance through the cable-like cilium into the cell (essentially an extension of the pipette). <italic>5) Paragraph two, subheading “Ca<sub>v</sub>-mediated currents in ependymal cells”: Were all the single-channel recordings from cilia made from the very tip (“Typically, we patched the bulging tip of a motile cilium”)? If yes, is there a possibility that Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (or other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) are abundant on the sides of the cilium?</italic> </p><p>We performed all single channel recordings from the tip of the cilium, and were unable to make seals on the sides of cilia due to their small diameter and geometry. We cannot exclude Ca<sub>V</sub> channel expression along the sides or at the base of a motile cilium. We discuss this in the Discussion.Reviewer #3<italic>The studies were necessarily done in cell culture.
