Loss or dysfunction of insulin-producing β-cells in islets results in dysregulation of blood glucose levels and leads to diabetes. β-cells receive and integrate input from multiple extracellular cues throughout life to control insulin secretion. An important goal in diabetes prevention and treatment is a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes governing β-cell development and function.</p><p>β-adrenergic receptors are G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that are widely expressed throughout the body and respond to adrenergic nerve-derived norepinephrine or adrenal gland-derived epinephrine to regulate diverse physiological processes including glucose metabolism. In humans, β-adrenergic agonists augment circulating insulin levels, and stimulate insulin secretion from isolated islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrén and Scherstén, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacey et al., 1993</xref>). Adult mice with global deletion of the β2-adrenergic receptor exhibit impaired glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santulli et al., 2012</xref>). However, the tissue-specific functions of β-adrenergic receptors in glucose metabolism remain undefined.</p><p>Here, we identify a pancreas-specific requirement for the β2-adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) in controlling glucose homeostasis by suppressing VEGF-A production in β-cells and limiting vascular growth in islets during development. Pancreas-specific loss of <italic>Adrb2</italic> results in glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which surprisingly, was observed only in female mice. <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression in islets declines from neonatal to adult stages. Consistently, Adrb2 deletion from neonatal, but not adult, β-cells elicited metabolic defects in mice, supporting a critical role for β-cell Adrb2 during development. We provide evidence that Adrb2 acts in β-cells to suppress VEGF-A expression and thus restrict islet vascular growth, which in turn, influences insulin synthesis and secretion. Remarkably, developmental blockade of VEGF-A signaling corrects islet hyper-vascularization in neonatal mice and rescues glucose intolerance and insulin secretion defects in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> mutant mice. These findings reveal Adrb2 as a negative regulator that controls islet development and glucose metabolism by influencing bi-directional communication between islet β-cells and the vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adrb2 is required in neonatal β-cells for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in female mice</title><p>Global Adrb2 knockout mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santulli et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether Adrb2, acting specifically in the pancreas, impacts β-cell function and glucose homeostasis remains unclear. To address pancreas-specific functions of Adrb2, we crossed mice carrying a floxed <italic>Adrb2</italic> allele (<italic>Adrb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinoi et al., 2008</xref>) with transgenic <italic>Pdx1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hingorani et al., 2003</xref>) to delete <italic>Adrb2</italic> in cells of the pancreatic anlage starting at embryonic stages. <italic>Pdx1-Cre;Adrb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (henceforth referred to as <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice) were born at expected Mendelian frequencies, had normal body weight at birth, no gross morphological abnormalities, and survived to adulthood. Significant <italic>Adrb2</italic> reduction was observed in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO pancreas assessed at postnatal day 6 (P6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that levels of other α- and β-adrenergic receptors were unaltered in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that pancreatic Adrb2 depletion does not elicit compensatory changes in expression of other adrenergic receptor genes. Although in <italic>Pdx1-Cre</italic> transgenic mice, Cre recombinase activity has been reported in the hypothalamic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2010</xref>), there is little <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression in these areas (Allen Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/">http://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). Additionally, the (<italic>Tg(Pdx1-Cre<sup>Tuv</sup></italic>) transgenic mice that we employed have not been reported to carry a human growth hormone mini-gene, commonly found in several Cre lines, that elicits metabolic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brouwers et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of pancreatic Adrb2 in glucose homeostasis, we evaluated metabolic parameters at the whole animal level in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice and control littermates at 2 months of age. In performing these analyses, we noted that some <italic>Adrb2</italic> mutant mice exhibited a glucose intolerance phenotype, while in other mutants, glucose tolerance was indistinguishable from control animals. In order to understand the basis for the conflicting results from mutant animals, we assessed glucose tolerance separately in males and females. Surprisingly, we found that only female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice were glucose intolerant, while male <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice exhibited normal glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice also showed reduced insulin secretion during the first phase of the glucose challenge (measured 5 min after the glucose challenge), as well as dampened insulin levels in the sustained second phase (30 min after the glucose challenge) compared to same-sex control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, glucose-induced insulin secretion was unaffected in male <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with previous studies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lavine et al., 1971</xref>), control males showed lower glucose tolerance relative to control females (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> <italic>versus</italic> 1C,D), and also lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Using qPCR analyses, we found similar depletion (~90% decrease) of <italic>Adrb2</italic> mRNA from male and female mutant islets relative to same-sex controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that absence of metabolic phenotypes in male mutant mice is not due to inefficient Adrb2 deletion. Both male and female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice showed normal insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that the glucose intolerance in female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice does not stem from defects in insulin responsiveness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39689.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Adrb2 in neonatal β-cells results in glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in female mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adult (2-month-old) female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice have elevated fasting blood glucose and are glucose intolerant.

The reasons why male <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice are protected from deficits in glucose homeostasis remain unclear. However, we note that even in control animals, there are sex-specific differences in islet Adrb2 expression, with the levels in male islets being significantly lower relative to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>We next asked if the altered insulin secretion in female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice was an islet-intrinsic defect. Thus, we measured basal insulin secretion (in response to 2.8 mM glucose), and insulin release induced by high glucose (16.7 mM) in isolated islets from control and <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice. Both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were significantly blunted in adult female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these results reveal a pancreas-specific requirement for Adrb2 in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion specifically in female animals.</p><p>To address if glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in female <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice stemmed from defective islet formation and/or maintenance, we performed immunostaining for the islet hormone markers, insulin and glucagon, in adult animals at 2 months of age. These analyses revealed the stereotypical arrangement of insulin-producing β-cells at the core surrounded by glucagon-producing α-cells at the periphery or mantle in both control and <italic>Adrb2</italic> mutant islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that islet shape and cyto-architecture were unaffected by pancreatic <italic>Adrb2</italic> loss. Intriguingly, we observed an increase in insulin immunoreactivity in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Enhanced insulin expression in mutant islets was confirmed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results indicate that islet insulin content is increased with pancreatic Adrb2 deletion, despite a profound reduction in insulin secretion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Morphometric analyses revealed normal endocrine cell numbers in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> mutant islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), although the mutants had a greater distribution of smaller islets relative to control <italic>Adrb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Despite smaller islets, there were no significant differences in the number of EdU/insulin double-positive cells between <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO and control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). The percentage of replicating β-cells in both <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO and control adult islets was low (&lt;1%), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Puri et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the metabolic phenotypes with pancreatic Adrb2 deletion do not arise from alterations in islet architecture, β-cell mass, or diminished insulin production.</p><p>In <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice, Adrb2 would be deleted in all cells of the pancreas anlage. We next asked if Adrb2 is specifically required in β-cells to regulate insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Previously, Adrb2 has been reported to be enriched in β-cells at embryonic and neonatal stages, and its expression declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2015</xref>). We analyzed <italic>Adrb2</italic> transcript levels in neonatal islets (postnatal days 2 and 6) and in adult islets (postnatal day 60) using qPCR analyses. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression was significantly depleted in adult islets compared to neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The postnatal decline in <italic>Adrb2</italic> mRNA was observed in both female and male islets.

We also observed down-regulated gene expression for components of the exocytosis apparatus in β-cells, <italic>Snap-25</italic>, <italic>Rph3al</italic> (Noc2), and <italic>Pclo</italic> (Piccolo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Noc2, an effector of the Rab3 and Rab27 GTPases, is an essential component of insulin granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsumoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsunaga et al., 2017</xref>). Piccolo is a scaffold protein that functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor and links K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, L-type calcium channels and insulin granules into exocytosis-competent complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shibasaki et al., 2004</xref>), whereas Snap-25 is a t-SNARE protein that is critical for insulin granule fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wheeler et al., 1996</xref>). Since in β-cells, <italic>Noc2, Pclo</italic> and <italic>Snap-25</italic> are known to be regulated by the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Neurod1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), we also assessed <italic>Neurod1</italic> levels in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets and observed a significant decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The decreased <italic>Neurod1</italic> expression in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets suggests that β-cell maturation may be affected by Adrb2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). To address if Adrb2 loss affects β-cell maturation, we analyzed mRNAs for additional genes associated with β-cell functional maturity including <italic>Nkx6.1</italic>, <italic>Npy</italic>, <italic>Pdx1</italic>, <italic>Ucn3</italic>, and <italic>Slc2a2</italic>. Of these genes, we found that <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA was significantly elevated in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets while <italic>Slc2a2</italic> was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). <italic>Npy</italic> encodes for Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a hormone that is normally downregulated in islets during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Myrsén-Axcrona et al., 1997</xref>), while its persistent expression in adult islets is associated with decreased β-cell responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodnoi et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Slc2a2</italic> encodes for the β-cell-specific glucose transporter, Glut2, which is essential for GSIS in mature β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thorens, 2003</xref>). Immunostaining also revealed a marked upregulation of NPY, and diminished Glut2 expression, in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in genes involved in glycolysis (<italic>Aldob, Pfkl, Ldha, Tpi,</italic> or <italic>Pklr</italic>) or encoding for potassium channel subunits found in β-cells (<italic>Kcnj11</italic> or <italic>Abcc8</italic>) between <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO and control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that impaired insulin secretion in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets arise, in part, from decreased expression of key components of the calcium regulation and exocytotic machinery in β-cells, as well as aberrant expression of specific genes associated with β-cell maturity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Developmental VEGF blockade rescues defects in islet morphology, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice</title><p>Given that islet vasculature has been postulated to impact adult islet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2012</xref>), we next asked if early developmental phenotypes in VEGF-A expression and islet hyper-vascularization in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice are causal for the later glucose intolerance and insulin secretion defects. If so, then remedying the neonatal hyper-vascularization should rescue the metabolic phenotypes in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO mice. To test this prediction, we sought to attenuate VEGF-A signaling during development by injecting a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against VEGFR-2 (KDR or Flk-1), the primary VEGF-A receptor expressed in intra-islet endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).

These early effects of Adrb2 on islet vasculature are essential for insulin secretion in adult islets and for glucose homeostasis, in part via transcriptional regulation of key components of calcium signaling, exocytotic machinery, and functional maturation in β-cells.

An intimate relationship between β-cells and intra-islet microvasculature is critical for multiple aspects of islet biology including β-cell mass, islet innervation, insulin secretion, and regenerative capacity of islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eberhard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogan and Hull, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinert et al., 2014</xref>). This cross-talk between islet endothelial and β-cells is under precise regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2012</xref>), and a set-point of endothelial to β-cell ratios is critical for mature islet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogan and Hull, 2017</xref>). In mice, hypo- or hyper-vascularization of newly formed islets by β-cell-specific deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>) or over-expression of VEGF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2012</xref>), respectively, both elicit detrimental effects on β-cell mass, insulin secretion, and glucose tolerance, suggesting that VEGF-A levels in β-cells must be maintained within a narrow range. Surprisingly, inactivation of VEGF-A and subsequent islet hypo-vascularization in adult islets did not perturb islet mass and insulin secretion, and elicited only modest elevations in blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Hoker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reinert et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these studies imply that the influence of the intra-islet vasculature and VEGF-A levels on islet morphology and function is predominantly exerted during development. However, the factors modulating the precise control of β-cell VEGF-A expression, and the link between early islet vascular patterning and later metabolic functions, have remained poorly defined. Here, we reveal that Adrb2 activity in β-cells constitutes an endogenous brake to suppress VEGF-A production and curtail excessive endothelial cell expansion during the first week of birth in mice, a period that is characterized by pronounced growth of intra-islet capillary network and endothelial cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johansson et al., 2006a</xref>).</p><p>The precise molecular mechanisms by which Adrb2 regulates VEGF-A production in β-cells remain to be determined. Adrb2 is activated both by circulating epinephrine, derived from adrenal glands, and norepinephrine, secreted locally by sympathetic nerves, although Adrb2 has 100-fold higher affinity for epinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Molinoff, 1984</xref>). Our findings that epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, suppressed VEGF-A expression in MIN6 cells, together with observations of differences in phenotypes between <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO and sympathectomized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borden et al., 2013</xref>), suggest that epinephrine is the likely ligand responsible for Adrb2-mediated effects on VEGF-A levels and islet vasculature. Adrb2 is a prototypical GPCR that is classically thought to couple with Gα<sub>s</sub> proteins and activate transcriptional events via a cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, which stimulates VEGF-A expression in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claffey et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). However, association of GPCRs with specific Gα proteins is dependent upon the cellular context. Our findings suggest that in pancreatic β-cells, Adrb2 might act via Gα<sub>i</sub> to negatively regulate cAMP-mediated transcriptional signaling. In support of this idea, loss of Adrb2 enhanced CREB phosphorylation in bone osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kajimura et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Both neonatal and adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets showed an up-regulation of insulin content, despite a profound impairment in insulin secretion. It is reasonable to assume that impaired insulin secretion in mutant β-cells leads to an accumulation of insulin granules. However, insulin transcript levels were also elevated in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets, suggesting that enhanced synthesis could also be an important factor contributing to elevated insulin content. Vascular endothelial cells instruct β-cell gene expression and maturation by supplying extracellular matrix molecules and soluble factors including hepatocyte growth factor and thrombospondin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eberhard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hogan and Hull, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johansson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansson et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olerud et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, intra-islet endothelial cells regulate insulin gene transcription by producing vascular basement membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaido et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nikolova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nikolova et al., 2007</xref>). Our results that VEGFR2 neutralization restores insulin transcript levels in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets support the notion that enhanced insulin expression is a consequence of aberrant VEGF-A signaling and perturbed islet vasculature.</p><p>We reason that the defect in mature β-cell secretory function in mutant islets is, in part, due to dysregulated expression of genes associated with β-cell maturation, calcium responsiveness, and insulin granule exocytosis. mRNA analyses of β-cell genes in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets revealed decreased <italic>Neurod1</italic> and <italic>Glut2</italic> but enhanced <italic>Npy</italic> expression, which are characteristics of juvenile β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), although other late maturation markers such as <italic>Ucn3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van der Meulen et al., 2012</xref>) were unchanged. Adrb2 loss also did not elicit enhanced β-cell replication in adult islets, which has been associated with functional immaturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Puri et al., 2018</xref>). NPY expression declines postnatally with β-cell maturation, and its re-emergence in animal models of β-cell dysfunction, for example, in β-cell-specific <italic>Neurod1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), or during diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodnoi et al., 2017</xref>), is thought to contribute to altered β-cell identity and impaired GSIS. Thus, diminished expression of genes essential for GSIS (<italic>Glut2</italic>) and de-repression of disallowed genes (<italic>Npy</italic>) could alter β-cell maturation and/or identity and eventually contribute to the secretory dysfunction observed in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets. It is unclear if these gene expression changes reflect compensatory efforts to counter the excessive insulin production that develops neonatally and protect against hypoglycemia, or a <italic>bonafide</italic> effect of endothelial cells in instructing mature β-cell phenotype. Developmental VEGFR2 blockade restored the gene expression of β-cell maturation and GSIS machinery in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets, suggesting that effects of Adrb2 loss are secondary to the disruption of islet endothelial cells. Of note, in contrast to previous studies where VEGF-A over-expression and islet vascular hypertrophy is accompanied by β-cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agudo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2012</xref>), we did not observe major disruptions in β-cell proliferation, islet size, or architecture in <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO animals. This could reflect differences in the timing and levels of VEGF-A over-expression elicited by Adrb2 loss versus transgenic over-expression of VEGF-A. Early increases in VEGF-A expression and islet vascular density preceding the onset of hyperglycemia have been observed in animal models of type two diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2006</xref>). An expanded islet capillary network has also been noted in human islets from individuals with type two diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brissova et al., 2015</xref>), although the patterning and density of the human islet micro-vasculature differs significantly from that in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brissova et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these studies underscore the need to fully delineate the pathways underlying the tight control of β-cell-endothelial cell communication and their long-term impact on islet function.</p><p>We demonstrate that the effects of pancreatic Adrb2 receptors on glucose homeostasis are predominantly due to its functions during a critical window during neonatal development. Islet Adrb2 expression declines markedly during postnatal stages with adult islets (P60) showing significantly depleted expression relative to neonatal stages (P2 and P6). Consistent with this expression pattern, Adrb2 deletion from neonatal, but not adult β-cells, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. That Adrb2 loss from adult murine β-cells did not impair insulin secretion is counter to previously reported effects of β2-adrenergic agonists on acutely stimulating insulin secretion in adult human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacey et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, either the effects of Adrb2 agonists on adult human islets are indirect, perhaps via regulating glucagon release from α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrén and Scherstén, 1986</xref>), or there are species-specific differences in adult Adrb2 functions in β-cells. β-adrenergic receptors have been best characterized for mediating diverse physiological responses to stress in adult mammals, and are one of the most common targets of therapeutic drugs. β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (β-blockers) are commonly used to treat cardiovascular disease and hypertension, including in pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Easterling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parati and Esler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>), and administered to infants for treating hemangiomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chinnadurai et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings in mice suggest that inhibition of pancreatic Adrb2 activity during development could have a lasting impact on glycemic control.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that loss of Adrb2 specifically elicits metabolic phenotypes in female mice. Traditionally, the majority of rodent studies on insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis have employed adult males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in a scarcity of information on sex differences in β-cell development and function. However, it has been noted in different inbred mouse strains, that males are generally less glucose tolerant than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lavine et al., 1971</xref>), likely, in part, due to lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goren et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, clinical studies in humans support that healthy women tend to have increased insulin secretion after a meal or in response to an oral glucose load compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horie et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, isolated female islets show greater glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared to male islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). Sex differences in islet function could arise from one or a combination of multiple factors including, but not limited to, differences in sex chromosomes, developmental effects of steroid sex hormones, in particular testosterone, which surges perinatally and exerts major organizational changes on neuronal circuits, or activity of gonadal hormones following puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular underpinnings of sexually dimorphic Adrb2 functions in islets remain to be defined. However, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2015</xref>) have observed that islet Adrb2 expression is sexually dimorphic with expression in male islets being lower than females. During pregnancy, β-cell mass and intra-islet vasculature undergo dramatic expansions to accommodate the needs of the growing fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansson et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sorenson and Brelje, 1997</xref>). Negative regulatory mechanisms, such as Adrb2-mediated restriction of vascular growth and insulin production, may be particularly critical for adaptive structural and functional changes in female islets to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation. Although Adrb2 deletion in adult females does not affect β-cell function, whether this pathway is relevant under specific circumstances such as pregnancy remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M.musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.FVB-Tg(Pdx1-cre) <break/>6Tuv/Nci; Pdx1-Cre</td><td valign="top">NCI Frederick mouse repository</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_NCIMR:01XL5">IMSR_NCIMR:01XL5</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M.musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Tg(Ins1-EGFP) <break/>1Hara/J; MIP-GFP</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006864">IMSR_JAX:006864</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Adrb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinoi et al.

For practical reasons, analyses of endocrine cell counts and quantifications from immunohistochemistry (TH density and vessel length) and ultrastructural analyses (caveolae and fenestrae density, insulin granule density, insulin granule docking) were done in a semi-blinded manner, such that the investigator was aware of the genotypes prior to the experiment, but conducted the staining and data analyses without knowing the genotypes of each sample. All Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed assuming Gaussian distribution, two-tailed, unpaired, and with a confidence interval of 95%, with the exception of fold change analyses (such as for qPCR), which were done using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. One-way ANOVA analyses with post hoc Tukey test were performed when more than two groups were compared. Two-way ANOVA analyses with post hoc Bonferroni’s test were performed when there were two independent variables, for example genotype and glucose concentrations. Statistical analyses were based on at least three independent experiments and described in the figure legends. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Zhao, M Parsons, M Van Doren, and S Hattar for suggestions on the project and manuscript, members of the Kuruvilla laboratory for discussions, G Karsenty (Columbia) for providing <italic>Adrb2<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, and Integrated Imaging Center (JHU) for help with imaging.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Adrb2</italic> controls glucose homeostasis by developmental regulation of pancreatic islet vasculature&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ceasrine and colleagues analyze the requirement of <italic>Adrb2</italic> for β-cell function and glucose regulation. The manuscript describes the interesting observation that the β2-adrenergic receptor is important for normal β-cell function, but only during a critical post-natal window, and only in female mice. For this study, they employ mouse tools for constitutive and induced deletion of <italic>Adrb2</italic> in pancreatic epithelial cells and β-cells. Overall, the authors make a convincing case that the lack of <italic>Adrb2</italic> leads to excess β-cell <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression during a critical early post-natal window, driving excessive vascularization which then impairs insulin secretion. The rescue experiment that involves transiently blocking <italic>Vegfa</italic> action elegantly demonstrates the latter point. They also establish a feedback loop where β-adrenergic agonists inhibit β-cell <italic>Vegfa</italic> secretion to curb excess islet vascularization.</p><p>The paper is well written and the data are of high quality and uniformly well presented. With the exception of a number of (relatively minor) issues that are straightforward to address, the conclusions are supported by the data presented. The major concerns are predominantly related to the organization of the manuscript and a couple of important pieces data that are needed to clarify the sex-specific bias and lack of phenotype in the adult specific β-cell knockout.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The organization of the manuscript is difficult to follow. The authors present some of the cKO data first, followed by the i-cKO data, and then back to the cKO data. It would make more sense to combine the cKO data. And more importantly, it will be important to first show that the glucose intolerance phenotype isn't due to a loss of β-cells and/or insulin expression/content prior to investigating the β-cell dysfunction (secretory granules, calcium signaling, etc.).</p><p>To fully be able to explain the restricted developmental phenotype, it is necessary to show the expression of <italic>Adrb2</italic> in the developing pancreas, neonate and adult. The authors provide relative values, but this is uninformative. These values should be normalized to a favorite HKG.</p><p>Several existing islet/β-cell datasets indicate that <italic>Adrb2</italic> is barely detectable in the adult; the lack of a phenotype in the adult β-cell KO, may be due to this lack of/extremely low expression of <italic>Adrb2</italic>. Also, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Pancreatic Adrb2 is required for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in female mice”, it is indicated that <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression is lower in male islets vs. female islets. Since a phenotype is only caused by disruption of <italic>Adrb2</italic> in female embryos/neonates, this comparative expression analysis should be performed at these earlier timepoints.</p><p>The authors have nicely shown that disruption of VEGF-A repression and hypervascularization contributes to β-cell dysfunction in the female mice. Are there sex specific differences in VEGF-A repression and/or endothelial density? This will be an important piece of information to understand when/how the sex-specific bias occurs.</p><p>The authors claim they observed an increase in intra-islet endothelial density (subsection “Adrb2 suppresses insulin expression and islet vasculature during development”, second paragraph). While Figure 4E suggests that might be the case, intra-islet endothelial density was not measured (but vessel length/ islet area, which may or may not correlate with endothelial density). The authors should directly show intra-islet endothelial density or restate.</p><p>The authors show increased insulin expression in neonatal transgenic islets. As Figures 1G and 2A present normalized insulin secretion, it seems the islet insulin content was measured in adult mice. Was islet insulin content measured in neonatal islets (by ELISA)?</p><p>As pointed out by the authors, overexpression of VEGF-A and islet hypervascularization increases β-cell proliferation. It has been recently suggested that proliferation renders β-cells immature, and thus less functional (Puri et al., 2018). Thus, increased β-cell proliferation during the neonatal and adult period in the absence of <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression may link hypervascularization with impaired β-cell function. Did the authors analyze β-cell proliferation rate?</p><p>Upon observing the significantly impaired insulin secretion from <italic>Adrb2</italic> deficient female mice, the investigators first explore gene expression of genes directly related to β-cell stimulus secretion coupling and find several of these downregulated. However, with the possible exception of <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, these are unlikely to explain the loss of calcium influx in response to KCl-mediated depolarization, which is a quite dramatic effect. Normal insulin expression and impaired stimulus-secretion coupling could explain the increased insulin granule content that is observed, which is an explanation that should be considered or included in the Discussion.</p><p>The gene expression analysis suggests there may be a fundamental problem with β-cell maturity/identity, which manifests as a defect in insulin secretion that the investigators observe. A loss of <italic>Neurod1</italic> is reported, but it is a little surprising that this is not followed up in more detail. Additional β-cell maturation markers (<italic>Mafa, Ucn3, Glut2, Pdx1, Nkx6-1</italic>) could all be readily included in the panel of maturity markers assessed by qPCR, and good antibodies are available against all of these that should be used to validate any differences in expression that may be observed. The conclusion that '<italic>Adrb2</italic> is required in neonatal, but not adult, β-cells for insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis' may not accurately describe the phenotype that is observed. It appears instead that <italic>Adrb2</italic> is required for maturation of β-cells during a critical window during postnatal development, which manifests as impaired β-cell function.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Adrb2</italic> controls glucose homeostasis by developmental regulation of pancreatic islet vasculature&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The authors have provided the requested additional experiments and the manuscript has been improved. However, with the addition of new data there is one remaining issue regarding the text that will need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>With the added data showing there is little to no expression of <italic>Adrb2</italic> in the adult islet, the paragraph describing the adult specific KO doesn't make much sense. Knocking out a gene that isn't expressed would not be expected to cause a phenotype. We are not opposed to the inclusion of the adult data, but the text should be rearranged to make more sense. A possible solution is to move expression data (subsection “<italic>Adrb2</italic> is required in neonatal β-cells for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in female mice”, seventh paragraph) up before the adult KO data (sixth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The adult phenotype could be introduced as a study to confirm that lack of expression correlated with no phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39689.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The paper is well written and the data are of high quality and uniformly well presented.

We have now included additional analyses of <italic>adult</italic> islet morphology and insulin content in <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-J, revised manuscript). We show that adult islet organization, endocrine cell numbers (by immunostaining and counting), and β-cell proliferation (by EdU labeling) were unaffected by <italic>Adrb2</italic> deletion. However, the mutants had a trend toward smaller-sized islets relative to control mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, revised manuscript). Notably, insulin immunoreactivity and ELISA revealed <italic>increased</italic> insulin content in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F, revised manuscript), similar to findings in neonatal mutants (Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, revised manuscript). Together, these results suggest that defects in islet formation and/or maintenance, reduced β-cell numbers, or <italic>diminished</italic> insulin synthesis do not contribute to decreased insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To fully be able to explain the restricted developmental phenotype, it is necessary to show the expression of Adrb2 in the developing pancreas, neonate and adult. The authors provide relative values, but this is uninformative. These values should be normalized to a favorite HKG.</p><p>Several existing islet/β-cell datasets indicate that Adrb2 is barely detectable in the adult; the lack of a phenotype in the adult β-cell KO, may be due to this lack/extremely low expression of Adrb2. Also, in the third paragraph of the subsection “Pancreatic Adrb2 is required for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in female mice”, it is indicated that Adrb2 expression is lower in male islets vs. female islets. Since a phenotype is only caused by disruption of Adrb2 in female embryos/neonates, this comparative expression analysis should be performed at these earlier timepoints.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed <italic>Adrb2</italic> transcripts in male and female islets at neonatal stages (P2 and P6) and adults (P60) using qPCR analyses. To clarify, we always normalize each transcript to 18S rRNA and then express the fold-change in levels relative to a set-point (particular time-point, control versus mutant etc.). We have clearly indicated this in the revised figure legends.</p><p>We found that <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression was significantly decreased in adult islets compared to neonatal stages (Figure 1H, revised manuscript). The decline in <italic>Adrb2</italic> expression was observed in both female and male islets.

As Figures 1G and 2A present normalized insulin secretion, it seems the islet insulin content was measured in adult mice. Was islet insulin content measured in neonatal islets (by ELISA)?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments to measure insulin content from neonatal islets at P6 using ELISA. We observed a significant 2-fold increase in insulin content in neonatal <italic>Adrb2</italic> cKO islets (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, revised manuscript), similar to the results from adult mutant islets (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As pointed out by the authors, overexpression of VEGF-A and islet hypervascularization increases β-cell proliferation. It has been recently suggested that proliferation renders β-cells immature, and thus less functional (Puri et al., 2018). Thus, increased β-cell proliferation during the neonatal and adult period in the absence of Adrb2 expression may link hypervascularization with impaired β-cell function. Did the authors analyze β-cell proliferation rate?</p></disp-quote><p>To assess β-cell proliferation, we performed EdU labeling in conjunction with insulin immunostaining in neonatal and adult mice at P6 and 2 months of age, respectively. There were no significant differences in β-cell proliferation between control and <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets at either age (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J for adults and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D for neonates, revised manuscript). These results are consistent with the findings that β-cell numbers are unaffected by Adrb2 loss in neonatal and adult animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G for adults and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A for neonates, revised manuscript).Of note, although Adrb2 loss did not elicit enhanced adult β-cell proliferation, postulated to be a characteristic of juvenile β-cells (Puri et al., 2018), we did observe dysregulated expression of specific β-cell genes associated with β-cell maturation, including <italic>Neurod1, Glut2</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets (see our last response below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Upon observing the significantly impaired insulin secretion from Adrb2 deficient female mice, the investigators first explore gene expression of genes directly related to β-cell stimulus secretion coupling and find several of these downregulated. However, with the possible exception of Cacna1c, these are unlikely to explain the loss of calcium influx in response to KCl-mediated depolarization, which is a quite dramatic effect. Normal insulin expression and impaired stimulus-secretion coupling could explain the increased insulin granule content that is observed, which is an explanation that should be considered or included in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The increased insulin granule content observed in <italic>Adrb2</italic> mutant β-cells could result from impaired secretion. However, insulin transcript levels were also elevated in <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets, suggesting that enhanced synthesis could also be an important contributing factor to the elevated insulin content in <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets. We have modified the text in the Discussion accordingly (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The gene expression analysis suggests there may be a fundamental problem with β-cell maturity/identity, which manifests as a defect in insulin secretion that the investigators observe. A loss of Neurod1 is reported, but it is a little surprising that this is not followed up in more detail. Additional β-cell maturation markers (Mafa, Ucn3, Glut2, Pdx1, Nkx6-1) could all be readily included in the panel of maturity markers assessed by qPCR, and good antibodies are available against all of these that should be used to validate any differences in expression that may be observed. The conclusion that 'Adrb2 is required in neonatal, but not adult, β-cells for insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis' may not accurately describe the phenotype that is observed. It appears instead that Adrb2 is required for maturation of β-cells during a critical window during postnatal development, which manifests as impaired β-cell function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editors/reviewers for the suggestion. To address if <italic>Adrb2</italic> loss affects β-cell maturation, we analyzed additional genes associated with functional maturity including <italic>Ucn3, Glut2 (Slc2a2), Pdx1, Nkx6.1</italic>, and<italic>Npy</italic> using qPCR. We observed a marked up-regulation of <italic>Npy</italic> and decreased <italic>Glut2</italic> in adult Adrb2 cKO islets, while <italic>Ucn3 Pdx1,</italic> and <italic>Nkx6.1</italic> were unaffected (Figure 3F, revised manuscript). The changes in NPY and Glut2 expression in Adrb2 cKO islets were supported by immunostaining analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, revised manuscript). The decreased expression of <italic>Neurod1</italic> and <italic>Glut2</italic> and up-regulation of <italic>Npy</italic> in adult <italic>Adrb2</italic>cKO islets, which are all well-established features of juvenile β-cells, could alter β-cell maturation and/or identity and eventually contribute to the observed secretory dysfunction in mutant islets. We have modified the text in the Discussion accordingly (fourth paragraph).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have provided the requested additional experiments and the manuscript has been improved. However, with the addition of new data there is one remaining issue regarding the text that will need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>With the added data showing there is little to no expression of Adrb2 in the adult islet, the paragraph describing the adult specific KO doesn't make much sense. Knocking out a gene that isn't expressed would not be expected to cause a phenotype. We are not opposed to the inclusion of the adult data, but the text should be rearranged to make more sense. A possible solution is to move expression data (subsection “Adrb2 is required in neonatal β-cells for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in female mice”, seventh paragraph) up before the adult KO data (sixth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection).
