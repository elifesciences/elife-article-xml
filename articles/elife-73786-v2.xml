Investigating remyelination in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is difficult in MS, where collecting serial short-interval scans is challenging. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in common marmosets, a model of MS that recapitulates focal cerebral inflammatory demyelinating lesions, we investigated whether MRI is sensitive to, and can characterize, remyelination. In six animals followed with multisequence 7 T MRI, 31 focal lesions, predicted to be demyelinated or remyelinated based on signal intensity on proton density-weighted images, were subsequently assessed with histopathology. Remyelination occurred in four of six marmosets and 45% of lesions. Radiological-pathological comparison showed that MRI had high statistical sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90%) for detecting remyelination. This study demonstrates the prevalence of spontaneous remyelination in marmoset EAE and the ability of in vivo MRI to detect it, with implications for preclinical testing of pro-remyelinating agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset</kwd><kwd>EAE</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>remyelination</kwd><kwd>primate</kwd><kwd>histopathology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donadieu</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Nathanael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Seung-Kwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Luciano</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ineichen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Leibovitch</surname><given-names>Emily C</given-names></name><name><surname>Yen</surname><given-names>Cecil C</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Afonso C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobson</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name><name><surname>Sati</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Daniel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Adelson Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donadieu</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Seung-Kwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Daniel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011022</institution-id><institution>Vertex Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Mac</given-names></name><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Daniel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ineichen</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008870</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG-1907-34570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Dzung L</given-names></name><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Snehashis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21OD030163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Dzung L</given-names></name><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Snehashis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spontaneous remyelination is a common phenomenon in the marmoset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, reliably detected using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, rendering this an indispensable model to further investigate the pathobiology of remyelination in multiple sclerosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating inflammatory demyelinating disorder affecting millions worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reich et al., 2018</xref>). MS causes dynamic changes to myelin in the central nervous system, including the quintessential focal inflammatory destruction of myelin, as well as the phenomenon of remyelination that can follow the demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lubetzki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lassmann et al., 1997</xref>). Demyelinated axons are susceptible to persistent damage and neurological dysfunction in MS; therefore, remyelination is a crucial aspect of tissue repair, and as such represents an important therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kremer et al., 2019</xref>). Most knowledge about remyelination in MS derives from postmortem studies using histochemistry and electron microscopy. This is because investigating remyelination in vivo in real time is limited by imperfect discrimination on neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, in human beings, where collecting serial short-interval scans is challenging, it is difficult to detect and track the dynamic occurrence of remyelination. Therefore, to investigate the pathobiology of remyelination in the context of focal inflammatory demyelination, a reliable preclinical model is needed to develop techniques that can then be applied clinically.</p><p>Rodent models have been widely used to investigate various aspects of the pathobiology of demyelination. However, while toxin models in mice, including the lysolecithin and cuprizone models, display demyelination and even remyelination, they do not recapitulate the recruitment of peripherally derived adaptive immune cells that occurs in MS, which can potentially confound the MRI signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kipp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kipp et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, rodent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, though driven by an immune response, are often neither focally nor profoundly demyelinating and mostly impair the spinal cord. There is no known rodent model that is characterized by multifocal inflammatory demyelination in the brain that resembles MS and is disseminated in both space and time.</p><p>However, EAE in the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) is a well-recognized translational model that serves as a bridge between the rodent EAE and human MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jagessar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kap et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kap et al., 2016</xref>). Not only does EAE resemble MS white matter lesions (WML) both radiologically and pathologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maggi et al., 2017</xref>), but marmoset WML spontaneously remyelinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), as occurs in MS.</p><p>Prior studies demonstrated that certain signal changes in MRI, such as magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), correlate with demyelination and remyelination in MS lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filippi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absinta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laule and Moore, 2018</xref>). This has also been investigated in animal models, albeit mainly in rodent cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmierer et al., 2010</xref>) rather than white matter. It has also been demonstrated that partial remyelination can occur and can be localized either to specific parts of the lesion (most commonly the lesion edge) or to the whole lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filippi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patrikios et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we studied focal WML in marmoset EAE. We utilized serial in vivo MRI, mainly involving proton density-weighted (PDw), T1-weighted (T1w) before and after intravenous injection of a gadolinium chelate, and MTR sequences, to age and characterize lesions and predict remyelination. We further analyzed WML histopathology, focusing on myelin lipids and proteins as well as mature oligodendrocytes and their precursors, to compare and study the reliability of using various in vivo MRI sequences to predict remyelination in the context of recovery from inflammatory demyelination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lesion characterization and categorization on MRI</title><p>EAE was induced in six marmosets as described, and the animals followed by MRI at regular intervals until sacrifice due to clinical progression.

We found that remyelination is relatively common in this model: four of the six marmosets studied had remyelinated lesions on either MRI or histopathology, and nearly half (18) of the 40 lesions identified on MRI were predicted to be remyelinated. In people, WML repair is an age-dependent process that is variable across patients and clinical disease classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lassmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patrikios et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the two animals that did not show remyelination by in vivo MRI, M#5 and M#6, had the shortest experimental duration (16–18 weeks, compared to 40–61 weeks for the other four animals), suggesting more aggressive lesions and/or insufficient time for remyelination.</p><p>Our characterization of remyelinated lesions showed low residual levels of inflammation (microglia/macrophages) and an extensive but incomplete (using NAWM as reference) repopulation of mature oligodendrocytes, specifically a higher number of ASPA+/Olig2+ cells in the lesion core compared to chronic, at least partially demyelinated lesions. Lower percentage of unstained area on LFB and PLP slides (&lt;6%), consistent with data from MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lucchinetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucchinetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patani et al., 2007</xref>), was also observed in remyelinated lesions. Remyelinated lesions were nearly isointense to healthy white matter at the terminal in vivo PDw MRI timepoint and showed no enhancement on post-gadolinium T1w images.</p><p>Interestingly, one lesion appeared remyelinated on PLP with less than 6% of unstained area but demyelinated on LFB (82% of unstained area) and hyperintense on PDw MRI. This result suggests potentially distinct timelines for reconstitution of myelin lipids vs. protein in the context of remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chari, 2007</xref>). As previously described, MRI seems to be more sensitive to content of myelin lipid than of myelin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leuze et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As expected, assessment of early active and chronic, at least partially demyelinated lesions showed fewer mature oligodendrocytes in the lesion core and edge as well as a percentage of demyelinated area &gt;20% on LFB and PLP staining. Both early active and chronic, at least partially demyelinated were hyperintense on terminal in vivo PDw MRI. Taken together, these data suggest that in marmoset EAE, lesions that initially present as hyperintense foci on PDw MRI and subsequently return toward isointensity over time are undergoing remyelination. Our data further suggest that signal intensity time courses, as well as lesion size, can be used to infer lesion status in the setting of early lesion development and recovery, despite the fact that PDw MRI is also known to be sensitive to tissue-level factors other than myelin.</p><p>The time course of marmoset EAE lesion development and repair is relatively stereotyped, as confirmed here. Previous work from our group has shown that once lesions form, the period of demyelination lasts around 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with data from this study (4–7 weeks; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The time course of marmoset remyelination is somewhat slower than toxin-induced demyelinating models in rodents, further raising potential relevance of the marmoset EAE model for preclinical testing of putative remyelination therapies in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMurran et al., 2019</xref>). Our data also suggest that, during the lifespan of a lesion, if its size exceeds ~0.5 µL, the lesion will most likely not start the repair process and remain chronically demyelinated.</p><p>Of the 12 early active lesions, 7 showed an increased number of ASPA-/Olig2+ cells in the lesion vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This pattern, never observed in remyelinated lesions or NAWM, suggests a possible proliferative OPC response, which may indicate attempted repair or potentially an inflammatory role of OPC in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harrington et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we compared PDw and MTR MRI, since MTR is widely used to assay remyelination in vivo in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mallik et al., 2014</xref>), and found that in the context of marmoset EAE, PDw, in close connection with histopathology, appears to have higher sensitivity and specificity for remyelination status. MTR may be low in remyelinated lesions compared to healthy white matter because of the presence of incomplete or morphologically altered myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mallik et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike MTR, which suffers from signal-to-noise reduction due to its calculation as a voxel-wise division of signal intensity measures, PDw signal intensity is directly measured by the MRI system, and thus PDw may prove more reliable for simply discriminating the presence or absence of remyelination and for characterizing its time course.</p><p>To determine whether corticosteroid treatment alters the course of lesion repair, half of the marmosets (for each twin pair, the one that showed lesions first) received 5-day treatment courses. We found no differences by corticosteroid treatment status in prevalence or time course of remyelination on either MRI or histological quantification. However, it remains possible that optimal timing of corticosteroid treatment might influence remyelination. For example, it is possible that early initiation of corticosteroid treatment (as soon as the first lesion was detected) in this study, resulting in treatment completion before lesions were even 1 week old. This might have been too early to influence lesion outcome, as the initial demyelination period typically lasts 4–7 weeks before remyelination ensues. It is also possible that reduction of inflammation via corticosteroid treatment could have hampered more rapid remyelination by slowing clearance of myelin debris, which is a prerequisite for OPC recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunha et al., 2020</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gruchot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rawji et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The main limitation of the study is its small sample size. This limitation is partially compensated by our focus on individual lesions, rather than the number of animals. Another limitation is that different EAE immunization protocols were applied across marmosets, though we did not observe any difference in lesion evolution or outcome either radiologically or histologically. Notably, previous studies from our group with a similar variety of EAE induction methods have also not shown consistent differences in disease course or lesion pathobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we did not obtain ultrathin sections to quantify myelin thickness, as we were interested in performing a battery of stains on our tissue, and as lesions were found at a variety of orientations relative to axons, which would complicate such quantification.</p><p>In conclusion, in vivo longitudinal PDw MRI can effectively predict remyelination in the context of marmoset EAE, with high sensitivity and specificity relative to histology. Given strong similarities between marmoset EAE and MS with respect to lesion development and repair, these results suggest a paradigm for preclinical – and possibly early-phase clinical – studies to investigate putative remyelinating therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Marmoset EAE induction</title><p>Six marmosets (three pairs of twins; four males and two females, ages 2–6 at baseline; same group used for two different studies) were included in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). As a pilot study, two marmosets (M#1–2) first received 100 mg of human white matter homogenate followed by an additional 200 mg after no lesions were detected by in vivo MRI 2 months after the initial injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Following protocol revision to boost the chance of early disease induction, four additional marmosets (M#3–6) received 200 mg of temporal-lobe white matter homogenate collected at autopsy. All white matter homogenates were mixed with complete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco Laboratories). Data from the two induction protocols were combined for this study, as prior marmoset EAE studies have not revealed lesion-level pathology differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">’t Hart and Massacesi, 2009</xref>), and marmosets are a scarce nonhuman primate animal resource for which data use should be maximized.</p><p>In each twin pair, per protocol, the first animal to develop a lesion, as detected by in vivo MRI, received intravenous methylprednisolone (18 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days), the goal of which was to reduce severity of inflammation, potentially allowing longer-term evaluation of the lesions, and to detect a potential effect of corticosteroids on lesion repair. The specific regimen was based on treatment of acute MS relapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goodin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sellebjerg et al., 2005</xref>), scaled to the marmoset setting.

Animals were weighed and monitored daily to ensure adequate nutritional intake and physical wellbeing. All protocols were approved by the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Specifically, the neuroethics committee of the NINDS was consulted, and formally went through the protocol prior to submission on crucial topics including minimization of pain, justification of number of animals and the sex ratio, and dosing of methylprednisolone based on human data (IACUC protocol number #1308).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Marmoset in vivo MRI</title><p>All six marmosets were scanned weekly under anesthesia, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).

The network was trained using PDw MRI images from three EAE marmosets scanned in a previous study along with binary manual segmentation of lesions. An atlas consists of a pair of postprocessed PDw images (baseline and a timepoint) and the binary lesion segmentation of that timepoint. The baseline is assumed and was verified to be lesion-free. Once the network was trained, it was applied to the serial PDw images collected on all six animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), and lesion masks were automatically generated. Any lesion smaller than 4 voxels (0.0225 μL) was considered below the threshold and was removed from analysis.</p><p>For temporal progression computation, a lesion at timepoint <italic>t</italic>=<italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic> was identified as the same lesion at timepoint <italic>t</italic>=<italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> if they overlapped by at least 4 voxels in 3D. All automated lesion segmentations were reviewed by an experienced rater. For subsequent MRI analysis of lesion trajectories, including intensity changes over time, all lesions were identified on every scan of each marmoset, and the average intensities were calculated using the automatically segmented lesions. For prelesion timepoints, a region of interest (ROI) of the size of the maximum lesion volume was drawn manually and centered over the white matter area where the lesion later appeared. When a lesion disappeared during the time course of the disease, an ROI of the maximum lesion size was propagated until the terminal scan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MRI WML categorization</title><p>MRI WML categorization and prediction were set based on our prior experience and performed independently by two experienced raters, blinded to histology.

Brain tissue was processed using formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and subsequent histopathological staining, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luciano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, an ultrahigh-resolution, ex vivo, 3D MRI of extracted brains was used to create individualized brain cradles with a 3D printer, which was in turn used to guide cutting of the brains into 2–4 mm slabs in an extremely close plane and axis to that of the in vivo MRI.

For characterizing inflammation and edema, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (Iba1), CD3, and CD20, were used. Oligodendrocytes and OPC were assessed with aspartoacylase (ASPA) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Olig2) double staining (mature oligodendrocytes are considered ASPA and Olig2 positive; OPC are considered Olig2 positive but ASPA negative). For axon staining, Bielschowsky’s silver method was used. Briefly, deparaffinized slides were covered with 20% AgNO<sub>3</sub> and incubated at 40°C inside a dark chamber for 30 min. Slides were washed and placed in ammonia silver solution, prepared by adding concentrated ammonium hydroxide drop-by-drop into AgNO<sub>3</sub> until brown precipitate disappeared, at 40°C for 30 min. Developer working solution was added to the slides, made with developer stock solution (37–40% formaldehyde, citric acid, and nitric acid), ammonium hydroxide, and distilled water. After all incubations, slides were washed with 1% ammonium hydroxide, washed in distilled water, and treated with 5% sodium thiosulfate solution.

The categorization was performed according to our experience with marmoset EAE lesions as detailed in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maggi et al., 2014</xref>). The lesions were categorized as follows: 1 – <italic>early active</italic>: LFB-PAS shows prominent demyelination with LFB+, PAS+, and/or PLP+ phagocytes, indicating ingestion of myelin breakdown products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). PLP immunohistochemistry also demonstrates demyelination with myelin debris. ASPA/Olig2 double immunohistochemistry demonstrates loss of oligodendrocytes. Qualitative assessment highlights prominent Iba1<sup>+</sup> cell infiltration, CD3+ and CD20+ cells in the perivascular cuff and lesion core (not shown), and loss of axons on Bielschowsky silver staining. HE staining shows edema marked by irregular clear spaces around cells. 2 – <italic>Chronic, likely at least partially demyelinated</italic>: LFB-PAS staining and PLP immunohistochemistry show areas of complete demyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Lesions contain few Iba1+ cells, and CD3+ and CD20+ cells (not shown) are scarce and only found around vessels. There is loss of both oligodendrocytes and OPC on ASPA/Olig2 staining. There is less edema compared to early active lesions (HE staining), and there is substantial loss of axons (Bielschowsky silver stain). 3 – <italic>Remyelinated</italic>; LFB-PAS staining and PLP immunohistochemistry show nearly normal myelin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Both oligodendrocytes and OPC are present, as demonstrated by staining with ASPA/Olig2. Inflammatory cells are less prominent, with few infiltrations of Iba1+ microglia/macrophages or CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes (not shown). Bielschowsky staining shows some preservation of normal axon structures.</p><p>Quantitative measurement of demyelination and remyelination was performed by a single experienced rater (MD). To obtain a quantitative measurement of demyelination and remyelination, the percentage of demyelinated area for each lesion was extracted on LFB and PLP staining. For consistency, an ROI of 1500 µm<sup>2</sup> centered on each lesion core was placed; this ROI was large enough to include even the biggest lesion in our sample. The demyelinated area for each stain was calculated using the thresholding tool on FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) as follows: number of pixels with a null value*100/total number of pixels. ASPA+/Olig2+ cell count (oligodendrocytes) and ASPA-/Olig2+ cell count (OPC) were assessed using thresholding tools in FIJI45 within the same ROI for each lesion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To evaluate the statistical sensitivity and specificity of in vivo MRI detection of chronic demyelination or remyelination, relative to histopathology, we created confusion matrices and calculated true or false positive and negative rates, as well as sensitivity and specificity.

To test the effects of corticosteroid treatment and sex on remyelination, we used the point biserial correlation model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a shareholder and employee of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was performed under the guideline and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health IACUC.

the remyelination of brain lesions in an EAE marmoset model of multiple sclerosis. This work addresses in a non-human primate a missing link in the neuropathology of myelin repair, because in human MS it is virtually impossible to study the lesion dynamics by MRI (in live patients) and demyelination by histology (upon brain autopsy). The data presented are solid although the conclusions would have been stronger with further histological evidence of remyelination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73786.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>Jeannie</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pttbw34</institution-id><institution>Baylor College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.27.466044">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466044v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We appreciate your patience during the handling of this submission. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this response to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see below, there was an agreement that your work is an important step towards the MRI-based diagnosis of CNS remyelination in multiple sclerosis. However, it was also felt that the present manuscript has shortcomings in the presentation of histological data and some missing information about data acquisition. Please look for details below how to improve a revised version of your manuscript that better supports the claims made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Similar to the serial MRI, the manuscript would be enhanced by supplementing Iba1- and PLP-stained sections of each lesion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Before publication I think that this would be improved by consideration of the following</p><p>How do the authors know that PDw is imaging new myelin formation rather than loss of inflammation? The signal is maintained in acute and chronic inflammation, and lost in remyelination -which is also associated with reduced inflammation. It's not clear to me how the two events can be distinguished by this imaging protocol. Is the time course of inflammatory loss different to that for every myelination? The gadolinium experiments mentioned in the methods but not included in the results might address this?</p><p>How is the distinction between acute and chronic inflammatory lesions made. Is it just the time of onset after immunisation?</p><p>In figure 5 it is not clear how the transition from demyelination to remyelination was established, and so the evaluation of the time course for remyelination is not clear</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If possible, it would be useful to have images of lesions (histology) at somewhat lower magnification as well, to appreciate differences in density etc. This would be very helpful particularly in the case of Luxol Fast Blue staining of remyelinated lesions so that pale staining compared to non-affected tissue can be appreciated, and for ASPA/Olig2 and Bielschowsky staining, to illustrate differences in density.</p><p>Regarding Iba1 staining, clear cellular labeling pattern is observed only in Figure 4, while Figure 2 shows high background and very few if any clearly labeled cells, which is a bit better in Figure 3.</p><p>Points to clarify:</p><p>1. Figure 5 shows the estimated timing of demyelination/remyelination. Three out of four graphs are from methylprednisolone (MP)-treated animals. It was indicated in Methods that MP administration was performed after demyelination was first detected, but the first graph shows 1 double bar, at 12 weeks (prior to the first peak), and a triple bar at 18 weeks approx.

Yet, on page 16, it is indicated that remyelination was detected in animals M#2-4 by MRI and confirmed by histology, and that M#5 had a single remyelinated lesion not seen on MRI, which seems to contradict Figure 5.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jeannie Chin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are remaining issues that need to be addressed, as described in the individual reviewer comments at the end of this correspondence. A brief summary of those essential issues follows:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Related to the finding that none of the lesions returning to isointensity on PDw MRI demonstrated gadolinium enhancement on T1w scans, while the gadolinium data is very helpful, no quantification is provided. This should be added. Ideally, additional histological evidence of remyelination should be provided to strengthen the power of PDw to classify the lesions. Also, please clarify whether gadolinium enhancement is also considered as a marker of acute versus chronic lesions in this paper.</p><p>2) The authors assert that prior data shows that the changes seen occur at the same time as remyelination and don't correlate with any changes in inflammation, but this was not sufficiently addressed. Please include a more detailed analysis of remyelination and inflammation in the lesions on which the MRI was performed, rather than a comparison with older data. Of particular interest would be histological evidence of remyelination such as reduced myelin density, shorter and thinner myelin internodes and myelin protein staining of remyelinating oligodendrocyte cytoplasm.</p><p>3) A concern raised in the previous review was that it was not possible to see loss of oligodendroglia based on the image provided to illustrate acute lesions (now in Figure 1), in which there is a small oligo-free area surrounding what may be blood vessels, but the remaining PLP-free area contains many oligodendroglial cells. The question of oligodendroglial loss could be addressed by quantifying the density in perilesional area and comparing it to the intralesional density. However, the authors simply refer to a previous manuscript (JCI, 2019). Were the same animals/lesions analyzed in this study? This point needs to be clearly addressed throughout the manuscript wherever references to previous data are made. Please add quantitative data to demonstrate oligo depletion followed by repopulation in remyelinated lesion. If the quantification does not support the loss of oligodendroglia, then these claims should be removed.</p><p>4) The histological criteria for lesion classification is slightly confusing, which was brought up in the original review as well. The authors assert that experienced histopathologists blindly classified these lesions in Kuhlmann 2017, but it is not really clear that exactly the same immunolabelings were performed. Please provide a clear statement on which histological parameters (immunolabelings) were considered by the histopathologists to classify the lesions in this study.</p><p>Note: Because the results of this manuscript have important implications for pre-clinical testing of remyelinating drugs, solid data on the lesions analyzed in this manuscript should be provided to reinforce the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is no histological evidence of remyelination such as reduced myelin density, shorter and thinner myelin internodes and myelin protein staining of remyelinating oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. Most lesional areas are small. It is most likely that many of the MRI ROIs are due to alterations in myelinated white matter. It may be that all lesion are remyelinated to a point that they cannot be distinguished from normal myelinated white matter. It would seem unlikely that a lesion in the process of remyelination is not present in all the lesions investigated. This reduces the utility of the model to investigate remyelination. What can be measured? Unlikely that remyelination can be enhanced. I do not consider this as a reliable model for remyelination. This a relevant question based upon the species utilized in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My key point of concern was</p><p>&quot;How do the authors know that PDw is imaging new myelin formation rather than loss of inflammation? The signal is maintained in acute and chronic inflammation, and lost in remyelination -which is also associated with reduced inflammation. It's not clear to me how the two events can be distinguished by this imaging protocol. Is the time course of inflammatory loss different to that for every myelination? The gadolinium experiments mentioned in the methods but not included in the results might address this?&quot;</p><p>This is rebutted as follows</p><p>&quot;- This is an essential point, and we thank the reviewer for the inquiry. We agree (and have now clarified in the paper) that PDw imaging is sensitive to inflammation and other changes; the lack of specificity to myelin is indeed well known in the field. What is critical for our purposes, however, is the ability to infer changes in myelin from the combination of in-vivo MRI data and extensive knowledge of the time course of lesion development and repair, which in our hands is derived from the analysis of ~100 animals over more than a decade, as reflected in our prior publications and the current manuscript. Hence, our paper is essentially about sensitivity of PDw MRI to myelin changes in this context, not about specificity of the technique. It is worth noting, in this context, that chronic EAE lesions are typically either gliotic (chronic inactive) or remyelinated, with few inflammatory cells; thus, the difference in MRI signal between remyelinated and chronically demyelinated lesions cannot be explained purely by inflammation. Furthermore, none of the lesions returning to isointensity on PDw MRI demonstrated gadolinium enhancement on T1w scans. In the revision, we have added material under the description on remyelinated lesions in the Results section.&quot;</p><p>The gadolinium data is very helpful, although no quantification is provided. This should be added.</p><p>I take the point that the prior data argues that the changes seen occur at the same time as remyelination and don't correlate with any changes in inflammation, but feel my concern is not really addressed in the discussion despite it being recognised as &quot;essential&quot;. At the very least I'd like to see an addition to the discussion here, although Id much prefer a more detailed analysis of remyelination and inflammation in the lesions on which the MRI was performed rather than a comparison with older data</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My general feeling is that, while several issues were successfully addressed by this revision, referring to previous manuscripts has not provided answers to some fundamental questions raised in the previous review.</p><p>One of my points was that I could not see loss of oligodendroglia based on the image provided to illustrate acute lesions (now in Figure 1), in which there is a small oligo-free area surrounding what may be blood vessels, but the remaining PLP-free area contains many oligodendroglial cells. The question of oligodendroglial loss could be addressed by quantifying the density in perilesional area and comparing it to the intralesional density. However, the authors simply refer to a previous manuscript (JCI, 2019). Were the same animals/lesions analyzed in this study? This is really not clear from the manuscript. One sentence in the Discussion refers to previous analyses of oligo repopulation and remyelination, but is it the same lesions/animals? This should be clarified.</p><p>Because some acutely demyelinating lesions show oligo preservation, I do not think that showing a decrease in oligos is necessary to claim that the lesion is demyelinated, but I do think that if this claim is made, it should be supported by data, especially when the image provided does not illustrate the claim. Otherwise, the claim should be omitted. Thus, I recommend adding some quantitative data to demonstrate oligo depletion followed by repopulation in remyelinated lesions. If no depletion is evidenced in acute lesions, then it can be discussed that demyelination with oligodendroglial preservation has also been observed in early MS lesions. If these data on the same lesions are provided in previous publications, it should be clearly indicated that these are the same lesions.</p><p>A crucial issue raised in the previous round was that of PDw sequences detecting changes other than demyelination/remyelination. The authors did mention that gadolinium enhancement was present in acute but not chronic lesions, both of which were demyelinated and show similar Pdw, which, in my opinion, does suggest that changes in PDw signal are not due to inflammatory infiltrates, even though does not exclude that other events (axonal changes, astrocytes, diffuse microgliosis) might alter the signal. Including gadolinium data and potentially, quantification, would be a good argument to exclude inflammatory infiltrates as the cause of changes in PDw. This point should be reinforced in the Discussion. Ideally, additional histological evidence of remyelination should be provided to strengthen the power of PDw to classify the lesions.</p><p>I still find the histological criteria for lesion classification slightly confusing. The answer to my suggestion to clearly define lesion classification criteria applied in this paper was that experienced histopathologists blindly classified these lesions based on Tanja Kuhlmann paper from 2017, but from the data presented, it is not really clear that exactly the same immunolabelings were performed (as compared to Kuhlmann paper). From the authors' response, it can be concluded that all these analyses were performed in their previous work on marmoset lesions (again, were these the same lesions?), and thus not repeated in this study. I think that the authors need to provide a clear statement on which histological parameters (immunolabellings) were considered by the histopathologists to classify the lesions in this study.</p><p>The authors state that lesions were classified as acute if younger than 5 weeks and remyelinated or chronic if older than 5 weeks. I suppose this refers to MRI classification of the lesions, and not the histological one. As the authors also describe acute lesions as gadolinium enhancing, and chronic lesions (and remyelinated ones) gadolinium enhancement-free, was gadolinium enhancement also considered as a marker of acute versus chronic lesions in this paper?</p><p>Because the results of this manuscript have important implications for pre-clinical testing of remyelinating drugs, solid data on the lesions analyzed in this manuscript should be provided to reinforce the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73786.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Similar to the serial MRI, the manuscript would be enhanced by supplementing Iba1- and PLP-stained sections of each lesion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that supplementing all the lesions with Iba1 and PLP stains would be a useful addition and have now added them to the supplementary data section of the manuscript, under Source data 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Before publication I think that this would be improved by consideration of the following</p><p>How do the authors know that PDw is imaging new myelin formation rather than loss of inflammation?

Also, please clarify whether gadolinium enhancement is also considered as a marker of acute versus chronic lesions in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and have made substantial changes to the paper in response.</p><p>First, we would like to clarify that most of the lesions newly detected on PDw MRI showed gadolinium enhancement on T1w images. Only lesions identified as “early active” on pathology were found to be enhancing on the terminal MRI. We added the following paragraph in the Results section:</p><p>“T1w gadolinium enhancement as a marker of acute inflammation</p><p>Across the 6 animals scanned longitudinally, 82% of the lesions newly detected on PDw MRI presented T1w gadolinium enhancement. Enhancement was occasionally seen at the following timepoint (10–15 days after first detection). No chronic, at least partially demyelinated or remyelinated WML presented gadolinium enhancement on the terminal scan. M#5–6 presented at least one early active WML enhancing lesion at their terminal scan.”</p><p>The use of gadolinium enhancement to categorize lesions as acute or chronic has now been clarified in the Results section, in the section entitled “MRI WML categorization.”</p><p>Second, as suggested, we have added more histological evidence of lesion remyelination in the revision. To do so, we assessed, over 31 lesions, the percentage of unstained area on PLP and LFB stains for myelin protein and lipid, respectively. We also added 10 NAWM areas from the same animals as control. As expected, we observed a larger unstained area for demyelinated lesions vs remyelinated lesions on both PLP and LFB. We have added details to the method section as well as a detailed paragraph in results:</p><p>“Histological quantification recapitulates MRI rater analysis of lesion myelin status</p><p>Assessment of PLP staining in 31 lesions and 10 normal appearing white matter (NAWM) areas (1500 µm<sup>2</sup> centered over the lesion core) demonstrated larger unstained areas in early active (58±25%) and chronic, at least partially demyelinated (38±25%) lesions compared to remyelinated lesions (4.5±1.1%) or NAWM (2.6±0.3%) (Figure 5A). LFB assessment showed similar results: 63±26% unstained area in early active lesions, 43±26% in chronic, at least partially demyelinated lesions, 15±25% in remyelinated lesions, and 3.0±0.4% in NAWM (Figure 5B). We observed a significantly smaller unstained PLP area in NAWM compared to remyelinated lesions (2-sample t-test, p&lt;0.001). There were no apparent differences between PLP and LFB staining in the different lesion categories and in NAWM (2-sample t-test). Interestingly, 1 lesion appeared remyelinated on PLP, with less than 6% of unstained, area but demyelinated on LFB (82% of unstained area).”</p><p>Oligodendrocyte density was addressed with ASPA and Olig2 staining. ASPA+/Olig2+ cells, reflecting mature oligodendrocytes, and ASPA-/Olig2+ cells, potentially reflecting OPC, were counted for every lesion in comparison to 10 NAWM areas. Our analysis showed a higher ASPA+/Olig2+ cell count in remyelinated lesions compared to acute or chronic lesions as well as negative correlation between lesion volume at terminal PDw MRI and ASPA+/Olig2+ cell number. A detailed paragraph was added in the Results section:</p><p>“Oligodendrocyte and OPC counts are consistent with degree of demyelination in lesions Quantitative assessment of ASPA+/Olig2+ (mature oligodendrocytes) and ASPA-/Olig2+ (OPC) across the 31 lesions and 10 NAWM areas showed, as expected, more mature oligodendrocytes in remyelinated lesions and NAWM than early active or chronic, at least partially demyelinated lesions (Figure 5C). Consistent with PLP observations, we observed significantly more oligodendrocytes in NAWM compared to remyelinated lesions (2-sample t-test, p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, more OPC were found in early active demyelinating lesions than in remyelinated lesions or NAWM (Figure 5D). Younger lesions (&lt;10 weeks old by MRI) had more OPC than older lesions, highlighted by a negative correlation between lesion age and OPC count (r = -0.46; p = 0.009).”</p><p>The revision includes a newly added Figure 5, which summarizes the quantitative histological analysis. Adequate description in the method section was also added (“Histological WML categorization”). We have also added additional comments in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors assert that prior data shows that the changes seen occur at the same time as remyelination and don't correlate with any changes in inflammation, but this was not sufficiently addressed.

Of particular interest would be histological evidence of remyelination such as reduced myelin density, shorter and thinner myelin internodes and myelin protein staining of remyelinating oligodendrocyte cytoplasm.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested and described in the response to essential revision #1 (above), we have added additional histological analysis to back up and quantify our findings regarding remyelination.</p><p>In addition to myelin staining, we did additional characterization of CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells to assess inflammation in each type of lesion.

The question of oligodendroglial loss could be addressed by quantifying the density in perilesional area and comparing it to the intralesional density. However, the authors simply refer to a previous manuscript (JCI, 2019). Were the same animals/lesions analyzed in this study? This point needs to be clearly addressed throughout the manuscript wherever references to previous data are made. Please add quantitative data to demonstrate oligo depletion followed by repopulation in remyelinated lesion. If the quantification does not support the loss of oligodendroglia, then these claims should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the request for clarification. With respect to the second point, the lesions and animals studied in this project were different those reported in our previous publication (JCI, 2019).</p><p>Please see the response to essential revision #1 (above) for the revisions we made to quantify OPC and oligodendrocytes.

The following paragraphs were added or changed:</p><p>“MRI WML categorization</p><p>MRI WML categorization and prediction were set based on our prior experience and performed independently by 2 experienced raters, blinded to histology. WML were classified according to the terminal MRI as follows: 1 — predicted early active, described as hyperintense on PDw and enhancing on T1w scans after injection of gadolinium; 2 — predicted chronic, at least partially demyelinated, described as hyperintense on PDw and not enhancing on T1w scans after injection of gadolinium; and 3 — predicted remyelinated, described as initially hyperintense on PDw, iso-intense on PDw at the terminal scan, and not enhancing on T1w scans after injection of gadolinium.”</p><p>“Histological WML categorization</p><p>Histological analysis and characterization were performed by 1 experienced rater blinded to the MRI. The categorization was performed according to our experience with marmoset EAE lesions as detailed in previous publications<sup>14,24,44</sup>. The lesions were categorized as follows: 1 — early active: LFB-PAS shows prominent demyelination with LFB+, PAS+, and/or PLP+ phagocytes, indicating ingestion of myelin breakdown products (Figure 1C). PLP immunohistochemistry also demonstrates demyelination with myelin debris. ASPA/Olig2 double immunohistochemistry demonstrates loss of oligodendrocytes. Qualitative assessment highlights prominent Iba1+ cell infiltration, CD3+, and CD20+ cells in the perivascular cuff and lesion core (not shown), and loss of axons on Bielschowsky silver staining. HE staining shows edema marked by irregular clear spaces around cells. 2 — Chronic, likely at least partially demyelinated: LFB-PAS staining and PLP immunohistochemistry show areas of complete demyelination (Figure 2C). Lesions contain few Iba1+ cells, and CD3+ and CD20+ cells (not shown) are scarce and only found around vessels. There is loss of both oligodendrocytes and OPC on ASPA/Olig2 staining. There is less edema compared to early active lesions (HE staining), and there is substantial loss of axons (Bielschowsky silver stain). 3 — Remyelinated; LFB-PAS staining and PLP immunohistochemistry show nearly normal myelin structure (Figure 3C). Both oligodendrocytes and OPC are present, as demonstrated by staining with ASPA/Olig2. Inflammatory cells are less prominent, with few Iba1+ microglia/macrophages or CD3+ and CD20+ lymphocytes (not shown). Bielschowsky staining shows some preservation of normal axon structures.</p><p>Quantitative measurement of demyelination and remyelination was performed by a single experienced rater (MD). To obtain a quantitative measurement of demyelination and remyelination, the percentage of demyelinated area for each lesion was extracted on LFB and PLP staining. For consistency, a region of interest (ROI) of 1500 µm<sup>2</sup> centered on each lesion core was placed; this ROI was large enough to include even the biggest lesion in our sample. The demyelinated area for each stain was calculated using the thresholding tool on FIJI45 as follows: number of pixels with a null value*100/total number of pixels. ASPA+/Olig2+ cell count (oligodendrocytes) and ASPA-/Olig2+ cell count (OPC) were assessed using thresholding tools in FIJI45 within the same ROI for each lesion.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
