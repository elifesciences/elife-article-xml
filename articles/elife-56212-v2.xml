active learning process comprising the development of disparity tuned neurons in visual cortex and the establishment of precise vergence control of the eyes. We present a computational model for the learning and self-calibration of active binocular vision based on the Active Efficient Coding framework, an extension of classic efficient coding ideas to active perception. Under normal rearing conditions with naturalistic input, the model develops disparity tuned neurons and precise vergence control, allowing it to correctly interpret random dot stereograms. Under altered rearing conditions modeled after neurophysiological experiments, the model qualitatively reproduces key experimental findings on changes in binocularity and disparity tuning. Furthermore, the model makes testable predictions regarding how altered rearing conditions impede the learning of precise vergence control.

This is in sharp contrast to today’s machine learning approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kotsiantis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jordan and Mitchell, 2015</xref>), which typically use millions of carefully labeled training images in order to learn to, say, recognize an object or perceive its three-dimensional structure. How can biological vision systems learn so much more autonomously? The development of binocular vision presents a paradigmatic case for studying this question. This development is an active process that includes the learning of appropriate sensory representations and the learning of precise motor behavior. Species with two forward facing eyes learn to register small differences between the images projected onto the left and right retinas. These differences are called binocular disparities and are detected by populations of neurons in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kandel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake and Wilson, 2011</xref>) that have receptive subfields in both eyes. Frequently, they are modeled using separate Gabor-shaped filters for each eye, where the disparity is encoded by a shift in the centers of the filters, a difference between their phases, or by a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fleet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Qian, 2004</xref>). The responses of such disparity tuned neurons can be used to infer the three-dimensional structure of the world. At the same time, such species also learn to align their eyes such that the optical axes of the two eyes converge on the same point of interest. These so-called vergence eye movements are also learned and fine-tuned during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Held et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fox et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stidwill and Fletcher, 2017</xref>). Again, this learning does not require any supervision from outside, but must rely on some form of self-calibration.</p><p>Various computational models have been employed to explain the development of binocular disparity tuning in the context of efficient coding ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li and Atick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>), independent component analysis (ICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hoyer and Hyvärinen, 2000</xref>), Bayesian inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burge and Geisler, 2014</xref>), or nonlinear Hebbian learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chauhan et al., 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chauhan et al., 2020</xref> for a review). A critical limitation of these studies is that they ignore the importance of behavior in shaping the statistics of the sensory input and in particular the role of vergence eye movements in determining the statistics of disparities. Indeed, while it has long been argued that the development of disparity tuning and vergence eye movements are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candy, 2019</xref>), it has been only recently that computational models have tried to explain how the learning of disparity tuning and vergence eye movements are coupled and allow the visual system to self-calibrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klimmasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckmann et al., 2019</xref>). These models have been developed in the framework of Active Efficient Coding (AEC), which is an extension of Barlow’s classic efficient coding hypothesis to active perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow, 1961</xref>). In a nutshell, classic efficient coding argues that sensory systems should use representations that remove redundancies from sensory signals to encode them more efficiently. Therefore, sensory representations should be adapted to the statistics of sensory signals. Based on this idea, a wide range of data on tuning properties of sensory neurons in different modalities have been explained from a unified theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simoncelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith and Lewicki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doi et al., 2012</xref>). AEC goes beyond classic efficient coding by acknowledging that developing sensory systems shape the statistics of sensory signals through their own behavior. This gives them a second route for optimizing the encoding of sensory signals by adapting their behavior. In the case of binocular vision, for example, the control of vergence eye movements is shaping the statistics of binocular disparities. By simultaneously optimizing neural tuning properties and behavior, AEC models have provided the first comprehensive account of how humans and other binocular species may self-calibrate their binocular vision through the simultaneous learning of disparity tuning and vergence control.</p><p>A generic AEC model has two components. The first component is an efficient coding model that learns to encode sensory signals by adapting the tuning properties of a population of simulated sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olshausen and Field, 1997</xref>). In the case of binocular vision, this is a population of visual cortical neurons receiving input from the two eyes that learns to encode the visual signals via an efficient code. The second component is a reinforcement learning (RL) model that learns to control the behavior. In the case of binocular vision, this component will learn to control eye vergence. For this, it receives as input the population activity of the visual neurons and learns to map it onto vergence commands. This learning is guided by an internally generated reward signal, which reinforces movements that lead to a more efficient encoding of the current visual scene. For example, when the eyes are aligned on the same point, the left and right images become largely redundant. The efficient coding model can exploit this redundant structure in both eyes, by developing neurons tuned to small or zero disparities. Conversely, such binocular neurons tuned to small disparities will represent any remaining misalignments of the eyes, providing informative input for vergence control. In this way, learning of vergence control supports the development of neurons tuned to small disparities and this developing population of neurons in turn facilitates the learning of fine vergence control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, however, this normal development of binocular vision is impaired in a range of alternate rearing conditions. In fact, already since the days of Hubel and Wiesel, alternate rearing conditions have been used to improve our understanding of visual cortex plasticity and function. Manipulating the input to the visual system during development and observing how the system reacts to such manipulations has shaped our understanding of visual development until today. For example, artificially inducing a strabismus (squint) leads to drastic changes in the tuning properties of neurons in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</xref>). A comprehensive theoretical account of the development of binocular vision must therefore also be able to explain the experimentally observed differences in alternate rearing conditions. Our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckmann et al., 2019</xref>) took a step in this direction by modeling the development of amblyopia in response to anisometropic rearing (introducing differences between the refractive power of the two eyes). In the present study, in contrast, we aim to demonstrate the generality of the AEC approach by reproducing and explaining a large range of neurophysiological findings from different alternate rearing conditions: changing the orientation distribution in the visual input (horizontal, vertical, or orthogonal rearing), monocular rearing, strabismic rearing, and aniseikonia. We also utilize a sophisticated biomechanical model of the oculomotor system, opening the door to simulating the effects of both optical and motor abberations on visual development.</p><p>Our results show that the model qualitatively captures findings on how different alternate rearing conditions alter the statistics of disparity tuning and binocularity. Furthermore, the model makes specific novel and testable predictions about differences in vergence behavior under the different rearing conditions. Surprisingly, it also predicts systematic differences in the statistics of orientation tuning of visual cortical neurons depending on the fidelity of vergence eye movements. Overall, our results support AEC as a parsimonious account of the emergence of binocular vision, highlighting the active nature of this development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A model for the development of active binocular vision</title><p>The model comprises a virtual agent situated in a simulated environment. The agent looks at a textured plane that is positioned in front of it at variable distances between 0.5 m and 6 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We use planar images instead of a full 3D environment to (i) allow us to uniquely define the correct vergence angle for the current visual scene and (ii) make sure that the visual input follows natural image statistics. Note, that previous AEC models have already demonstrated the approach in full 3-D environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lelais et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model overview.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The agent looks at the object plane in the simulated environment. (<bold>B</bold>) Architecture of the model. Input images are filtered to simulate alternate rearing conditions (N: normal, V: vertical, H: horizontal, O: orthogonal, M: monocular). Binocular patches are extracted at a coarse and a fine scale (turquoise and orange boxes) with different resolutions. These patches are encoded via sparse coding and combined with the muscle activations to form a state vector for actor critic reinforcement learning. The reconstruction error of sparse coding indicates coding efficiency and serves as a reward signal (purple arrow) to train the critic. The actor generates changes in muscle activations, which result in differential rotations of the eyeballs and a new iteration of the perception-action cycle.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56212-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>An image is rendered for the left eye and a second image is rendered for the right eye. Binocular patches are extracted from these images and encoded by a sparse coding algorithm. The activation levels of the learned binocular basis functions (BFs) can be thought of as firing rates of binocular simple cells in primary visual cortex. The basis functions themselves roughly describe their receptive fields (RFs) and are adapted through learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Olshausen and Field, 1997</xref>). These activations are then squared and pooled across the image to obtain a more position-invariant representation mimicking the behavior of complex cells. From this state representation a reinforcement learner generates vergence commands that symmetrically rotate the eyeballs inwards or outwards. This results in two new images being rendered and a new simulation iteration starts. The complete process is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>In the human retina, the RF size of ganglion cells increases towards the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curcio et al., 1990</xref>). We incorporate this idea by extracting patches from an input image at two different spatial scales: A high-resolution fine scale is extracted from the central part and a low-resolution coarse scale is extracted from a larger area (orange and turquoise boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The overlap between the coarse and fine scale does not depict the biological reality, but simplifies the implementation and analysis of the model. Covering a visual angle of 8.3° in total, the fine scale corresponds to the central/para-central region (including the fovea) and the coarse scale to the near-peripheral region with a diameter of 26.6°. On the one hand, this two-scale architecture is more biologically plausible than using just a single scale, on the other hand it also increases the resulting verging performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lonini et al., 2013</xref>). One input patch (or subfield) in the coarse scale can detect a disparity of up to 8.8° while one patch in the fine scale covers 1.6°. The coarse scale can therefore be used to detect large disparities, while the fine scale detects small disparities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Visual input and learned receptive fields under different rearing conditions.</title><p>Left: Illustration of visual inputs under the different rearing conditions.

To mimic strabismus, the right eyeball is rotated inwards while the left eye remains unchanged to enforce non-overlapping input to corresponding positions of the left and right retina (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>The adaptation of the neural representation and the learning of appropriate motor commands occur simultaneously: While the sparse coder updates the initially random RFs to minimize the reconstruction error, the RL agent generates vergence eye movements to minimize the reconstruction error of the sparse coder. Since the sparse coder has a fixed capacity, minimizing its reconstruction error is equivalent to maximizing its coding efficiency. Thus, both the sparse coder and the reinforcement learner aim to maximize the overall coding efficiency of the model. The learning of the two components (sparse coder and RL agent) happens roughly at the same timescale. Our model is robust to variations in the learning rates, as long as the reinforcement learner’s critic converges faster than the actor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van Hasselt and Wiering, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Normal rearing conditions lead to the autonomous learning of accurate vergence control for natural input and random dot stereograms</title><p>A first critical test of a model of the development of binocular vision is whether the model produces plausible behavior. Indeed, under normal rearing conditions the joint learning of the neural representation and motor behavior results in an agent that accurately verges the eyes on the plane in front of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klimmasch et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> illustrates the learned behavior.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56212-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Vergence performance for normal visual input.</title><p>The sizes of the scales and the according patch sizes are indicated in blue for the coarse scale and red for the fine scale.</p></caption></media><p>To quantify vergence behavior in the model, we define the absolute vergence error. It measures by how much the vergence angle between the eyes deviates from the ideal position at the end of a fixation (see Materials and methods for details). The model obtains an accuracy of vergence eye movements of 0.12 ± 0.17° or 455.40 ± 613.75 arc sec. Note, however, that the model as described above has a much lower visual resolution compared to human foveal vision. One pixel in the model corresponds to 802 arc sec, while the spacing between photoreceptors in the fovea corresponds to 28 arc sec. When we correct for the model’s lower visual resolution (see Materials and methods), the corrected vergence accuracy is 15.9 ± 21.44 arc sec. This falls within the range of human performance under natural viewing conditions, which is typically better than 60 arc sec (1 arc min) for stimuli not closer than 0.5 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaschinski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jaschinski, 2001</xref>).</p><p>A second critical test of a model of the development of stereoscopic vision is whether it can handle <italic>random-dot stereograms</italic> (RDSs), which represent the most challenging stimuli for stereopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Olshausen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Qian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chauhan et al., 2018</xref>).

In these experiments, participants view a grid of random dots through a stereoscope or another form of dichoptic presentation. Typically, the central part is shifted in one of the two images which results in the perception of stereoscopic depth in healthy subjects. The advantage of this form of examination is that there are no monocular depth cues (such as occlusion, relative size, or perspective). The impression of depths arises solely because of the brain’s ability to integrate information coming from the two eyes.</p><p>To show that our model is able to perceive depth in RDS, although not having been trained on them, we generate various RDS and render the shifted images for the left and right eye separately. We expose the model that was trained on natural input stimuli to a range of RDS with different spatial frequencies, window sizes, disparities, and object distances. The model is able to exploit the differences in the images and align the eyes on the virtual plane that will appear in front or behind the actual object plane in the RDS. Averaged over all trials, the model achieves an absolute vergence error of 0.21 ± 0.22° at the end of a fixation. This corresponds to a corrected vergence accuracy of 26.8 ± 28.8 arc sec. This is only slightly worse than the model’s performance on natural images (see Figure 6) and demonstrates that the model generalizes to artificial images it has never seen before. A video of the performance can be found in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56212-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Vergence performance on a randomly generated set of RDS.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Altered rearing conditions cause qualitative changes in neural representations</title><p>A third critical test of any model of the development of binocular vision is whether it can account for the effects of alternate rearing conditions observed in biological experiments. We simulate such alternate rearing conditions by filtering the input images for the left and right eyes with Gaussian filters. The amount of blur was chosen to simulate experiments where animals where exposed to just one single orientation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stryker et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows illustrative examples of the filtered images that were used to train our model and the respective learned RFs. Here, we only depict the 10 RFs that have been selected most often during training for each scale. The full set of all RFs can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>When the model is trained with unaltered natural visual input, the resulting RFs resemble Gabor wavelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daugman, 1985</xref>), as shown in the first row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The changes that are applied to the input images in the alternate rearing conditions are reflected in the RFs that are learned: Among the 10 most often selected RFs there are no vertically (horizontally) oriented RFs, when the model is trained on images that are deprived of vertical (horizontal) edges. Orthogonal RFs emerge as a result of training on orthogonal input. When one eye is deprived of input, the RFs will become <italic>monocular</italic> and encode information coming from the ‘healthy’ eye only. Strabismic rearing results in the development of monocular RFs without a preference for one or the other eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>). In the following sections, we will quantify neurons’ tuning properties for different rearing conditions and compare them to neurophysiological findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neurons’ orientation tuning reflects input statistics</title><p>To analyze the statistics of the developing RFs in greater detail, we fit oriented two-dimensional Gabor wavelets to each RF (see Materials and methods for details).

We combine the results from coarse and fine scale, since a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young, 1977</xref>) did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the distributions of orientation preferences (p-values &gt; 0.18 for all rearing conditions).

This over-representation has been observed in different animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appelle, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Furmanski and Engel, 2000</xref>) and is considered a neural correlate of the <italic>oblique effect</italic>. This phenomenon describes the relative deficiency in participants’ performance in perceptual tasks on oblique contours as compared to the performance on horizontal or vertical contours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appelle, 1972</xref>). It has been argued that it stems from the over-representation of vertical and horizontal edges in natural images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppola et al., 1998</xref>) and reflects the internal model of orientation distribution in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Girshick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burge and Geisler, 2014</xref>).

The binocularity index (BI) is used to assess how responsive a neuron is to inputs from the two eyes. A <italic>binocular</italic> neuron requires input from both eyes to respond maximally, while a <italic>monocular</italic> neuron is mostly driven by just one eye. To determine the binocularity indices for the neurons in our model, we use an adaptation of the original method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref> (see Materials and methods for details). The binocularity index can vary from −1 (monocular left) over 0 (binocular) to +1 (monocular right).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> depicts the binocularity distributions for the coarse and the fine scale for all rearing conditions. The models that were trained on input that is coherent between the left and right eye (top row) exhibit the majority of neurons falling in the bin with binocularity index 0. Neurons in this category receive about the same drive from the left and the right eye. In the <italic>normal</italic> case, more neurons fall into that bin than in the <italic>vertical</italic> and <italic>horizontal</italic> case. This is due to the ability of the model to perform precise vergence control: Since left and right image are almost identical most of the time, the great majority of basis functions will develop to encode the exact same input from both eyes. This, in turn, will result in the cells being completely binocular with a binocularity index of 0. This effect is even more pronounced at the coarse scale, where small residual disparities can no longer be resolved. In the vertical and horizontal rearing case, we observe a reduction in the number of cells that have a binocularity index around 0. We attribute this to the limited vergence performance in these cases, that we will analyse in the next sections.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Binocularity distributions for different rearing conditions.</title><p>The binocularity index ranges from −1 (monocular left) over 0 (binocular) to 1 (monocular right).

This can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for the orthogonal, monocular, and strabismic case. Most cells become monocular, with a symmetric distribution for orthogonal and strabismic rearing. Monocular deprivation of the right eye leads to a distribution of binocularity indices that is biased toward the left eye.</p><p>Comparing our model to biological data, the model’s pronounced peak of bincularity indices close to 0 in the normal case matches experimental findings (Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref> and Figure 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</xref>). Animals trained on inputs deprived of certain orientations (Figure 6B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stryker et al., 1978</xref>) develop more monocular neurons, but most neurons remain binocular. This is in good agreement with our model.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stryker et al., 1978</xref> also reared kittens on orthogonal input and report an increase in monocular neurons (their Figure 6A) when compared to the normal rearing data from Hubel and Wiesel. In comparison to the rearing on horizontal or vertical stripes, there are fewer binocular cells. The loss of binocular neurons that we see in our data is also reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirsch and Spinelli, 1970</xref>, who reared kittens on orthogonal stripes.</p><p>Finally, monocular rearing and the analysis of binocularity was performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>. In their Figures 3 and 5, we see the development of completely monocular cells after visual deprivation of the other eye. The strabismic case was studied a few years later in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hubel and Wiesel, 1965</xref> (their Figure 5A) and revealed a division of the neural population in monocular neurons for either left or right eye, in agreement with our model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Alternate rearing conditions reduce the number of disparity tuned neurons</title><p>A central aspect of the development of binocular vision is the emergence of neurons which are tuned to binocular, horizontal disparities. We therefore investigate how alternate rearing affects the number of neurons with disparity tuning and the distribution of their preferred disparities. We estimate horizontal disparity tuning by considering phase shifts between left and right RFs in the following way: We fit binocular Gabor wavelets to the RFs, where all parameters, except for the phase shift, are enforced to be identical for the left and right monocular RF. The disparity for one neuron can then be calculated as described in Materials and methods. The distribution of disparity tuning of the coarse scale neurons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for the different rearing conditions. Results for the fine scale are comparable and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. First, there is a noticeable difference in the number of cells that are disparity tuned between the different rearing conditions: In the normal case, we find the highest number of disparity tuned cells, rearing in a striped environment reduces the number, and uncorrelated input results in the smallest number of disparity tuned cells. In every case, the distribution of preferred disparities is peaked at zero. The height of this peak is reduced for rearing conditions with in-congruent input to the two eyes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Distributions of neurons’ preferred disparities for different rearing conditions.</title><p>The neurons’ preferred disparities are extracted from the binocular Gabor fits.

Aniseikonia can also be induced as result of the treatment of anisometropia (different refractive powers of the eyes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achiron et al., 1997</xref>). In this scenario, spectacles or artificial lenses are used to correct the refractive power of one or both eyes to create a sharp image in both eyes. However, due to optical magnification this also leads to a difference in the image sizes. When this difference remains small (typically lower than 3%), it can be tolerated by the visual system. Larger values on the other hand lead to problems in fusing the images and a loss of stereopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katsumi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oguchi and Mashima, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achiron et al., 1997</xref>).

For example, when fixating the center of a square, the upper edge of the square will be projected to different vertical positions for the two eyes due to the different sizes of the square in the two eyes. We can measure these vertical disparities in a similar way as we measured the horizontal disparities before (see Analysis of receptive fields). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> shows that the number of neurons tuned to vertical disparities initially increases with growing aniseikonia but then reduces again for 25% of aniseikonia. The key to understanding this phenomenon is considering binocularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and vergence performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>): at 25% aniseikonia, vergence behavior does not develop and many neurons assume monocular RFs. This reduces the total number of neurons which are tuned to vertical disparites. The inverted U-shaped amount of RFs tuned to vertical disparities for increasing amounts of aniseikonia is a testable prediction of the model.</p><p>Interestingly, when looking at the orientation tuning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>, we observe that the number of cells tuned to the <italic>vertical orientation</italic> decreases with increasing aniseikonia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref> for a direct comparison). Since the distribution of orientations in the input images does not change by changing image size, we attribute this change in orientation preference to the model’s (in-)ability to perform accurate vergence movements. As we will elaborate in the next section, the ability to detect different ranges of horizontal disparities results in an abundance of vertically tuned cells. When the visual system looses the ability to detect horizontal disparities and to verge, the number of vertical RFs decreases.</p><p>We also test the effects of a suddenly induced aniseikonia on a fully developed healthy visual system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lovasik and Szymkiw, 1985</xref> induced aniseikonia in healthy subjects and let them perform the Randot and Titmus stereo acuity tests. They found that the stereo acuity diminishes roughly quadratically with the level of aniseikonia. We simulate their experiments by taking a normally trained, healthy model, induce aniseikonia, and test it under the same conditions as before: frozen synaptic weights, novel test stimuli, and a whole range of different object distances and initial vergence errors. We interpret the mean absolute vergence error as the stereo acuity of that model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> shows that the stereo acuity declines approximately quadratically with increasing aniseikonia as observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lovasik and Szymkiw, 1985</xref>. When we correct for the model’s lower visual resolution compared to humans (see Materials and methods), we find that the stereo acuity achieved by the model falls in the typical range of human stereo acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coutant and Westheimer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohr and Read, 2013</xref>). In fact, our model appears to be somewhat more robust against larger values of aniseikonia than human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lovasik and Szymkiw, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atchison et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate that this is due to the absence of an interocular suppression mechanism in our model that may accentuate the effects of aniseikonia on stereo vision in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Model predicts how vergence influences the statistics of orientation preference</title><p>Our model also allows us to investigate, for the first time, how the quality of the vergence control influences the neural representation. As a baseline, we consider the orientation tuning of a reference model which is trained on normal visual input and learns an appropriate vergence policy. For simplicity, we only consider the fine scale in the following. We compare this model to a version that is trained on the same input images, but could not verge the eyes. Specifically, the sparse coder is trained normally, but the RL part is disabled. This model sees different disparities during training by looking at objects at different depths, but is not able to change this distribution of disparities to facilitate the encoding. We refer to this model as the ‘random disparity’ model. In another version of the model, we artificially always set the vergence angle to correctly fixate the objects. In this way, this model is never exposed to non-zero disparities (except for very small ones in the periphery that arise because of slightly different perspectives in the left and right eye). We refer to this version as the ‘zero disparity’ model.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows the fraction of neurons that are tuned to vertical orientations (0 ± 7.5°) for these three models.

This change must be caused by the different distributions of disparities that the models experience due to their different motor behavior, because all other parameters remain unchanged.

Here, we depict a part of an input image at three different disparities. While the horizontal edge can be encoded by the same RF for all disparity values, the vertical edge demands three different RFs to represent the input pattern faithfully. A system that experiences these disparities in its inputs, needs to devote neural resources to represent them all. If the distribution of disparities becomes too wide, however, individual neurons will receive close to independent input from both eyes and disparities that lie in the range that can be represented by a single RF will be rare. This explains the reduction of the number of vertically tuned RFs for very wide disparity distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Intuition for the over-representation of vertical edges when different disparities have to be encoded.</title><p>Top: Input scence with marked input patch.

Over the last decades, the dominant theoretical framework for understanding the development of tuning properties of sensory neurons has been the <italic>efficient coding hypothesis</italic>. It states that sensory tuning properties adapt to the statistics of the sensory signals. In this framework, the behavior of the organism has been largely neglected, however. Specifically, there has been hardly any work on how developing neural tuning properties shape behavior, how the developing behavior affects the statistics of sensory signals, and how these changing statistics feed back on neural tuning properties. We argue that understanding the development of sensory systems requires understanding this feedback cycle between the statistics of sensory signals, neural tuning properties and behavior. The <italic>active efficient coding</italic> (AEC) approach offered here extends classic theories of efficient coding by a behavior component to study this feedback cycle in detail. In AEC, both sensory coding and behavior are adapted to improve the system’s coding efficiency. This coupling of perception and action is also a feature of the general framework of <italic>Active Inference</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Parr and Friston, 2018</xref>). There, motor commands are generated to fulfill sensory predictions, while AEC offers a mechanism to adapt motor commands to improve sensory coding efficiency via reinforcement learning. Interestingly, the presented model does not make use of any efference copy of motor commands to help predict the next sensory input. Evidently, such feedback is not required to learn accurate stereoscopic vision. However, extending our model to incorporate efference copies of motor commands may still be interesting, for example, for the case of calibrating pursuit eye movements, and is left for future work. Interestingly, both AEC and Active Inference have also been linked to higher level cognitive phenomena such as imitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Friston and Frith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Triesch, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have focused on active binocular vision, where a simulated agent autonomously learns to fixate a target object with both eyes via vergence eye movements. All parts of our model self-organize in tandem to optimize overall coding efficiency. We have identified three critical tests that a model of the development of stereoscopic vision should pass and we have demonstrated that the proposed model passes all of them. Specifically, we have shown that (1) our model autonomously self-calibrates, reaching human-like vergence performance when correcting for differences in visual resolution. Second, it handles random dot stereograms, despite having never been exposed to such stimuli. Third, the model reproduces a wide range of findings from animal studies on alternate rearing conditions, which often show dramatic effects on neural representations and behavior. Beyond explaining the experimental findings, our model also predicts systematic changes in the learned vergence behavior in response to altered rearing conditions. In addition, the model predicts that the learning of accurate vergence behavior systematically influences the neural representation and offers a novel explanation for why vertical orientations tend to be over-represented in visual cortex compared to horizontal ones, at least in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Valois et al., 1982b</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yacoub et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). These predictions should be tested in future experiments. For example, in unilaterally enucleated animals, a bias in favor of vertical orientations over horizontal ones may be reduced or completely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frégnac et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>By freezing the neural network after the training period, we also simulated the state of the brain after the critical period. Even after correcting the optical aberrations present during training we observed a reduced vergence performance for all alternate rearing regimes. This finding is in line with a large body of evidence suggesting that optical aberrations should be corrected as early as possible to facilitate healthy development of binocular vision (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daw, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fawcett et al., 2005</xref>, but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding and Levi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While our results qualitatively match experimental findings, there are some quantitative differences. In particular, while the distribution of binocularity indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiesel and Hubel, 1963</xref>) and disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sprague et al., 2015</xref>) in healthy animals are relatively broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Valois et al., 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stevenson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ringach et al., 1997</xref>), we find more narrow ones in our model. These differences are likely due to a number of simplifications present in our model. In the brain, inputs from both eyes into primary visual cortex are organized into ocular dominance bands such that individual cortical neurons may receive input which is already biased toward one or the other eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">LeVay et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowley and Katz, 2000</xref>). In contrast, in our model all neurons receive similar amounts of input from both eyes and are therefore already predisposed for becoming binocular cells. This might explain the model’s narrower distribution of binocularity indices. Regarding the distribution of preferred disparities, animals raised under natural conditions will experience a broad range of disparities in different parts of the visual field, since objects in different locations will be at different distances. In the model, the visual input is quite impoverished, as it is dominated by a single large frontoparallel textured plane. Once this plane is accurately fixated, most parts of the visual field will appear at close to zero disparity. This may explain the narrower distribution of preferred disparities observed in the model.</p><p>Similarly, the distribution of preferred orientations in our model shows a very strong preference for horizontal and vertical, that is accentuated in comparison to biological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Valois et al., 1982b</xref>). Possible reasons for this include the discrete, rectangular pixel grid with which visual inputs are sampled, the choice of our image data base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olmos and Kingdom, 2004a</xref>), which contains mostly man-made structures including buildings, etc., for which it is known that they contain an abundance of horizontal and vertical edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppola et al., 1998</xref>), and the model’s restriction to the central portion of the visual field, where the oblique effect is more pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rothkopf et al., 2009</xref>). To clarify the role of the input images, we repeated the main findings with a random selection of all sections from the McGill Database (Appendix 1) and indeed found that the over-representation of vertical and horizontal orientations is reduced.</p><p>Next to addressing the above limitations, an interesting topic for future work is to use the model to study the development of amblyopia. For this, we have recently incorporated an interocular suppression mechanism, since suppression is considered a central mechanism in the development of amblyopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckmann et al., 2019</xref>). Such models could be a useful tool for predicting the effectiveness of novel treatment methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Papageorgiou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gopal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have presented a computational model that sheds new light on the central role of behavior in the development of binocular vision. The model highlights how stimulus statistics, sensory representation and behavior are all inter-dependent and influence one another and how alternate rearing conditions affect every aspect of this system. The Active Efficient Coding approach pursued here may be suitable for studying various other sensory modalities across species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In the following, we describe the different components of the model, the experimental setup, and the analysis techniques.

Specifically, we chose the man-made section from the McGill Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olmos and Kingdom, 2004a</xref>), because its statistics may resemble the statistics of the indoor environments that a majority of infants grow up in. As a comparison, we repeated our main analysis with a random set of images across all sections of the McGill data base (see Appendix 1).

It also includes an interocular suppression mechanism to capture the role of interocular suppression for the development of amblyopia in children suffering from anisometropia. In the present paper, in contrast, we simulate a large range of alternate rearing conditions used in animal experiments. This allows us to test the AEC approach against a large body of neurophysiological work. For example, we compare neuronal tuning properties observed experimentally with those developing in the model. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of the role of behavior for the development of the statistics of orientation and disparity tuning as well as binocularity. In terms of the model itself, a major difference lies in the utilized reinforcement learning model. While Eckmann et al., (2019) used a very simplistic approach with small numbers of discrete actions for vergence and accommodation control, we here use a more sophisticated continuous action reinforcement learning model and a biomechanical model of the extra-ocular eye muscles, enhancing the realism of the model. Finally, in the current work we also test the model on random dot stereograms (RDSs), the most challenging kind of stereoscopic input and demonstrate that the model can “solve&quot; RDSs, despite never being trained on them. Finally, we also study the phenomenon of aniseikonia and how it interferes with stereoscopic vision. We have brought another expert on board, Maria Fronius, to advise us on various aspects of the development of binocular vision from biological and clinical perspectives. We have clarified all these differences in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The model does not use an explicit prediction of the next sensory input based on an efference copy of the motor command. It turns out that this is not necessary for the system to learn to perform at subpixel accuracy. It is an open question if such a mechanism might speed up learning. In active inference, an agents acts to make sensory inputs match prior expectations. But it is not always clear where these prior expectations come from. We have addressed these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, we are surprised that the study uses a very elaborate simulation system but that you simply show a planar image of a natural image and not a three-dimensional scene.

If different points on a presented object have different distances from the observer, then the correct vergence angle in no longer uniquely defined and we wanted to avoid this. It is important to point out, however, that the model does not require planar objects and we have shown in previous work that AEC models can work well in more complex naturalistic 3D scences [Zhu et al., (2017), Lelais et al., (2019)].</p><p>More detail was added to the Results and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, we do not think that this would provide any deeper insights into the learning processes, on which we are focusing here. Our primary concern is how the receptive fields develop their binocular tuning properties for natural input, how this input and the emerging vergence behavior determine the population statistics of receptive fields and how the neural activities get mapped to appropriate behavior (vergence commands), which in turn changes the input statistics and so forth. Therefore, we think it is better not to clutter the (already long) manuscript with an additional analysis like this, although it could certainly be done if required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also some elements on the bibliography of modeling emergence of binocular disparity (e.g., doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1259-18.2018) are lacking.

Our pooling procedure is analogous to the operation of complex cells that pool responses of multiple simple cells across some region of visual space. This is also similar to approaches that utilize feature histograms to extract position-invariant features, for example to classify objects [Swain and Ballard (1991), Mel (1997)]. In these studies, it is common to normalize the coefficients/features in the histograms to make up for different sampling rates, different lighting conditions, etc. Here, we do not need to normalize the pooled values, because in our case, there is a fixed number of active features (10) per image patch. To clarify all this, we added an explanatory section to the Methods.</p><p>To keep the simplicity of Figure 1, we did not include the pooling procedure here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We have assumed that patching the weak eye results in a boost of the contrast sensitivity after removing the patch. To capture this in our model, we increased the contrast in the deprived eye of a monocularly reared model after normal visual input was reinstated. However, we saw no difference to a model that learned without this contrast adaptation. We can not rule out, however, that this could change if we included an interocular suppression mechanism to the model. We added these new results to the manuscript (see Appendix 2).</p><p>As another clinically relevant aspect, we also added experiments on a common side effect of the treatment of anisometropia: Correction of the refraction differences between the eyes can lead to different magnifications of the input images on the patients' retinas, a condition called aniseikonia. We show that aniseikonia impedes visual development and can lead to a complete loss of binocular function. Interestingly, we also find that the number of cells tuned to vertical disparities increases with increasing aniseikonia (until some degree), which represents another testable prediction of our model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
