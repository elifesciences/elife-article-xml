It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse embryonic stem cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals in a non-linear manner that depends on promoter strength. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>promoter</kwd><kwd>compatibility</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101054449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Ara</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name><name><surname>van Steensel</surname><given-names>Bas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-throughput enhancer-enhancer-promoter reporter assay indicates that pairs of enhancers generally activate promoters in a near-additive manner, and that promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Enhancers: background</title><p>Enhancers are DNA elements, typically a few hundred base pairs long, that bind transcription factors (TFs) and boost the activity of genes in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerji et al., 1981</xref>).

Therefore, it is still unclear what the globally predominant mode of functional interaction is between enhancers, and how this may depend on the target promoter. For this, more scalable approaches are needed. Here, we report such an approach.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Systematic approach</title><p>To systematically assess enhancer-enhancer (EE) interplay and the collective effect on promoter activity, we designed a three-way combinatorial MPRA based on our previous combinatorial reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>).

In particular, the multiplicative model tended to strongly overestimate activities at the higher range of activities (most active enhancers) for most promoters. When focusing on EE combinations for which the multiplicative and additive expected values differ more than 0.5 log<sub>2</sub> units (to limit random noise effects), we found that the multiplicative model matched the observed values better for only 0–17% EE combinations across the seven promoters. Only for the <italic>Ap1m1</italic> promoter the multiplicative and additive models were nearly indistinguishable. This may be due to the low dynamic range of activities observed with this promoter. We note that for the <italic>Fgf5</italic> promoter in the low activity ranges the expected activities were consistently underestimated for both models. It is likely that this is an inaccuracy due to the relative sparseness of the <italic>Fgf5</italic> data (the baseline activity of this promoter was estimated from only 23 measured CC combinations, compared to 219–477 combinations for the other promoters).

These previous studies pointed to a diversity of functional EE interactions, including redundancy, additivity, and synergy. Our study also uncovered a broad spectrum of functional interactions, but simple near-additive effects of EE combinations were predominant, while supra-additive interactions occurred at a lower frequency and were dependent on the specific enhancer and promoter context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Promoters ‘interpret’ and scale EE interplay</title><p>An important finding is that promoters can have substantial impact on supra-additivity of EE interactions. Promoters may thus be seen as ‘interpreters’ of EE combinations. This underscores the importance of studying triple combinations of elements, and perhaps in the future even more complex settings. A salient finding is that the different promoters show different degrees of responsiveness to EE pairs, with the stronger promoters being boosted less than the weaker promoters. The responses of the promoters follow roughly a power-law function of which the exponent is dependent on the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, which are on log-log scale). Because it is not possible to define an absolute measure of enhancer strength, we cannot determine the absolute values of the exponents of the promoter power-law responses. This would be of interest because exponents &lt;1 would lead to ‘diminishing returns’ with higher EE activities, while exponents &gt;1 would correspond to increasing non-linear (see definition of non-linear in Computational methods section) amplification with higher EE activities. The apparent saturation observable at high enhancer activities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> suggests that the exponents are most likely below 1. Our findings resemble those of an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong and Cohen, 2022</xref>), indicating that promoter activities are non-linearly scaled by the genomic environment, with the steepness of the scaling being negatively correlated with promoter strength.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Episomal MPRAs versus genomic context</title><p>The reporters in our MPRA were not integrated into the genome. On the one hand, this ensures that all EEP combinations are tested under similar conditions, without confounding effects of variable chromatin contexts. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the results are not fully representative of a natural chromatin environment. However, other studies have indicated that transiently transfected reporters generally behave quite similar, although not identically, to integrated reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue and Ahituv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2020</xref>), and another study indicated that chromatin context can scale transcriptional activity of inserted reporters in a simple linear manner that is largely independent of the inserted sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maricque et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Results may be biased by model system</title><p>We cannot rule out that our results are biased by our selection of enhancers and promoters, which was mostly focused on genes linked to pluripotency in mouse ESCs.

However, the protocol that we developed for three-way MPRAs should be generally applicable to any set of enhancers and promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Spacing and context of elements</title><p>It should also be considered that in our MPRA the enhancer and promoter elements are placed in fixed positions and close to one another, which does not recapitulate their relative positioning in the genome. Genomic distance and chromatin contexts could act as thresholds for activation, or turn additive interactions into non-linear relationships. For instance, the ability of a <italic>Sox2</italic> enhancer to activate its cognate promoter was found to depend on their distance, following a non-linear decay function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zuin et al., 2022</xref>). The rules for EE interplay may depend on the EE distance or genomic context, as suggested by a recent report indicating that distant pairs of enhancers are more often synergistic than closely spaced enhancers, which tend to act additively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). A recent study reported synergies between E elements in the <italic>Sox2</italic> locus control region (a large compound enhancer region) in the native genomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>). We did not observe such synergies, but the data of that study are not directly comparable to ours due to differences in the size of the elements tested. In the native <italic>Fgf5</italic> locus, several of the E elements exhibited some degree of synergy in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>). However, in mESCs this synergy was not detected, which is in line our results for the same E elements from the <italic>Fgf5</italic> locus. Possibly, the default mode of EE interplay is additive, while the precise chromatin context, element spacing, and cellular state may enable synergy in some genomic loci.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Enhancer-promoter compatibility re-interpreted</title><p>In our previous MPRA study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) we found evidence for selectivity of enhancer-promoter functional interactions (see definition of selectivity in Computational methods section). However, due to the limited number of enhancer-promoter combinations tested we could not fully disentangle what caused these differences in promoter responses. The data from the eight promoters indicate that there are two intermingled factors that account for differences between promoters. First, distinct classes of promoters show different specificities, as illustrated by the poor correlations between the <italic>Ap1m1</italic> housekeeping promoter and the developmental promoters. Second, promoters scale the input they receive from enhancer pairs differently, as discussed above. It is probable that the compatibility differences we observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) are a mix of these two phenomena: (1) promoters that respond differently to enhancers because of specificity, and (2) promoters that respond differently to enhancers because of differences in responsiveness caused by their intrinsic strength.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Relevance of findings and context</title><p>The findings presented here offer insights into two aspects of the gene regulatory process – interplay between enhancers, and promoter integration of the resulting signals – in a more quantitative manner. The near-additivity of enhancers will help us understand how different enhancers may be more or less relevant in different loci. The non-linearity of promoter responsiveness and the effects of promoters on enhancer-enhancer interactions illustrates how some promoters may be more sensitive to activating signals. Thus, it will be useful to quantify promoter responsiveness genome-wide to understand which genes may be more or less sensitive than others to environmental cues or to non-coding mutations. These aspects may be especially relevant for developmentally regulated transcription factors and their target genes, like the ones here studied, as they can be very sensitive to dosage changes (<xref

Mycoplasma contamination was ruled out by monthly tests (#LT07-318; Lonza).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Selection of promoters, enhancers, and controls</title><p>For the construction of the libraries we selected seven developmental genes from the mESC pluripotency regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acampora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Klf2, Sox2, Nanog, Otx2, Lefty1, Ffg5, Tbx3;</italic> and the housekeeping gene <italic>Ap1m1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hounkpe et al., 2021</xref>), which is neighbouring the <italic>Klf2</italic> gene. The promoters of these genes were identified based on transcript and TSS annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frankish et al., 2019</xref>) and overlaps with DHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). We then selected sequences that approximately cover –350 to 50 bp around the TSS.</p><p>The clusters of enhancers were selected in as follows: (1) Clusters of enhancers that were known to regulate the developmental genes (<italic>Nanog, Sox2, Fgf5</italic> clusters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blinka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zuin et al., 2022</xref>). (2) Putative clusters of enhancers in proximity of one of the developmental genes and that overlapped with previously defined super-enhancers (<italic>Lefty1, Tbx3, Otx2</italic> clusters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). (3) A cluster of putative enhancers previously identified by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) to act as enhancers in an MPRA (<italic>Klf2</italic> cluster). (4) Clusters of enhancers identified as putative enhancers of other mESC pluripotency genes for which we did not include their promoters (<italic>Pou5f1</italic> and <italic>Nodal</italic> clusters) and overlapping with previously defined super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hnisz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Clusters of enhancers were divided into single enhancers based on DHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2015</xref>). These single enhancers were then resized to ~450 bp from the centre of DNAse hypersensitivity peaks as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For the library construction we included twenty 450-bp-long randomised control sequences as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). Fifteen of these were based on five DHS peak sequences that were randomly scrambled. The other five controls were randomly generated sequences with the similar GC content as the DHS peak sequences. These control sequences were ordered as synthetic DNA. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> contains the sequences of these controls.</p><p>For single enhancers and promoters we designed PCR primers against the 50 bp ends of each selected element using BatchPrimer3 version 1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">You et al., 2008</xref>). This yielded PCR products of ~400 bp for each element. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> lists the coordinates of all individual enhancers and promoters. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> lists primer sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EEP library generation</title><p>The vector for library construction was previously used for the downstream reporter assay in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). This vector is based on a pSMART backbone. It contains a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame followed by a barcode, and a psiCheck polyadenylation signal (PAS) introduced during barcoding, followed by the cloning site for inserts and a triple polyadenylation site (SV40+bGH+psiCheckPAS).</p><p>Each of the selected eight promoters were amplified by PCR and individually inserted by Gibson assembly (#E2611S; New England Biolabs) into the reporter vector. Each construct was transformed into standard 5-alpha competent bacteria (#C2987; NEB) grown overnight in 500 ml of standard Luria Broth (LB) with 50 mg/ml of kanamycin and purified. Then, each promoter sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing.</p><p>Each of the promoter vectors was then barcoded. Similar to what we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>)<bold>,</bold> we digested 10 µg of each vector with AvrII (#ER1561; Thermo Fisher) and XcmI (#R0533; NEB) and performed a gel-purification. Barcodes were amplified in 10 separate 100 µl PCRs using 5 µl of 10 mM primer 275JvA, 5 ml of 10 mM primer 465JvA, and 1 µl of 0.1 mM template 274JvA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for sequences). 14 PCR cycles were performed using MyTaq Red Mix (#BIO-25043; Bioline), yielding 30 µg of barcodes. We purified barcodes by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Barcodes were digested overnight with 80 units of NheI (#R0131S; NEB) and purified by magnetic bead purification (#CPCR-0050; CleanNA). Each promoter vector and barcodes were then ligated in one 100 µl reaction. In each reaction we used 3 µg of digested vector and 2.7 µg digested barcodes, 20 units NheI (#R0131S; NEB), 20 units AvrII, 10 ml of 103 CutSmart buffer, 10 µl of 10 mM ATP, 10 units T4 DNA ligase (#10799009001 Roche). We performed a cycle-ligation of six cycles (10 min at 22°C and 10 min at 37°C), followed by 20 min heat-inactivation at 80°C. Linear barcoded vectors were purified by magnetic beads and digested for 3 hr with 40 units of XcmI (#R0533S; NEB). Finally barcoded vectors were purified again by gel-purification.</p><p>Single enhancers were amplified by PCR from E14tg2a mESC genomic DNA, then purified with magnetic beads (#CPCR-0050, Clean NA) and quantified by Qubit using dsDNA High sensitivity Qubit kit (#Q33231; Invitrogen). Single enhancers and random controls were combined in approximately equimolar manner. This pool of elements was end-repaired using End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (#ER0720; Epicentre) and self-ligated using Fast-link ligase (LK0750H; Lucigen). Duplets of 800–1000 bp were excised from agarose gel, purified (BIO-52059; Bioline), and A-tailed using Klenow HC 3′ → 5′ exo (#M0212L; NEB).</p><p>The pool of duplets was ligated to each of the barcoded promoter vectors using Takara ligation kit version 2.1 (#6022; Takara). Ligation products were purified using magnetic bead purification and 2 µl of the ligation were electroporated into 20 µl of electrocompetent e. cloni 10G supreme (#60081-1; Lucigen). To estimate the approximate complexity of the resulting libraries, dilutions of the electroporated bacteria were plated for overnight culture and colonies were counted. We aimed at a minimum of 2 million complexity per library in order to have sufficient expected representation of all possible combinations.</p><p>When the estimated complexity of the libraries was not high enough, we amplified the ligation products with primers aligning to the vector. This generated PCR products consisting of the duplets pool and a vector overhang. These PCR products were used for Gibson assembly with the barcoded promoters (#E2611S; NEB). Gibson assembly reactions were purified with magnetic beads and 2 µl of the reaction were electroporated into 20 µl of electrocompetent e. cloni 10G supreme (#60081-1; Lucigen).</p><p>Each library was grown overnight in 500 ml of standard LB with 50 mg/ml of kanamycin and purified using a maxiprep kit (K210016, Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Characterisation of libraries by iPCR and sequencing</title><p>Barcode to insert (enhancer and control duplets) combinations were identified by inverse PCR (iPCR) and Illumina sequencing as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Arensbergen et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, each library was digested overnight with I-CeuI (#R0699S, NEB), barcode-insert fragments were then circularised, remaining linear fragments digested, and barcode-insert fragments were linearised again with I-SceI (#R0694S; NEB). Barcode-insert fragments were then amplified by PCR with Illumina adapters and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform using 150 bp paired-end sequencing. Each library was processed separately and mixed together for sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transfection of libraries</title><p>Each EEP library was transfected separately into E14tg2a mESCs. Per library 20 million cells were nucleofected (5 µg of library and 5 million cells per cuvette, 5 cuvettes) using Amaxa nucleofector II, program A-30, and Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit (#VPH-1001, Lonza). Three biological replicates were performed per library on different days. Cells were collected 24 hr after transfection in 5 ml of TRIsure (#BIO-38032; Bioline) and frozen at –80°C until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>cDNA sequencing</title><p>RNA was extracted and prepared for sequencing as described for the Downstream Assay in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>). From each sample, the aqueous phase containing the total RNA of the TRIsure solution was extracted and purified on an RNA extraction column (#K0732, Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was digested with 10 units of DNase I (#04716728001; Roche) for 30 min in 10-8 10 µl reactions containing 5 µg of RNA. DNase I was inactivated by the addition of 1 µl of 25 mM EDTA and incubation at 70°C for 10 min.</p><p>cDNA was produced in 20 µl reactions (1 per 10 µDNAse reaction) using Maxima Reverse transcriptase (#EP0743; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a gene-specific (targeting the GFP reporter) primer (JvA304, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for sequence). dNTPs and the primer were mixed with the DNAse digested RNA and incubated at 65°C for 5 min. The RT buffer, enzyme, and RNAse inhibitor were added and the reaction was incubated at 50°C for 1 hr. cDNA was then amplified by two nested PCRs to make it strand specific. The first PCR uses index variants of 285JvA (containing the S2, index, and p7 adaptor) and primer 305JvA (targeting the adapter introduced by 304JvA). Each 20 µl RT reaction was amplified in a 100 µl PCR with MyTaq Red mix (#BIO-25043; Bioline). The second PCR was performed using 10 µl of the product of the previous reaction in a 100 µl reaction using the same index variant primer and index variants of 437JvA (containing the S1, index, and p5 adaptor) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for primer sequences). The first PCR was run for 10 cycles and the second one for 8 cycles using the recommended Mytaq Red mix conditions (for both PCRs: 1 min 96°C, then each cycle 15 s 96°C, 15 s 60°C, 15 s 72°C). PCR products were purified with magnetic beads and mixed for sequencing in an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using 100 bp single-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>pDNA sequencing</title><p>Plasmid libraries were processed for sequencing as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) but using dual indexing for sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 platform with 100 bp single-end reads. 1 µg of each plasmid was digested with I-SceI in order to linearise the plasmid. Barcodes were amplified by PCR for 9 cycles from 50 ng of material. Primers and reaction conditions were the same as in the amplification of cDNA.

In brief, iPCR reads from each library were locally aligned using Bowtie (version 2.3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with very sensitive parameters (–very-sensitive-local) on a custom Bowtie genome. This custom Bowtie genome consists of virtual chromosomes that correspond to each of the enhancer and control sequences used to generate the combinatorial libraries. Bam files were processed by a custom Python script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rossum and Drake, 2009</xref>). This script extracts from read 1 the barcode sequence, and the identity and orientation of the DNA fragment in position 1. From read 2 it extracts the identity and orientation of the DNA fragment in position 2. Finally, barcodes were clustered using Starcode (version 1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zorita et al., 2015</xref>) to remove PCR and sequencing errors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>cDNA and pDNA data pre-processing</title><p>For each cDNA and pDNA replicate of each library, barcodes were extracted from single-end reads using a custom Python script that matches the constant region after the barcode.

Any barcode assigned to multiple fragment identities was removed from the data. Per cDNA/pDNA replicate barcode counts were normalised to the total number of barcode counts. Then, activity was calculated per barcode and cDNA replicate as the cDNA:pDNA normalised counts ratio. Per individual duplet combination these normalised activity ratios were averaged across barcodes with a minimum requirement of five barcodes and eight pDNA counts per barcode. The mean activity across the three replicates was calculated as the geometric mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Calculation of boost indices</title><p>In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez-Ara et al., 2022</xref>) we observed that it was critical to use control sequences to estimate the baseline activity of the promoters. For each promoter we used all of the CC combinations to estimate its baseline activity. We calculated this as the median activity across all CC combinations. Then, the boost index of an EE or EC (single enhancer boost index) combination was calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio between the observed activity of this combination and the baseline activity of the promoter. Except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, boost indices were averaged across positions and orientations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> boost indices were averaged across all EC combinations for each enhancer. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> boost indices were averaged across orientations but not positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Selectivity of promoters</title><p>To analyse the selectivity of promoters on single enhancers (enhancer-control-promoter combinations) we used a Welch F-test due to the heteroscedasticity of the data. The test was performed on each of the populations of enhancer-control-promoter combinations. First the data was confirmed to be approximately normal by a Shapiro test, which confirmed that 94.1% of the 439 single enhancers+promoter combinations (that could be tested) show normal distributions (at a 1% FDR).</p><p>Definition of selectivity: We consider selectivity of enhancers and promoters as the differences that lead to an enhancer quantitatively activating some promoters more strongly than others. We prefer the use of selectivity rather than compatibility because compatibility in a biochemical sense is more of an on/off binary descriptor. Therefore, we consider selectivity is a better descriptor of a quantitative difference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Calculation of additive and multiplicative expected activities</title><p>To calculate the expected additive and multiplicative activities we first had to determine three values. The baseline activity of the promoter (A<sub>CCP</sub>) was measured as the median activity across all CC combinations for each promoter. The single enhancer activity estimates (A<sub>E1CP</sub> and A<sub>CE2P</sub>, enhancer in position 1 and position 2, respectively) were calculated as the median activity of all enhancer-control combinations where the enhancer was found in either position 1 (A<sub>E1CP</sub>) or position 2 (A<sub>CE2P</sub>). Therefore,</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A<sub>CCP</sub> = median{A<sub>C1C2P</sub>, A<sub>C1C3P</sub>, …, A<sub>CiCjP</sub>}</p></list-item><list-item><p>A<sub>E1CP</sub> = median{A<sub>E1C1P</sub>, A<sub>E1C2P</sub>, …, A<sub>E1CiP</sub>}</p></list-item><list-item><p>A<sub>CE2P</sub> = median{A<sub>C1E2P</sub>, A<sub>C2E2P</sub>, …, A<sub>CiE2P</sub>}</p></list-item></list><p>Then, for each enhancer-enhancer-promoter combination the expected additive activity was calculated as the sum of the estimated activities of the single enhancers in each position minus the promoter baseline activity (A<sub>E1CP</sub> + A<sub>CE2P</sub> – A<sub>CCP</sub>). The multiplicative expected activity was calculated as the product of the estimated activities of the single enhancers in each position divided by the promoter baseline activity ((A<sub>E1CP</sub> * A<sub>CE2P</sub>)/A<sub>CCP</sub>). For the expected additive activity, the SD of the estimate was propagated as the square root of the sum of the variances of the single measurements. Therefore,</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Expected Additive Activity = (A<sub>E1CP</sub> + A<sub>CE2P</sub> - A<sub>CCP</sub>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expected Multiplicative Activity = (A<sub>E1CP</sub> * A<sub>CE2P</sub>)/A<sub>CCP</sub></p></list-item></list><p>The additive expected activities were then used to calculate log<sub>2</sub>(observed/expected) ratios in order to find supra-additive behaviours between enhancers. To find trends the log<sub>2</sub> ratios were then averaged for each enhancer across EE pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Non-linear promoter responses</title><p>For every EE combination present in all eight libraries we averaged boost indices across the eight promoters. This average enhancer effect was then used to calculate the slope between the average boost index and the observed boost index for each of the promoters. The slopes were calculated using the lm function in R.</p><p>Definition of non-linear: We consider non-linear any relationship between two variables in the linear space where a change of one variable does not correspond to a proportional change in the other variable that follows a linear equation. Therefore, we consider proportional changes in the log-space as non-linear as they arise from non-linear relationships in the linear space.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Libraries generated in this study are available upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>co-founder of enGene Statistics GmbH</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>mm10 genomic coordinates of the regulatory elements tested in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91994-supp1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Sequences of the synthetic controls used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91994-supp2-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Processed and normalised data for all the enhancer-enhancer-promoter (EEP) combinations tested in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91994-supp3-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Sequences of the primers used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91994-supp4-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91994-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw sequencing data and processed data are available at Gene expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE240586.

Using a clever iteration on massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), the authors measure the combinatorial effects of pairs of enhancers on specific promoters.

Also, in Supplementary Figure 4, coloring each point by promoter type would clarify if certain promoters (the weak ones) consistently show higher boost indices across all enhancers. If they do not, the authors may want to speculate how single enhancers can show selectivity for promoters while the effect of adding a second enhancer to an existing E-P has little selectivity.

The authors use an episomal reporter assay which measures the transcriptional output of the reporter under the regulation of an enhancer-enhancer-promoter triple. The authors test all combinations of 8 promoters and 59 enhancers in this assay. There are two main findings: (1) enhancer pairs generally combine additively on reporter output (2) the extent to which enhancers increase reporter output over the promoter (individually and as enhancer-enhancer pairs) is inversely related to the intrinsic strength of the promoter. Both of these findings are interesting and are well supported by the data.</p><p>This study extends previous results on enhancer-promoter combinations to enhancer-enhancer-promoter triples. For example the near equivalence of Fig. 5b and Fig. S7b is intriguing. This experimental design also provides the ability to investigate the notion of selectivity (also commonly referred to as compatibility) between enhancer-enhancer pairs and promoters.</p><p>The authors note many limitations, including the selection of the elements and the size and spacing of the tested elements. Some of the enhancer-enhancer-promoter triples they test were also investigated by a different experimental design in Brosh et al 2023. Brosh et al observed non-additivity between these elements while this study did not. Ultimately we do not know which mechanisms produce the non-additivity that has been observed in native loci and which experimental designs would preserve such mechanisms.</p><p>Overall this is a nice experimental design and a great dataset for probing how enhancers and promoters combine to regulate gene expression. I have no major concerns, but I will try to clarify some methodological points I found confusing.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>The following two comments are meant to help the reader understand the methodology/terminology used in this paper and how it relates to other similar studies.</p><p>The interpretation that &quot;promoters scale enhancer signals in a non-linear manner&quot; is potentially confusing. I believe that the authors use &quot;non-linear&quot; to refer to the slopes (represented by the letter 'b' in Fig. 5b) being not equal to 1. Given how the boost index is defined, this implies the relationship</p><p>Activity of EEP = (Activity of CCP) * (Average Linear Boost)^b</p><p>One potential source of confusion is that the Average Linear Boost term itself depends on the set of promoters that are assayed. Averaging across (many) promoters may alleviate this concern, in which case Average Linear Boost may be considered some form of intrinsic enhancer strength. If so, there is a correspondence between this terminology and the terminology presented in Bergman et al 2022. If b not equal to 1 refers to a non-linear scaling, then the reader may think that b=1 refers to a linear scaling. But if b=1, and the Average Linear Boost term is interpreted as intrinsic enhancer strength, then the equation above implies that the activity of EEP is equal to an intrinsic promoter strength times an intrinsic enhancer strength. This is essentially the relationship that is considered in Bergman et al 2022 and which is referred to in that paper as 'multiplicative'. The purpose of this comment is not to argue for what is the relationship that best explains the data, it is just to clarify the terminology.</p><p>Enhancer-promoter selectivity: As a follow-up to a previous study (Martinez-Ara et al, Molecular Cell 2022) the authors mention that the data in this study also shows that enhancers show selectivity for certain promoters. I found the methodology hard to follow, so this section of the review is meant to guide the reader in understanding how the authors define 'selectivity'. The authors consider an enhancer to be not selective if its 'boost index' is the same across a set of promoters. 'Boost index' is defined to be the ratio of the reporter output with the enhancer and promoter divided by the reporter output with just the promoter. Conceptually, I think that considering the boost index is a reasonable way to quantify selectivity. The authors use a frequentist approach to classify each enhancer as selective or not selective. The null hypothesis is that the boost index of the enhancer is equal across a set of promoters. This can be visualized in Fig. 2C where the null hypothesis is that the mean of each vertical distribution is equal. Note that in Figure S4b of this paper (and in Figure 4B of their 2022 paper) the within-group variance is not plotted. Statistical significance is assessed using a Welch F-test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91994.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Martinez-Ara</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Gene Regulation and Oncode Institute, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Comoglio</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Gene Regulation and Oncode Institute, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Steensel</surname><given-names>Bas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Gene Regulation and Oncode Institute, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews</bold>:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and constructive comments.

The authors use an episomal reporter assay which measures the transcriptional output of the reporter under the regulation of an enhancer-enhancer-promoter triple. The authors test all combinations of 8 promoters and 59 enhancers in this assay. The main finding is that enhancer pairs generally combine additively on reporter output.

The results and data will be of interest to researchers studying enhancers. Given that my expertise is in modeling and computation, I will take the experimental results at face value and focus my review on the interpretation of the results and the computational methodology. I find the result of additivity between enhancers to be well supported. The findings on differential responsiveness between promoters are very interesting but the interpretation of such responses as 'non-linear' or 'following a power-law' may be misleading. More broadly, I think a more rigorous description of the mathematical methodology would increase the clarity and accessibility of this manuscript. A major unanswered question is whether the findings in this study apply to enhancers in their native genomic context. Regardless, investigating such questions in an episomal reporter assay is valuable.</p><p>Main comments</p><p>Applicability to native genomic context: The applicability of the results in this paper to enhancers in their native genomic context is unclear. As the authors state in the discussion section, the reporter gene is not integrated into the genome, the spacing between enhancers does not match their native context etc. It is thus unclear whether this experimental design is able to detect the non-additivity between enhancers which is known to be present in the genome. This could be investigated by testing the enhancer-enhancer-promoter tuples for which non-additivity has been observed in the genome (references are given in the introduction) in this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion, but we chose not to go back to the lab to generate additional data to address this point. Of the cited previous studies, two are comparable to our study because they also used mESCs and included loci that we also studied: Thomas et al. (2021) and Brosh et al. (2023). We now discuss how the findings of these two studies relate to our observations in the Discussion, lines 336-345.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation of promoter responses as non-linear and following a power-law: In Fig 5, the authors demonstrate that enhancer-enhancer pairs boost reporter output more for weak promoters as opposed to strong promoters. I agree the data supports this finding, but I find the interpretation of such data as promoters scaling enhancers according to a power-law (as stated in the abstract) to be misleading. As mentioned on line 297, it is not possible to define an intrinsic measure of enhancer strength, thus the authors assign the base of the power-law to be the average boost index of the enhancer-enhancer pair across the 8 promoters. But this measure incorporates some aspect of a promoter and is not solely a property of enhancers...</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the power-law conclusion in the abstract was too strong; we have rephrased it as &quot;non-linear&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>...It would also be useful to know whether the results in Fig 5 apply to only enhancer-enhancer-promoter triples or also to enhancer-promoter pairs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this EP analysis as new Supplemental Figure S7. Although the statistical power is much lower, this shows very similar trends as the EEP analysis. We briefly report this, lines 275-278.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Enhancer-promoter selectivity: As a follow-up to a previous study (Martinez-Ara et al, Molecular Cell 2022) the authors mention that the data in this study also shows that enhancers show selectivity for certain promoters. The authors mention that both studies use the same statistical methodology and the data in this study is consistent with the data from the 2022 paper. However, I think the statistical methodology in both studies needs further exposition. This section of the review is thus meant to ensure that I understand the author's methodology, to guide the reader in understanding how the authors define 'selectivity', and to probe certain assumptions underlying the methodology.</p><p>My understanding of the approach is as follows: The authors consider an enhancer to be not selective if its 'boost index' is the same across a set of promoters. 'Boost index' is defined to be the ratio of the reporter output with the enhancer and promoter divided by the reporter output with just the promoter. Conceptually, I think that considering the boost index is a reasonable way to quantify selectivity.</p><p>The authors use a frequentist approach to classify each enhancer as selective or not selective. The null hypothesis is that the boost index of the enhancer is equal across a set of promoters. This can be visualized in Fig. 2C where the null hypothesis is that the mean of each vertical distribution is equal. Note that in Figure S4 of this paper (and in Figure 4B of their 2022 paper) the within-group variance is not plotted. Statistical significance is assessed using a Welch F-test. This is a parametric test that assumes that the observations within each vertical distribution in Fig 2C are normally distributed (this test does allow for heteroskedasticity - which means that the variance may differ within each vertical distribution). Does the normality assumption hold? This analysis should be reported. If this assumption does not hold, is the Welch test well calibrated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested the normality of all of the single enhancer + promoter combinations that were tested using the welch F-test. 94.1% of the 439 single enhancers + Promoter combinations show normal distributions (at a 1% FDR). We have added this to the methods section of the revised manuscript. Apart from this, non-normality has little to no influence on the Welch F-test performance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.198">https://rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.198</ext-link>). Therefore, the use of the Welch F-test to score enhancer selectivity on these data is valid. Apart from this, we agree that a simple binary classification of selective vs non-selective is not descriptive enough for these kinds of data. We addressed this in our previous publication by exploring the relationship between selectivity and enhancer strength. However, in the objective in this publication was solely to show that this new dataset follows similar selectivity patterns to our previous publication. Furthermore, our analysis on the non-linearity of promoter response is a more quantitative continuation on the analysis on selectivity as this is probably one of the major contributors to enhancer selectivity. This was probably present in our previous paper but could not be analyzed as there were less combinations per promoter.</p><p>For further clarity, we have now highlighted the individual promoters in Figure S4 by colors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I found this to be an interesting manuscript and am glad this experiment was conducted. As I wrote in my public review, I think that clarifying the computational methods/ideas would really help. I also think it would be helpful to properly define the terms that are being used. For example, this manuscript uses the terminology cooperativity and synergy. Are these meant to be synonymous with supra-addivity?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. The revised manuscript no longer uses the word “cooperativity”. We now use “supra-additivity” when describing our data, and “synergy” as biological interpretation. In the Introduction we now clarify this distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on enhancer selectivity:</p><p>In the public review, I have given comments on the statistical methodology employed to assess enhancer selectivity. On a more subjective note, I'm not convinced that a frequentist approach to a binary classification of 'selective' vs 'not selective' is that useful here. I think it would be more useful to report an 'effect size' of the extent to which an enhancer is selective and to study the sources of this effect size. I think you've tried to do this in lines 329-339 of the discussion but I think the exposition could be clearer.</p><p>Figure S4B may suggest how to do this. It appears that the distribution of boost indices for a given enhancer is trimodal (this is most obvious for the stronger enhancers on the top of the plot). Is it the case that each mode (for each enhancer) consists of the same set of promoters? I think what is implied by Figure 5B is that the stronger promoters are not boosted as much as the weaker promoters. So does the leftmost mode consist of Ap1m1, the middle mode consist of Klf2/Otx2/Nanog, and the rightmost mode of Sox2/Fgf5/Lefty1/Tbx3? If so, I would recommend emphasizing this in the text/figure and clarifying how this relates to selectivity. It seems that the chain of logic is as follows: (1) We define an enhancer to be selective if its boost indices across a set of promoters are not the same. (2) We generally observe that stronger promoters get boosted less than weaker promoters. (3) Thus selectivity arises due to differences in intrinsic strengths of the promoter. I think this is what is being implied in lines 329-339 of the discussion, but it took me multiple readings to understand this and I'm not convinced the power-law explanation is justified (see public review).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this paragraph of the Discussion (now lines 350-359).</p><p>Regarding the power-law: in the Results we state “<italic>roughly</italic> a power-law function”. We have removed the power-law claim from the abstract, that conclusion as phrased was indeed too firm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reference to Zuin et al</p><p>Lines 323 - 325: A reference is made to the data from Zuin et al &quot;following approximately a power-law&quot;. What data in Zuin et al does this statement refer to? I do not believe the authors in Zuin et al claim that the relationship between GFP intensity and enhancer-promoter distance (Figure 1h,i from Zuin et al) follows a power law. It is certainly non-linear, but I have taken a look at this data myself and do not find it follows a power-law. Please either explain this further and rigorously justify the claim or adjust the wording accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point, in the discussion of Zuin et al we have replaced “power law” with “non-linear decay function”</p></body></sub-article></article>
