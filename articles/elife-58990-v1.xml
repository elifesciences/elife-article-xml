cells (MSCs) occupy perivascular spaces. Profiling human adipose perivascular mesenchyme with antibody arrays identified 16 novel surface antigens, including endolysosomal protein CD107a. Surface CD107a expression segregates MSCs into functionally distinct subsets. In culture, CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells demonstrate high colony formation, osteoprogenitor cell frequency, and osteogenic potential. Conversely, CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells include almost exclusively adipocyte progenitor cells. Accordingly, human CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells drove dramatic bone formation after intramuscular transplantation in mice, and induced spine fusion in rats, whereas CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells did not. CD107a protein trafficking to the cell surface is associated with exocytosis during early adipogenic differentiation. RNA sequencing also suggested that CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells are precursors of CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells. These results document the molecular and functional diversity of perivascular regenerative cells, and show that relocation to cell surface of a lysosomal protein marks the transition from osteo- to adipogenic potential in native human MSCs, a population of substantial therapeutic interest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perivascular stem cell</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Within mammalian white adipose tissue (WAT), a perivascular population of mesenchymal progenitor cells is well documented with respect to multipotency and tissue renewal capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corselli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramann et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of human WAT-resident perivascular cells to differentiate into bone-forming osteoblasts and incite or participate in bone repair is also well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askarinam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2012c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016</xref>) (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">James et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">James and Péault, 2019</xref>) for reviews). The bulk of WAT-resident perivascular cells with mesenchymal progenitor cell attributes reside in the <italic>tunica adventitia</italic> – the outer collagen-rich sheath of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corselli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">West et al., 2016</xref>). Microvascular pericytes, although less frequent in absolute numbers, also demonstrate progenitor cell attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crisan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>). With several recent studies from our group in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardy et al., 2017</xref>) and mouse WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), it is clear that perivascular cells, including those found within the <italic>tunica adventitia</italic> (adventitial cells or adventicytes), demonstrate more phenotypic and functional diversity than previously understood.</p><p>CD107a (lysosome-associated membrane protein-1, LAMP1) is a member of a family of structurally related type one membrane proteins predominantly expressed in lysosomes and other intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlsson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Saint-Vis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defays et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramprasad et al., 1996</xref>). CD107a is far less frequently expressed on the cell surface, which is the result of both trafficking of nascent protein to the plasma membrane as well as the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akasaki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dell'Angelica et al., 2000</xref>). In inflammatory cells, surface CD107a reflects the state of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janvier and Bonifacino, 2005</xref>) and has been implicated in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kannan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2013</xref>). In separate reports, CD107a has been described in intracellular vesicles in both osteoblasts and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bandeira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Solberg et al., 2015</xref>), yet beyond this, essentially nothing is known regarding CD107a in mesenchymal stem cell fate or differentiation decisions.</p><p>Here, antibody array screening of FACS-defined stromal vascular fraction (SVF) perivascular cells identified several novel cell surface antigens, including CD107a, enriched within subpopulations of human adventicytes and pericytes. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that cells with membranous surface CD107a expression reside in a perivascular microanatomical niche within WAT. CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells represent an adipocyte precursor cell, while CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells represent progenitors with increased osteoblast potential. CD107a trafficking to the cell surface was observed to occur during early adipocyte differentiation – results confirmed by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mouse and human adipose tissues. Upon transplantation into immunocompromised rodents, CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells robustly induce bone formation, both in an intramuscular ectopic ossicle assay in mice and a lumbar spine fusion rat model. These results suggest that cell surface CD107a divides osteoblast from adipocyte perivascular precursors within human tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CD107a as a novel cell surface antigen expressed among adipose tissue (AT)-resident perivascular stem cells</title><p>To identify new markers that may define subsets of perivascular cells, a cell surface antigen screen (Lyoplate) was performed on previously defined perivascular cell fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2012c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), including CD34<sup>+</sup>CD146<sup>-</sup> adventitial cells and CD146<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>-</sup> pericytes after exclusion of non-viable, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells (PI<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> or CD45<sup>+</sup> fractions) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Several markers were confirmed to be highly expressed among both adventicytes and pericytes, including, for example, the progenitor cell and MSC marker CD90 (Thy-1) and the perivascular cell antigen CD140b (PDGFRβ).

Microvascular pericytes were first recognized to include such progenitors since they grow into mesenchymal stem cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>). The outermost layer enwrapping arteries and veins, or <italic>tunica adventitia</italic>, that used to be considered as a mere fibroblast-populated collagen sheath anchoring vessels within tissues, is also home to presumptive MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corselli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramann et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have used an antibody array targeting all human CD surface markers to identify several novel antigens expressed by human adipose tissue-resident perivascular cells. We found, among other surface antigens, that CD107a, aka LAMP-1, is expressed at the surface of subsets of adventitial cells and pericytes, which was confirmed in terms of gene expression on RNA sequencing libraries, and corroborated by immunohistochemistry, surface CD107a being co-expressed with canonical markers of pericytes and adventitial cells. Further, flow cytometry analysis of the total stromal vascular fraction extracted from adipose tissue showed a continuum of non-endothelial, non-hematopoietic CD107a expressing cells that could be gated back to pericytes and adventitial cells. Altogether, these results confirmed unequivocally that surface CD107a/LAMP-1, used generally as a marker of NK cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryceson et al., 2005</xref>), is present on subsets of human MSC-related perivascular cells, and established the conditions for the purification of these cells by flow cytometry.</p><p>Albeit not described before at the surface of human pericytes and other perivascular cells, CD107a has been earlier detected on human bone marrow and dental conventionally cultured MSCs, where it binds the enamel matrix protein amelogenin and in turn induces cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Besides, CD146<sup>+</sup>CD107a<sup>+</sup> human bone marrow MSCs have been recently described as endowed with the highest immunomodulatory and secretory, hence therapeutic, potential in experimental joint inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowles et al., 2019</xref>). Besides suggested association of surface CD107a with progenitor cell proliferation and immunomodulation related tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), lysosomal CD107a has also been linked to neural stem cell potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that surface expression of CD107a divides adipocyte- from osteoblast precursors within human perivasculature. Adipocyte progenitor distribution was virtually confined to the CD107a<sup>high</sup> cell subset; in agreement, adipogenic potential in culture was restricted to this cell compartment. However, knockdown of CD107a in ASCs slightly promoted adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that CD107a can be used for identification of functionally relevant subsets, which is likely not explained by intrinsic function of CD107a protein. CD107a is thought to be responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eskelinen, 2006</xref>). Lysosomes provide the degradative enzymes for autophagy and are involved in autophagy regulation, primarily through its relationship with the master kinase complex, mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mrschtik and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yim and Mizushima, 2020</xref>). Therefore, CD107a may also play an essential role in autophagy, which itself has been shown crucial for adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). Whether CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells enhance adipogenesis by promoting autophagy is an interesting and worthy follow-up topic. Conversely, osteogenic ability in vitro was almost totally restricted to purified CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells, which also exhibited the highest CFU-F potential. We confirmed the exclusive bone-forming potential of CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells in vivo, in situations of ectopic intramuscular ossification and lumbar spine fusion. Thus, CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells likely represent a more progenitor cell, while CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells are a more mature, differentiated cell population. Similar results are found in the hematopoietic system, where the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells are Thy-1<sup>low</sup>, whereas Thy-1<sup>high</sup> cells belong to a well-defined blood cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spangrude et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>The natural function of these ubiquitous perivascular mesenchymal progenitor cells remains a dominant, yet unanswered question. While subsets of mouse pericytes are known, in contexts of experimental disease or injury, to give rise in situ to white adipocytes, follicular dendritic cells, myoblasts, and myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dellavalle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dulauroy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krautler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2008</xref>), the osteogenic and chondrogenic potentials present in these microvascular cells are unlikely to be ever used in the turnover and repair of soft tissues. On the other hand, a contribution to blood vessel pathologic remodeling of perivascular presumptive MSCs has been recognized, as osteoblast and smooth muscle cell forerunners for calcific arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramann et al., 2016</xref>). How such pathogenic side effects exerted by perivascular progenitors are counterbalanced by beneficial contributions to tissue homeostasis is not known, but might be related to differential recruitment of uni- or multipotent progenitors, as well as activation in these cells of mechanisms independent of cell differentiation such as growth factor production or cell contact-mediated immunomodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pittenger et al., 2019</xref>). A precise phenotypic and functional characterization of perivascular progenitor cells is a requisite for the understanding of the role of these cells in developmental, regenerative, and pathophysiologic processes. In particular, unwrapping the intrinsic heterogeneity of these cells is a prioritized, ongoing process.</p><p>Although abundant evidence of the osteogenic potential of perivascular cells exists in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askarinam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corselli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">James et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">James and Péault, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2012c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), there is recent proof that this competence is restricted to discrete cell subsets. For instance, CD10 expression marks a subset of human adipose tissue adventitial cells with higher bone-forming potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2019</xref>), and the highest calcification potential is attributed to mouse adventitial cells co-expressing CD34 and PDGFRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, human perivascular cells expressing the ROR2 Wnt receptor exhibit stronger chondrogenic ability than ROR2 negative counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the concept is emerging of a developmental micro-heterogeneity of perivascular cells, the surrounding niches being suggested to host a whole hierarchy of mesenchymal progenitor cells already documented to include adipocyte-, chondrocyte-, and osteoblast progenitors. Although the data herein were obtained on abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, our preliminary results indicate that the same cell partition can be achieved in other fat depots. Moreover, we have observed the same restriction of adipogenic and osteogenic potentials, respectively, to CD107a<sup>high</sup> and CD107a<sup>low</sup> perivascular cells sorted from the human placenta, which suggests the broad and possibly ubiquitous distribution of these functionally distinct subpopulations. Strikingly, these tissues are not natural sites of ossification, which raises the recurring question of the physiologic significance of these unrelated developmental potentials. It is conceivable that mesodermal cell turnover and regeneration in adult tissues be mediated exclusively by multipotent, MSC like cells, irrelevant potentials in a given tissue being always repressed. It is more difficult to justify that progenitors committed to a given cell compartment be maintained in a tissue devoid of this very cell lineage, such as osteogenic dedicated progenitors in adipose tissue, at the expense of adipogenic cells. Since the hypothesis that these unrelated progenitors can be mobilized through blood circulation to drive regeneration in other organs is not supported for the moment, we can only speculate that such atypical differentiation potentials are irreversibly associated with other tissue repair mechanisms of broader applicability, which remain to be identified. Further characterization of the role of CD107a at the cell surface may contribute to clarifying this issue.</p><p>Our in vitro studies, coupled with single-cell transcriptomics, suggest that CD107a, an endolysosome transmembrane protein, traffics to the cell surface during early adipogenesis, suggesting a specific function in this cell lineage. Future studies will tell whether CD107a/LAMP-1, a unique novel marker of the perivascular mesenchymal stem cell hierarchy, will also shed light on the tissue regeneration mechanisms initiated in this niche.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Immunohistochemistry and microscopy</title><p>All human tissues were obtained under Johns Hopkins University institutional IRB approval with a waiver of informed consent.

Trajectory plots were generated in Monocle (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_018685">SCR_018685</ext-link>) as previously described. For exocytosis pathway activation, a gene list of exocytosis activating/promoting genes was generated from the previously annotated KEGG pathway. Gene lists were filtered for genes that met the Monocle cutoff criteria as an expressed gene (expressed in a minimum of 10 cells). Expression levels were normalized first for individual cell UMI counts, then to the average gene expression across the whole sample population. This normalized expression across pseudotime was displayed following average with nearest neighbors. Values above one indicate enriched expression of genes associated with exocytosis while values below one indicate expression below population averages. Pathway analyses were conducted on CD107a<sup>low</sup> and CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells from bulk RNA-seq experiments, as well as on early- and late-expressing, pseudotemporally-regulated genes derived from scRNA-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Osteogenic differentiation assay and ALP/Alizarin red staining</title><p>For osteogenic differentiation, cells were seeded at the density of 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/ml in 12- or 24-well plates. Upon confluency, medium was changed to osteogenic differentiation medium, composed of DMEM, 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, with 50 μM ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).

A DBX putty (courtesy of Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, NJ) was used for ectopic bone formation in mice. Briefly, CD107a<sup>low</sup> or CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells derived from the same human WAT sample at passage five were prepared at a density of 3 million total cells in 40 μl PBS and mechanically mixed with 45 mg DBX putty. DBX alone was used as an acellular control. The cell preparation was then implanted intramuscularly into the thigh muscle pouch of 8-week-old male NOD-SCID mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:001303">IMSR_JAX:001303</ext-link>, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2012c</xref>). Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and premedicated with buprenorphine. Incisions in the hindlimbs were made, and pockets were cut in the biceps femoris muscles by blunt dissection, parallel to the muscle fiber long axis. Dissection methods and the surgical manipulation of tissues were kept as constant as possible across animals. The muscle and skin were each closed with 4–0 Vicryl*Plus sutures (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Blue Ash, OH). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for an outline of animals per experimental group. Surgical implantations and subsequent analyses were performed blinded to treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Lumbar spine fusion</title><p>Posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion was performed on 23-week-old male athymic rats (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2312499">RGD_2312499</ext-link>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Posterior midline incisions were made over the caudal portion of the lumbar spine, and two separate fascial incisions were made 4 mm bilaterally from the midline. L4 and L5 lumbar spines were exposed by blunt muscle splitting technique and decorticated using a low speed burr and micro-drill (Roboz Surgical Instrument Co., Gaithersburg, MD). Next, DBX (300 μl per side) mixed with CD107a<sup>low</sup> or CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells from the same AT sample (1.5 million cells, P3-5 passage) or DBX alone were implanted between the transverse processes bilaterally into the paraspinal muscle bed. Finally, the fasciae and skin were each closed using continuous suture (4–0 Vicryl*Plus, Ethicon Endo-Surgery). In vivo imaging was performed by a combination X-ray/DXA (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, AZ) at 0, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Rats were sacrificed 8 weeks after surgery, and the spines were harvested for further analysis.

For intramuscular implants, scans were obtained at an image resolution of 15 μm with a 1 mm of aluminum filter (X-ray voltage of 65 kVP, anode current of 153 uA, exposure time of 218 ms). For spine fusion samples, scans were obtained at an image resolution of 22 μm with a 1 mm of aluminum filter (X-ray voltage of 55 kVP, anode current of 181 uA, exposure time of 218 ms). NRecon software (SkyScan, Bruker) was used to reconstruct images from the 2D X-ray projections. For the 3D morphometric analyses of images, CTVox and CTAn were used (SkyScan, Bruker). For muscle pouch implantation and spine fusion analysis, volumes of interest were shaped to encompass all the implant and exclude native bone, with a threshold value of 65.</p><p>After radiographic imaging, samples were transferred to 14% EDTA for decalcification for 28–60 d. Samples were then embedded in OCT for cryosectioning at 18 μm thickness. H and E and ALP staining were performed on serial sections (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase Kit, Sigma-Aldrich). For immunofluorescent staining, sections were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 hr at 25° C. Antigen retrieval was performed by trypsin enzymatic antigen retrieval solution (ab970; Abcam) for 10 min at 25° C.

usefulness of CD170a as a surrogate marker to distinguish between osteoblast precursors and adipocytes within the human perivascular tissue. The authors have clearly demonstrated the osteogenic potential of CD107a<sup>low</sup> expressing cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, they have carefully and thoroughly addressed the reviewer suggestions and made appropriate amendments in the revised paper.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yuji Mishina (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study James et al. have performed extensive analysis of CD107a expression in ASCs and determined that CD107a<sup>low</sup> expressing cells exhibit osteogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. While all three reviewers are in agreement that the manuscript is well written and the establishment that CD107a serves as a surrogate marker to distinguish between adipogenic and osteogenic human ASCs would provide an important contribution to the field, they also have raised a number of questions (see below) that relate to the role of CD107a in cell fate. The reviewers and the editors realize the difficulty in performing the suggested additional in vivo bone regeneration experiments in a timely manner due to current Covid19 situation. However, the authors could use the in vitro model system to complement in vivo data to provide additional data to support the claims made in the paper. For example, the CD107a knockdown experiments using purified populations would provide more convincing data for direct involvement of CD107a in cell fate specification (or just an innocent bystander). Please consider clarifying some aspects noted below that were raised in the reviewer comments without additional experiments.</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Peault B et al. claim that the cell surface expression of lysosomal associated protein-1 (LAMP1 or CD107a) serves as a surrogate marker to distinguish between osteogenic and adipogenic human adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs).</p><p>Using BD Lyoplate assay, authors identified CD107a as a cell surface protein differentially expressed between pericytes (CD146<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>-</sup>) and adventicytes (CD146<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>). Authors recently demonstrated that these cells work together in bone formation (Wang et al., 2019). In this paper, authors show that CD107a<sup>low</sup> ASC are more osteogenic relative to CD107<sup>high</sup> cells, whereas the latter is more adipogenic than the former in vitro. in vitro experiments further demonstrate that CD107 cell surface expression is induced during adipogenesis. Gene silencing of CD107, however, does not interfere with adipogenic potential of ASCs. Consistent with in vitro findings, CD107a<sup>high</sup> ASCs demonstrate highly osteogenic potential in ectopic bone formation and spinal fusion mouse models.</p><p>The potential significance of CD107a as a surrogate marker to enrich adipogenic ASCs is shown in vitro and the functional impact of CD107a<sup>low</sup> ASCs in bone formation in vivo was well documented in this paper. However, the biological significance of lysosomal trafficking in ASCs is unclear.</p><p>1) Increased CD107a expression on the cell surface may simply reflect increased exocytosis process in differentiating preadipocytes. A subset of ASCs might be resistant to adipogenesis, which results in reduced CD107a expression on cell surface. From this study alone we do not know whether the intrinsic ability of lysosomal trafficking confers adipogenic versus osteogenic capacity of ASCs. Addressing the functional significance of lysosomal trafficking in adipogenesis may help us better understand the cellular mechanism of human ASC differentiation.</p><p>2) In vivo experiment of ectopic bone formation or bone fusion did not compare CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells versus unsorted ASCs. If the focus of this paper is to use CD107a to enrich osteogenic ASCs for bone regeneration, comparing between enriched and unsorted cell populations will be needed.</p><p>3) Adipogenic potential of CD107a<sup>high</sup> ASCs in vivo is not shown; as such, the in vivo significance of CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells is unclear.</p><p>4) As discussed, developmental and pathological significance of CD107a in ASCs is unclear unless authors demonstrate the cell surface expression of this lysosomal protein in development and certain disease process, such as obesity.</p><p>5) Increased expression of CD107a in pericytes (CD146<sup>+</sup>) relative to adventicytes (CD34<sup>+</sup>) is intriguing. As the roles of pericytes versus fibroblasts in adipogenesis during development and in obesity are actively investigated at least in mice (1, 2), comparing the adipogenic potential of human pericytes relative to adventicytes may help us better understand human adipose tissue biology.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Hepler C, Shan B, Zhang Q, Henry GH, Shao M, Vishvanath L, Ghaben AL, Mobley AB, Strand D, Hon GC, Gupta RK.

CD107a<sup>low</sup> and CD107a<sup>high</sup> AT-derived stromal cells represent osteoblast and adipocyte precursor cells, respectively. They also confirmed human CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells drive dramatic bone formation using two mouse models. They demonstrated that CD107a correlates with exocytosis during early adipogenic differentiation, rather than having vital function in cellular differentiation.

However, I have several comments that will require further attention:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors mentioned the basic function of CD107a (Lamp1) marker as a lysosomal membrane protein. However, they did not mention its important role in autophagy, which should be included as it can make relevant explanation for their observation as the process of autophagy is crucial for regulation of adipogenesis (DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00193-13). The authors should add this information as it can be further discussed in relation to their findings.</p><p>2) Regarding the expression profile of CD107a in human adipose tissue, did the authors check the proportion of the cells and cell types with CD107a expression to identify the heterogeneity of the cells expressing this surface marker in AT and also if it correlates with number of lysosomes or their state of the activation?</p><p>3) Further, the authors mentioned that CD107a distinguish between AD and OB progenitors among MSC derived from AT. Did the authors check the expression profile of CD107a during AD and OB differentiation if its expression profile changes during these processes? They should add these data and comment on it in relation to CD107a function in MSC. Also, if there are known other factors e.g. inflammatory/metabolic molecules (e.g. TNFa, TGFb, or lipids) that could stimulate expression of CD107a?</p><p>4) Regarding the source of human AT samples, the authors should add the information on the age and BMI or possible medication used in the subjects as these are the major factors that can affect the quality and cellular composition of the tissue.</p><p>5) For the cell sorting, how stable was the expression of CD107a after sorting in the culture, did the CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> cells maintain their difference in CD107a expression through the passaging? It is very common that MSC after sorting change their expression profile through the sub-culturing. The authors should add these data and comment on them.</p><p>6) Did the authors measure proliferation rate of CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> expressed cells?

While all three reviewers are in agreement that the manuscript is well written and the establishment that CD107a serves as a surrogate marker to distinguish between adipogenic and osteogenic human ASCs would provide an important contribution to the field, they also have raised a number of questions (see below) that relate to the role of CD107a in cell fate. The reviewers and the editors realize the difficulty in performing the suggested additional in vivo bone regeneration experiments in a timely manner due to current Covid19 situation. However, the authors could use the in vitro model system to complement in vivo data to provide additional data to support the claims made in the paper. For example, the CD107a knockdown experiments using purified populations would provide more convincing data for direct involvement of CD107a in cell fate specification (or just an innocent bystander). Please consider clarifying some aspects noted below that were raised in the reviewer comments without additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for this suggestion. To further pursue this, we examined CD107a knockdown in FACS isolated CD107a<sup>low</sup> and CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells. Our results showed that knockdown of CD107a in CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells slightly promoted adipogenic differentiation, which was in similarity to unsorted cells. In CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells, knockdown had no effect (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 4P, Q). We speculate that as CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells have <sup>high</sup> intrinsic adipogenic potential, the effects of knockdown were not apparent in this group. In aggregate, these data suggest that CD107a is a marker (or innocent bystander), rather than directly involved in cell fate specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Peault B et al. claim that the cell surface expression of lysosomal associated protein-1 (LAMP1 or CD107a) serves as a surrogate marker to distinguish between osteogenic and adipogenic human adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs).</p><p>Using BD Lyoplate assay, authors identified CD107a as a cell surface protein differentially expressed between pericytes (CD146<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>-</sup>) and adventicytes (CD146<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>). Authors recently demonstrated that these cells work together in bone formation (1). In this paper, authors show that CD107a<sup>low</sup> ASC are more osteogenic relative to CD107<sup>high</sup> cells, whereas the latter is more adipogenic than the former in vitro. in vitro experiments further demonstrate that CD107 cell surface expression is induced during adipogenesis. Gene silencing of CD107, however, does not interfere with adipogenic potential of ASCs. Consistent with in vitro findings, CD107a<sup>high</sup> ASCs demonstrate highly osteogenic potential in ectopic bone formation and spinal fusion mouse models.</p><p>The potential significance of CD107a as a surrogate marker to enrich adipogenic ASCs is shown in vitro and the functional impact of CD107a<sup>low</sup> ASCs in bone formation in vivo was well documented in this paper. However, the biological significance of lysosomal trafficking in ASCs is unclear.</p><p>1) Increased CD107a expression on the cell surface may simply reflect increased exocytosis process in differentiating preadipocytes. A subset of ASCs might be resistant to adipogenesis, which results in reduced CD107a expression on cell surface. From this study alone we do not know whether the intrinsic ability of lysosomal trafficking confers adipogenic versus osteogenic capacity of ASCs. Addressing the functional significance of lysosomal trafficking in adipogenesis may help us better understand the cellular mechanism of human ASC differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. As you point out, it is likely that increased CD107a expression reflects increased exocytosis process in differentiating preadipocytes. In our past observations, CD107a knockdown led to a modest but significant increase in adipogenesis. To further expand on these results, adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was performed with Vac-1 treatment, the inhibitor of exocytosis which we previously observed prevented CD107a translocation to the cell membrane. Consistent with siRNA knockdown results, Vac-1 treatment also led to a modest increase in adipogenic differentiation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These results, along with new siRNA experiments using CD107a<sup>low</sup> and <sup>high</sup> cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 4P, Q), suggest that partitioning allows for identification of functionally relevant subsets which is likely not explained by intrinsic function of CD107a protein. Changes to the Discussion to make this point more clear have been added (second paragraph).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of exocytosis with Vacuolin-1 moderately promotes adipogenic differentiation of human ASCs.</title><p>(A) Oil red O (ORO) staining (left) and photometric quantification (right) at d7 of adipogenic differentiation with or without Vacuolin-1 treatment (Vac-1, 1 μM).

If the focus of this paper is to use CD107a to enrich osteogenic ASCs for bone regeneration, comparing between enriched and unsorted cell populations will be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion. The main focus of the paper was to better understand the cellular heterogeneity of human progenitor cells within the perivascular niche. As pointed out by the editor, timely additional in vivo experiments are not currently feasible due to COVID19 related shutdowns in our area. However, we agree that the future use of CD107a cell subsets for tissue engineering efforts in the bone or fat field would require clear evidence of improvement in comparison to unsorted ASCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Adipogenic potential of CD107a<sup>high</sup> ASCs in vivo is not shown; as such, the in vivo significance of CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent point. From our data and across 8 patient samples, we did find that CD107a<sup>high</sup> stromal cells represent adipocyte precursor cells in vitro. Just as perivascular cells in PDGFRA<sup>1</sup> or PDGFRB<sup>2</sup> reporter animals have been observed to replenish adipocytes among either homeostasis or high fat diet conditions, it is quite possible that CD107a-expressing perivascular cells perform a similar function in vivo. Our studies are confined to human tissues, and future studies examining the dynamic cell fate of CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells would need to be performed in the mouse in the context of lineage tracing. Of note, we did return to our muscle pouch and spine fusion assays and performed Oil red O staining to look for frank adipocytes within these tissues. No definite adipocytes were observed across any samples, suggesting that these particular carriers are not permissive to adipocyte formation. Future tissue engineering studies with CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells for adipose tissue formation are indeed needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As discussed, developmental and pathological significance of CD107a in ASCs is unclear unless authors demonstrate the cell surface expression of this lysosomal protein in development and certain disease process, such as obesity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good point. Mice deficient in either CD107a or CD107b are viable and fertile. However, mice deficient in both CD107a and CD107b have an embryonic lethal phenotype. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mutual disruption of both CD107s is associated with an increased accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and unesterified cholesterol<sup>3</sup>. In our preliminary data, CD107b is also expressed in the human adipose stromal cells. However, using FACS we found that only a small fraction of cells (0.39% in total ASCs) co-expressed surface CD107a and CD107b, making functional redundancy of these proteins in ASCs less likely. Any link between CD107a/CD107b and either obesity or a skeletal phenotype in mouse or humans is not known. In pilot studies, we did examine CD107a expression in a tissue microarray of healthy and diseased human coronary arteries. Although still preliminary data, adventitial and plaque associated CD107a immunostaining was present, particularly in diseased vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). It remains to be seen the extent to which CD107a-expressing adventitial cells are involved in pathologic vascular remodeling.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>CD107a immunohistochemical staining in human atherosclerotic vessel.</title><p>CD107a positive staining appears red.

As the roles of pericytes versus fibroblasts in adipogenesis during development and in obesity are actively investigated at least in mice (1, 2), comparing the adipogenic potential of human pericytes relative to adventicytes may help us better understand human adipose tissue biology.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the interesting point. In our experience, adventitial cells rather than pericytes have a higher intrinsic adipogenic potential, which most likely correlates with their theoretically higher ‘stem-like’ identity<sup>4</sup>. In terms of frequency, and across 8 patient samples, membranous CD107a was present in CD146<sup>+</sup> pericytes, CD34<sup>+</sup> adventicytes and also a fraction of as of yet undefined mesenchymal cells (C146<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> cells). Interestingly, the percentage of pericytes and adventicytes that made up the CD107a<sup>high</sup> cell population varied to some degree across samples (see Supplementary files 2 and 3). In the future, membranous CD107a among mesenchymal cells or a subfraction of perivascular mesenchymal cells could be used prospectively as a biomarker. Nevertheless, our study was a first step in analyzing a completely unknown marker in MSC biology. The further functional segregation of CD107a-expressing cell subsets (pericytes and adventitial cells) is a fascinating area of research, but lies considerably outside the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References:</p><p>1) Hepler C, Shan B, Zhang Q, Henry GH, Shao M, Vishvanath L, Ghaben AL, Mobley AB, Strand D, Hon GC, Gupta RK.

However, I have several comments that will require further attention:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors mentioned the basic function of CD107a (Lamp1) marker as a lysosomal membrane protein. However, they did not mention its important role in autophagy, which should be included as it can make relevant explanation for their observation as the process of autophagy is crucial for regulation of adipogenesis (DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00193-13). The authors should add this information as it can be further discussed in relation to their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent point, which we have added to the Discussion (second paragraph). CD107a is responsible for maintaining lysosomal integrity, pH and catabolism<sup>3,5</sup>. Lysosomes provide the degradative enzymes for autophagy and participate in autophagy regulation<sup>6</sup>, and CD107a may have an essential role in the process of autophagy. Also as you point out, the activation of autophagy is crucial for adipogenic differentiation<sup>7</sup>. Whether CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells enhance adipogenesis by promoting autophagy is an interesting and worthy follow-up topic. This additional discussion has been added to the resubmission (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the expression profile of CD107a in human adipose tissue, did the authors check the proportion of the cells and cell types with CD107a expression to identify the heterogeneity of the cells expressing this surface marker in AT and also if it correlates with number of lysosomes or their state of the activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent suggestion. The proportion of cell types present within CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> cell preparations is reported in Supplementary files 2 and 3. Briefly, both CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> cell populations showed relatively equivalent numbers of CD146<sup>+</sup> pericytes (6.94% in CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells and 4.47% in CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells), while CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells contained a slightly greater population of CD34<sup>+</sup> adventitial cells (70.88% in CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells and 52.45% in CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells). According to your suggestion, we quantified the number of lysosomes among the CD107a<sup>low</sup> and CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells using Lysosomal Staining Kit (Abcam) and found no difference in lysosome staining intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>No change in lysosome immunohistochemical staining among human CD107a<sup>low</sup> and CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells.</title><p>Lysosome positive staining appears green.

Did the authors check the expression profile of CD107a during AD and OB differentiation if its expression profile changes during these processes? They should add these data and comment on it in relation to CD107a function in MSC. Also, if there are known other factors e.g. inflammatory/metabolic molecules (e.g. TNFa, TGFb, or lipids) that could stimulate expression of CD107a?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent suggestions. We observed that CD107a was increased prominently during early adipogenic differentiation (Figure 3H-J). Briefly, after 3 d exposure to adipogenic conditions, a 12.03-fold increase in immunostaining intensity and a 253.5% increase in the number of CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells were noted. In contrast, no significant change in membranous CD107a expression profile was found during osteogenic differentiation (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). As to your good point regarding inflammatory mediators of CD107a expression, this is well reported in other cell types. For example, IL-2 stimulates CD107a expression on NK and cytotoxic T cells<sup>8</sup>. In addition, CD107a production is increased with the stimulation of IL-15, IFN-α, and IFN-β in NK cells<sup>9</sup>. Linking perivascular inflammation to mesenchymal CD107a expression in obesity or other pathophysiology would be an interesting subject for the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding the source of human AT samples, the authors should add the information on the age and BMI or possible medication used in the subjects as these are the major factors that can affect the quality and cellular composition of the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. Details of age and BMI have been added in Supplementary file 1. Unfortunately, data on medication usage was not available for these de-identified samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the cell sorting, how stable was the expression of CD107a after sorting in the culture, did the CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> cells maintain their difference in CD107a expression through the passaging? It is very common that MSC after sorting change their expression profile through the sub-culturing. The authors should add these data and comment on them.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good point. The frequency of membranous CD107a in CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells did not change after three passages. However, the frequency of membranous CD107a among passaged CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells increased slightly over three passages (1.41%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Did the authors measure proliferation rate of CD107a<sup>high</sup> and <sup>low</sup> expressed cells? Did they measure ALP activity or inflammatory properties (e.g. expression of cytokines, growth factors) in these cells? These are functional assays that would add more information about their cellular properties and determination.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Proliferation assays have been added, in which we observed that CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells have a higher proliferative index in comparison to CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells (Figure 2A, subsection “CD107a<sup>low</sup> AT-derived stromal cells represent osteoblast precursor cells!). As suggested, we observed that ALP activity was quite different among CD107a<sup>low</sup> and <sup>high</sup> cells (Figure 2I, J), in which ALP staining and quantification demonstrated an enrichment among CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells. According to your suggestions, we re-analyzed existing RNA sequencing data and found that CD107a<sup>low</sup> and <sup>high</sup> cells expressed few inflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>IL-1B</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, and <italic>IL-33</italic>.

This should be specified to know if there was change in determination or switch in differentiation potential of the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good point. For CFU-OB/AD quantification, we calculated the total number of positive colonies in each well. This has been added in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Regarding the different source of MSC on CD107a expression, the authors mentioned some data on CD107a expression in different fat depots or placenta (Discussion, fourth paragraph). They should add this information, also if they could add the data on BMSC and their expression of CD107a as these cells are more prone to osteogenesis. It will be interesting to compare different sources of MSC and the CD107a expression if it can be used for the specification of particular cell subpopulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. CD107a expression within different fat depots is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, in which CD107a immunoreactivity within the perivascular mesenchymal niche was noted, including pericardial, perigonadal, perirenal and omental human fat. In addition, we have begun to investigate disparate tissues such as placenta and fetal skeletal muscle. An example of the perivascular staining patterns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>. However, this distinct project is being performed by another graduate student, and is reserved for a distinct thesis project. Finally, we did observe that a portion of BMSC expressed membranous CD107a (2.54%, Figure 3L). Interestingly, BMSC showed a similar increase in CD107a expression during adipogenesis as did ASC (Figure 3L). We hope in future work to more thoroughly understand how CD107a identifies perivascular cell subsets across and between tissues.</p><fig id="sa2fig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>CD107a immunohistochemical staining in human fetal skeletal muscle.</title><p>CD107a positive staining appears red, while CD31 positive staining appears black.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58990-resp-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Regarding the RNA-seq data between CD107a<sup>low</sup> and <sup>high</sup> (Figure 4C), is the expression of AD genes significant between groups?

Does it mean that MSC with lower CD107a expression have higher multipotent characteristics and better regeneration properties?

Also, if the testing regenerative properties of CD107a<sup>low</sup> and <sup>high</sup> cells should be attributed, the authors should use better model for tissue regeneration for example calvarial defect regeneration model or monocortical bone defect model.

Our main findings were that CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells demonstrate high colony formation, osteoprogenitor cell frequency, and osteogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, CD107a<sup>high</sup> cells include almost exclusively adipocyte progenitor cells and exhibit high fat cell forming potential. Overall this suggests a more ‘stem-like’ identity for CD107a<sup>low</sup> cells, and that CD107a<sup>high</sup> cell populations have a high pre-adipocyte content which is functionally associated with exocytosis during early adipogenic differentiation.</p><p>According to your earlier suggestion, we have reviewed in more detail the literature regarding CD107a regulation of autophagy (Discussion, second paragraph), as well as inflammatory inducers of CD107a expression (see response to point 3). As you point out, there are many potential bone injury models that could be chosen, including monocortical bone defects or calvarial bone defects. In our experience with the mentioned models, these models rely on both paracrine stimulation of endogenous cells and direct ossification of the implanted cells. In contrast, the spine fusion model relies more on direct ossification of the implanted cells, which was one of the primary factors which influenced our choice of models.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Wang Y, Xu J, Meyers CA, et al.
