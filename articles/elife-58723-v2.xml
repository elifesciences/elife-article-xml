However, less is known about how their interplay might influence behavior and physiology. Here we focused on social hierarchy status, a major component of the social environment in mice, and whether it influences behavioral adaptation to chronic stress in a sex-specific manner. We used a high-throughput automated behavioral monitoring system to assess social dominance in same-sex, group-living mice. We found that position in the social hierarchy at baseline was a significant predictor of multiple behavioral outcomes following exposure to chronic stress. Crucially, this association carried opposite consequences for the two sexes. This work demonstrates the importance of recognizing the interplay between sex and social factors and enhances our understating of how individual differences shape the stress response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most people experience chronic stress at some point in their life, which may increase their chances of developing depression or anxiety. There is evidence that chronic stress may more negatively impact the well-being of women, placing them as higher risk of developing these mental health conditions. The biological factors that underlie these differences are not well understood, which leaves clinicians and scientists struggling to develop and provide effective treatments.</p><p>The social environment has a powerful influence on how people experience and cope with stress. For example, a person’s social and socioeconomic status can change their perception of and reaction to everyday stress. Researchers have found differences in how men and women relate to their social standing. One way for scientists to learn more about the biological processes involved is to study the effect of social standing and chronic stress in male and female mice.</p><p>Now, Karamihalev, Brivio et al. show that social status influences the behavior of stressed mice in a sex-specific way. In the experiments, an automated observation system documented the behavior of mice living in all female or male groups. Karamihalev, Brivio et al. determined where each animal fit into the social structure of their group. Then, they exposed some groups of mice to mild chronic stress and compared their behaviors to groups of mice housed in normal conditions. They found that both the sex and social status of each played a role in how they responded to stress. For example, subordinate males displayed more anxious behavior under stressful circumstances, while dominant females acted bolder and less anxious.</p><p>More studies in mice are needed to understand the biological basis of these social- and sex-based differences in stress response. Learning more may help scientists understand why some individuals are more susceptible to the effects of stress and lead to the development of personalized prevention or treatment strategies for anxiety and depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>social dominance</kwd><kwd>chronic mild stress</kwd><kwd>principal component analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01KU1501A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1565/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1916/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006544</institution-id><institution>Israeli Ministry of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3–11389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ruhman Family Laboratory for Research on the Neurobiology of Stress</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Perlman Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Adelis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund12"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck School for Translational Psychiatry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund13"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sonia T.

For example, the latest studies estimate the prevalence of major depressive disorder among women as 1.5 times higher than in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). In addition, in women major depression is characterized by increased symptom severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2013</xref>) and is more commonly comorbid with anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and sleep disturbances, while men with major depression are more prone to develop aggression, alcohol or substance abuse, and suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite these observations and the documented examples of sexual dimorphism in human stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangasser and Valentino, 2012</xref>), the biological mechanisms that give rise to sex differences in stress response are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joel and McCarthy, 2017</xref>). The symptomatology of stress-related pathologies and the biological response to stress span several domains of functioning including energy metabolism, mood, and sociability. Recent studies in rodent models of stress-related psychopathologies have already identified several differences across molecular, behavioral, and metabolic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bangasser and Wicks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brivio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodes and Epperson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Young and Pfaff, 2014</xref>). Very few studies, however, have looked into the interaction between pre-existing differences in social behavior between the sexes and stress. Considering that abnormalities in social functioning are an essential part of the symptomatology of stress-related disorders, differences in social behavior and social cognition prior to disorder onset are likely to contribute to disorder susceptibility. Here, we explored how social context shapes the response to chronic stress. We focused specifically on social dominance, an essential characteristic of rodent social groups.</p><p>Wild and laboratory rodents form complex and dynamic social structures which typically involve the formation of dominance hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kondrakiewicz et al., 2019</xref>). These have been observed in the lab in group sizes ranging from three to over a dozen individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horii et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Varholick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Hierarchies are thought to improve social stability and reduce severe conflicts and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curley, 2016</xref>). As a consequence, an individual’s position in the dominance hierarchy has important consequences, including preferential access to food, shelter, and mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drews, 1993</xref>). Social rank within male hierarchies is also known to influence health, hormonal profile, brain function, metabolism, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pallé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Razzoli et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, subordinate individuals display increased anxiety-like behavior, a suppressed immune response, higher basal corticosterone levels, and reduced life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolomucci, 2007</xref>). These types of relationships have classically been studied in male animals, as female mice have usually appeared more communal and displayed limited aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König and Lindholm, 2012</xref>). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that female laboratory mice also form hierarchies that appear quite similar to those seen in males, accompanied by some of the same dominance-related physiological markers, such as differences in corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuhr, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van den Berg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Varholick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varholick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williamson et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we examined social dominance status as a putative mediator of sex differences in the response to adverse events.</p><p>To do so, we took advantage of a high-throughput automated behavioral monitoring system (the Social Box, SB) to assess and better understand the hierarchies of groups of male or female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forkosh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shemesh et al., 2013</xref>). We then exposed mice to a well-established chronic stress procedure, the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, and evaluated its effects using a series of standard behavioral and physiological readouts. Finally, we used social dominance status at baseline to predict behavioral outcomes following CMS. We hypothesized that an individual’s standing in the social hierarchy would be a predictor of behavior upon stress exposure, and that this relationship would differ between the sexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Male and female dominance hierarchies</title><p>We first explored the hierarchical structure of grouped CD-1 mice over four days of baseline monitoring as well as the stability of hierarchies following an acute stressor (15 min of restraint stress). Social dominance was assessed by calculating the David’s Score (DS), an established method for inferring social hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gammell et al., 2003</xref>). We based the DS on the numbers and directionality of chases between each pair of individuals in a group. A cumulative DS for the four baseline days of the SB assessment was used as a final measure of social dominance. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuhr, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van den Berg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Varholick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varholick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williamson et al., 2019</xref>), we were able to detect some stability in the hierarchies of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Social dominance hierarchies in males and females.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) David’s Scores (DS) based on chases during the four baseline days of Social Box (SB) assessment show relatively stable social hierarchies in both male and female groups (each line represents an individual, colors represent the cumulative social rank on day 4, points are mean values for each rank ± standard error of the mean).

Female <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −0.144, <italic>n</italic> = 48 mice, p = 0.402), as well as two related measures of roaming entropy, which assess the predictability of how an individual explores their environment – <italic>Entropy</italic> and <italic>Grid Entropy [6 × 6]</italic> (for brevity we only report the latter, Male <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.531, <italic>n</italic> = 40 mice, p = 0.00123. Female <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.00677, <italic>n</italic> = 48 mice, p = 0.694). These correlations indicate that overall locomotion and exploration of the home environment may be more strongly connected to social rank in male groups, while being seemingly independent of social status in females. Interestingly, no correlations were present in females but absent in males. Altogether these findings suggest that male and female social dominance hierarchies, despite having a similar structure, have different relationships to overall behavior.</p><p>Next, we estimated DS stability over time by examining the frequency of rank change events and comparing those to the chance-level expectation. Briefly, normalized daily DS values were ranked for each group to create a four-rank hierarchy: <italic>α</italic> (most dominant), <italic>β</italic>, <italic>γ</italic>, and <italic>δ</italic> (most subordinate) and each mouse was assigned a single rank based on its four-day cumulative DS. For each pair of consecutive days, we observed how many individuals maintained the same rank they had been assigned on the previous day. We then calculated the rank maintenance odds for animals in each final rank category relative to the expected chance-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The true probability of rank maintenance in our data was higher than chance in <italic>α</italic>-females and in all male ranks (one-tailed binomial tests against the rank maintenance probability of 25%, <italic>α</italic>-females: 21/36 successes, p = 2.1×10<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>α</italic>-males: 22/30 successes, p = 3.7×10<sup>−8</sup>, <italic>β- and γ</italic>-males: 13/30 successes each, p = 0.0216, <italic>δ</italic>-males: 19/30 successes, p = 1.02×10<sup>−5</sup>). These results indicate that the highest rank in a hierarchy is often occupied by the same individual over time in both sexes, while the lower ranks appeared to be stable in males only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>In addition to stability over time during baseline recordings, individual DS also remained stable following acute restraint stress (Pearson’s correlation between cumulative baseline DS and DS following acute restraint on day 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both males (<italic>r</italic> = 0.6639, <italic>n</italic> = 40 mice, p = 3×10<sup>−6</sup>) and females (<italic>r</italic> = 0.446, <italic>n</italic> = 48 mice, p = 0.000149) showed significant DS correlations from baseline to acute restraint. Finally, we investigated the possibility of differential effects of acute restraint on the behavior used to produce the DS – numbers of chase events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Repeated-measures ANOVA on log-transformed chase numbers showed that the number of chases decreased significantly following acute restraint stress (<italic>F</italic>(1, 86) = 29.04, <italic>n</italic> = 88 mice, p = 6.11×10<sup>−7</sup>), however the extent of this decrease did not differ between the sexes (Sex x Stage interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 86) = 1.053, <italic>n</italic> = 88 mice, p = 0.301).</p><p>The apparent robustness of social hierarchies over time and in response to acute stress suggested that predictions from the baseline assessment may carry information that would still be relevant to behavioral outcomes following a long-term intervention. More specifically, we hypothesized that occupancy of the highest-ranking positions in the social hierarchy in both sexes and additionally the lowest in males might be sufficiently stable to allow for long-term predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of CMS on behavior and physiology</title><p>To investigate the effects of pre-existing social dominance status on the behavioral response to chronic stress, we employed a CMS protocol adapted for group-housed animals.</p><p>In short, groups were exposed to a weekly schedule of two daily randomly combined mild stressors (e.g. wet bedding, tilted cage, overcrowding) for a total of three weeks. Six groups of each sex (<italic>n</italic> = 24 per sex) were randomly assigned to receive CMS, while the rest of the groups (six groups of females and four groups of males) were assigned to the control condition. The 21-day CMS procedure was followed by a behavioral test battery for both control and CMS mice, which included tests previously shown to capture the effects of chronic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This included, among others, classical tests of locomotion (open field test, OFT), anhedonia (sucrose preference test, SPT), anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze, EPM), and stress coping (tail suspension test, TST). Additionally, we assessed several physiological indicators of stress level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–e</xref>).

We tested the association between PC1 scores and DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Remarkably, baseline DS significantly predicted scores on PC1 in CMS individuals only and this association was in opposite directions between the two sexes (sex by DS interaction: <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 6.016, p = 0.0183).

Instead, CMS exposure appeared to create relationships between dominance and the outcome variables that were not present in controls (the top examples from the OFT and EPM are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>, correlations between individual readouts and DS within each sex and condition are available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To conclude, we were able to narrow down a portion of the variance in a broad range of behavioral and physiological outcomes following CMS to an interaction between dominance and sex with more subordinate CMS males showing apparent increases in measures of overall activity (distance/speed in the OFT and EPM) and more subordinate males and more dominant females showing an apparent reduction in anxiety-like behavior. Thus, we were able to identify a novel role for social rank belonging in modulating behavior following chronic stress in a sexually dimorphic way.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Social behavior in general and social dominance in particular are important contributors to individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forkosh et al., 2019</xref>). As such, they may also shape how individuals respond to environmental challenges. In humans, different types of social hierarchies coexist in complex structures and they influence an individual’s behavior and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sapolsky, 2005</xref>). Mouse social dominance hierarchies are considerably simpler, however parallels between the two species can be drawn in particular with regard to human socioeconomic status (SES). Both objective and perceived SES impact human health, mortality, morbidity, and susceptibility to psychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farah, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoebel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McEwen and Gianaros, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shaked et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wetherall et al., 2019</xref>). These outcomes resemble findings related to social dominance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolomucci, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pallé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Razzoli et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, some human studies have identified sex differences in the relationship between SES and stress-related psychopathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kosidou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mwinyi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peplinski et al., 2018</xref>). All this suggests that social status and the stress and health gradient that characterize human social structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McEwen and Gianaros, 2010</xref>) likely have close analogues in other mammals with well-defined social structures.</p><p>Here, we have demonstrated that both male and female socially housed mice establish social dominance hierarchies, which are relatively stable over time and resistant to acute perturbations. In agreement with previous work, female hierarchies were less despotic and had lower directional consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williamson et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that females may be maintaining a less rigid structure compared to males. This is supported by our finding that only the top rank in females showed significant stability over time, whereas in males both subordinate and dominant ranks appeared stable. Further research is needed to ascertain if this observation is limited to our paradigm and specific set of measurements (same-sex groups of four individuals), or if it represents a true sex difference in social dominance hierarchies.</p><p>Additionally, our data suggest that an individual’s position in the hierarchy carries different implications for overall behavior in each sex. While we are unable to assess whether social rank belonging should be considered a cause or consequence of these behavioral differences, we have observed an interesting sex difference in this relationship. For groups living in the enriched environment of the SB apparatus, dominance in males but not in females was associated with overall locomotion, proportion of time spent outside the nest, and exploration entropy. These associations likely reflect territorial or patrolling behavior in males, which may be less relevant to female social hierarchies.</p><p>As hypothesized, occupancy of different positions in the social hierarchy conferred varying levels of responsiveness to the challenges posed by chronic stress. Previous investigations have rarely found associations between social dominance and response to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larrieu and Sandi, 2018</xref>). An important exception is a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larrieu et al., 2017</xref> in groups of male mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress. The authors found increased susceptibility to chronic social defeat for dominant males, but in contrast to our results, no real behavioral alterations for subordinates. It is important to note, however, that chronic social defeat and CMS are profoundly different paradigms. Social defeat is strongly tied to social dominance and might be perceived as loss of status more than other stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larrieu and Sandi, 2018</xref>). Our use of CMS allowed us to investigate both sexes under comparable levels of stress. Nevertheless, both the study from Larrieu and colleagues, and ours highlight that social status can influence an individual's response to long-term adverse life events.</p><p>Importantly, we demonstrated that the effects of preexisting dominance on stress outcomes were sexually divergent, such that the association between dominance and anxiety-like and locomotor behavior following CMS was in opposite directions between males and females. Specifically, subordinate males appeared to display hyperlocomotion, while dominant females displayed increased boldness (reduced anxiety-like behavior) compared to non-CMS controls. Overall, our data indicate that an individual’s position within a social structure can influence their behavioral response to chronic stress in a sex-specific fashion.</p><p>These findings suggest an intriguing possibility. Given that male social hierarchies are likely antagonistic, we speculate that social living carries an especially high cost for subordinate males, who are the recipients of most antagonistic interactions. Conversely, female hierarchies may contribute to more affiliative social interactions, and thus social context may carry a net benefit for females, with the highest benefit gained by the dominant females. We speculate that this positioning as the most advantaged and disadvantaged individuals may confer higher behavioral flexibility and results in the strongest behavioral change upon exposure to environmental challenges.</p><p>Crucially, since we decided to maintain social context throughout our experimental design, the current work did not allow for the assessment of the effect of group- versus single-housing on CMS outcomes. Given this constraint, we were not able to confidently assess the difference in how CMS was experienced by each sex in groups as opposed to if they had been single-housed. However, since we were interested in the prediction from baseline dominance, we did not wish to remove the salience and thereby the effect of social context. Likewise, in naturalistic conditions, mice are found in mixed-sex groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kondrakiewicz et al., 2019</xref>). Working with same-sex groups provided us with a more controlled environment, preventing confounding by mating behavior and pregnancy. However, this was at the expense of the ethological validity of our findings. Further research is needed to understand if and how mixed-sex social structures may differ in their impact on stress outcomes.</p><p>Moreover, while CMS produced some of the expected physiological changes (i.e., reduction of bodyweight gain, reduced coat quality, adrenal weight increase), we did not observe several of the behavioral phenotypes often found using similar protocols (e.g., hyperlocomotion, anhedonia, passive coping, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franceschelli et al., 2014</xref>). While we have sufficient evidence that CMS individuals experienced significant amounts of stress, we are not able to determine if the absence of some of these behavioral signatures of CMS is a result of the maintenance of social context throughout the protocol or if it is due to other unknown factors. We are, however, not the first to observe no change in adrenal size or sucrose preference in female CD1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dadomo et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe any changes in basal corticosterone levels. This is probably be due to the fact that our blood sampling was performed one week after the end of the CMS paradigm, allowing enough time for corticosterone levels to return to normal.</p><p>Finally, we employed the David’s Score as a continuous linear indicator of social dominance for the additional statistical power that this approach provides. Dominance hierarchies, however, are more commonly thought of as ordinal, and we lacked sufficient sample sizes per rank and condition to be able to reliably quantify the contribution of each rank to the behavioral outcomes of chronic stress. Further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings to specific social ranks.</p><p>While were not able to directly compare between single- and group-housed animals, our data suggest that the existence of a social hierarchy in groups of mice might contribute to increased variability in behavioral outcomes after chronic treatment generating rank-specific responses. Moreover, this effect could be especially relevant when studying sex differences. Often, housing conditions (single vs. group) are not taken into consideration as a variable of interest. Based on the findings reported here, we speculate that housing conditions might have contributed to discordant behavioral findings in studies of stress and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franceschelli et al., 2014</xref>). Our results argue for considering group-derived individual differences and, in particular, dominance status, in the design of experiments, especially when investigating the contribution of sex differences to stress response.</p><p>Taken together, this work suggests that social dominance might influence the perception of and reaction to chronic stress differently for male and female mice. While there has been some work looking into the effects of dominance on stress susceptibility in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larrieu et al., 2017</xref>), very little is known about female social dominance and its contribution to stress coping. Our findings emphasize the need for exploring the stress response in the presence of conspecifics in a more naturalistic manner and the importance of recognizing that the same social factors may carry divergent consequences for the behavior of males and females.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Corticosterone Double Antibody RIA Kit</td><td>MP Biomedicals</td><td>SKU 0712010-CF</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Tidyverse,</italic> ecosystem of packages</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">R Core Development Team, 2013</xref> doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686">10.21105/joss.01686</ext-link></td><td/><td>R version 4.0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>‘RNOmni</italic> R package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCaw, 2019</xref></td><td>v 0.7.1</td><td>R version 4.0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>‘<italic>cowplot’</italic> R package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilke, 2019</xref></td><td>v 1.0.0</td><td>R version 4.0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>‘<italic>compete</italic>’ R package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curley et al., 2015</xref></td><td>v 0.1</td><td>R version 4.0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>‘<italic>steepness</italic>’ R package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leiva and de Vries, 2014</xref></td><td>v 0.2–2</td><td>R version 4.0.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal housing and care</title><p>Male and female ICR CD-1 mice at 7–9 months old were employed for all experiments (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany).

We used an implementation of this procedure made available in the open-source ‘<italic>steepness’</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leiva and de Vries, 2014</xref>), whose output ranges between 0 and 1, with one meaning a very steep hierarchy in which power is unequally distributed between dominant and subordinate individuals. Despotism was defined as the fraction of the group’s total number of chases that were initiated by the highest-ranking individual. Its values range as well between 0 and 1, in which one represents the presence of a very strong alpha who initiate all chases. Directional consistency was calculated using the average fraction of pairwise social interactions that occur in the direction from the individual who displayed more instances of an agonistic behavior to the individual who displayed fewer instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Hooff and Wensing, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williamson et al., 2016</xref>). A directional consistency equal to one indicates that all agonist interactions are directed from an individual with a higher DS to one with a lower DS. Finally, we used Landau’s modified <italic>h</italic>’ to assess the linearity of a social hierarchy, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries, 1995</xref>, in which hierarchies which are fully linearly ordered are assigned a value of 1. We calculated both directional consistency and Landau’s modified <italic>h</italic>’ using functions made available in the R package ‘<italic>compete</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curley et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acute restraint</title><p>Before the beginning of the fifth night in the SB, mice were removed from the SB and restrained in a ventilated tube for 15 min.

Throughout the testing period, mice were maintained in their original groups and habituated to the testing room for at least one hour prior the start of the test. Forty-eight hours after the last test, mice were terminally anesthetized in isoflurane and sacrificed. Terminal bodyweight, plasma, adrenal glands, and thymus were collected. Adrenal glands and thymus were cleaned from fat tissue and weighed. Absolute values were adjusted to bodyweight using the bodyweights collected on day 1. Tissue weighing, corticosterone measurement, and behavioral scoring were performed by an experimenter blind to sex, condition, and social rank.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Open field test</title><p>On the day following the last stressors (day 22), mice locomotor activity and exploratory behavior were assessed in the OFT for 10 min.

Prior to decomposition, missing data points (for a maximum of two values per individual) were replaced with the median of the respective outcome. The principal components (PCs) obtained were ranked by the total amount of variance explained. The top 3 PCs, namely PC1, PC2, and PC3, contained most of the variance in our dataset and were thus used to investigate the effects of known variables (sex, stress condition, social dominance status). To evaluate the influence of social dominance we assessed the association between PC1 and the David’s Score within each experimental group.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Yair Shemesh, Oren Forkosh, Markus Nussbaumer, and Chadi Touma for their assistance in establishing the ‘Social Box’ paradigm.

sex and social hierarchy influence behavioral adaptations to chronic stress. The paper makes innovations in measuring mouse behavior in a social context and concludes that social hierarchy has a sex-specific influence on multiple behavioral outcomes after chronic mild stress. Thus this work will be of interest to those interested in stress and related conditions, and the influence of sex on behavior. As it is standard practice to ignore social hierarchy in rodent studies, this paper is also of importance to the study of animal behavior more broadly.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Social dominance mediates behavioral adaptation to chronic stress in a sex-specific manner&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jaideep Singh Bains (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Karamihalev et al. use a novel approach to understand social hierarchy in mice and then ask whether this has impacts how individuals are affected by experimental chronic stress paradigms. The foundation question is: Does social hierarchy influence behavioral adaptations to chronic stress in a sex-specific manner? The consideration of sex and social hierarchy and interactions therein is extremely important. As it is standard practice to ignore social hierarchy in rodent studies, this paper fills an important gap. To this end, the authors use an ingenious system for measuring individual mouse behavior within social groupings. Based on their observations, they conclude that social hierarchy is a predictor of multiple behavioral outcomes after exposure to chronic mild stress, but the consequences are opposite in males and females.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, all reviewers were very excited by the study and supportive of the approach being utilized, highlighting its novelty and impact. It has been uniformly agreed upon that no further experimentation is required, but there are several issues with interpretation and description that require attention.</p><p>1) Overall locomotion and exploration in the home-cage appears to be linked to hierarchy in males, but not in females. The authors suggest this means that, although male and female male and female social dominance hierarchies have a similar structure, they have different consequences for overall behavior. It is unclear how the authors can untangle whether it is the hierarchy that drives the behavior or whether it is the behavior that leads to a position in the hierarchy. For example, one possibility is that males who are dominant (<italic>α</italic>) explore more. The other argument is that it is the males that explore more who become dominant. So the question then becomes whether their dominance allows them to exhibit this behavior or whether, by exhibiting this behavior, they establish dominance. This argument is not one of semantics. It goes to the very heart of the paper which attempts to establish causal links between social hierarchy and subsequent behaviors.</p><p>2) Were the mice returned to the Social Box between CMS stress episodes and subsequent behavioral tests? The Materials and methods state, in reference to the Acute restraint that 'At the end of the stressors, groups of mice were put back in their original SB and tracked for an additional 12 hours' and in reference to the CMS that 'Throughout the testing period, mice were maintained in their original groups,' so I assume they were either returned to the SB or retained in groupings but not in the SB? Figure 2A is not informative in this regard. This aspect of the design requires clarification. It is also pertinent to the question of whether additional data were obtained, post stress, in the SB, and how these data looked – given this would be a potentially very interesting additional set of correlative data.</p><p>3) With respect to methodology, there is some additional clarification required for other points. First, there are many independent variables that are not clearly defined (e.g., steepness, despotism, directional consistency), which make data interpretation difficult. Second, the authors should also provide the behaviors in the correlation structure and how they are computed (subsection “Male and female dominance hierarchies”, third paragraph) minimally in the supplement and not make the reader reference another paper.</p><p>4) The PCA used in Figure 3 is not well explained. It could be explained in the Materials and methods because it is important for the reader to understand the differences between PCA1, PCA2, PCA3.</p><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors make rank-specific comparisons. It is not clear why the middle ranks are combined. The <italic>β</italic> and the <italic>γ</italic> appear to be as different from each other as the <italic>α</italic> from the <italic>β</italic> and the <italic>γ</italic> from the <italic>δ</italic>. If <italic>β</italic> and γ were interchangeable then I could understand this lumping of groups. But this is not the case.</p><p>6) A key part of the Results is in the section titled, &quot;Sex-specific effects of dominance on CMS outcomes.&quot; But based on the data reported, it is not clear that social context is the determinant of the response to chronic stress. There is a nice association here, that suggests a predictive value to social hierarchy – most reliably in the dominant and subordinate, but it is very difficult to conclude that the responses to chronic stress are a consequence of this hierarchy. In order to make this conclusion, the authors would have to find a way to disrupt the hierarchy and then ask whether this affects responses to chronic stress. Additionally, the correlation of PC1 scores with the DS was powerful and suggests stability of the hierarchy. But it would have been better to re-test the hierarchy after the CMS manipulation. Are there any other metrics that suggest stability was maintained? In the absence of these studies where the hierarchy was manipulated and outcomes were measured, the authors should temper their statements indicating causal relationships between social status hierarchy and the effects of chronic stress, or vice versa.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58723.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, all reviewers were very excited by the study and supportive of the approach being utilized, highlighting its novelty and impact.

We believe position in the social dominance hierarchy is itself an expression of at least one stable underlying trait and have shown some evidence that it is robust against changes in social context in male mice (see Forkosh et al., 2019). Nonetheless, the reviewers are correct in stating that we cannot discern if the behavioral differences associated with social dominance are a cause or consequence (or neither) of occupying a specific social rank. This would be an excellent direction for future research although addressing this set of questions rigorously is a large and non-trivial undertaking. We believe it would take a combination of well-designed brain circuit-level manipulations and/or perhaps taking advantage of the more unstable social hierarchies.</p><p>However, despite our inability to pinpoint exactly if behavioral differences are a consequence of social rank or if rank is a consequence of the behavioral characteristics of the individual, we are able to show that for some behaviors this connection appears to be influenced by pre-existing social status and often only exists in one sex and not the other.</p><p>We have made some adjustments in the text of the manuscript to avoid giving readers the impression that we believe the behavioral differences are a consequence of social rank:</p><p>“These correlations indicate that overall locomotion and exploration of the home environment may be more strongly connected to social rank in male groups, while being seemingly independent of social status in females. […] Altogether, these findings suggest that male and female social dominance hierarchies, despite having a similar structure, have different relationships to overall behavior.”</p><p>And in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Additionally, our data suggest that an individual’s position in the hierarchy carries different implications for overall behavior in each sex. […] These associations likely reflect territorial or patrolling behavior in males, which may be less relevant to female social hierarchies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Were the mice returned to the Social Box between CMS stress episodes and subsequent behavioral tests?

It is also pertinent to the question of whether additional data were obtained, post stress, in the SB, and how these data looked – given this would be a potentially very interesting additional set of correlative data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in the Materials and methods section on this point. We have attempted to remove the ambiguity by making changes to Figure 2A and the Materials and methods:</p><p>“The fur of all mice was marked using four different colors under mild isoflurane anesthesia and mice were left to recover for few days before the start of the experiment. […] On day 6, animals were removed from the Social Box and placed in their original cage under standard housing conditions for the rest of the experimental procedure (see “Chronic mild stress protocol” and “Behavioral battery” sections).”</p><p>The animals were returned to the SB only following the acute restraint test on day 5, whereas during and after the CMS procedure animals were maintained in groups in standard housing conditions. We agree that a further testing in the SB after the CMS would generate interesting additional data. We hope to be able to address this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With respect to methodology, there is some additional clarification required for other points. First, there are many independent variables that are not clearly defined (e.g., steepness, despotism, directional consistency), which make data interpretation difficult. Second, the authors should also provide the behaviors in the correlation structure and how they are computed (subsection “Male and female dominance hierarchies”, third paragraph) minimally in the supplement and not make the reader reference another paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to this and understand the need for further clarification. To address this, we have now expanded our explanation of the variables related to social hierarchy.</p><p>“We further calculated several properties of male and female hierarchies to explore potential differences in their characteristics. […] We found that male hierarchies were steeper, more linear, more despotic, and had higher directional consistency than those of females. Interestingly, mice housed in larger groups show analogous relationships between sexes (Williamson et al., 2019).”</p><p>“Social dominance was assessed using the David’s Score (DS), a measure based on the pairwise directionalities and numbers of agonistic interactions in a group (David, 1987). […]We calculated both directional consistency and Landau’s modified h’ using functions made available in the R package “compete” (Curley et al., 2015).”</p><p>We have also added clarifications of how SB behaviors are computed in the Materials and methods section, although, due to the large number of readouts and the extensive background behind how they are computed, we are not able to provide the same level of detail here as we have in the paper where we initially described them (Forkosh et al., 2019). We recognize that it is an inconvenience for readers to have to track down the specifics of how each behavior is computed in a separate paper, however the amount of detail needed for a satisfying description of each readout would considerably expand the size of this manuscript. We hope that a simplified explanation, such as the one below, will satisfy most readers and would refer those who still require more detail to our previous published work.</p><p>“From the location data we inferred agonistic interactions as well a variety of other behavioral readouts as described in (Forkosh et al., 2019). […] We model social interactions using a Hidden Markov Model, which takes into consideration the relative trajectories and distances between pairs of mice and determines who initiates a contact, its progression and its properties using a simple topology states (idle, approach/avoid, contact, follow/avoid, described in detail in Forkosh et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The PCA used in Figure 3 is not well explained. It could be explained in the Materials and methods because it is important for the reader to understand the differences between PCA1, PCA2, PCA3.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and have attempted to better explain PCA itself and the resulting projections. The following is now part of the designated PCA section in our Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to explore the sources of variance in our multi-dimensional behavioral dataset. […] To evaluate the influence of social dominance we assessed the association between PC1 and the David’s score within each experimental group.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4, the authors make rank-specific comparisons. It is not clear why the middle ranks are combined. The β and the γ appear to be as different from each other as the α from the β and the γ from the δ. If β and γ were interchangeable then I could understand this lumping of groups. But this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We are especially grateful to the reviewers for this comment. Upon reanalysis with the increased sample size, we did indeed find significant stability also in the <italic>β</italic> and <italic>γ</italic> ranks in males, making it especially clear that combining the ranks is unjustified. However, as stated above, we lack sufficient power to perform a rank-by-rank comparison within each sex to assess the social rank-specific effects of CMS. With that in mind, we have removed the comparisons that previously made up Figure 4 as well as the corresponding Supplementary Figure 4. Instead, we provide a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) that shows the correlations between social dominance as a continuous score (via the David’s score) and each individual behavioral or physiological readout within each sex and stress condition. We believe this presents a more complex, but also more accurate picture of the complex association patterns between social dominance, stress, and sex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A key part of the Results is in the section titled, &quot;Sex-specific effects of dominance on CMS outcomes.&quot; But based on the data reported, it is not clear that social context is the determinant of the response to chronic stress. There is a nice association here, that suggests a predictive value to social hierarchy – most reliably in the dominant and subordinate, but it is very difficult to conclude that the responses to chronic stress are a consequence of this hierarchy. In order to make this conclusion, the authors would have to find a way to disrupt the hierarchy and then ask whether this affects responses to chronic stress. Additionally, the correlation of PC1 scores with the DS was powerful and suggests stability of the hierarchy. But it would have been better to re-test the hierarchy after the CMS manipulation. Are there any other metrics that suggest stability was maintained? In the absence of these studies where the hierarchy was manipulated and outcomes were measured, the authors should temper their statements indicating causal relationships between social status hierarchy and the effects of chronic stress, or vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful comment and agree that establishing a clear causal link between social status and stress response would require further experimentation. We believe two explanations of the relationship between the social status and stress response are conceivable. Either, as discussed by the reviewers, hierarchical status directly modulates and determines an individual’s response to chronic stress, or there is a set of underlying characteristics that influences an individual’s social status and their behavioral response to chronic stress. In this scenario, prolonged occupation of a specific social rank does not directly alter stress response, but rather is itself an indication of the hidden feature(s) that govern both social dominance status and stress response.</p><p>Testing the social status of the mice a second time, following the CMS manipulation, would open a very interesting line of investigation and we did consider including it as part of our original design. However, by doing so we would have introduced a new and different set of questions related to the effects of CMS on social hierarchies (as well as on a variety of behaviors in the SB) and whether those effects depend on sex. These questions are of great interest and deserve thorough experimentation, but are outside the scope of the current work. Instead, here we decided to focus on exploring sex differences in social hierarchies in general and the relationship between sex, social dominance prior to stress exposure, and the behavioral response to chronic stress. The downside to this focus is that we cannot exclude the possibility that social hierarchies are systemically altered or otherwise disrupted by stress exposure. We have no evidence that the hierarchy status we observed at the start of the experiment was maintained. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates that a link exists between preexisting social status, sex, and chronic stress. Further, more detailed inquiries are needed to determine how exactly these three factors interact.</p><p>As with Point 1, we have made modifications to the text in order to clarify the limitations of the current work regarding the causal effects of social dominance.</p></body></sub-article></article>
