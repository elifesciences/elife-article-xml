Various steps of protein synthesis are inhibited by natural and synthetic antibacterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polikanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson, 2009</xref>). A number of antibiotics impede the initiation of translation by preventing mRNA binding or departure of the ribosome from the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polikanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson, 2009</xref>). Numerous inhibitors affect translation elongation by interfering with mRNA decoding, peptide bond formation, translocation, or passage of the nascent protein through the exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polikanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vázquez-Laslop and Mankin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson, 2009</xref>). However, no antibiotics were known to specifically target the termination step of protein synthesis. It was only recently that apidaecin, an antimicrobial peptide from honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casteels et al., 1989</xref>), was described as the first antibiotic specifically targeting translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Apidaecin is an 18-amino acid proline-rich antimicrobial peptide (PrAMP). Various PrAMPs are produced by insects and mammals to protect the host from bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graf and Wilson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scocchi et al., 2011</xref>). The antimicrobial activity of PrAMPs is based on their ability to bind to the bacterial ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mardirossian et al., 2014</xref>). PrAMPs bind in the vacant nascent peptide exit tunnel of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gagnon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seefeldt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2015</xref>). Most of the PrAMPs described to date invade the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and by hindering the binding of the first elongator aminoacyl-tRNA, arrest the ribosome at the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gagnon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seefeldt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The action of apidaecin is principally different. Even though this PrAMP also binds in the exit tunnel and closely approaches the PTC, it does not directly obstruct the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krizsan et al., 2015</xref>). Biochemical analyses carried out with the synthetic peptide Api137 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthold et al., 2013</xref>; referred to, throughout, as Api) showed that Api traps deacyl-tRNA in the P site and class one release factors (RF1 or RF2) in the A site. The model that emerged from these in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>) postulated that Api can bind only after the ribosome has reached the stop codon, associated with RF1/RF2, and released the fully-synthesized protein, because only then the exit tunnel becomes available for Api binding. This view implied that Api specifically targets the post-release ribosome. Strikingly, however, addition of Api to a cell-free translation system could also lead to the accumulation of unhydrolyzed peptidyl-tRNA, indicating that Api is also able to interfere with peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis at stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>). To explain this observation, it was proposed that Api-mediated trapping of RF1/RF2 on the post-release ribosomes would prevent the release of completed proteins at the remaining Api-free ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The proposed mechanism of Api action has been inferred primarily based on in vitro biochemical and structural studies involving a limited number of artificial substrates and reporters. Furthermore, there is a seeming discrepancy regarding the in vitro and in vivo modes of Api action, since the translation of a GFP reporter protein was significantly inhibited by Api in bacterial cells, whereas expression of the same reporter in a cell-free system was only marginally affected even at high Api concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krizsan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the consequences of Api action upon translating ribosomes in the living cell have remained unknown.</p><p>To investigate the genome-wide impact of Api on translation in bacterial cells we used ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq). Our analysis revealed that Api globally inhibits translation termination. The general arrest of translation at the end of the ORFs leads to a pronounced queuing of elongating ribosomes behind those occupying stop codons. Strikingly, the treatment of <italic>E. coli</italic> with Api results in a dramatic stop codon readthrough that generates proteins with C-terminal extensions. Our data also show that, trying to mitigate the pervasive Api-induced readthrough, cells engage the ribosome rescue systems, which nevertheless remain ineffective because of the Api action.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Api redistributes ribosomes within mRNAs</title><p>Prior to carrying out the Ribo-seq experiment, we first optimized the conditions of Api treatment to achieve a significant antibiotic effect while minimizing undesirable secondary events. Incubation of <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21) cultures for 1 min with increasing concentrations of Api resulted in severe inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Exposure to 1.25 µM of Api, which corresponds to the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) that prevents cell growth, reduced translation by as much as 75%. Treatment for 2 min with 4× MIC diminished protein synthesis to nearly 10% of the control and extending the treatment to 10 min achieved ~94% inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results confirmed the previous assertion that Api acts as a general inhibitor of bacterial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>) and guided the selection of the treatment conditions for the subsequent experiments.</p><p>We then proceeded to the Ribo-seq experiments to obtain an unbiased view of how treatment with Api alters the global distribution of translating ribosomes in cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oh et al., 2011</xref>). Exponentially-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were incubated for 5 min with 4× MIC of Api, conditions that led to nearly complete inhibition of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (ribosome footprints) were isolated, sequenced, and mapped to the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>). Exposure to Api caused a dramatic redistribution of ribosomes along mRNAs. The general pattern observed within individual genes revealed a buildup of ribosome density toward the ends of the ORFs, often spilling into the 3’-intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). In operons with narrowly spaced genes, the ribosome density was primarily observed at the junctions spanning 3’-terminal codons of the upstream ORF and 5’-proximal codons of the downstream ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, these effects are drastically different from those observed previously with the antibiotic retapamulin, a specific inhibitor of translation initiation, which generates precise and sharp peaks representing ribosomes occupying start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>). To mitigate the uncertainty of assigning reads at the junctions of adjacent or overlapping genes in the operons, we limited our subsequent analysis to actively translated genes that are separated by at least 50 nt from the nearest gene (see Materials and methods). The metagene analysis of ribosome coverage near the stop codons of the well-separated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) revealed several major effects of Api action that will be discussed in the following sections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Api redistributes ribosomes toward the ends of mRNA ORFs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of ribosome footprint density in the <italic>tktA</italic> and <italic>dptA</italic> ORFs in untreated <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with that in cells treated with either Api or the translation initiation inhibitor retapamulin (Ret).

Alternatively, the 3’UTR footprints may correspond to ribosomes that failed to release the completed protein at the stop codon, bypassed it, and continued translation into the downstream segment of mRNA. Such a scenario could be caused by the depletion of available RF1/RF2 trapped by Api on terminating ribosomes. To test the feasibility of the latter model, we examined to which extent Api treatment affects the abundance of free RFs, more specifically of RF2, which by far outnumbers RF1 in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, unlike those of the control sample, the ribosome-depleted lysates of Api-treated cells essentially lacked free RF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we reasoned that if 3’UTR-associated ribosomes are engaged in translation they should preferentially stall at the downstream stop codons. Indeed, metagene analysis shows a peak of ribosome footprints at the first in-frame downstream stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that ribosomes that bypassed the termination signal of the main ORF are actively translating downstream mRNA sequences.</p><p>We used shotgun proteomics to test whether exposure of cells to Api leads to productive translation of the non-coding mRNA segments and generation of proteins with C-terminal extensions. To allow for the accumulation of proteins synthesized during Api treatment, we exposed cells for 1 hr to a sublethal concentration of Api (0.5× MIC) permitting protein synthesis to continue, even if at a reduced level. In addition, we also incubated cells for 1 hr with a higher Api concentration (4× MIC). We then analyzed the proteins synthesized in treated and control cells, using custom algorithms to search for tryptic peptides encoded in the 150 nt-long segments downstream from the stop codons of the annotated ORFs (see Materials and methods). Even when applying strict filtering criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gessulat et al., 2019</xref>), we were able to identify a significant number of peptides encoded in the genomic regions downstream from the ORF stop codons in both of the Api samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). The same analysis found no such peptides in the control sample. The number of identified peptides encoded in the 3’UTRs increased further upon applying a less strict filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results argued that genome regions downstream of the stop codons of the annotated ORFs are actively translated in the cells exposed to Api. Approximately half (49%) of the identified ‘extension’ peptides were encoded in frame with the upstream ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and thus, were likely produced by the ribosomes that misread the main ORF stop codon as a sense codon and continued translating the downstream mRNA sequence. Consistently, in the three identified tryptic peptides encoded in mRNA sequences spanning the ORF termination signal, the stop codon was mistranslated by a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). The other detected downstream peptides were encoded in the (−1) or (+1) frames relative to the main ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). These peptides also likely belong to C-terminal extensions of the main-ORF proteins given that stop codons can be bypassed via frameshifting of the ribosomes stalled at termination sites in the pre-release state, as was observed in the experiments of Gross and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baggett et al., 2017</xref>). The sample size of the ‘extension’ peptides was insufficient to systematically identify the mRNA or nascent protein features conducing to stop codon bypass via frameshifting. However, the presence of a slippery sequence preceding the stop codon (e.g. in <italic>arcB;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>) or the possibility of repairing of peptidyl-tRNA in a different frame (e.g. in <italic>rplE</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>) could be among the factors contributing to the synthesis of identified proteins’ C-terminal extensions.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that stop codon bypass, active translation of 3’ UTRs, and production of proteins with C-terminal extensions constitute major consequences of Api action.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Puromycin alters the Api stalled ribosome pattern</title><p>The results of our analysis suggest that the complex metagene profile observed in the vicinity of stop codons in the Api-treated cells is accounted for by distinct populations of ribosomes: the post-release ribosomes in complex with RF1/RF2 arrested by Api at the stop codons of the main ORF and the ribosomes carrying peptidyl-tRNA (including the queued ribosomes, some of the ribosomes in 3’ UTRs, and a fraction of ribosomes stalled at the stop codons in pre-release state). We hypothesized that this complex profile could be at least partially simplified by clearing from mRNA the ribosomes carrying peptidyl-tRNA. For that, we used puromycin (Pmn), an antibiotic that releases the nascent protein from ribosomes whose PTC A site is accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Traut and Monro, 1964</xref>). Indeed, metagene analysis showed that Pmn treatment of lysate from Api-treated cells significantly reduced the relative amounts of queued ribosomes and 3’UTR ribosomes and, consequently, increased the relative occupancy of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, this does not imply that Pmn causes more ribosomes to associate with stop codons but that a higher fraction of the remaining mRNA-bound ribosomes are positioned at termination sites. However, even upon Pmn treatment, some ribosomes remained within the ORFs, suggesting that either some of the translation complexes are refractory to Pmn action or that Pmn treatment requires further optimization. The remaining footprints still found in 3’UTRs after Pmn treatment may represent the ribosomes arrested at the downstream stop codons: Api-trapped RFs would block Pmn binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Api treatment distorts the cell proteome and activates cellular ribosome rescue systems</title><p>Exposure of cells to Api leads to significant deregulation of the proteome.

The moderate effect of Api on translation initiation is reminiscent of the main mode of action of other PrAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gagnon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seefeldt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seefeldt et al., 2015</xref>) and could be explained by its ability to bind with a reduced affinity to the ribosome even in the absence of RF1/RF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains to be elucidated whether the mechanism of the weak inhibition of translation initiation by Api is comparable to that of other PrAMPs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ribo-seq and proteomics studies revealed a complex pattern of events triggered by the translation termination inhibitor Api in bacteria.</p><p>One of the main effects of Api in the cell is the arrest of translation at the stop codons of the ORFs. A larger fraction of the ribosomes associated with stop codons is likely arrested in a post-release state, with Api bound in the exit tunnel, trapped RF1 or RF2 in the A site, and deacylated tRNA in the P site. Most of the available RFs are sequestered in these complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which explains why overexpression of class 1 RFs reduced the sensitivity of <italic>E. coli</italic> to Api (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsumoto et al., 2017</xref>). In normal conditions, however, because the number of ribosomes in the cell exceeds the copy number of RF1 and RF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>), some ribosomes likely become stalled at stop codons in a pre-release state, with a vacant A site and the completed protein still esterifying P-site tRNA. It is difficult to determine experimentally what fraction of the stop codon associated footprints belongs to the pre-release ribosomes. However, because the number of the total stop codon footprints (~11% of all mapped footprints) roughly matches the ratio between ribosomes and RFs in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>), it is likely that most of the ribosome density detected at stop codons is accounted for by Api-stalled post-release ribosomes. A fraction of the stop codon peak could be also possibly attributed to the post-release Api-free ribosomes that have not yet been recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The extent of Api-induced ribosome arrest at stop codons differs in magnitude between genes. At least some of the gene- or nascent protein-specific effects of the Api action could be linked to the kinetics of extrusion of the nascent chain from the exit tunnel, which is a pre-requisite for Api binding. The nascent chains that would linger for a longer time after their separation from the P-site tRNA would allow more time for RF1/RF2 dissociation before Api reaching its binding site in the exit tunnel. Consistently, we note a modest trend for arrest at the RF2-specific UGA codons to be somewhat less pronounced than that at the UAA or UAG stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) possibly because the residence time of RF2 on the post-release ribosome could be shorter than that of RF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adio et al., 2018</xref>), which would provide Api with a lesser chance to trap the ribosome terminating at the UGA codons. We should note, however, that the available data are insufficient to distinguish whether the observed context effects operate upon the post- or pre-release fractions of the stop codon-associated ribosomes.</p><p>Api-induced ribosome stalling at stop codons causes severe ribosome queuing. The impressive ability of Api to cause queuing likely stems from its unique mechanism of action. In contrast to elongation inhibitors, which simultaneously arrest ribosomes at many codons within the gene, Api preferentially arrests translation at a single site, the stop codon; the trailing ribosomes on the same mRNA continue translation until they run into the traffic jam caused by the termination site roadblock. The pronounced ribosome queuing in the Api-treated cells illustrates a distinctive feature of a translation termination inhibitor as an antimicrobial: Api needs to bind to only a few terminating ribosomes to preclude a much larger number of inhibitor-free ribosomes from participating in translation. Termination arrest and ribosome queuing, however, did not increase the number of heavy polysomes in the cell, likely because in fast-growing cells ~90% of the ribosomes are already associated with mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartholomäus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bremer and Dennis, 1996</xref>) and thus, blocking termination would not perceptibly increase ribosome loading per mRNA.</p><p>Our Ribo-seq experiments revealed a striking and pervasive Api-induced genome-wide stop codon readthrough resulting in an increased abundance of ribosome footprints downstream of ~99% of the analyzed genes. The appearance of peptides encoded in the downstream mRNA sequences, revealed by shotgun proteomics, and the increased ribosome occupancy of the downstream stop codons strongly argue that in the Api-treated cells a sizable fraction of ribosomes translate past the end of the ORFs and synthesize proteins with C-terminal extensions. Stop codon bypass is likely a consequence of the Api-mediated depletion of available RFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that increases the residence time of pre-release state ribosomes at the stop codons of the ORFs, leading ultimately to readthrough.</p><p>Some level of stop codon readthrough can be also induced by antibiotics that render the ribosome error-prone, such as aminoglycosides, odilorhabdins, or negamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olivier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polikanov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wangen and Green, 2020</xref>). However, Api’s ability to stimulate bypass appears to be more robust, leading to the appearance of ribosome footprints downstream of not only the first but also of the subsequent stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Because Api does not inhibit translation elongation (in contrast to the aforementioned antibiotics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabañas et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polikanov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), more ribosomes can reach the ends of the ORFs in the Api-treated cells, thereby triggering a higher rate of stop codon readthrough. Additionally, unlike miscoding antibiotics, Api does not reduce the general accuracy of translation and thus, could be exploited for medical applications where a premature stop codon readthrough is desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keeling et al., 2014</xref>). Api-mediated stop codon suppression can be also instrumental in synthetic biology, for example, for enhancing the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuru et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Api-induced stop codon bypass is achieved by either misincorporation of a near-cognate amino acid at the stop codon or via (−1) or (+1) frameshifting leading to the synthesis of proteins with C-terminal extensions. Although under our Api treatment conditions, we did not detect any significant accumulation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>), it remains possible that accumulation of proteins with C-terminal appendages could contribute to the antimicrobial activity of Api since these aberrant extensions may negatively affect the proteins’ catalytic capacity, ligand binding, or interactions with other polypeptides.</p><p>By allowing translation to proceed to the 3’ ends of mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) and by prompting some of the translating ribosomes to stall at the stop codons in a pre-release state, Api triggers the activation of the ribosome rescue systems. However, in the cells exposed to Api, the rescue systems are likely worthless. tmRNA-mediated rescue of stalled ribosomes relies on canonical translation termination at the UAA codon of the degron ORF in tmRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buskirk and Green, 2017</xref>). Yet, the lack of available RF1/RF2 in the Api-treated cells prevents the release of the degron-tagged protein, therefore sequestering tmRNA. The depletion of the available tmRNA pool leads to activation of the backup rescue systems, which nevertheless, should be also ineffectual in the Api-treated cells. ArfA facilitates translation termination at non-stop mRNAs by interacting with the empty A site of the small ribosomal subunit and promoting binding of RF2, which can then release the stalled protein. Once again, the lack of available RF2 in the Api-treated cells should prevent ArfA from carrying out its rescue mission. This idea is supported by the appearance of an exceedingly high ribosome density peak at the end of the non-stop <italic>arfA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), where the stalled ribosomes are expected to be released by the action of the ArfA protein itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garza-Sánchez et al., 2011</xref>). Despite acting independently from the primary RFs, the alternative RF ArfB, should be equally inconsequential because Api can also trap ArfB on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2020</xref>) and deplete its available pool. Thus, it appears that none of the known ways that the bacterial cell normally exploits for salvaging stalled ribosomes would be of much use when the translation is inhibited by Api. In agreement with this notion, the inactivation of any of the rescue systems does not sensitize <italic>E. coli</italic> to the Api action (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata7">Source data 7</xref>).</p><p>One of the unexpected aspects of Api action revealed by the in vivo studies is the increased ribosome occupancy of start codons of some genes. These effects could be related to the reported low affinity of Api for the ribosome with the vacant nascent peptide exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>). Once associated with the ribosome at the start codon, Api may block the first peptide bond formation by displacing the fMet moiety of the initiator tRNA in the P site or may interfere with the first act of translocation. Because the initiation effects could be observed in vitro only at very high concentrations of Api (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>), the Api-induced ribosome stalling at start codons in the cell could involve additional factors absent in the cell-free system or result from the accumulation of aberrant ribosomes.</p><p>On the basis of our findings, we can propose a model of Api action in the bacterial cell involving multiple, not necessarily sequential effects (numbered <italic>1</italic> to <italic>5</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The immediate effect of Api is arresting the ribosomes in the post-release state at stop codons and sequestering the available RF1/RF2 (<italic>1</italic>). Because ribosomes outnumber RFs, the depletion of available RFs leads to stalling of a fraction of the translating ribosomes at the stop codons in the pre-release state, with peptidyl-tRNA bound in the P-site and an empty A site (<italic>2</italic>). The trailing ribosomes that carry incomplete polypeptides form a stalled queue behind those trapped at the stop codons (<italic>3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>). A prolonged arrest of pre-release ribosomes at termination leads to the eventual bypass of stop codons via misincorporation of a near-cognate tRNA or frameshifting resulting in the synthesis of proteins with C-terminal extensions (<italic>4</italic>). Some of the ribosomes that bypassed the main ORF stop codon may ultimately reach the mRNA 3’ end. Accumulation of ribosomes with vacant A-site (stalled at the 3’ ends of the RNA transcripts or at the stop codons) triggers the massive but futile engagement of the ribosome rescue systems (<italic>5</italic>). The combination of these effects causes rapid and efficient cessation of translation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model of Api action in the bacterial cell.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62655-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Understanding the mode of Api action in the bacterial cell helps to rationalize the seeming discrepancy between its marginal effect on reporter expression in a cell-free system and the strong inhibition of translation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krizsan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krizsan et al., 2014</xref>). Exposure of cells to Api, leads to translation arrest at stop codons of multiple ORFs, ribosome queuing and depletion of available RFs resulting in a rapid halt of protein synthesis. By contrast, in cell-free systems, where only one type of mRNA is present, many mRNA molecules will be translated at least once before the Api-induced depletion of the RF pool, thereby resulting in poor inhibition of the reporter expression.</p><p>The use of Ribo-seq in combination with the translation initiation inhibitor retapamulin was instrumental in identifying translation start sites in bacteria, revealing a universe of cryptic protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). Ribo-seq, enhanced by the use of a translation termination inhibitor, could bolster our ability to detect the translated sequences in the bacterial genomes. Because the effects of Api are multifaceted and lead not only to translation arrest at the stop codons but also to ribosome queuing and stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), its immediate application for mapping translation termination sites could be challenging. Nevertheless, with additional tricks, for example, properly optimized Pmn treatment to remove queued and elongating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), Api could be repurposed for genome-wide analysis of stop codons of protein-coding regions. The use of Ribo-seq in combination with inhibitors of translation initiation and termination could provide new insights into the principles of genetic encoding and regulation of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

After analyzing the footprints at the start codons, the first position of the P-site codon was assigned 16 nt from the 3’ end of the read, in-line with the 15 nt offset previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Metagene analysis</title><p>The metagene analyses at the annotated start and stop regions followed the previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksashin et al., 2019</xref>). For the inclusion in the analysis, the well-separated ORFs had to satisfy three criteria in all four datasets (two control and two Api-treated biological replicates): (i) The ORF length is at least 300 nt, (ii) at least 5% of the positions within the coding sequence had assigned reads values above zero, and (iii) the average number of rpm per nt in an ORF is ≥0.005. Ribosome footprint density at each nucleotide was normalized to the average coverage of the entire ORF plus 50 nt up- and downstream. The mean of the normalized values was calculated and plotted for the regions around the start and stop codons of the ORF.</p><p>The metagene analysis of the first in-frame stop codons of the downstream regions was carried out using 3769 genes with such codons present within the 225 nt downstream of the annotated ORF. Normalized read coverage, calculated for each nucleotide within a 200 nt window centered around the last nucleotide of the downstream stop codons, was determined by dividing ribosome footprint coverage at each position by the maximum coverage value within the window. Normalized coverage was then summed for each position in the windows and plotted.</p><p>To analyze the metagene coverage at the 3’ termini of mRNAs, we first converted the 3’ termini coordinates reported in the <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dar and Sorek, 2018</xref>) to coordinates in the BL21 strain, used in this work. We then followed﻿ a similar normalization and summing procedure to that used in the first in-frame stop codon analysis. However, the window of nts for normalization included 100 upstream and 20 downstream of the mRNA 3’ termini.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calculation of stop codon- and readthrough scores</title><p>The well-separated genes included in the analysis were required to meet two criteria in all four datasets (two control and two Api-treated biological replicates): (i) they were separated from the upstream and downstream adjacent genes by at least 50 nt, and (ii) they have a coverage density of at least 0.1 reads per nt in the protein-coding sequence, excluding the first and last 9 nt of the ORF. The stop codon (SC) region was assigned as nine 3’-terminal nt of the ORF (the last two sense codons and the stop codon); the readthrough (RT) region encompassed 40 nt downstream from the ORF stop codon. The SC and RT scores were calculated by dividing the ribosome density within the SC region or the RT region, respectively, by the total ORF density. The mean SC and RT scores of each gene were used in further analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>Aliquots of the clarified cell lysates from the samples prepared for the Ribo-seq analysis (see above) were used to extract and analyze total RNA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksashin et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, total RNA was purified by acidic phenol extraction, short RNAs and rRNA were subtracted using the MEGAclear (Ambion) and MicrobEXPRESS (Ambion) kits, respectively, mRNA was fragmented via alkaline fragmentation and, after size-fractionation and isolating fragment sin the 15–45 nt range, converted to the library for next-generation sequencing.</p><p>The RNA-seq analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksashin et al., 2019</xref>).

the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Genome-wide effects of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin on translation termination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Rachel Green as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>We now have two reviews on your manuscript, one from myself, and the other from an expert in the field. While we normally would obtain three reviews, the congruence of these reviews was sufficient to return with a response. Overall, both reviewers appreciated the contribution that this work has the potential to make in defining the specificity and impact of apidaecin (Api) on bacterial ribosomes in living cells. Previous biochemical work from the group showed that Api traps deacylated tRNA in the P site, post peptide release, but where RFs remain bound in the A site. This work also showed that there was a broad shut down of termination in the lysates which was interpreted to reflect the sequestration of the RFs by the Api-bound ribosomes. This work uses ribosome profiling and mass spec to demonstrate that ribosomes do indeed accumulate (and stack) at stop codons in cells treated with Api, and that they occasionally read through the stop codon and generate new peptides (presumably those ribosomes that are stalled prior to peptide release). Overall, the work is strong but lacks much in the way of new insight into the role of Api in stopping translation. Both reviewers agreed that there are several points that would need to be addressed in order for this study to make novel contributions to our understanding. Given that addressing these points and the reviews below will require additional experimentation and is expected to take more than two months, the manuscript is being rejected at this time. However, please consider re-submitting to <italic>eLife</italic> if you are able to address the comments.</p><p>1) The analysis of specificity in Figure 3 seemed overstated. First, both reviewers were somewhat concerned that the SC metric included 3' UTR sequence in the analysis, given that readthrough on different mRNAs could be variable, and the location of next stop codon would also be variable, and that these features could differentially impact the SC values – also not sure that it makes any sense to include. A second concern was whether the differences in variance identified in panel B were real or rather were exaggerated by presentation of these data in linear rather than log format. Finally, it is critical that the motifs that appear to arise in the Api-treated cells don't show up in the untreated cells – otherwise it has nothing to do with Api and more to do with natural readthrough propensity transcriptome wide.</p><p>2) The collection of ribosomes at stop codons is likely heterogeneous – some are stalled with Api and an RF bound, the others contain peptidyl-tRNA and no RF. Yet these studies fail to separate these two classes and to analyze differences. Preparing ribosome profiling libraries with a salt wash would yield libraries enriched in ribosomes containing peptidyl-tRNAs. Alternatively, overexpression of RF1 might clear a subset of ribosomes and establish that the model is correct (not enough free RF1 to function in termination). The Pm experiment does not make sense. Why do ribosomes in the queue and the 3' UTR clear, but not at the stop codons. Those occupied by RFs might be resistant to Pm but those trapped by a lack of RF should be sensitive. These data make me concerned that the model is not correct.</p><p>3) Figuring out whether the overall model is correct should be possible using simple polysome analysis. The prediction is that RFs should be enriched in polysomal fractions when cells are treated with Api. This simple experiment could lend strong support to the models derived from in vitro experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript using ribosome profiling to characterize the impact of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin (Api) on bacterial ribosomes in living cells. Previous structural studies have shown that Api binds in the vacant nascent peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, approaching the PTC, but not directly occupying the catalytic site. Biochemical experiments in vitro showed that Api traps deacylated tRNA in the P site, post peptide release, but where the RFs remain bound in the A site. As such the ribosome is trapped in a post-release state, where the release of the nascent peptide allows binding of Api, thus trapping RF1/2 on the ribosome. However, it was also clear that treatment of lysates with Api led to the accumulation of peptidyl-RNAs, as though the actual release reaction were also inhibited. These ideas led to the model that trapping of RF1/2 on ribosomes would lead to its depletion in the cell and genome-wide build up of ribosomes at stop codons with no way to properly terminate. Here these models are tested.</p><p>The data presented are straightforward. The authors present ribosome profiling data with Api, with and without puromycin to independently release nascent peptides, and look at ribosome accumulation throughout the transcriptome. As anticipated, ribosomes accumulate at stop codons, and exhibit queuing behind the lead ribosome with a periodicity of about 27 nts. The authors analyze the stop codon (SC) peak size, observing broad increases for most genes, and then attempted to define some features that correlated with especially increased SC scores (including a Glycine residue at the terminal amino acid of the peptide chain, for example). The authors then characterized stop codon readthrough (RT) using the same data and the same types of analyses. Evidence for RT was corroborated by shotgun mass spec data revealing peptides that represent sequences found in the 3' UTRs. These were disproportionately in frame, though not dramatically so (and there was no statistical analysis to support this). These ideas were consistent with their initial model that depletion of RFs by Api stalled ribosomes would result in broad inhibition of termination, though those ribosomes would not be blocked per se by Api, and if they can escape the stop codon can continue elongating. The final section of the manuscript focuses on the regulation of various bacterial rescue pathways under treatment with Api, but arguing ultimately that none of these pathways can help deal with Api since all of them depend in some way on a termination reaction that utilizes a release factor or related protein (arfB), and this factor would similarly be inhibited by Api.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript was clearly written and presented some clear data on the mechanism of action of Api in vivo that is appealingly consistent with the models presented. However, the manuscript did not fully explore features of terminating ribosomes that might have better informed their models. The authors used Pm to show that elongating ribosomes were released from the ORF and to some extent from the 3'UTR (though many are left behind), though ribosomes at stop codons are resistant. These data are consistent with the idea that some ribosomes at the stop codon are bound by RF1/2 and are thus resistant to ribosome dissociation by Pm. The authors also argue however that there are different types of ribosomes stuck at stop codons.… those trapped with Api and those trapped because RF1/2 has been depleted. These should be differently sensitive to salt washing, as one class carries nascent peptide while the other does not. This experiment seems important since the analysis of the SC score will be confounded by these two populations of ribosomes, and so it is not clear whether the Glycine residue contributes to Api action on the stop codon or to preferential sensitivity to RF depletion. Another weakness of the manuscript is in the absence of any orthogonal approaches to define the model that they favor (depletion of RF1/2 on Api bound ribosomes). If RF1/2 are sequestered on ribosomes in the presence of Api, it seems likely that analysis of the distribution of RF1/2 on a polysome profile could provide strong support for such a model that would strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>The SC metric was defined by the ribosome density within the last three codons of the gene relative to average ORF density including the 40 nts of the 3 UTR downstream of the stop codon.

In yeast, stop codon peaks arise primarily from post-release ribosomes (meaning recycling is slow, see Schuller and Green, 2017).

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We now have two reviews on your manuscript, one from myself, and the other from an expert in the field. While we normally would obtain three reviews, the congruence of these reviews was sufficient to return with a response. Overall, both reviewers appreciated the contribution that this work has the potential to make in defining the specificity and impact of apidaecin (Api) on bacterial ribosomes in living cells. Previous biochemical work from the group showed that Api traps deacylated tRNA in the P site, post peptide release, but where RFs remain bound in the A site. This work also showed that there was a broad shut down of termination in the lysates which was interpreted to reflect the sequestration of the RFs by the Api-bound ribosomes. This work uses ribosome profiling and mass spec to demonstrate that ribosomes do indeed accumulate (and stack) at stop codons in cells treated with Api, and that they occasionally read through the stop codon and generate new peptides (presumably those ribosomes that are stalled prior to peptide release). Overall, the work is strong but lacks much in the way of new insight into the role of Api in stopping translation. Both reviewers agreed that there are several points that would need to be addressed in order for this study to make novel contributions to our understanding. Given that addressing these points and the reviews below will require additional experimentation and is expected to take more than two months, the manuscript is being rejected at this time. However, please consider re-submitting to eLife if you are able to address the comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for carefully examining our work. Following your recommendation, we are resubmitting to <italic>eLife</italic> the expanded and revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The analysis of specificity in Figure 3 seemed overstated. First, both reviewers were somewhat concerned that the SC metric included 3' UTR sequence in the analysis, given that readthrough on different mRNAs could be variable, and the location of next stop codon would also be variable, and that these features could differentially impact the SC values – also not sure that it makes any sense to include. A second concern was whether the differences in variance identified in panel B were real or rather were exaggerated by presentation of these data in linear rather than log format. Finally, it is critical that the motifs that appear to arise in the Api-treated cells don't show up in the untreated cells – otherwise it has nothing to do with Api and more to do with natural readthrough propensity transcriptome wide.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original SC metric was confusing and, following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have changed the scoring metrics. Specifically, we have excluded the 3’UTR reads calculating the new SC score by dividing the ribosome density (number of reads) at the last three codons by the total density in the entire ORF – from start to stop. Using the new metrics, the stop codon identity shows a milder effect upon the SC score and, therefore, we have deemphasized this point. Furthermore, to avoid the confusion noted by the reviewers, the data are now presented as a log<sub>2</sub> transformed violin plot and are shown not in the main text figure, but in Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>In addition, following the reviewers advise, we now include the pLogo analysis of the C-terminal amino acid sequences of the high-SC scoring genes not only for the Api sample, but also for the untreated control, all based on the new SC scoring metrics. In this case, the statistically significant difference still remains. The results are included in panel B of the revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The collection of ribosomes at stop codons is likely heterogeneous – some are stalled with Api and an RF bound, the others contain peptidyl-tRNA and no RF. Yet these studies fail to separate these two classes and to analyze differences. Preparing ribosome profiling libraries with a salt wash would yield libraries enriched in ribosomes containing peptidyl-tRNAs. Alternatively, overexpression of RF1 might clear a subset of ribosomes and establish that the model is correct (not enough free RF1 to function in termination). The Pm experiment does not make sense. Why do ribosomes in the queue and the 3' UTR clear, but not at the stop codons. Those occupied by RFs might be resistant to Pm but those trapped by a lack of RF should be sensitive. These data make me concerned that the model is not correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that it would be interesting to know the ratio of pre- and post-hydrolysis ribosomes at stop codons in the Api-treated cells. However, this is a difficult question to address experimentally. Although ribosome profiling with a high-salt wash is an interesting idea, it is unknown whether Api bound ribosomes, where tunnel-lodged Api interacts with the P-site tRNA and the A-site RF1/2 would be susceptible to salt-induced dissociation. Furthermore, because the approaches for computing stop codon occupancy (SC score or metagene) use relative, not absolute values, any changes resulting from salt wash could be difficult to interpret.</p><p>The other suggestion – to overexpress RF1 – is also interesting. However, for the aforementioned reasons it is also unlikely to clarify the ratio of the pre- and post release ribosome complexes at stop codons. Furthermore, overexpression of class 1 release factors is known to render cells more resistant to Api (Matsumoto et al., 2017); the MIC difference would make it difficult to find the conditions for an accurate comparison of Api effects upon wt and RF-overexpressing cells.</p><p>Being unable to address the ratio of pre-and post-release ribosomes experimentally, we instead calculated the fraction of the stop codon footprints relative to all the mapped footprints and found that ~11% of them map to stop codons in the Api-treated cells (as opposed to ~2% in the control). The resulting fraction of stop codon-associated ribosomes roughly equals the estimated number of cellular RFs (RF2, to be more precise), in exponentially growing cells. Therefore, we believe that most of the ribosomes found at stop codons are associated with RFs and thus, have released the nascent protein.</p><p>Accordingly, we have rectified our model by proposing that the majority of stop codon ribosomes are post-release and Api-bound. While this has not changed the implications of our model, it has clarified it and we are thankful for bringing these considerations to our attention. We added a new figure (Figure 6) to illustrate our model.</p><p>We believe that out metagene plot of the Pmn-treated Api sample does make perfect sense. We appreciate, however, that some of the confusion could stem from the apparent increase in the magnitude of the ribosome peak at stop codons upon Pmn treatment (former Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Because the drug is expected to remove the ribosomes stalled in a pre-release state, it is natural to expect that the stop codon peak should decrease when the lysates are treated with Pmn. However, our metagene metrics utilizes the <italic>relative</italic> occupancy, where the scores are computed as a fraction of ribosomes at each nucleotide within the analyzed window. Because Pmn removes a significant fraction of queued and 3’-UTR ribosomes, the fraction of ribosomes at stop codon increases even if some of them are removed by Pmn.To avoid such a confusion, in the revised figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) we use a cartoon to illustrate the ribosomes that are removed by Pmn and use the % of normalized RPM for the y axis. We further clarify this point in the text and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figuring out whether the overall model is correct should be possible using simple polysome analysis. The prediction is that RFs should be enriched in polysomal fractions when cells are treated with Api. This simple experiment could lend strong support to the models derived from in vitro experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great idea, although we have implemented it in a slightly different format. Instead of analyzing RFs in the polysome fractions, which could be difficult to interpret, we have instead tested the amount of free RF (RF2, to be precise) in the cytoplasm of the Api-treated cells. After lysing the cells and pelleting ribosomes through a sucrose cushion, we tested for the amount of free RF2 in the supernatant. While a robust RF2 band is evident in the supernatant of untreated control cells, free RF2 was essentially undetectable in the Api-treated cells.This result, which is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, strongly confirms our model that Api treatment leads to depletion of free class 1 RFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript using ribosome profiling to characterize the impact of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin (Api) on bacterial ribosomes in living cells. Previous structural studies have shown that Api binds in the vacant nascent peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, approaching the PTC, but not directly occupying the catalytic site. Biochemical experiments in vitro showed that Api traps deacylated tRNA in the P site, post peptide release, but where the RFs remain bound in the A site. As such the ribosome is trapped in a post-release state, where the release of the nascent peptide allows binding of Api, thus trapping RF1/2 on the ribosome. However, it was also clear that treatment of lysates with Api led to the accumulation of peptidyl-RNAs, as though the actual release reaction were also inhibited. These ideas led to the model that trapping of RF1/2 on ribosomes would lead to its depletion in the cell and genome-wide build up of ribosomes at stop codons with no way to properly terminate. Here these models are tested.</p><p>The data presented are straightforward. The authors present ribosome profiling data with Api, with and without puromycin to independently release nascent peptides, and look at ribosome accumulation throughout the transcriptome. As anticipated, ribosomes accumulate at stop codons, and exhibit queuing behind the lead ribosome with a periodicity of about 27 nts. The authors analyze the stop codon (SC) peak size, observing broad increases for most genes, and then attempted to define some features that correlated with especially increased SC scores (including a Glycine residue at the terminal amino acid of the peptide chain, for example). The authors then characterized stop codon readthrough (RT) using the same data and the same types of analyses. Evidence for RT was corroborated by shotgun mass spec data revealing peptides that represent sequences found in the 3' UTRs. These were disproportionately in frame, though not dramatically so (and there was no statistical analysis to support this). These ideas were consistent with their initial model that depletion of RFs by Api stalled ribosomes would result in broad inhibition of termination, though those ribosomes would not be blocked per se by Api, and if they can escape the stop codon can continue elongating. The final section of the manuscript focuses on the regulation of various bacterial rescue pathways under treatment with Api, but arguing ultimately that none of these pathways can help deal with Api since all of them depend in some way on a termination reaction that utilizes a release factor or related protein (arfB), and this factor would similarly be inhibited by Api.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript was clearly written and presented some clear data on the mechanism of action of Api in vivo that is appealingly consistent with the models presented. However, the manuscript did not fully explore features of terminating ribosomes that might have better informed their models. The authors used Pm to show that elongating ribosomes were released from the ORF and to some extent from the 3'UTR (though many are left behind), though ribosomes at stop codons are resistant. These data are consistent with the idea that some ribosomes at the stop codon are bound by RF1/2 and are thus resistant to ribosome dissociation by Pm. The authors also argue however that there are different types of ribosomes stuck at stop codons.… those trapped with Api and those trapped because RF1/2 has been depleted.

This experiment seems important since the analysis of the SC score will be confounded by these two populations of ribosomes, and so it is not clear whether the Glycine residue contributes to Api action on the stop codon or to preferential sensitivity to RF depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe we have addressed most of these concerns in our comments above. As we indicated, we do not have a convincing way to assess the fraction of pre-and post-release ribosomes stalled at stop codons in the Api-treated cells, but our estimates based on the profiling data argue that the majority of them are stalled in the post-release Api-bound state. Nevertheless, we are not sure we have sufficient data to conclude whether C-terminal glycine increases the fraction of pre-or post-release ribosomes and we openly state this in the revised manuscript (subsection “Api treatment leads to pervasive stop codon readthrough”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness of the manuscript is in the absence of any orthogonal approaches to define the model that they favor (depletion of RF1/2 on Api bound ribosomes).

Nevertheless, we respectfully disagree that our data are largely confirmatory. Firstly, prior to this work, most of what we knew about Api action came from in vitro biochemical experiments or microbiological MIC testing and the proposed models required large leaps of faith. The previous in vitro experiments, which involved artificial substrates, unnatural settings, and non-translating ribosomes were incapable to reveal or even predict the range and magnitude of the in vivo effects. Indeed, neither the pronounced ribosome queuing, nor the massive stop codon readthrough and synthesis of the extended proteins could be revealed in vitro. As an illustration, on the basis of the published biochemical data, we and others thought that Api could be directly used for mapping translation termination sites genome-wide. Little did we know! It is only with our new data that we could think of possible approaches, e.g. Pmn treatment, that could be exploited for achieving such a goal. Similarly, translation all the way to the mRNA 3’ ends and the massive, but futile, engagement of the rescue systems were practically impossible to predict. Thus, we think that our study significantly advances the understanding of how a specific inhibitor of translation termination affects global cellular translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few concerns about the analyses as described below. In particular, they should test whether effects seen on UGA and other nearby sequence features are specific to Api or are more generally true during translational termination.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. Indeed, after implementing the new scoring metric, we realized that firstly, the UGA-specific effects are less strong than we originally thought and secondly, they generally match the trend observed in the untreated cells. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we have significantly deemphasized the stalling effect at the UGA codons. On the other hand, the influence of C-terminal glycine appears to be authentic and Api-specific (revised Figure 3B). The comparison with the untreated control, which following the reviewer’s suggestion we have introduced in the revised manuscript, helps to make this point stronger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Api acts as a global inhibitor of translation termination”: The authors state the increase in the stop codon peak shows that Api is &quot;a potent global inhibitor of translation termination.&quot; It is possible that the peak at stop codons comes from pre-release ribosomes or post-release ribosomes that have not yet been recycled.
