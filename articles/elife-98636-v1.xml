Identification of human stem cells being able to regenerate tendon will greatly facilitate the development of regenerative medicine for tendon injury. Genetic and functional analyses identify human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors with tenogenic differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse muscle stem cells is minimal and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.

MuSCs are adult stem cells located at the periphery of myofibers between the basal lamina and the plasmalemma of the myofibers and responsible for muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Relaix et al., 2021</xref>). MuSCs have been considered to be unipotent stem cells to have a sole differentiation potential to myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seale et al., 2001</xref>). MuSCs undergo expansion and differentiate to multinuclei myofibers after injury in vivo. MuSCs have remarkable abilities to support muscle regeneration. After transplantation, the engrafted mouse MuSCs go through active expansion and regenerate myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2005</xref>). Isolation by FACS and expansion of MuSCs have been reported from several species, including mouse, pig, and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2023</xref>). Single-cell sequencing analysis from human skeletal muscles has also revealed the existence of Pax7+ myogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barruet et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the different motion patterns, the regeneration capacity may be different between humans and rodents. Current investigations have suggested that human myogenic progenitor cells did not share same markers as that in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boldrin et al., 2010</xref>), and the expression pattern of oxidative enzymes and cytokines between these two species is also different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bareja et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that human muscle progenitor cells may have distinct features from mice.</p><p>FACS method to isolate cells with myogenic differentiation potential from human muscle biopsies has been established. It has been reported that CD56 (NCAM)+ and CD56+CD29+ cells from skeletal muscle display myogenic differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bareja et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spinazzola and Gussoni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pisani et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The CD56+CD34+ progenitor cells isolated from human skeletal muscle biopsies have been reported to have chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic potentials besides myogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castiglioni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pisani et al., 2010a</xref>). CD56+CD34- progenitor cells are free of adipogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pisani et al., 2010b</xref>). The differentiation potential of human myogenic progenitors remains to be further explored.</p><p>Skeletal muscle directly connects to tendons, which is responsible for transmitting forces from skeletal muscle to bone to generate active movement. Tendinopathy affects more than 10% of the population under 45 and compromises the tendon functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voleti et al., 2012</xref>). Tendon injury healing is slow and incomplete due to the low number of cells in the tendon and the hypovascular and anaerobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korcari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pennisi, 2002</xref>). Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TDSCs) is a cell population derived from tendon and considered to be a subgroup of mesenchymal stem cells that have abilities to improve tendon injury healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kohler et al., 2013</xref>). However, the number of TDSCs in the tendon is low, and retrieving TDSCs is invasive and exacerbates tendon injury. Morphology and proliferation ability loss in the culture system also hampers the efforts to obtain sufficient amounts of active TDSCs. Finding more cell types supporting tendon regeneration will facilitate the development of regenerative medicine to treat tendon injury.</p><p>The activity of tenogenesis is tightly regulated by many signaling pathways, especially for TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nourissat et al., 2015</xref>). TGFβ signaling is indispensable for tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>), and it could systematically promote the tenogenic differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barsby and Guest, 2013</xref>). The downstream effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 are able to activate the transcription of tendon-specific genes, which further facilitates tendon development and tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nourissat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berthet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). After tendon injury, TGFβ signaling promotes the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of TDSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2021</xref>), increases tendon collagen synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">You et al., 2020</xref>), and contributes to matrix anabolism for tendon remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors exhibit tenogenic differentiation capacity in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors to injured tendon in mice improved the tendon regeneration, suggesting its bipotential ability. Interestingly, the tendon differentiation potential in mouse MuSCs is minimal, and the higher TGFβ signaling level may be the key for the distinct feature of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CD29+/CD56+ cells isolated from human muscle biopsies display robust features of myogenic progenitors</title><p>To analyze the cell components of human skeletal muscle, single-cell sequencing analysis was performed using skeletal muscle biopsy. A total of 57,193 cells were included for analysis. The cells were grouped to nine cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Consistent with the previous single-cell sequencing results from human muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rubenstein et al., 2020</xref>), fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), endothelial cells, myocytes, and myogenic progenitors were among the identified cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Especially, myogenic progenitors accounted for 12.4% of all the mononuclear cells, while tenocytes only accounted for 0.06% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). To investigate the identity of CD29+/CD56+ cells, joint expression analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The scRNA-seq data revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). However, there existed no tenocytes with CD29+/CD56+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Since the Achilles tendon transmits the plantarflexion force from gastrocnemius muscle to calcaneus, the plantarflexion force of involved leg was also performed 2 months after tendon injury. Expectedly, transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors for the injured tendon also contributed to improving both twitch and tetanus plantarflexion force when compared with the PBS injection control group, although the plantarflexion force could still not reach the level of the uninjured leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Interestingly, TGFβ signaling was identified in KEGG enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors when compared with murine MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), indicating that TGFβ signaling could be the key node for maintaining the tendon differentiation potential.

Transplantation of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors contributes to injured tendon repair and thus improves locomotor function. Thus, the human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors could serve as a new source for tendon regeneration.</p><p>Tendon disorders widely occur in people of all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nourissat et al., 2015</xref>). It disrupts the stability and mobility of joint, which deeply affects their locomotor function and quality of life. However, the natural healing of injured tendon is very slow due to hypocellularity and hypovascularity of tendon. The biomechanical property and structural integrity could be hardly completely recovered even with surgical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). It is still a great challenge in clinical work to treat tendon injury.</p><p>The relative inefficient outcome of routine therapy for tendon injury sparked the exploration of stem cell treatment. Seed cells with the ability to differentiate into tenocytes and secrete paracrine factors to repair tendon injury are preferred. Thus, tendon-derived stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells have been introduced as seed cells to treat tendon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lui, 2015</xref>). However, inadequate sources of tendon-derived stem cells, ethical issue and risk of teratoma formation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cell, and heterogeneity of mesenchymal stem cells limit the development of these seed cells for tendon injury treatment. As for muscle progenitors, it is high in proliferation and abundant in sources, and donor site morbidity after muscle harvest was low. Thus, myogenic progenitors might be a promising candidate as seed cells for tendon repair.</p><p>The differentiation potential of MuSCs was found to be species-dependent. Human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors are bipotential adult stem cells. In contrast, murine MuSCs barely have tendon differentiation potential. The species difference might be due to the higher TGFβ signaling level in human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. It has been reported that TGFβ/SMAD2/SMAD3 axis plays a crucial role in tendon development and tenogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nourissat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berthet et al., 2013</xref>). SMAD2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling also acts as a crucial molecular brake for myogenesis. It could suppress myogenic regulatory factors Myod1 and Myogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennan et al., 1991</xref>), as well as inhibit myotube fusion and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melendez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girardi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the elevated TGFβ signaling may help inhibit the myogenic differentiation ability and stimulate the tenogenic differentiation potential of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors under specific microenvironment.</p><p>Studies using mouse models contributed to the majority of our knowledge about MuSCs and laid the foundation for our understanding of mammalian MuSCs. However, humans are dramatically different from mice in many aspects such as size, life span, and manner of motion. It is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in a much longer life span and a bigger body size. Though our knowledge about human muscle regeneration is limited, the current studies have revealed multiple differentiation potentials of Pax7+ human myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscles. CD56+CD34+progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been reported to have myogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castiglioni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pisani et al., 2010a</xref>). The CD56+CD34- progenitor cells in human skeletal muscle have been shown to be free of adipogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pisani et al., 2010b</xref>). Our results suggest that the CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscles also have tenogenic differentiation ability besides their myogenic differentiation ability. It seems that there are multiple subpopulations of myogenic progenitors in skeletal muscle. They are all capable of muscle regeneration, while with potential to regenerate other components of the motion system such as bone, tendon, and adipocytes. This could be an economic method to maintain the functions of the motion system for the longer life span and more complicated motion manner in human beings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal care and use were in accordance with the guidelines of the animal facility hosted by Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and the operations were approved by the ethical committee of Xinhua Hospital affiliated to the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (approval no.

progenitors were first sorted in 96-well plates with density of single cell per well. Tenogenic induction or myogenic induction was performed after proliferation for each well. After induction, the immunofluorescence staining of SCX or MyHC was performed in each well. The differentiation efficiency was determined by calculating the ratio of total wells with positive fluorescence signal to total wells with alive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, cat# 15596-018) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. mRNA was enriched with magnetic oligo (dT) beads (New England Biolabs, cat# S1419S). The cDNA library was constructed with mean inserts of 200 bp with non-stranded library preparation using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, cat# E7530L). Sequencing was performed by a paired-end 125 cycles rapid run on the Illumina HiSeq2500. Sequencing data were filtered by SolexaAQ (Q&gt;20 and length ≥25 bp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2010</xref>). The adapter sequences and low-quality segments (Phred Quality Score&lt;20) were trimmed using Cutadapt. Paired-end clean reads were then mapped to the reference genome GRCh38.98 using HISAT2. Htseq-count was used to quantify the gene expression value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Read count of each gene was normalized using FPKM (fragments per kilo bases per million fragments). Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed using DESeq, and significant DE genes were defined as those with absolute log2FoldChange &gt;1 and p&lt;0.05. Heatmap and volcano plot of DE genes were generated using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html">R package Pheatmap</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EnhancedVolcano/inst/doc/EnhancedVolcano.html">EnhancedVolcano</ext-link>, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted using R package topGO, with p&lt;0.05 as the cut-off. The differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data between human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors and mouse MuSCs was performed according to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell transplantation in TA muscle</title><p>A single dose of 18 Grey irradiation was administered to the hind legs of the recipient NOD/SCID mice. TA muscle was injured by injecting 15 μl of 10 μM CTX (Sigma), and 50,000 human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors or 50,000 murine MuSCs suspended in 10 μl PBS were injected intramuscularly to the injury site as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Tendon injury for lineage tracing</title><p>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>:Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice were obtained and MuSC was labeled with tdTomato as aforementioned. A mouse surgical model was established using dedicated instruments to replicate procedures analogous to previously reported human tendon surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shao et al., 2020</xref>). Firstly, distal gastrocnemius tendon was woven with a 6-0 polypropylene non-absorbable suture (PROLENE, cat# EH7242H) and released by microsurgical scissor. Then, a dedicated mini tendon stripper was introduced over the free end of distal medial gastrocnemius tendon. The medial gastrocnemius tendon could be totally removed after advancement of tendon stripper. To further activate MuSCs to guarantee that sufficient amount of activated MuSCs were available around the tendon injury site, 15 μl of 10 μM CTX CTX was injected at the muscle adjacent to the sites where the tendon was removed to induce more muscle injuries and further activate MuSCs. Then the subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Tendon injury and cell transplantation</title><p>An approximately 1.5 mm long and 0.5 mm wide transverse incision was performed at 5 mm from the calcaneus in Achilles tendon for recipient NOD/SCID mice. 50,000 human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors or mouse MuSCs resuspended in 20 μl hydrogel were injected to the injury site with 28-gauge needles. PBS mixed with 20 μl hydrogel were injected as control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Biomechanical analysis</title><p>Two months after tendon injury, the tendons were harvested to biomechanical analysis using a universal tester (Instron 3345 load system, USA). The grippers were gradually moved apart with the speed of 5 mm/min until the tested tendon was completely ruptured. Then the max load was obtained and documented. The slope of the stress–strain curve was defined as stiffness. All these data were automatically presented in Instron 3345 load system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>TEM examination</title><p>After washing the selected target tendon tissues with PBS, tissue fixation was performed for more than 2 hr. Post-fixation was conducted by 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> (Ted Pella Inc) in 0.1 M PB for 1–2 hr. Then dehydration and drying were performed, and target tendon samples were subsequently attached to metallic stubs for conductive metal coating. Images were obtained by TEM (HITACHI, SU8100), and at least 1000 collagen fibrils were evaluated for each sample. Density of fibrils was evaluated by the percentage of collagen fibril-containing area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Treadmill test</title><p>Mouse treadmill test was performed in Exer-3/6 treadmill apparatus with electrical stimulus. Treadmill exercise began with a 5 min warm-up, then each mouse was evaluated with specific protocol. For endurance test, mice ran on the treadmill at the constant speed of 22 m/min until exhaustion. For exhaustion test, the treadmill speed was increased (2 m/min each 3 min) at the beginning speed at 18 m/min until exhaustion. Exhaustion was defined as inability to run on the treadmill for longer than10 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>In vivo muscle force analysis</title><p>The 1300A 3-in-1 whole animal system (Aurora Scientific) was used for in vivo muscle force analysis. Mice were first anesthetized and kept warm by a heat lamp. The foot was placed on a footplate and kept perpendicular to the tibia. The peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve was stimulated to evaluate the plantarflexion strength. Five repetitive tests were performed for each limb, and DMA software (Aurora Scientific) was used for results analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>At least three biological replicates and technical repeats were performed in each experimental group. All experiments were analyzed and evaluated by investigators in a blinded manner. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used when variances were similar (tested with F-test) for comparison of two independent groups. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-test or Tukey’s post-test were used for multiple comparisons. Shapiro–Wilk tests were performed to determine data normality. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) or SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Data were presented as mean ± standard unless stated otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was approved by the ethical committee of Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine (Approval No. XHEC-D-2019-043) and written informed consents were obtained from all donors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Approval No. XHEC-F-2021-011).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98636-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The complete sequencing data have been uploaded on to Sequence Read Archive database (PRJNA1178160, PRJNA1012476 and PRJNA1012828).

The revised version of the current manuscript is solid now. It's very interesting that there is bi-potential ability of human CD29/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.

The finding that 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation, may instead suggest heterogeneity of the sorted progenitor population. The methods as currently described, suggest that two different plates were subject to different induction conditions. It is therefore difficult to assess the strength of the claim of bi-potency.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comment. We are sorry for the confusing illustration of colony assay. In fact, we first obtained CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors by FACs. Then these freshly isolated cells were randomly seeded to 96-well plate with density of 1 cell/well. Subsequently, the single cell in each plate was cultured with growth medium to form colonies for ten days. Then myogenic induction was performed in three 96-well plates and tenogenic induction was performed in another three 96-well plates for subsequent analyses. We agree with your point that the sorted cell population could be heterogeneous myogenic progenitors. The result showed over 95% colonies successfully differentiated into myotubes, while 40% of colonies displayed tenogenic differentiation (Fig. 2g). Since the freshly obtained CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors were randomly seeded for tenogenic induction or myogenic induction, the undifferentiated cells in each group were considered as the same sample. Furthermore, the optimal tenogenic differentiation condition for these cells was still waiting for investigation. Thus, we believe the colony analysis combined with the data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 could indicate the bi-potency for human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This group uses the well-established CD56+/CD29+ sorting strategy to isolate muscle progenitor cells, however recent work has identified transcriptional heterogeneity within these human satellite cells (ie Barruet et al, eLife 2020). Given that they identify a tenocyte population in their human muscle biopsy in Figure 1a, it is critical to understand the heterogeneity contained within the population of human progenitors captured by the authors' FACS strategy and whether tenocytes contained within the muscle biopsy are also CD56+/CD29+.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have included more samples to perform scRNA-seq and reanalyzed the data. The scRNA-seq data revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors (Fig. 1e). However, there existed no tenocytes with CD29+/CD56+ (Fig. 1d), and tenocytes made up only a small percentage (0.06%) of all the mononuclear cells. Thus, human CD29+/CD56+ cells are myogenic progenitors, and tenocytes contained within the muscle biopsy are not CD56+/CD29+. In addition, both published research and our results indicated the heterogeneity of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. Since the main purpose of current study was to investigate the tenogenic differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, the heterogeneity in CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors should be investigated in the further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The bulk RNA sequencing data presented in Figure 3 to contrast the expression of progenitor cells under different differentiation conditions are not sufficiently convincing. In particular, it is unclear whether more than one sample was used for the RNAseq analyses shown in Figure 3. The volcano plots have many genes aligned on distinct curves suggesting that there are few replicates or low expression. There is also a concern that the sorted cells may contain tenocytes as tendon genes SCX, MKX, and THBS4 were among the genes upregulated in the myogenic differentiation conditions (shown in Figure 3b).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. Each group consisted of three samples for RNAseq analyses. We are sorry there existed a minor analysis mistake in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c, which have been reanalyzed in the revised version. There was no significantly difference of tendon related marker genes after myogenic differentiation (Fig. 3b), while these tenogenic genes were significantly up-regulated after tenogenic induction (Fig. 3c). As for contamination of tenocytes, scRNA-seq data showed there were no tenocytes with both CD29 and CD56 positive (please see response to Comment 2). And almost all the obtained cells highly expressed myogenic progenitors markers PAX7/MYOD1/MYF5 (Fig. 1f-g). Low expression levels of tendon markers were identified in these cells (Fig. 2a-c). Furthermore, although tendon genes slightly upregulated in myogenic differentiation conditions, these markers dramatically upregulated in tenogenic differentiation conditions (Fig. 2c). Thus, we believe the bulk RNA sequencing data could add the evidence of tenogenic differentiation ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>scRNAseq assay using total mononuclear cell population did not provide meaningful insight that enriched knowledge on CD56+/CD29+ cell population. CD56+/CD29+ cells information may have been lost due to the minority identity of these cells in the total skeletal muscle mononuclear population, especially given the total cell number used for scRNAseq was very low and no information on participant number and repeat sample number used for this assay. Using this data to claim a stem cell lineage relationship for MuSCs and tenocytes may not convincing, as seeing both cell types in the total muscle mononuclear population does not establish a lineage connection between them.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. We have included more samples to perform scRNA-seq and reanalyzed the data. Three samples with a total of 57,193 cells were included for analysis. As you can see in Fig. 1d and 1e, the joint expression analysis revealed that all the CD29+/CD56+ cells were myogenic progenitors, which occupied 19.3% of all the myogenic progenitors. In addition, we agree with your comment that the pseudotime analysis could be a bit misleading as the nature of computational biology with pseudotime plots, so we deleted this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The TGF-b pathway assay uses a small molecular inhibitor of TGF-b to probe Smad2/3. The assay conclusion regarding Smad2/3 pathway responsible for tenocyte differentiation may be overinterpretation without Smad2/3 specific inhibitors being applied in the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment.

We have explored the tenogenic differentiation potential of mouse MuSCs both in vivo and in vitro. However, low tenogenic differentiation ability was revealed (Figure 4), which might be due to species diversity. Maybe it is more demanding for humans to maintain the homeostasis of the locomotion system and the whole organism locomotion ability in much longer life span and bigger body size. Thus, the current study also indicated that anima studies may not clinically relevant when investigating human diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The methods section contained insufficient details for sample tissue for many methods, including the single cell analysis, RNA FISH, and for in vivo cardiotoxin treatment. ie. how were the samples subclustered for the monocle pseudotime analysis; how many cells were counted in the FISH shown in Fig 1e/f, does the n=5 refer to tissue sections or biological replicates?; for the double injury, what was the cardiotoxin dose?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. Three samples and a total 57,193 cells were analyzed in single cell analysis (Line 464). We deleted RNA FISH assay data because it provided limited information to prove bipotential ability of human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. In addition, since the pseudotime analysis could be a bit misleading as the nature of computational biology with pseudotime plots, we also deleted this assay.

Pax7 positive cells could consistently express TdTomato for lineage tracing. In current study, large amount of tdTomato+ myofibers were observed after muscle injury (SFig. 2c-d), suggesting that the tracing system works well. However, less than 0.2% tendon cells originated from TdTomato+ MuSCs were observed even four months after tendon removal (Fig. 4f-g). When comparing in vivo data between murine MuSCs and human CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, we believe these data could indicate the poor tendon differentiation abilities of murine MuSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) TGFb as a pathway of smad2/3 mediated tenocyte differentiation assays were well done albeit not novel.

The current study focused on the tenogenic differentiation potential of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, so the research priority was the bipotential ability of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors. We agree with you that chondrogenic and osteogenic ability of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors is also important and would investigate it in the further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 3, the GO analysis also shows increased enrichment of muscle-related terms including muscle contraction and filament. Please clarify it.</p></disp-quote><p>The tenogenic differentiation efficiency of CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors was about 40% in clonal assay. Some cells would myogenically differentiated under this tenogenic induction system. Thus, the GO analysis could also enrich muscle related terms including muscle contraction and filament.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use TNC staining to evaluate cell transplantation. My concern is whether the TNC expression is specific to the tendon site, or do engrafted human cells also express TNC in other sites such as muscle?</p></disp-quote><p>TNC is one of a well-known tendon-related markers. As you can see in Figure 6b and Figure 6c, although some human cells (labeled by Lamin A/C) were engrafted in muscle tissue area (labeled by MyHC), these engrafted human cells didn’t express TNC in muscle. In addition, we also used tendon related markers SCX and TNMD to confirm the tenogenic differentiation ability of engrafted human cells in vivo (SFig. 3a and 3b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors demonstrate that CD29+/CD56+ human stem/progenitor cells could efficiently transplant and contribute to myofiber regeneration in vivo. However, why were only a few transplanted human cells differentiating into myofiber (labeled by MyHC) in the tenon injury model even with CTX injection?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. Since skeletal muscle is able to regenerate with in situ muscle progenitor cells, regeneration of injured muscle by CTX injection was dependent on not only CD29+/CD56+ myogenic progenitors, but also native murine MuSCs. Thus, it is reasonable that there were only a few transplanted human cells differentiating into myofiber (labeled by MyHC) in the tenon injury model even with CTX injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 7 shows the crucial role of TGFB/SMAD signaling for the tenogenesis of human CD29+/CD56+ stem/progenitor cells. However, can TGFB/SMAD signaling activation facilitate the tenogenic differentiation of mouse MuSCs? This point is crucial to clarify the difference of MuSCs between different species.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We did a series of pilot assays to investigate the effect of TGFβ signaling activation to facilitate tenogenic differentiation of mouse MuSCs (Author response image 1). As you can see, activating TGFβ by SRI-011381 could slightly increase the expression of tenogenic markers of murine MuSCs. It’s an interesting topic and we would investigate it in the further study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>TGFβ signaling pathway slightly elevated tenogenic differentiation ability of murine MuSCs.</title><p>(a) Immunofluorescence staining of tendon marker Scx and Tnc in murine MuSCs induced for tenogenic differentiation with or without TGFβ signaling pathway agonist SRI-011381, respectively.
