Upon light irradiation, vertebrate rhodopsin forms a metastable active state, which cannot revert back to the original dark state via either photoreaction or thermal reaction. By contrast, after photoreception, most opsins form a stable active state which can photoconvert back to the dark state. Moreover, we recently found a novel type of opsins whose activity is regulated by photocycling. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this diversification of opsins remains unknown. In this study, we showed that vertebrate rhodopsin acquired the photocyclic and photoreversible properties upon introduction of a single mutation at position 188. This revealed that the residue at position 188 contributes to the diversification of photoreaction properties of opsins by its regulation of the recovery from the active state to the original dark state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>retinal</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H02515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shichida</surname><given-names>Yoshinori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K21848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imamoto</surname><given-names>Yasushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K07437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004094</institution-id><institution>Kyoto University Education and Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Through a single mutation at position 188, vertebrate rhodopsin acquires the ability to recover the dark state from the active state by a thermal reaction and by a photoreaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opsins are photosensitive G-protein-coupled receptors and are universally found in diploblastic and triploblastic animals. All opsins share common structural elements including seven transmembrane domains and bind a light-absorbing chromophore, retinal, via a Schiff base linkage to Lys296 (based on the bovine rhodopsin numbering system) of opsin. Opsins function for both visual and nonvisual photoreception and are classified into several groups based on their amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shichida and Matsuyama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2014</xref>). Bovine rhodopsin is the best-studied opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yau and Hardie, 2009</xref>) and it functions as a visual photoreceptive protein in the retina and binds 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal in the dark. Photoisomerization of retinal to the all-<italic>trans</italic> form produces the meta II intermediate of rhodopsin, which couples with G protein. Meta II is a metastable active state and spontaneously converts to meta III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heck et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, light irradiation of meta II induces the formation of meta III rather than the original dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ritter et al., 2008</xref>). That is, the active state meta II very inefficiently converts back to the original dark state by photoreaction or thermal reaction. These observations show that vertebrate rhodopsin is specialized for photoactivation, and is thus characterized as a monostable opsin. By contrast, mollusk and arthropod rhodopsins form a stable active state, the acid-meta state, by photoisomerization of 11-<italic>cis</italic> to all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal, and the active state can photoconvert back to the original dark state, which contains 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yau and Hardie, 2009</xref>). That is, these opsins have two stable states, the dark and active states, which are interconvertible by light and thus are known as bistable opsins. Recent accumulation of knowledge about the molecular properties of opsins revealed that many members of various opsin groups are bistable opsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which suggests that vertebrate rhodopsin evolved as a monostable opsin from an ancestral bistable opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shichida and Matsuyama, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we identified a novel type of opsin, Opn5L1, as a photocycle opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Opn5L1 binds all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal, not 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, to form the active state in the dark. Light irradiation suppresses the G protein activation ability of Opn5L1 by the photoisomerization of the retinal to 11-<italic>cis</italic> form. Subsequent formation of a covalent adduct between the retinal and Cys188 of the opsin induces the conversion of the C11 = C12 double bond to a single bond in the retinal. Afterward, the thermal rotation of the C11–C12 single bond in the retinal results in dissociation of the Cys188-retinal adduct and regeneration of the original dark state. The combination of photoisomerization and thermal isomerization of retinal regulates the ability of Opn5L1 to activate G protein, making this the first animal opsin whose activity is controlled by its photocyclic reaction.</p><p>Comparison of the amino acid sequences among opsins shows that the cysteine residue at position 188 is well conserved in the Opn5L1 group but rarely found in other opsin groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamashita, 2020</xref>), which supports the importance of Cys188 for the unique photocyclic reaction of Opn5L1. On the other hand, vertebrate rhodopsin and cone pigments, which are characterized as monostable opsins, have a glycine residue at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In this study, we analyzed whether the mutation at position 188 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) can make bovine rhodopsin photocyclic. Our detailed analysis revealed that G188C mutant photoconverted to the active state, meta II, which thermally recovered to the original dark state. In addition, light irradiation of meta II of G188C mutant induced reversion to the original dark state. Therefore, G188C mutant of bovine rhodopsin exhibits the photocyclic and photoreversible property and the residue at position 188 regulates the recovery from the active state to the original dark state in vertebrate rhodopsin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acquisition of photocyclic property of bovine rhodopsin G188C mutant</title><p>In a previous report, we revealed that Opn5L1 possesses a cysteine residue at position 188, which underlies the photocyclic reaction of the opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, to analyze whether G188C mutant of bovine rhodopsin acquires the photocyclic property, we purified G188C mutant after reconstitution with 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal. However, we found that G188C mutant has much lower thermal stability than wild-type. That is, G188C mutant gradually decayed during incubation in the dark at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas wild-type was quite stable under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we improved the thermal stability of G188C mutant to analyze the detailed molecular properties of the mutant. Following previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Standfuss et al., 2007</xref>), we introduced two cysteine residues (N2C/D282C) into the mutant and measured the thermal decay rate during incubation in the dark at 37°C. The time-dependent spectral changes showed that this G188C/N2C/D282C mutant decayed much more slowly than G188C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we compared the spectral changes among wild-type, N2C/D282C and G188C/N2C/D282C mutant at 20°C. The spectrum of wild-type was shifted into the UV region after yellow light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which is indicative of the formation of meta II intermediate containing all-<italic>trans</italic>-15-<italic>anti</italic> retinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Subsequently, the absorbance at around 470 nm increased, which indicated the transition from meta II to meta III intermediate containing all-<italic>trans</italic>-15-<italic>syn</italic> retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vogel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These spectral changes were also observed in N2C/D282C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) as noted in the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, G188C/N2C/D282C mutant had the absorption maximum (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>) at 487 nm and its spectrum was also shifted into the UV region to form meta II by yellow light irradiation. During subsequent incubation in the dark, decreased absorbance in the UV region and a concomitant increase of the absorbance at around 485 nm were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Analysis of the retinal configurations showed that light irradiation triggered the isomerization of the retinal to the all-<italic>trans</italic> form, which converted back to the 11-<italic>cis</italic> form during the subsequent incubation in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This interconversion of the retinal isomers can explain the spectral change of G188C/N2C/D282C mutant after light irradiation. Thermal recovery of the original dark state after light irradiation was also observed at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, G188C mutant showed thermal recovery of the absorption spectrum of the original dark state after light irradiation at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which was confirmed by an increase of the amount of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal during the incubation after light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that G188C mutation led to acquisition of the ability to thermally recover the original dark state from the photoactivated state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Thermal recovery of bovine rhodopsin G188C mutant after yellow light irradiation.</title><p>Thermal stability of wild-type (<bold>A</bold>) and G188C (<bold>B</bold>) and G188C/N2C/D282C (<bold>C</bold>) mutants of bovine rhodopsin purified after the incubation with 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal.

The numbers show the distances in Å. The previous mutational analysis revealed that Glu113 and Glu181 work as counterions to stabilize the protonation of the Schiff base in the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sakmar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhukovsky and Oprian, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nathans, 1990</xref>) and meta I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lüdeke et al., 2005</xref>), a precursor of meta II, respectively. In these structural models, Cys188 can be located in the vicinity of the C11 = C12 position of the retinal and Glu181.

This was probably because meta II of G188C mutant is thermally unstable and is decomposed into all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal and apo-protein in addition to reverting to the original dark state during the incubation after light irradiation, which was confirmed by the acid denaturation experiment (<bold>D</bold>). (<bold>D</bold>) Acid denaturation of G188C mutant samples in the dark and after yellow light (&gt;500 nm) irradiation.

Spectrum recorded in the dark was normalized to be ~1.0 at <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>. Moreover, spectra of G188C mutant were recorded after acid denaturation by the addition of HCl to meta II formed just after yellow light irradiation (curve 3) and to the original dark state converted from meta II during 60-min incubation after yellow light irradiation (curve 4).

Thus, in response to light and heat, meta II exhibits greater conversion from all-<italic>trans</italic>-15-<italic>anti</italic> to all-<italic>trans</italic>-15-<italic>syn</italic> retinal than from all-<italic>trans</italic> to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal and recovers to the original dark state very inefficiently. By contrast, G188C mutant can revert to the original dark state from meta II much more efficiently than wild-type, possibly as a result of the preferential isomerization from all-<italic>trans</italic> to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal within the chromophore-binding pocket of meta II. The molecular models of the dark state and meta II of G188C mutant constructed based on the crystal structures of wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Okada et al., 2004</xref>) suggest that Cys188 can be located in the vicinity of the C11 = C12 position of the retinal and Glu181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The protonation of the Schiff base in the dark state is neutralized by Glu113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sakmar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhukovsky and Oprian, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nathans, 1990</xref>), from which the counterion position switches to Glu181 in meta I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lüdeke et al., 2005</xref>), a precursor of meta II. It should be noted that G188D mutant formed a substantial amount of meta I after light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which can be explained by the stabilization of the protonated Schiff base of meta I by the introduction of an aspartic acid residue. Moreover, during the process of the formation of meta II, Cys188, Glu181, and the adjacent water molecule approach the Schiff base, whereas Glu113 and Ser186 move away from the Schiff base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A previous study suggested that the syn/anti isomerization of the C = N double bond of the Schiff base in meta II can be promoted by the appropriate hydrogen-bonding network around the Schiff base as well as the specific steric chromophore–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vogel et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the cysteine residue introduced at position 188 disturbs the local structure and the hydrogen-bonding network around the Schiff base and Glu181 in meta II, which prevents the syn/anti isomerization of the C = N double bond of the Schiff base.</p><p>The addition of all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal to G188C mutant resulted in the formation of 9-<italic>cis</italic> or 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal-containing photopigments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). 9-<italic>cis</italic> or 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal within G188C mutant would be formed from all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal on the outside or inside of the protein. If the thermal isomerization of the retinal occurs on the outside of the protein, we can expect the formation of the photopigments also from wild-type. However, this occurred much less efficiently in wild-type. Thus, we speculate that 9-<italic>cis</italic> or 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal would be formed from all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal on the inside of G188C mutant, which is consistent with the acceleration of the thermal <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of the retinal in meta II of G188C mutant.</p><p>Quite recently, we showed that T188C mutation of a bistable opsin, Opn5m, induces the thermal isomerization of the retinal from <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> isomer to make the opsin photocyclic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fujiyabu et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we observed the thermal recovery from the photoactivated state in G188C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but not in other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the cysteine residue at position 188 would have a special role to facilitate the thermal isomerization of the retinal. In a previous study of Opn5L1, we revealed that the light-dependent adduct formation between Cys188 and 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal accelerates the isomerization to all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal to recover the original dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). During this process of photocycling of Opn5L1, our spectral analysis detected an increase of the absorbance at around 270 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A, B</xref>), which is derived from the breaking of the retinal-conjugated double bond system by the adduct formation. However, in this study, the introduction of the cysteine residue at position 188 of bovine rhodopsin induced the isomerization from all-<italic>trans</italic> to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, which is a reverse reaction to the thermal isomerization of the retinal in Opn5L1. Moreover, we could not observe a clear increase of the absorbance at around 270 nm during the thermal reaction of bovine rhodopsin G188C mutant after photoreception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). Thus, the detailed molecular mechanism of the acceleration of the thermal recovery to the original dark state in G188C mutant remains unknown, but one possible mechanism is that the cysteine residue introduced at position 188 transiently forms an adduct with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal after photoactivation and quickly dissociates from the retinal after the isomerization to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal. An alternative possible mechanism can be predicted based on the analysis of channelrhodopsins. Channelrhodopsins have a unique cysteine residue near the C13 position of the retinal, which modulates the photocycle rate by regulating the syn/anti isomerization of the C = N double bond of the Schiff base without the adduct formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oppermann et al., 2019</xref>). Considering this molecular mechanism in channelrhodopsins, the cysteine residue at position 188 near the C11 = C12 position of the retinal may possibly influence the structure and charge distribution of the retinal in meta II, which could trigger the thermal <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of the retinal.</p><p>Comparison of the amino acid sequences reveals that most bistable opsins have a threonine or serine residue at position 188 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we speculate that an ancestral bistable opsin possessed a threonine or serine residue at position 188, which was mutated into the glycine residue in the common ancestor of monostable opsins, including vertebrate rhodopsin, cone visual pigments, and pinopsin. Also, the mutation at position 188 may have contributed to the change from the bistable property to the monostable property in the evolutionary ancestor of vertebrate rhodopsin. This is consistent with our recent finding that mutations at Thr188 of a bistable opsin, Opn5m, drastically hamper the bistable photoreaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fujiyabu et al., 2022</xref>). However, we could not create a bistable opsin by a single mutation, G188T or G188S, of bovine rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which means that additional amino acid residue(s) are necessary to explain the difference between the bistable and monostable property from the viewpoint of the molecular evolution of opsins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we analyzed a series of mutants at position 188 of bovine rhodopsin and found that G188C mutant has a unique active state which can revert to the original dark state both by a thermal reaction and by a photoreaction. These results showed that the molecular properties of vertebrate rhodopsin can be converted to photocyclic and photoreversible properties by this single mutation. Little attention has been paid to the functional role of the residue at position 188 in opsins so far. The combination of the mutation at position 188 with other mutations in various opsins could perturb the local structure around the Schiff base, which could lead to interconversion of the molecular properties among opsins. Moreover, G188C mutant of bovine rhodopsin has several advantages as an optogenetic tool, because G188C mutant can be reconstituted in the presence of all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal and exhibits the photocyclic property, like channelrhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deisseroth and Hegemann, 2017</xref>) in addition to its high expression yield in mammalian cultured cells and high G protein activation ability. We successfully showed that the change of the lifetime of meta II by the single mutation can modulate the photocycle rate of G188C mutant. Further accumulation of evidence about mutants of vertebrate rhodopsin can help to guide the modification of the molecular properties of G188C mutant, which will provide a novel type of optogenetic tools based on vertebrate rhodopsin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">In-Fusion HD Cloning</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clontech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clontech: 639,647</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GloSensor cAMP AssayKit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega: E1290</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Forskolin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FUJIFILM (Wako)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FUJIFILM:067-02191</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">n-Dodecyl-β-<sc>D</sc>-maltoside</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOJINDO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOJINDO: D316</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">[<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PerkinElmer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PerkinElmer: NEG030H</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Igor Pro Ver. 6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wavemetrics.com/">https://www.wavemetrics.com/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PyMOL Ver. 1.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/2/">https://pymol.org/2/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Preparation of bovine rhodopsin mutants</title><p>The mutant cDNAs of bovine rhodopsin (accession no.

For the measurement of Gi activation by wild-type and mutant rhodopsin, the cells were first treated with 2 µM forskolin to increase the cAMP-dependent luminescence to the plateau level and subsequently stimulated for 30 s with yellow light through a Y-52 cutoff filter from a 1 kW tungsten halogen lamp.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75979-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data needed to evaluate the conclusions are present in the paper.

in vertebrates. It highlights that single amino acid changes in vertebrate rhodopsins can create a partial bistable retinal pigment that can be photoconverted back to the ground state or it will slowly convert back to the ground state retinal isomer. The rationale for the experiments came from the discovery of a very interesting activation mechanism of the nonvisual pigment Opn5L1. This work has important implications for how our visual pigments have been optimized during evolution, and it contributes important insights into engineering bistable pigments for optogenetic applications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75979.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kruse</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hegemann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01hcx6992</institution-id><institution>Humboldt University of Berlin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Schertler</surname><given-names>Gebhard</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03eh3y714</institution-id><institution>Paul Scherrer Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.06.471433">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.06.471433v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Hegemann (Reviewer #1); Gebhard Schertler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please see the discussion below regarding clarity and presentation of data. While no new experiments are necessary, the reviewers felt that improvements to the text would significantly enhance readability and breadth of appeal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript of Sakai et al., reports about the long-standing question what internal constrains discriminate a cyclic rhodopsin kinetics from non-cyclic kinetics. This question has been discussed over many decades of rhodopsin research.</p><p>Based on the authors report about chicken OPN5L1 (Ref.7), which forms a thioadduct between a reactive Cys and the retinal upon illumination, they introduced such a Cys into the homologous position of bovine rhodopsin, G188C, rendering the naturally non-cyclic photoreaction cyclic. The photoproduct Meta II does not release the at-retinal and the rhodopsin converts back to the dark state. Other residues at this position were only partially active or unstable. At low temperature Meta II is further stabilized but may be photoconverted back to the dark state. This sounds trivial but it is not because wt rhodopsin Meta II state photoconverts it to Meta III with 15=N syn geometry thermally or photochemically and does not recover to the dark state.</p><p>The authors further stabilized the G188C-photoproducts by introducing two more Cys as reported already by Dan Oprian et al., in 2003. The triple mutant showed a further stabilized Meta II photoproduct whereas additional E122Q mutation reaccelerated it.</p><p>Finally, the authors showed that G188C mutants can also be reconstituted with at-retinal which is a great advantage over wt for potential optogenetic applications.</p><p>The G188C variants are fully active in terms of G-protein binding and the cAMP assay revealed the thermal photocycle kinetics of wt and mutants (Figure 4).</p><p>Comments:</p><p>What the reader also need to show are the differences between dark state and Meta II which could be visualized easily by an overlay of the two available structures.</p><p>The main question for the reader is to what extent can the principle of cyclization by introducing a Cys homologous positions be extended to other vertebrate rhodopsins. If this would be the case it would be a spectacular observation and open a new field for application. Now, it still looks exotic and as a exceptional observation.</p><p>The spectra of G188C at 37degC are of poor quality compared to the double or triple mutants in Figure 1 or the G188C spectrum in Figure S2. I would show the 20degC spectra in Figure 1.</p><p>The non-specialized reader would appreciate a scheme of cis-trans and &quot;syn/anti&quot; isomerization and if I interpret Figure S7 correctly is should be an anti/syn illumination because dark state and Meta II should be anti? Please clarify.</p><p>Figure S7 is helpful but should be introduced earlier in the text to make clear where C188 is located. I really do expect a deeper discussion of this issues including other relevant residues in Figure S7.</p><p>Interpretation</p><p>The weaker part of the manuscript is the interpretation of why G188C mutant prevents retinal release during the Meta II state and its thermal or photochemical anti/syn isomerization. Many invertebrate rhodopsins do not release the retinal during the Meta II state and do not have any Cys residue at this location. Moreover, some of them deprotonate during the meta state and others do not. The authors are experts in invertebrate rhodopsins as well and privileged to give a better interpretations.</p><p>Next, the suggestion that Cys causes transient thioadduct formation during the photocycle is not justified by anything and should be proposed with more care. For example a Cys at a similar position has been found in microbial Channelrhodopsins (ChRs). Substitution of this Cys slows down the photocycle dramatically and prevents syn/anti isomerization as it occurs during light adaptation. On the other hand some rhodopsin do not show such an anti/syn isomerization at all but removal of the Cys near the C13 position promotes anti/syn isomerization as found for example in Mermaid ChRs (Oppermann et al.,). The sulfur of the Cys seems to act as a nucleophile for retinal polyene chain, forming a thioadduct as in OPN5L or not as in Channelrhodopsin. But the Cys obviously influences the charge distribution in darkness or during the excited state. Moreover, residues in the active site including E113, E188 and other residues could act as steric constraints that influence the isomerization specificity as well.</p><p>I really do expect deeper discussion of this issues including other relevant residues in Figure S7.</p><p>What the reader also needs to know are the differences between dark state and Meta II which could be visualized by an overlay of the two available structures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I support the publication without further modifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data are thorough and convincing. However, the quality of presentation must be significantly improved.</p><p>1. Overall the manuscript is too long, with numerous unnecessary repetitions. It can be shortened by 30-40% without losing the message.</p><p>2. Evolutionary analysis (Figure S1) suggests that Ala, Ser, or Thr are in 188 position of most bistable opsins. How do the authors interpret this in the context of their data? The authors should discuss the difference in the properties of vertebrate opsin with Ala, Ser, or Thr are in 188 position (Figure S4), as compared to 188Cys? These data suggest that the residue in position 188 is not the only determinant of rhodopsin properties. The authors might want to revise Figure S7 accordingly.</p><p>3. Extensive editing, preferably by a native speaker, is needed.

Quite recently, we showed that a vertebrate non-visual bistable opsin, Opn5m, acquired the photocyclic property by the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 188 (Fujiyabu et al., (2022) Commun. Biol. 5, 63). Thus, we think that several opsins, including vertebrate rhodopsin and Opn5m, have the potential to convert into the photocyclic opsin by the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 188. Now we are systematically analyzing which opsins can acquire the photocyclic property by the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 188. To show our recent results, we added the following sentence in the “Results and discussion” section.</p><p>Page 13: “Quite recently, we showed that T188C mutation of a bistable opsin, Opn5m, induces the thermal isomerization of the retinal from cis to trans isomer to make the opsin photocyclic.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The spectra of G188C at 37degC are of poor quality compared to the double or triple mutants in Figure 1 or the G188C spectrum in Figure S2.

We already showed the spectra of the triple mutant at 20degC in Figure 1F, which were recorded by a scanning spectrophotometer with a single monochromator. We would like to show the spectra at 37degC in Figure 1G to confirm that the photocyclic reaction of G188C mutant can be observed at 37degC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The non-specialized reader would appreciate a scheme of cis-trans and &quot;syn/anti&quot; isomerization and if I interpret Figure S7 correctly is should be an anti/syn illumination because dark state and Meta II should be anti?

I really do expect a deeper discussion of this issues including other relevant residues in Figure S7.</p><p>Interpretation</p><p>The weaker part of the manuscript is the interpretation of why G188C mutant prevents retinal release during the Meta II state and its thermal or photochemical anti/syn isomerization. Many invertebrate rhodopsins do not release the retinal during the Meta II state and do not have any Cys residue at this location. Moreover, some of them deprotonate during the meta state and others do not. The authors are experts in invertebrate rhodopsins as well and privileged to give a better interpretations.</p><p>Next, the suggestion that Cys causes transient thioadduct formation during the photocycle is not justified by anything and should be proposed with more care. For example a Cys at a similar position has been found in microbial Channelrhodopsins (ChRs). Substitution of this Cys slows down the photocycle dramatically and prevents syn/anti isomerization as it occurs during light adaptation. On the other hand some rhodopsin do not show such an anti/syn isomerization at all but removal of the Cys near the C13 position promotes anti/syn isomerization as found for example in Mermaid ChRs (Oppermann et al.,). The sulfur of the Cys seems to act as a nucleophile for retinal polyene chain, forming a thioadduct as in OPN5L or not as in Channelrhodopsin. But the Cys obviously influences the charge distribution in darkness or during the excited state. Moreover, residues in the active site including E113, E188 and other residues could act as steric constraints that influence the isomerization specificity as well.</p><p>I really do expect deeper discussion of this issues including other relevant residues in Figure S7.</p></disp-quote><p>I thank you very much for the valuable comment about the molecular mechanism underlying the photocyclic reaction in G188C mutant. The crystal structures of the dark state and meta II of bovine rhodopsin suggest that the appropriate hydrogen-bonding network and the specific steric interactions around the Schiff base regulate the deprotonation/reprotonation of the Schiff base and the syn/anti isomerization of the C=N double bond of the Schiff base during the formation and the decay of meta II. However, in the present situation, it is very difficult to clearly construct a molecular model to explain the acceleration of the syn/anti isomerization of the C=N double bond in meta II. In this study, we can speculate that the introduction of a cysteine residue at position 188 would disturb the local environment around the Schiff base and Glu181 in meta II, which prevents the syn/anti isomerization of the C=N double bond. However, in the previous version of the manuscript, a lack of detailed structural information about G188C mutant caused us to hesitate to speculate about the molecular mechanism underlying the photocyclic reaction in G188C mutant except for the acquisition of the special structural mechanism, the adduct formation. During the revision process, you kindly provided valuable information about channelrhodopsins indicating that a unique cysteine residue is located near the C13 position of the retinal and modulates the photocycle rate by regulating the syn/anti isomerization of the C=N double bond of the Schiff base. Thus, based on the comparison of the predicted structures of the dark state and meta II of G188C and the mutational analysis of the cysteine residue of channelrhodopsins, we revised the sentences in the “Results and discussion” section as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What the reader also needs to know are the differences between dark state and Meta II which could be visualized by an overlay of the two available structures.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your comment, we constructed the structural models of the dark state and meta II of G188C mutant based on the 3D structures of the dark state and meta II of wild-type and superimposed these models to visualize the structural differences around position 188.

Evolutionary analysis (Figure S1) suggests that Ala, Ser, or Thr are in 188 position of most bistable opsins. How do the authors interpret this in the context of their data? The authors should discuss the difference in the properties of vertebrate opsin with Ala, Ser, or Thr are in 188 position (Figure S4), as compared to 188Cys? These data suggest that the residue in position 188 is not the only determinant of rhodopsin properties. The authors might want to revise Figure S7 accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the important comment. Comparison of the amino acid sequences reveals that most bistable opsins have a threonine or serine residue at position 188 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Thus, we speculate that an ancestral bistable opsin possessed a threonine or serine residue at position 188, which was mutated into the glycine residue in the common ancestor of mono-stable opsins. And the mutation at position 188 may have contributed to the loss of the bistable property and the acquisition of the mono-stable property of vertebrate rhodopsin. This is consistent with our recent finding that mutations at Thr188 of a bistable opsin, Opn5m, drastically hamper the bistable photoreaction (Fujiyabu et al., (2022) Commun. Biol. 5, 63). However, we could not create a bistable opsin by G188T or G188S mutation of bovine rhodopsin (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), which means that additional amino acid residues are necessary to explain the difference between the bistable and mono-stable property. To clarify this point, we added the following sentences in the “Results and discussion” section.</p><p>Page 14: “Comparison of the amino acid sequences reveals that most bistable opsins have a threonine or serine residue at position 188 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).

This is consistent with our recent finding that mutations at Thr188 of a bistable opsin, Opn5m, drastically hamper the bistable photoreaction. However, we could not create a bistable opsin by a single mutation, G188T or G188S, of bovine rhodopsin (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Table 1), which means that additional amino acid residue(s) are necessary to explain the difference between the bistable and mono-stable property from the viewpoint of the molecular evolution of opsins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
