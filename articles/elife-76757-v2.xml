enzymatic modification in the Golgi cisternae are displayed at the plasma membrane as cell identity markers. The modified proteins, called glycans, represent a molecular code. The fidelity of this <italic>glycan code</italic> is measured by how accurately the glycan synthesis machinery realizes the desired target glycan distribution for a particular cell type and niche. In this article, we construct a simplified chemical synthesis model to quantitatively analyse the trade-offs between the number of cisternae, and the number and specificity of enzymes, required to synthesize a prescribed target glycan distribution of a certain complexity to within a given fidelity. We find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi. Additionally, for a fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an optimal level of specificity (promiscuity) of enzymes that achieves the target distribution with high fidelity. The geometry of the <italic>fidelity landscape</italic> in the multidimensional space of the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae provides a measure for robustness and identifies stiff and sloppy directions. Our results show how the complexity of the target glycan distribution and number of glycosylation enzymes places functional constraints on the Golgi cisternal number and enzyme specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glycan code</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>Golgi cisterna</kwd><kwd>enzyme specificity</kwd><kwd>optimization</kwd><kwd>Kullback-Leibler</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI4006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Madan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>287975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Madan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JC Bose Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST-SERB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Madan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mathematical model of glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus to investigate how the fidelity of synthesising a complex glycan distribution at the plasma membrane depends on parameters such as the number of Golgi cisternae or enzyme specificity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A majority of the proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transferred to the Golgi cisternae for further chemical modification by glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 2002</xref>), a process that sequentially and covalently attaches sugar moieties to proteins, catalyzed by a set of enzymatic reactions within the ER and the Golgi cisternae.

Glycans, the final products of this glycosylation assembly line, are delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) conjugated with proteins, whereupon they engage in multiple cellular functions, including immune recognition, cell identity markers, cell-cell adhesion, and cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cummings and Pierce, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drickamer and Taylor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gagneux and Varki, 1999</xref>). This <italic>glycan code</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabius, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dwek, 1996</xref>), representing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winterburn and Phelps, 1972</xref>) about the cell, is generated dynamically, following the biochemistry of sequential enzymatic reactions and the biophysics of secretory transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we will focus on the role of glycans as markers of cell identity. For the glycans to play this role, they must inevitably represent a molecular code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabius, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>). While the functional consequences of glycan alterations have been well studied, the glycan code has remained an enigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabius, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard and Chia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Angelo et al., 2013</xref>). We study the <italic>fidelity</italic> of molecular code generation, that is, the precision and reliability with which the glycan distribution is created. While it has been recognized that fidelity of the glycan code is necessary for reliable cellular recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demetriou et al., 2001</xref>), a quantitative measure of fidelity of the mechanism and the constraints that fidelity requirements put on cellular structure and organization are lacking.</p><p>There are two aspects of the cell-type-specific glycan code and the code generation mechanism that have an important bearing on quantifying fidelity. The first is that extant glycan distributions have high <italic>complexity</italic> (section ‘Complexity of glycan code’), owing to evolutionary pressures arising from (a) reliable cell-type identification amongst a large set of different cell types in a complex organism, the preservation and diversification of ‘self-recognition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drickamer and Taylor, 1998</xref>), (b) pathogen-mediated selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gagneux and Varki, 1999</xref>), and (c) <italic>herd immunity</italic> within a heterogenous population of cells of a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wills and Green, 1995</xref>) or within a single organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drickamer and Taylor, 1998</xref>). We interpret this to mean that the <italic>target distribution</italic> of glycans for a given cell type is complex; in section ‘Complexity of glycan code’, we define a quantitative measure for complexity and demonstrate its implications. The second is that the cellular machinery for the synthesis of glycans, which involves sequential chemical processing via cisternal resident enzymes and cisternal transport, is subject to variation and noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>); the <italic>synthesized glycan distribution</italic> is, therefore, a function of cellular parameters such as the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae. We will discuss an explicit model of the cellular synthesis machinery in section ‘Synthesis of glycans in the Golgi cisternae’.</p><p>Here, we define <italic>fidelity</italic> as the minimum achievable Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cover and Thomas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacKay, 2003</xref>) between the synthesized distribution of glycans and the target glycan distribution as a function of given cellular parameters, such as the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae (section ‘Optimization problem’). Using a simplified chemical synthesis model, we analyse the trade-offs between the number of cisternae and the number and specificity of enzymes in order to achieve a prescribed target glycan distribution with high fidelity (section ‘Results of optimization’). Our analysis leads to a number of interesting results, a few of which we list here:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>First, since an important function of the glycan spectrum is cell type/niche identification, it seems natural to relate <italic>glycan complexity</italic> to organismal complexity taken to be associated with the number of cell types in the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonner, 1998</xref>). Here, we provide a <italic>measure of the complexity</italic> of the glycan distribution of a given cell type using mass spectrometry coupled with determination of molecular structure (MSMS) data. Using this we have analysed the MSMS data from hydra, planaria, and mammalian cells. We find that the complexity of the glycan distribution indeed correlates with the organism complexity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Constructing a high-fidelity representation of a <italic>complex target distribution</italic>, such as those observed in real cells, requires a <italic>complex Golgi machinery</italic> with multiple cisternae, precise enzyme partitioning, and control on enzyme specificity. This definition of fidelity of the glycan code allows us to provide a quantitative argument for the evolutionary requirement of multiple compartments. While it is possible to produce complex glycan distributions in one compartment using a large number of enzymes, such a design would inevitably require a more elaborate genetic cost.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Within our synthesis model, an increase in the number of Golgi cisternae drives an increase in the glycan complexity, keeping everything else fixed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We explore the geometry of the <italic>fidelity landscape</italic> in the multidimensional space of the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae. This allows us to discuss issues such as <italic>robustness</italic> to noise, and <italic>stiff and sloppy directions</italic> in this multidimensional space.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an optimal level of specificity of enzymes that achieves the complex target distribution with high fidelity. Keeping the number of enzymes fixed, having low specificity or sloppy enzymes and larger cisternal number could give rise to a diverse repertoire of functional glycans, a strategy used in organisms such as plants and algae. Promiscuous enzymes bring in the potential for <italic>evolvability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kirschner and Gerhart, 2008</xref>); promiscuity allows the system to be stable to random mutations in proteins or variations in the target distribution.</p></list-item></list><p>Thus, our results imply that the pressure to produce the target glycan code for a given cell type with high fidelity places strong constraints on the cisternal number and enzyme specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). Taken together, our quantitative analysis of the trade-offs has deep implications for the non-equilibrium self-assembly of Golgi cisternae and suggests that the control of cisternal number must involve a coupling of non-equilibrium self-assembly of cisternae with enzymatic chemical reaction kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>). This combined dynamics of chemical processing with non-equilibrium membrane dynamics involving fission, fusion, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sachdeva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sens and Rao, 2013</xref>) opens up a new direction for future research.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Complexity of glycan code</title><p>Since each cell type (in a niche) is identified with a distinct glycan profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabius, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>), and this glycan profile is noisy because of the stochastic noise associated with the synthesis and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard and Chia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Angelo et al., 2013</xref>), a large number of different cell types can be differentiated only if the cells are able to produce a large set of glycan profiles that are distinguishable in the presence of this noise. Our task is to identify a quantitative measure for the <italic>complexity</italic> of a glycan profile such that a set of more complex glycan profiles is able to support a larger number of well-separated profiles, and therefore, a larger number of cell types, or equivalently, a more <italic>complex</italic> organism (a rigorous definition of complexity can be given in terms of the KL metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cover and Thomas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacKay, 2003</xref>] between two glycan profiles. We declare that two profiles are distinguishable only if the KL distance between the profiles is more than a given tolerance. This tolerance is an increasing function of the noise. We define the <italic>complexity</italic> of a set of possible glycan profiles as the size of the largest subset such that the KL distance of any pair of profiles is larger than the tolerance). Furthermore, we would like to be able to estimate the complexity of a glycan profile from molecular structure (MSMS) measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cummings and Crocker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahadevan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify such a quantitative measure of complexity, we first need a consistent way of smoothening or coarse-graining the raw glycan profiles obtained from MSMS measurements to remove measurement and synthesis noise. Here, we denoise the glycan profile by approximating it by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a specified number of components that are supported on a finite set of indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacharoglou, 2010</xref>). Since the size of the set of all possible <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-component Gaussian densities is an increasing function of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we define the complexity of a mixture of Gaussians as the number of components <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that the value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> at which the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-component GMM approximation of the target profile saturates is a good measure of complexity. Using this definition we see that the complexity of the glycan profiles of various organisms correlates well with the number of cell types in an organism (details of the procedure are given in Appendix 1). We will now describe a general model of the cellular machinery that is capable of synthesizing glycans of any complexity.

The raw MSMS data, however, is not suitable as a target distribution. This is because it is very noisy, with chemical noise in the sample and Poisson noise associated with detecting discrete events being the most relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al., 2008</xref>). This means that many of the small peaks in the raw data are not part of the signal, and one has to ‘smoothen’ the distribution to remove the impact of noise.</p><p>We use MSMS data from <italic>human</italic> T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cummings and Crocker, 2020</xref>) for our analysis.

Here, we use a variation of the GMMs (see Appendix 1 for details) to create a hierarchy of increasingly complex distributions to approximate the MSMS raw data. Thus, the 3-GMM and 20-GMM approximations represent the low- and high-complexity benchmarks, respectively. In Appendix 1, we show that the likelihood for the glycan distribution of the <italic>human</italic> T-cell saturates at 20 peaks. Thus, statistically the <italic>human</italic> T-cell glycan distribution is accurately approximated by 20 peaks.</p><p>This hierarchy allows us to study the trade-off between the complexity of the target distribution and the complexity of the synthesis model needed to generate the distribution as follows.

They optimize incoming glycan ratio, transport rate, and effective reaction rates in order to synthesize a narrow target distribution centred around the desired glycan. The ability to produce specific glycans without much heterogeneity is an important goal in the pharmaceutical industry. They define heterogeneity as the total number of glycans synthesized and show that increasing the number of compartments <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf233"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> decreases heterogeneity and increases the concentration of the specific glycan.

This would be an erroneous inference, and is a consequence of the distortion model we have used for calculating the binding probabilities of substrates with enzymes. The root cause for this apparent symmetry is that we have allowed for all enzymes to catalyze reactions in all cisternae (albeit with different efficiencies). This symmetry is violated by simply restricting the activity of the enzymes to be dependent on the cisternae. A simple realization of this in terms of the distortion model is given in Appendix 7.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Optimal partitioning of enzymes in cisternae</title><p>Having studied the optimum <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf240"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to attain a given target distribution with high fidelity, we ask what is the optimal partitioning of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf241"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> enzymes in these <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf242"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> cisternae?

For low-specificity enzymes, the diversity remains unchanged upon increasing the cisternal residence time. For enzymes with high specificity, the diversity typically shows a non-monotonic variation with the cisternal residence time. At small cisternal residence time, the diversity decreases from the peak because of the early exit of incomplete oligomers. At large cisternal residence time, the diversity again decreases as more reactions are taken to completion. Note that the peak is generally very flat, which is consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>. To get a sharper peak, as advocated for instance by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jaiman and Thattai, 2018</xref>, one might need to increase the number of high-specificity enzymes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf335"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> further.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The precision of the stereochemistry and enzymatic kinetics of these N-glycosylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varki, 2009</xref>) has inspired a number of mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umaña and Bailey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krambeck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krambeck and Betenbaugh, 2005</xref>) that predict the N-glycan distribution based on the activities and levels of processing enzymes distributed in the Golgi cisternae of mammalian cells and compare these predictions with N-glycan mass spectrum data. Models such as the KB2005 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umaña and Bailey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krambeck and Betenbaugh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krambeck et al., 2009</xref>) are extremely elaborate (with a network of 22,871 chemical reactions and 7565 oligosaccharide structures) and require many chemical input parameters. These models have an important practical role to play, that of being able to predict the impact of the various <italic>chemical parameters</italic> on the glycan distribution, and to evaluate appropriate metabolic strategies to recover the original glycoprofile. Additionally, a recent study by Ungar and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fisher and Ungar, 2016</xref>) shows how <italic>physical parameters</italic>, such as overall Golgi transit time and cisternal number, can be tuned to engineer a homogeneous glycan distribution. Overall, such models can help predict glycosylation patterns and direct glycoengineering projects to optimize glycoform distributions.</p><p>Our focus is different.

To do this, we have had to develop a new formal apparatus that allows us to address these questions and discuss trade-offs between competing drives. Since our analysis draws on many diverse fields, we provide a short summary of the assumptions, methods, and results of the article before discussing the implications of our work.</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>The glycan profile on the cell surface is a marker of <italic>cell-type identity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gabius, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>). We define the complexity of a glycan profile to be the minimum number of GMM components required to approximate the profile to within the noise floor. We show that with this definition of complexity more complex organisms correlate with higher complexity glycan profiles.

It also provides an argument for the evolutionary requirement of multiple compartments by demonstrating that the fidelity and robustness of the glycan code arising from a chemical synthesis that involves multiple cisternae are higher than the one that involves a single cisterna (keeping everything else fixed) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) This feature, that with multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning one may generically achieve a highly accurate representation of the target distribution, has been highlighted in an algorithmic model of glycan synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jaiman and Thattai, 2018</xref>.</p><p>Combining (a) and (b), our study quantitatively shows that constructing a high-fidelity representation of a <italic>complex target distribution</italic>, such as those observed in real cells, requires a <italic>complex Golgi machinery</italic> with multiple cisternae, precise enzyme partitioning, and control on enzyme specificity. This definition of fidelity of the glycan code allows us to provide a quantitative argument for the evolutionary requirement of multiple compartments. While it is possible to produce complex glycan distributions in one compartment using a large number of enzymes, such a design would inevitably require a more elaborate genetic cost.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Organisms such as plants and algae have a diverse repertoire of glycans that are utilized in a variety of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McFarlane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O’Neill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Kaida, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gow and Hube, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atmodjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Free, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pauly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Fincher, 2014</xref>). Our study shows that it is optimal to use low-specificity enzymes to synthesize target distributions with high diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, this compromises on the complexity of the glycan distribution, revealing a tension between complexity and diversity. One way of relieving this tension is to have larger <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf351"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf352"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our study shows that for a fixed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf353"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf354"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, there is an optimal enzyme specificity that achieves the lowest distance from a given target distribution. As we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, this optimal enzyme specificity can be very high for highly complex target distributions. Such high specificity can lower fitness when the environment, and hence the target glycan distribution, fluctuates rapidly, and the synthesis parameters cannot change rapidly enough to track the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peracchi, 2018</xref>). This compromise, between robustness to a changing environment and high fidelity in synthesizing high-complexity glycan profiles, is achievable by sloppy enzymes coupled with error-correcting mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peracchi, 2018</xref>). However, sloppy enzymes create ‘wrong’ glycans, and therefore, ex-post error-correcting mechanisms must be in place to correct synthesis errors to ensure high fidelity of the glycan code. A task for the future is to understand the role of intracellular transport in providing non-equilibrium proofreading mechanisms to reduce such coding errors, and its optimal adaptive strategies and plasticity in a time-varying environment.</p><p>Combining (c) and (d), we find that keeping the number of enzymes fixed, having low specificity or sloppy enzymes, and larger cisternal number could give rise to a diverse repertoire of functional glycans.

For instance, typical N-glycosylation pathways would involve the glycosylation of a variety of GBPs. Further, apart from N-glycosylation, there are other glycoprotein, proteoglycan, and glycolipid synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Varki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pothukuchi et al., 2019</xref>). Our task has been to get at a qualitative understanding using quantitative methods and thereby to arrive at general principles. We believe our analysis is generalizable and that the qualitative results we have arrived at would still hold. To conclude, our work establishes the link between the cisternal machinery (chemical and transport) and high-fidelity synthesis of a complex glycan code. We find that the pressure to achieve the target glycan code for a given cell type places strong constraints on the cisternal number and enzyme specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). An important implication is that a description of the non-equilibrium self-assembly of a fixed number of Golgi cisternae must combine the dynamics of chemical processing and membrane dynamics involving fission, fusion, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta and Linstedt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sachdeva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sens and Rao, 2013</xref>).

The x-axis of mass spectroscopy (MS) graphs is mass/charge of the ionized sample molecules, and the y-axis is relative intensity corresponding to each mass/charge value, taking the highest intensity as 100%. This relative intensity roughly correlates with the relative abundances of the molecules in the sample.</p><p>The raw MS data is noisy and cannot be directly used as the target distribution in our optimization problem. There are three major sources of noise in the MS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Du et al., 2008</xref>): chemical noise in the sample, the Poisson noise associated with detecting discrete events, and the Nyquist–Johnson noise associated with any charge system. We propose a simple model that accounts for the chemical noise and the Poisson sampling noise. Using this noise model and the available MS data, we generate parametric bootstrap samples of glycan measurements and fit a GMM on this sample to approximate the glycan distribution. This GMM probability distribution is used as the target distribution in our numerical experiments.</p><p>The MS data obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cummings and Crocker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahadevan et al., 2014</xref> had mass ranging between 500 and 5000 Da with intensity reported at every 0.0153 Da. We first bin this MS data into 180 bins and take the maximum value within each bin as the value of intensity for that bin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> plots the raw MS data and the binned distribution.

The optimization problem consists of minimizing a non-convex objective with linear box constraints. We use the MATLAB FMINCON function to solve this optimization. We use SQP, a gradient-based iterative optimization scheme for solving optimizations with non-linear differentiable objective and constraints. Since our problem is non-convex and SQP only gives local minima, we initialize the algorithm with many random initial points.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Glycan processing in the Golgi – optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and enzyme specificity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This manuscript presents a clever approach to study from a theoretical point of view how glycosylation reactions occurring at the Golgi membranes define a cell-specific glycan profile. In particular, by optimizing a metric, the authors find that larger number of enzymes and/or compartments (Golgi cisternae) are required for increasingly complex glycan profiles. In addition, they found that enzymes should not be very specific nor too sloppy. This manuscript touches upon an important topic in cell biology (origin of glycan diversity and link to Golgi complex architecture), which has been relatively unexplored in the past. However, although there are no major concerns about the validity of the model presented in the paper (see separate reviews for more detailed comments), there is a general consensus among the reviewers that there are some key points that this manuscript should resolve before opting for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. Since these points will most likely require an extensive revision of the manuscript, we decided to proceed with a rejection at this moment. We encourage you, if you wish, to resubmit a stronger new paper in the future; or to opt for submission elsewhere for its timely publication.</p><p>The main concerns raised by the reviewers are the following:</p><p>1) It is not clear what new biology we learn from the results of this paper (see e.g. Rev. 1's report). It's been suggested that the reason for stacking is to give proteins enough time to undergo proper glycosylation and that cisternae number correlates with the complexity of glycans. Since the paper does not include any new experimental evidence on how the complexity of cellular glycans leads to more cisternae in the Golgi stack, it would be very valuable for a biological audience if the authors could present a list of model predictions that could be experimentally tested.</p><p>2) For the results of the model to be more robust and probably to also learn a bit more about cell specific glycobiology, a more systematic study of available glycan profiles would very much improve the story (see in particular, Rev. 2, point 2; and also Rev. 3, point 3).</p><p>3) The manuscript is very complex for non theorists, since it is presented as a rather technical manuscript. It is well written and organized for specialists. However, it is not clear whether this manuscript, in the current form, will be of interest for a broad biological audience. Along these lines, the conclusions and discussion might need to be toned down, given the large number of simplifications of the model (which is fine for a theoretical audience, but could be over-assumed by a non-specialist biological audience) (see Rev. 3, point 1).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Yadav et al. uses a theoretical model of glycan processing to investigate the constraints placed on the enzymatic modification process in order to achieve the complex final glycan distribution. The authors introduce a multi-compartment, many-species model of chemical modifications and develop an optimization algorithm to minimize the divergence between the resulting glycan distribution and that observed from data on immune cells. The authors find that a minimum number of enzymes and reactions chambers (cisternae) are necessary to recapitulate the complex features of the experimental distribution. They also find that enzymes should have an optimal specificity: they should not be too specific to only one particular substrate, nor should they be too &quot;sloppy&quot; by interacting with all substrates with similar rates. Finally, the authors elucidate control parameters of their model that maximize the diversity of glycans.</p><p>I am torn about this study because while the approach is elegant and principled and the results sensible and interpretable, the scope is rather technical and therefore I am skeptical as to whether this will have the broad audience and impact that is expected for <italic>eLife</italic>. The work combines elements from several fields (cell biology, chemical modeling, computational optimization, information theory), which is commendable, well-presented, and appropriate for an interdisciplinary audience. At the same time, however, I found myself wondering what we really learn at the end of the day. That the components must be complex (sufficient number of enzymes and compartments) in order for the result to be complex (many-peaked glycan distribution) seems unavoidable. That the specificity must be moderate also seems expected in order to not be limited by a one-to-one matching between enzyme and glycan product, but also not produce a broad, sloppy distribution. Part of the problem may also be that it is unclear what contribution is made in terms of predictions for new experiments (which is often a necessary criterion for a high-impact theoretical study): apart from using actual data as an optimization target, the study largely recapitulates and rationalizes existing features of the glycan machinery, rather than suggesting perturbations for, or placing quantitative limits on, new experimental investigations. My inclination is therefore to suspect that this work may be more suitable for a more specialized journal, e.g. on cell biology or chemical physics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Glycan processing in the Golgi – optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and enzyme specificity&quot; by Yadav et al. presents a model for glycan production by the Golgi cisternae. Glycans serve various cellular functions, such as markers for cell identity, and it is important that a function-specific profile (distribution) of glycans is obtained at the end of the production process. The authors show how to choose the reaction constants in their model to reach a target profile (distribution) of glycans. They discuss how the adequacy between the target and model profiles depend on the physico-chemical features of the reactants.</p><p>While the problem studied by the authors is interesting and their analysis reports valuable qualitative results, e.g. on the consequence of enzyme specificity on the profile statistics, I list below various points that I think would require further studies and discussions:</p><p>1. The writing of the manuscript is quite technical in some sections, in particular around equation (5) and (6), and involves superfluous notations: what is the added value in introducing V, M, L with respect to the already defined omega, P, …? I would recommend the authors to simplify the writing and really emphasize what is important here. Several definitions or assumptions remain vague and not discussed. For instance, equation (3) define the binding probability between enzyme α and substrate k in terms of &quot;shape&quot; vectors. On line 250 these shape vectors are defined as scalars, in particular the shape of enzyme k is identified with the index itself. Why is this a good choice (apart from reducing the dimension of the parameter space), and how could one test the validity this apparently quite strong hypothesis?</p><p>2. The manuscript is mostly theoretical with limited connections with experimental data and validations. It would be nice to have a systematic study of available glycan profiles and comparison of the corresponding inferred model parameters. In addition, it is necessary to validate the inference/optimization procedure on synthetic profiles generated by stochastic simulations of some prescribed network, to check that the correct network parameters are correctly recovered (or some other solutions giving back the same profile, see point 4 below).</p><p>3. While the KL divergence (7) is a reasonable measure of dissimilarity between two distributions the relevance of the ratio (9) on page 10 is not at all clear to me. More precisely, I do not see why the entropy of the target distribution is the relevant quantity here. Rather the KL divergence between the model and target distribution could be compared to the mean value of the KL divergence between any two glycan profiles resulting from the noisy production steps.</p><p>4. Since the function of the minimize over, see eq. (8) is non convex, there may exist many local minima. The authors report in Appendix 8 they perform grid-like search. How close are those minima in terms of the objective function? This question is important as the model studied here seems to be overparametrized, in particular when N_c is large. It may also be relevant in terms of evolution. More precisely, how were some glycan profiles and the corresponding biochemical networks selected in the course of evolution? On top of selection pressure to &quot;orthogonalize&quot; the profiles is it possible that some distributions are (approximately) realized by more networks than others and were therefore entropically favored?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Yadav et al. contributes to an important and largely unexplored topic in Life Sciences, namely, to the understanding of glycosylation. The authors introduce a mathematical model of glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus and use the model to investigate how the complexity (diversity) and fidelity of the plasma membrane glycan distribution depends on parameters such as the number of Golgi cisternae or enzyme specificity. The paper is well written and makes the effort to present a rather complex topic in an accessible way by leaving some of the details in the appendices.</p><p>After defining the quantitative measures for complexity and fidelity of glycan distributions, the paper builds a general model of glycosylation in the Golgi by assuming Michaelis-Menten type reactions and by taking into account parameters such as the number, specificity and distribution of enzymes across cisternae. However, the parameter space becomes so large that, before solving it numerically, the authors need to reduce it by making a number of simplifications (they linearize the distortion energy; assign one enzyme specificity σ to all reactions …). The authors then ask the question how different parameters influence the outcome and what are the optimal parameters for a given target glycan distribution. Finally, the authors explore the strategies to achieve high glycan diversity.</p><p>My comments are listed below:</p><p>1. The authors should be more careful (modest?) with the generalization of their results and conclusions. The results are obtained by a very simplified model and it is not obvious that they can be generalized.</p><p>For example, in the Abstract they state: &quot;We find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi.&quot; However, this is only true within the simplified model. Maybe, complex distributions could be obtained even with a small number of cisternae if one allowed biochemistry that is more complex. The statement above would be more accurate if it was turned around, e.g., &quot;we show that multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi can lead to complex glycan distributions.&quot;</p><p>The readers of a mathematical journal would very well understand that the results are not general but should be interpreted within the model proposed. On the other hand, the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> could be misled by statements which are too general. This is even more true for this paper, which starts with a rather general and complex model and then simplifies it on the go. While the authors do summarize the simplifications in the Discussion, an inexperienced reader could still miss them and take the results too literally. I would suggest that the authors amend the whole paper according to this comment to avoid possible misinterpretations.</p><p>2. An interesting result of the modeling is that the role of parameters NE and NC can be rather symmetrical – the fidelity of glycan distribution can be improved in a similar way by increasing either of these parameters (Figure 4). Why is that? Is this a consequence of a symmetrical role of these parameters in the reduced (simplified) parameter space, or can this symmetry be generalized and can have a biological merit?</p><p>3. The paper mentions examples of cells that have a complex Golgi and a complex glycan distribution. Is the opposite also true, e.g., that cells with a simple Golgi do not have complex glycan distributions? Or can a complex Golgi sometimes result in a low glycan complexity?</p><p>4. One wonders how robust the glycosylation process is according to the model proposed? Figure 5b neatly shows that large enzyme repartitioning can lead to a completely different glycan distribution. But how do small variations of the optimal reaction distribution affect the outcome? Would it be possible to quantify the robustness and analyze it systematically (not just show a few random examples)? How is robustness affected by the number of cisternae and enzymes? What are biological implications of this result?</p><p>5. Figure 5b shows that a complex Golgi can also lead to a simple glycan distribution. This implies that having a large NC and NE is not sufficient for a complex glycan distribution. Could the authors discuss this? What are additional requirements that are needed for a complex glycan distribution?</p><p>6. What is &quot;likelihood,&quot; which is used in some of the graphs? Is it related to the minimum achievable Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence according to Kullback-Leibler metric defined in Eq. 7 (and used in Figures 3, 4 and 5)? If so, the authors could use only one measure of likelihood/divergence in all the graphs.</p><p>7. Why does the mouse glycan distribution have a lower &quot;likelihood&quot; than the human one, even with an increasing number of GMM (Figure 1b)? Is this a coincidence or can this be generalized?</p><p>8. The paper would be easier to read if all the parameters were listed in one place, and if one letter was not used to denote different things (e.g., &quot;k&quot; denotes complexity, but it is also used as the index for glycosylation reactions).</p><p>9. Is the final distribution of glycans on PM presented on the right in Figure 2 conceptually the same as the glycan distributions presented in Figure 1? If so, use the same notation (and axes labels) everywhere.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76757.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

That the components must be complex (sufficient number of enzymes and compartments) in order for the result to be complex (many-peaked glycan distribution) seems unavoidable. That the specificity must be moderate also seems expected in order to not be limited by a one-to-one matching between enzyme and glycan product, but also not produce a broad, sloppy distribution. Part of the problem may also be that it is unclear what contribution is made in terms of predictions for new experiments (which is often a necessary criterion for a high-impact theoretical study): apart from using actual data as an optimization target, the study largely recapitulates and rationalizes existing features of the glycan machinery, rather than suggesting perturbations for, or placing quantitative limits on, new experimental investigations. My inclination is therefore to suspect that this work may be more suitable for a more specialized journal, e.g. on cell biology or chemical physics.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy that the referee finds the paper “elegant”, “commendable” and “appropriate for an interdisciplinary audience”. Despite this the referee does not feel that the manuscript provides new predictions or suggestions for new experiments and simply “rationalizes existing features of the glycan machinery”.</p><p>While it is true that our study provides rationalisations for existing (but not well appreciated) features of the cellular glycan machinery, it does so from a fresh perspective, namely from a distinct information theoretic point of view. This should not be considered as a problem, since one of the roles of theory is to view disparate observations through the lens of a general framework. Our abstract information theoretic considerations are a novel conceptual way of approaching the biochemical synthesis of information carrying molecules, and make quantitative, the purely verbal descriptions in, 2. We hope such a perspective would prove useful in the future.</p><p>In addition, our theoretical study also makes testable predictions, provides suggestions for future experiments and opens up a scope for new enquiry. Our rewriting of the manuscript emphasises this aspect – we do this by (i) including and analysing more data from different species, that together highlight the relation between organismal/glycan complexity and the complexity of the Golgi machinery; and (ii) highlighting the predictions and suggestions that follow from this study (this has involved some more calculations). While the abstraction and generality of the description helps in bringing together several aspects and highlighting new questions, it can at best make qualitative predictions. Our task therefore has been to to get at a qualitative understanding using quantitative methods and thereby to arrive at general principles. This approach has been highly successful in several branches of physics, a rather famous example is the Landau theory of phase transitions, and has been passionately, and we think correctly, advocated for Biology in [3, 4].</p><p>We now highlight the new conceptual contributions, predictions and offshoots/implications of our theoretical study and suggestions for future experiments -</p><p>1. Since an important function of the glycan spectrum is cell type/niche identification, it seems natural to relate <italic>glycan complexity</italic> to organismal complexity taken to be associated with the number of cell types in the organism [5, 6]. Here, we provide a <italic>measure of the complexity</italic> of the glycan distribution of a given cell type using MSMS data. Using this we have now analysed the MSMS data from Hydra, Planaria, Mammalian cells.</p><p>2. We have constructed a generic and calculable model of <italic>chemical synthesis</italic> of the glycan spectrum (molecular information) consistent with the phenomenology of enzymatic reactions and cellular compartmentalization. This represents a calculable model, as opposed to a black-box model, of the Golgi machinery.</p><p>3. Constructing a high fidelity representation of a <italic>complex target distribution</italic>, such as those observed in real cells, requires a <italic>complex Golgi machinery</italic> with multiple cisternae, precise enzyme partitioning and control on enzyme specificity. This definition of fidelity of the glycan code, allows us to provide a quantitative argument for the evolutionary requirement of multiple-compartments. While it is possible to produce complex glycan distributions in one compartment using a large number of enzymes, such a design would inevitably require a more elaborate genetic cost.</p><p>4. One of the predictions of the model is that we should see a qualitative trend of increasing Golgi compartments on increasing the glycan complexity, keeping everything else fixed. This can be empirically verified by looking at the glycan profiles, ultrastructure of Golgi and the number of glycosylation enzymes across many species.</p><p>5. The model solution is degenerate, in the sense that there many equally good global minima. These degeneracies are both continuous and discrete. The continuous degeneracies corresponds to regions in the reaction rate – transport rate space, moving along which will not change the concentration profile, thus ensuring <italic>robustness</italic> to internal noise. This suggests that the distribution is robust to slight cell-to-cell variations in these kinetic parameters.</p><p>6. Our model implies that close to a local minima the inter-cisternal transport rate <italic><bold>µ</bold></italic> and the specificity of the enzymes <italic>σ</italic> are stiff directions, i.e. the cell should exercise tighter control on <italic><bold>µ</bold></italic> and <italic>σ</italic> as compared to the reaction rates. The reaction rates close to the local minima are sloppy directions, moving along these directions does not change the glycan profile much.</p><p>7. For fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an optimal level of specificity of enzymes that achieves the complex target distribution with high fidelity. Keeping the number of enzymes fixed, having low specificity or sloppy enzymes and larger cisternal number could give rise to a diverse repertoire of functional glycans, a strategy used in organisms such as plants and algae. Sloppy or promiscuous enzymes bring in the potential for <italic>evolvability</italic> [7], sloppiness allows the system to be stable to random mutations in proteins or variations in the target distribution.</p><p>8. Taken together, our quantitative analysis of the tradeoffs has profound implications for nonequilibrium self assembly of the Golgi cisternae, suggesting that the nonequilibrium control of cisternal number must involve a coupling of nonequilibrium self assembly of cisternae with enzymatic chemical reaction kinetics [8].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Glycan processing in the Golgi – optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and enzyme specificity&quot; by Yadav et al. presents a model for glycan production by the Golgi cisternae. Glycans serve various cellular functions, such as markers for cell identity, and it is important that a function-specific profile (distribution) of glycans is obtained at the end of the production process. The authors show how to choose the reaction constants in their model to reach a target profile (distribution) of glycans. They discuss how the adequacy between the target and model profiles depend on the physico-chemical features of the reactants.</p><p>While the problem studied by the authors is interesting and their analysis reports valuable qualitative results, e.g. on the consequence of enzyme specificity on the profile statistics, I list below various points that I think would require further studies and discussions:</p><p>1. The writing of the manuscript is quite technical in some sections, in particular around equation (5) and (6), and involves superfluous notations: what is the added value in introducing V, M, L with respect to the already defined omega, P, …? I would recommend the authors to simplify the writing and really emphasize what is important here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion. <italic>V</italic> and <italic>M</italic> are physically measurable macroscopic quantities (vectors) related to the Michaelis constant and maximum velocity <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of the enzymes, for which we place bounds that we take from literature (see Appendix 2). These are defined in terms of the microscopic rates <italic>ω<sub>f</sub>,ω<sub>b</sub></italic> and <italic>ω<sub>c</sub></italic>, see equation 4 of the manuscript. However to make the manuscript clearer we have now relegated the expression for the concentrations in terms of <italic>M</italic>,<italic>V</italic> and <italic>L</italic> (equations 5 and 6 of the manuscript) to Appendix 3. We have also simplified the writing as recommended, highlighting essential features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several definitions or assumptions remain vague and not discussed. For instance, equation (3) defines the binding probability between enzyme α and substrate k in terms of &quot;shape&quot; vectors. On line 250 these shape vectors are defined as scalars, in particular the shape of enzyme k is identified with the index itself. Why is this a good choice (apart from reducing the dimension of the parameter space), and how could one test the validity this apparently quite strong hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We now state all the assumptions that we are making at the beginning of the Results section. In general, the shape of an object (enzyme) can be described by a shape tensor akin to a moment of inertia tensor (or a fabric tensor that expands the shape in spherical harmonics). Restricting the shape deformations to a scalar is tantamount to a single mode approximation. This is essentially the approximation used when a single reaction coordinate is taken to represent a multidimensional reaction landscape.</p><p>In a chemical reaction between macromolecules, the reaction centres are often buried in the molecule and not easily accessible, unless reactants have the appropriate shape (lock-key) or can be induced to have the appropriate shape (induced fit). Thus, reactions rates depend on the shape and its deformability, which may be modelled by a general shape tensor (we call this distortion). A simple model for distortion is a scalar model, as used for instance in [9]. We have chosen to parametrize the optimal length of the enzyme by a integer multiple of a basic unit. This choice merely simplifies the analysis. Normally in the analysis of chemical kinetics, this would be subsumed in the rates, since the experimentally measured rates are a function of the shape distortion, pH etc. Since in our work, we are interested in analysing the tradeoffs involving enzymatic parameters, we need to provide a “microscopic” model of enzyme reactions that allows us to proceed with our optimization analysis in a tractable manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript is mostly theoretical with limited connections with experimental data and validations. It would be nice to have a systematic study of available glycan profiles and comparison of the corresponding inferred model parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>What the referee is asking for is precisely the goal of glycan engineering (see Discussion in the revised manuscript). This is a mature and serious field of study, and has contributed a lot to understanding the chemical profile of glycans in health and disease. There are a number of sequential enzymatic reaction models [10, 11, 12] that predict the N-glycan distribution based on the activities and levels of processing enzymes distributed in the Golgi-cisternae of mammalian cells, and make comparisons with N-glycan mass spectrum data. Models such as the KB2005 model [10, 11, 12] are extremely elaborate (with 22800 chemical reactions) and require very detailed chemical input parameters, which are either determined experimentally or obtained by fitting to the mass spectrometry data. These models have an important practical role to play, that of being able to predict the impact of the various <italic>chemical parameters</italic> on glycan distribution.</p><p>In contrast, here we pose a different question: Given an evolutionary drive for a specific cell type within a specific tissue microenvironment to maintain a target glycan distribution of fixed complexity, what are the tradeoffs in the chemical and physical parameters of glycan biosynthesis that realise this target.</p><p>This engenders a different strategy of analysis as advocated here, and allows us to get at a qualitative understanding using quantitative methods, as elaborated in the Response to Referee 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is necessary to validate the inference/optimization procedure on synthetic profiles generated by stochastic simulations of some prescribed network, to check that the correct network parameters are correctly recovered (or some other solutions giving back the same profile, see point 4 below).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee and thank the referee for this suggestion. We have now added a new section in the manuscript (Please see Appendix 8 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the KL divergence (7) is a reasonable measure of dissimilarity between two distributions the relevance of the ratio (9) on page 10 is not at all clear to me. More precisely, I do not see why the entropy of the target distribution is the relevant quantity here. Rather the KL divergence between the model and target distribution could be compared to the mean value of the KL divergence between any two glycan profiles resulting from the noisy production steps.</p></disp-quote><p>The entropy of target distribution is a measure of the total statistical information in the distribution. Normalizing with respect to the entropy allows us to measure the information gained about the target distribution by approximating it with the empirical distribution, as the fraction of the total statistical information in the target distribution. This is a reasonable measure for comparing the effectiveness of the model for different target distributions. We have now made this point more explicit in the revised manuscript (Please see Equation 5 in section &quot;Optimization Problem&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Since the function of the minimize over, see eq. (8) is non convex, there may exist many local minima. The authors report in Appendix 8 they perform grid-like search. How close are those minima in terms of the objective function? This question is important as the model studied here seems to be overparametrized, in particular when N_c is large. It may also be relevant in terms of evolution. More precisely, how were some glycan profiles and the corresponding biochemical networks selected in the course of evolution? On top of selection pressure to &quot;orthogonalize&quot; the profiles is it possible that some distributions are (approximately) realized by more networks than others and were therefore entropically favored?</p></disp-quote><p>The issue of parameter degeneracy and possible evolutionary implications is very interesting, and we thank the referee for bringing this up. We have conducted a detailed study, which we now report in Appendix 8 subsection “Degeneracy in the model”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper by Yadav et al. contributes to an important and largely unexplored topic in Life Sciences, namely, to the understanding of glycosylation. The authors introduce a mathematical model of glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus and use the model to investigate how the complexity (diversity) and fidelity of the plasma membrane glycan distribution depends on parameters such as the number of Golgi cisternae or enzyme specificity. The paper is well written and makes the effort to present a rather complex topic in an accessible way by leaving some of the details in the appendices.</p><p>After defining the quantitative measures for complexity and fidelity of glycan distributions, the paper builds a general model of glycosylation in the Golgi by assuming Michaelis-Menten type reactions and by taking into account parameters such as the number, specificity and distribution of enzymes across cisternae. However, the parameter space becomes so large that, before solving it numerically, the authors need to reduce it by making a number of simplifications (they linearize the distortion energy; assign one enzyme specificity σ to all reactions …). The authors then ask the question how different parameters influence the outcome and what are the optimal parameters for a given target glycan distribution. Finally, the authors explore the strategies to achieve high glycan diversity.</p><p>My comments are listed below:</p><p>1. The authors should be more careful (modest?) with the generalization of their results and conclusions. The results are obtained by a very simplified model and it is not obvious that they can be generalized.</p><p>For example, in the Abstract they state: &quot;We find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi.&quot; However, this is only true within the simplified model. Maybe, complex distributions could be obtained even with a small number of cisternae if one allowed biochemistry that is more complex. The statement above would be more accurate if it was turned around, e.g., &quot;we show that multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi can lead to complex glycan distributions.&quot;</p><p>The readers of a mathematical journal would very well understand that the results are not general but should be interpreted within the model proposed. On the other hand, the readers of eLife could be misled by statements which are too general. This is even more true for this paper, which starts with a rather general and complex model and then simplifies it on the go. While the authors do summarize the simplifications in the Discussion, an inexperienced reader could still miss them and take the results too literally. I would suggest that the authors amend the whole paper according to this comment to avoid possible misinterpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not being careful in stating our results and presenting the necessary caveats. We believe we have now worked on it to a considerable extent in the revised submission.</p><p>We find that even within the framework of our simple model it is possible to generate complex distributions in a small number of compartments by having a complex biochemistry (large number of processing enzymes). However, this complex biochemistry invokes an elaborate genetic cost on the cell. Therefore, within our framework the number of compartments required are both a function of the complexity of glycan distribution to be synthesized and the number of enzymes. This is a crucial insight and we have edited the manuscript to make this point and the underlying assumptions explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An interesting result of the modelling is that the role of parameters NE and NC can be rather symmetrical – the fidelity of glycan distribution can be improved in a similar way by increasing either of these parameters (Figure 4). Why is that? Is this a consequence of a symmetrical role of these parameters in the reduced (simplified) parameter space, or can this symmetry be generalized and can have a biological merit?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for bringing this up. This is an interesting observation. However, we should hasten to add that this apparent symmetry is a consequence of our simplified chemical and transport model, as we have verified by making numerous extensions of the model. We now discuss these issues in detail in the section &quot;Tradeoffs between number of enzymes, number of cisternae and enzyme specificity to achieve given complexity&quot; of the revised manuscipt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The paper mentions examples of cells that have a complex Golgi and a complex glycan distribution. Is the opposite also true, e.g., that cells with a simple Golgi do not have complex glycan distributions? Or can a complex Golgi sometimes result in a low glycan complexity?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the complexity of the glycan distribution depends on <italic>both</italic> the complexity of the Golgi and the complexity of the chemical processing, this is a very difficult question to answer. We do feel that a systematic analysis of the enzyme chemistry, Golgi morphology and transport would shed more light on this issue, and indeed this is one of the suggestions that emerge from our analysis. For this paper, we have taken the glycan MS data of of a few cell types – planaria, hydra, mouse and human blood cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One wonders how robust the glycosylation process is according to the model proposed? Figure 5b neatly shows that large enzyme repartitioning can lead to a completely different glycan distribution. But how do small variations of the optimal reaction distribution affect the outcome? Would it be possible to quantify the robustness and analyze it systematically (not just show a few random examples)? How is robustness affected by the number of cisternae and enzymes? What are biological implications of this result?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the referee for bringing up this very interesting issue. We now provide a detailed analysis of the sensitivity to small perturbations around the optimal solution by calculating the Hessian of the KL divergence in the new section &quot;Geometry of the Fidelity landscape&quot; of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Why does the mouse glycan distribution have a lower &quot;likelihood&quot; than the human one, even with an increasing number of GMM (Figure 1b)? Is this a coincidence or can this be generalized?</p></disp-quote><p>Apart from updating the GMM procedure, we have also included data from two different organisms, <italic>Hydra</italic> and <italic>Planaria</italic>, in our study. Comparisons across these species tell a story when viewed from our framework.</p><p>Figure 5 compares the complexity of glycan profiles of Hydra, Planaria and Humans. Number of cell types in Hydra, Planaria and Humans are around 41 [15], 44 [16] and 103 [17] respectively, based on transcriptome analysis (these are lower bounds based on the main cell types, and especially for Planaria and Hydra, are subject to constant revision). These studies cluster thousands of cells from various tissues in the organism on the basis of statistical similarity of mRNA expression in the cell, with each cluster representing a cell type. This method is quite good for estimating the cell types in simpler organisms or single tissues but undercounts the number of cell types for humans due to limited cell number of each cell type in the sample. Based on morphology the number of cell types in humans is estimated to be around 200 [18].</p><p>Our analysis of the MSMS data of these organisms suggest that organism with fewer cell types have less complex glycan distribution.</p><p>It would be interesting to determine systematic correlations between complexity of Golgi, number of glycosylation enzymes and the complexity of the glycan distribution, in organisms such as algae (which typically possess many cisternae).</p><p>We have included this figure and a related discussion in Appendix 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[1] Gabius, Hans-Joachim. ”The sugar code: Why glycans are so important.” Biosystems 164 (2018): 102111.</p><p>[2] Bard, Frederic, and Joanne Chia. ”Cracking the glycome encoder: signaling, trafficking, and glycosylation.” Trends in cell biology 26.5 (2016): 379-388.</p><p>[3] Sengupta, Anirvan M.
