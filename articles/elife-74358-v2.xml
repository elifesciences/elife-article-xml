protein cargo. Genes encoding nanocompartments are widespread in bacteria and archaea, and recent works have characterized the biochemical function of several cargo enzymes. However, the importance of these organelles to host physiology is poorly understood. Here, we report that the human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) produces a nanocompartment that contains the dye-decolorizing peroxidase DyP. We show that this nanocompartment is important for the ability of Mtb to resist oxidative stress in low pH environments, including during infection of host cells and upon treatment with a clinically relevant antibiotic. Our findings are the first to implicate a nanocompartment in bacterial pathogenesis and reveal a new mechanism that Mtb uses to combat oxidative stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>encapsulin</kwd><kwd>oxidative defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lien</surname><given-names>Katie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savage</surname><given-names>David F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI143722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Sarah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A peroxidase-containing nanocompartment in the bacterial pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> protects against oxidative stress and antibiotic treatment in the host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The success of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) as a human pathogen results from its ability to avoid, resist, or subvert immunological mechanisms that are effective against most pathogens. Mtb has a remarkable ability to withstand the microbicidal arsenal of host macrophages, including the low pH of the lysosome and a diverse array of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host respiratory burst. However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of resistance to these toxic insults.</p><p>Upon phagocytosis of a pathogen, macrophages and neutrophils unleash a potent microbicidal arsenal, including a respiratory burst that leads to the rapid release of ROS that kill and degrade most microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Benna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nathan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Segal, 2005</xref>). The production of ROS is initiated when NADPH oxidase assembles on pathogen-containing phagosomes and initiates a series of reactions that produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hyperchlorous acid, lipid peroxides, and other toxic reactive molecules. Importantly, Mtb is highly resistant to oxidative stress, enabling the bacterium to survive within macrophages and neutrophils and establish chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 1992</xref>). Although some oxidative defense mechanisms have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrt and Schnappinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nambi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voskuil et al., 2011</xref>), the Mtb genome encodes a large number of enzymes that could participate in defense against oxidative stress that remain uncharacterized. For example, Mtb encodes ~15 peroxidases, a class of enzymes with diverse functions that form the front line of oxidative defense in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mishra and Imlay, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh and Eltis, 2015</xref>). It is unclear why Mtb encodes such a diversity of peroxidases, and little is known about what individual roles these enzymes may play in both resistance to oxidative stress and in normal bacterial physiology. One possibility is that specific peroxidase genes may participate in defense against different types of ROS generated during the respiratory burst. One of the most intriguing peroxidases encoded by Mtb is DyP, a member of the dye-decolorizing peroxidase family of proteins. DyP enzymes are unique amongst peroxidases in that some family members have been shown to have optimal activity at pH 4–5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh and Eltis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uchida et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, DyP is the only Mtb peroxidase predicted to be packaged inside a proteinaceous organelle known as a bacterial nanocompartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial cells were long thought to lack compartmentalization of function. However, the identification of organelle-like structures including microcompartments, anammoxosomes, magnetosomes, and, most recently, encapsulin nanocompartments has revolutionized our understanding of bacterial cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferousi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uebe and Schüler, 2016</xref>). Characterized nanocompartments are proteinaceous shells that are 24–45 nm in diameter and comprised of 60–240 subunits of a single protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giessen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). This shell surrounds (‘encapsulates’) an enzymatic cargo protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). Although putative encapsulin systems have been identified in &gt;900 bacterial and archaeal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nichols et al., 2020</xref>), very little is known about their physiological function. Based on genomic organization, encapsulin systems are often predicted to compartmentalize enzymes involved in oxidative stress defense, iron storage, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>). However, the function of an encapsulin system has only ever been demonstrated in a single bacterial species, <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>), and the physiological role of nanocompartments is largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that an Mtb nanocompartment containing DyP is crucial for resisting oxidative stress at low pH. Mutants lacking the nanocompartment are highly attenuated when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5, the pH of the lysosome. We show that this attenuation is linked to fatty acid metabolism in the bacteria. Further, we show that encapsulation of the DyP enzyme promotes its function, the first report to demonstrate a role for encapsulation in endogenous bacterial physiology. Finally, we show that the Mtb nanocompartment system is required for full growth in macrophages, and for resistance to the antibiotic pyrazinamide (PZA), demonstrating the importance of this system for a globally significant pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The Mtb genome encodes the predicted encapsulin gene <italic>Rv0798c/</italic>Cfp29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>) in a two-gene operon with <italic>Rv0799c</italic>, the dye-decolorizing peroxidase DyP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Overexpression of the predicted Mtb encapsulin gene in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was previously shown to result in the formation of nanocompartment-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>). Three potential cargo proteins for the nanocompartment were proposed based on a putative shared encapsulation targeting sequence: DyP, FolB, and BrfB. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, overexpression of each protein with Cfp29 resulted in encapsulation. However, this study did not address whether Mtb produces endogenous nanocompartments or identify the specific function of these compartments in Mtb biology. A transposon screen has identified Cfp29 as a gene required for growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and Cfp29 has long been known as an immunodominant T cell antigen in both mice and human TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weldingh and Andersen, 1999</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Mtb may produce an encapsulin nanocompartment that is important for pathogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mtb produces endogenous nanocompartments that package a peroxidase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the nanocompartment operon in Mtb that encodes the encapsulin shell protein (Cfp29) and the dye-decoloring peroxidase cargo protein (DyP).

Clarified protein lysates from <italic>E. coli</italic> were purified by ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. Assembled encapsulin nanocompartments are distinguishable by their high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, a fraction from the purification contained a high molecular weight species &gt; 260 kDa observable on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Fractions containing putative nanocompartments were pooled and imaged using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of icosahedral structures with the expected diameter of ~25 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Mtb produces nanocompartments under normal laboratory growth conditions, we performed an ultracentrifugation-based nanocompartment isolation strategy using wild-type H37Rv strain bacteria grown to mid-log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of the nanocompartment fraction identified both the encapsulin protein Cfp29 and the peroxidase DyP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). TEM analysis confirmed the presence of nanocompartment particles ~25 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, Rv1762c, a protein of unknown function, was consistently identified in purified nanocompartment preparations from Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We were unable to identify either FolB or BrfB in nanocompartments from Mtb, suggesting that these proteins are not endogenous substrates for encapsulation under normal laboratory growth conditions for Mtb.</p><p>Cfp29 (‘<underline>c</underline>ulture <underline>f</underline>iltrate <underline>p</underline>rotein 29’) was originally identified in the supernatants of Mtb cells grown in axenic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenkrands et al., 1998</xref>). As Cfp29 lacks a secretory signal sequence and is part of a large macromolecular complex, it is unclear how a nanocompartment could be actively secreted. However, nanocompartment structures are remarkably stable and it is possible that nanocompartments released from dying bacteria accumulate in culture as they are highly resistant to proteolysis/degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassidy-Amstutz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>DyP proteins are known to have low pH optima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uchida et al., 2015</xref>). To demonstrate that Mtb DyP has a similarly low pH optimum, SUMO-tagged unencapsulated DyP was purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the peroxidase activity was evaluated at a range of pH values using the ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) dye-decolorizing assay previously used to characterize DyP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> DyP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uchida et al., 2015</xref>), purified Mtb DyP had increased enzymatic activity in low pH environments, with the greatest efficacy at pH 4.0, the lowest pH tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next tested the ability of encapsulated DyP to degrade ABTS across a range of pH values. Similar to free DyP, the encapsulated enzyme had the highest activity at pH ~4.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate the stability and functionality of Mtb nanocompartments under acid stress, a condition that mimics the host lysosomal environment. The Mtb DyP protein was previously shown to function as a bona fide dye-decolorizing peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>). Because peroxidases consume H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, they often participate in defense against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mishra and Imlay, 2012</xref>). During macrophage infection, the phagocytes initiate an oxidative burst that exposes Mtb to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Benna et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore reasoned that DyP-containing nanocompartments may function to protect Mtb from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress. To test this hypothesis, we created a mutant strain lacking both genes from the nanocompartment operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Δoperon). Lysates from Δoperon mutants were used for nanocompartment purification (data not shown) and western blot analysis using an antibody for Cfp29 as a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Data from these analyses revealed that Δoperon mutants cannot produce viable nanocompartments. In addition, we isolated a transposon mutant (<italic>DyP::Tn</italic>) containing an insertion in <italic>DyP</italic>, a mutation that eliminated expression of both Cfp29 and DyP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To test whether DyP-containing nanocompartments are required for defense against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we exposed wild-type and <italic>DyP::Tn</italic> Mtb to increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and monitored bacterial survival. Mutants lacking DyP nanocompartments were more susceptible to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when compared with wild-type bacteria as measured by OD<sub>600</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and by plating for colony-forming units (CFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the phenotype was relatively modest. We next reasoned that DyP nanocompartments might be required to resist oxidative stress in acidic environments that more closely mimic the in vivo environment. During infection, Mtb bacilli encounter the low pH of the phagolysosome and the ability to tolerate low pH is required for Mtb survival in both infected macrophages and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vandal et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore tested the susceptibility of DyP mutants to a combination of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and acid stress (pH 4.5). Wild-type Mtb was able to withstand these conditions and did not significantly decrease in number over a 3-day exposure period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the Δoperon mutant was resistant to each stressor individually, but was highly susceptible to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, DyP-containing nanocompartments are required to protect bacteria from oxidative stress at low pH.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nanocompartments protect Mtb from oxidative stress in acidic environments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) OD<sub>600</sub> measurements of wild-type and <italic>DyP::Tn</italic> Mtb grown in 7H9 medium following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 96 hr.

To accomplish this, <italic>DyP::Tn</italic> mutants were complemented with constructs expressing DyP alone (pDyP), Cfp29 encapsulin alone (pCfp29), or both proteins (pOperon). As expected, expression of DyP did not restore production of nanocompartments, whereas expression of Cfp29 alone resulted in the formation of empty nanocompartment structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Restoring expression of the nanocompartment shell protein in the absence of DyP had no effect on bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Complementation by overexpression of unencapsulated DyP was sufficient to confer almost wild-type levels of resistance to oxidative and acid stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, complementation with both Cfp29 and DyP resulted in enhanced resistance to these stressors when compared to mutants complemented with DyP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that encapsulation of DyP enhances its function.</p><p>In the mutant complemented with DyP alone, it is possible that overexpression of the peroxidase compensates for the lack of encapsulation.

As expected, greater attenuation was observed in the mutant lacking both DyP and Cfp29 (Δoperon). Complementation of the Δcfp29 mutant fully restored resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that encapsulation of DyP has a modest, yet significant impact on protection against oxidative stress in low pH conditions.</p><p>We next sought to test whether nanocompartment mutants have altered redox homeostasis in the presence of oxidative stress. We transformed wild-type and mutant strains with Mrx1-roGFP, a fluorescent reporter of redox potential in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaskar et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, the Δoperon mutant had an intracellular environment at baseline that was more oxidizing than wild-type bacteria exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating a failure of redox homeostasis in mutants lacking the DyP encapsulin system. This oxidizing cellular environment was further enhanced by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We did not observe a difference in the redox state of Δcfp29. Thus, mutants lacking DyP-containing nanocompartments exhibit significant dysregulation of redox homeostasis.</p><p>The Mtb genome encodes ~15 putative peroxidase genes, including DyP. To determine whether other bacterial peroxidases participate in the defense against oxidative stress at low pH, we performed a transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013</xref>). To do so, we created a transposon library containing ~100K individual transposon mutants and exposed this library to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5 for 3 days, at which point the surviving bacteria were plated. Transposon gene junctions were amplified and sequenced from the recovered bacteria, and the sequencing data were analyzed using TRANSIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeJesus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data revealed that of the 18 putative enzymes encoded by Mtb that could be involved in oxidative defense, including peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases, only two genes were required for survival in the culture conditions—<italic>DyP</italic> and <italic>KatG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>KatG</italic> encodes a catalase-peroxidase that is important for defense against oxidative stress in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pym et al., 2002</xref>). Coincidentally, KatG is also required for activation of isoniazid (INH), a central component of anti-TB therapy. Approximately 10% of TB cases are caused by INH-resistant bacteria, many of which have loss-of-function mutations in KatG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seifert et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, KatG variants that do not activate INH often display a concomitant decrease in peroxidase and catalase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeVito and Morris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). Both the high proportion of KatG mutant bacteria in the human population and studies of virulence in animals suggest that KatG mutants are still capable of growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pym et al., 2002</xref>). The fact that both DyP and KatG mutants are important for survival in oxidative stress at low pH suggests that the DyP nanocompartment may provide redundancy that compensates for a loss of KatG in INH-resistant strains of Mtb.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Susceptibility of Mtb nanocompartment mutants to oxidative and acid stress is mediated by free fatty acids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) data showing normalized sequence reads per gene for all putative Mtb peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases and (<bold>B</bold>) lipid and cholesterol metabolism Mtb mutants that were significantly attenuated following 72 hr exposure to 2.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5.

Mtb biology is highly linked to lipid biology; Mtb granulomas are rich in free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2010</xref>) and the bacteria utilize lipids as a source of nutrition both during macrophage infection ex vivo and growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marrero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, mutants containing transposon insertions in three independent subunits of the Mce1 complex, which is required for import of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>), were susceptible to oxidative stress under acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The standard Mtb culture medium, 7H9, contains bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has binding sites for fatty acids and may also serve as a cholesterol shuttle in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Vusse, 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that fatty acids carried by albumin may become toxic following exposure to oxidative stress and low pH and that import of fatty acids into the bacteria might be a protective mechanism. . We therefore tested whether fatty acids are required for the susceptibility of Δoperon mutants using exposure to acid and oxidative stress in Sauton’s broth, a minimal medium that lacks BSA, and found that in the absence of fatty acids the Δoperon mutants persisted to the same degree as wild-type bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test whether lipids bound to BSA mediate the susceptibility of DyP mutants to acid and oxidative stress, we cultured wild-type and Δoperon Mtb in media constituted with fatty acid-free BSA and exposed the bacteria to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5 for 3 days. In the absence of BSA-bound lipids, we found that the Δoperon mutant was not susceptible to oxidative stress at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). 7H9 medium prepared with lipid-free BSA was then reconstituted with oleic acid, an abundant lipid found in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmagid et al., 2015</xref>). Reconstitution of fatty acid-free medium with oleic acid restored toxicity to nanocompartment mutants under conditions of acid and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the phagosomal lipids used by Mtb as a carbon source may be toxic to bacteria lacking functional nanocompartments under conditions of oxidative stress.</p><p>We considered the possibility that lipids present in the medium might disrupt Mtb membranes, resulting in altered pH homeostasis and a drop in cytosolic pH. Interestingly, in acidified medium we found that the intracellular pH of wild-type bacteria dropped from ~pH 7.5 to ~pH 6.2, and this decrease was dependent on the presence of albumin-bound fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data confirm published results demonstrating that the cytosolic pH of Mtb drops significantly during acid exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vandal et al., 2008</xref>). A lower cytosolic pH would possibly impair the function of many other bacterial enzymes important for resisting oxidative stress and place increasing importance on enzymes that can function in acidic environments, such as DyP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uchida et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these data may explain why functional nanocompartments are critical for bacterial survival when Mtb is exposed to acid and oxidative stress in a fatty acid-rich environment.</p><p>Our in vitro findings that DyP nanocompartments are important for defense against a combination of oxidative stress, low pH, and fatty acids suggested that this system may be important for Mtb survival in the phagosomal environment. Therefore, we sought to determine whether DyP nanocompartments are required for bacterial growth in host cells. We found that the Δoperon strain was consistently attenuated for growth in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We attempted to complement this phenotype; however, the limited dynamic range between wild-type and mutant in macrophages made clean interpretation of the complementation results difficult. As these genes are predicted to be in a two-gene operon with no other predicted genes in close proximity, polar effects are extremely unlikely. However, to confirm that the phenotype of the mutants in macrophages is due to the loss of the two-gene encapsulin operon, we repeated the experiment with the independently derived <italic>Dyp:Tn</italic> mutant and also observed attenuated growth in macrophages across repeated experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Nanocompartment mutants are attenuated for survival in macrophages and are more susceptible to pyrazinamide (PZA) treatment.</title><p>CFU enumeration of wild-type Mtb and (<bold>A</bold>) Δoperon or (<bold>B</bold>) DyP::Tn mutants during infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.

PZA is thought to disrupt the cell wall of Mtb, which leads to acidification of the bacterial cytosol. A recent study in human TB patients demonstrated that the pH of necrotic lung cavities is ~5.5, a finding that may also explain the efficacy of PZA in treating Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kempker et al., 2017</xref>). Since DyP is critical for protection of Mtb against oxidative stress at low pH, we considered whether nanocompartments may mediate Mtb resistance to PZA. To test bacterial susceptibility to PZA, we treated wild-type and Δoperon Mtb with PZA in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 5.5. We found that mutants lacking the DyP nanocompartment were sensitive to concentrations of PZA that did not impact growth of the wild-type bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We next set out to test whether mutants lacking the DyP operon are susceptible to PZA treatment in vivo. We infected BALB/C mice with wild-type and mutant bacteria by the aerosol route with a dose of ~250 bacteria instilled on day 0 of infection. PZA treatment began on day 14 and continued until day 35, at which time we enumerated CFU in the lungs. We did not find that Δoperon mutants were more attenuated than wild-type bacteria in mouse lungs at 35 days post infection, at least under the conditions examined. However, Δoperon mutants were significantly more susceptible to treatment with PZA in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>)<italic>,</italic> demonstrating that the DyP encapsulin operon is required for endogenous resistance to PZA treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report that a protein nanocompartment in Mtb encapsulates the dye-decolorizing peroxidase DyP. By demonstrating that the encapsulin system is important for resisting oxidative stress at low pH, we provide the first evidence that encapsulin systems contribute to oxidative stress in a bacterial pathogen, and only the second demonstration of a functional encapsulin system in any species. Furthermore, we expand our understanding of the importance of encapsulation in enzyme function by demonstrating that the protein shell encapsulating DyP enhances its function in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the DyP nanocompartment system is essential for the ability of Mtb to grow in host macrophages and to resist killing by the antibiotic PZA. These findings are the first demonstration that a nanocompartment system is important for virulence in any bacterial pathogen.</p><p>Bacterial protein-based compartments are emerging as functional equivalents of eukaryotic organelles that can sequester enzymatic reactions from the environment of the cytosol. Bacteria appear to have two predominant classes of protein based organelles, the relatively well-understood bacterial microcompartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerfeld et al., 2018</xref>) and the more recently discovered bacterial nanocompartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). Rather than using a lipid membrane for compartmentalization, both bacterial microcompartments and nanocompartments consist of a porous protein shell that surrounds enzymatic proteins. Bacterial microcompartments that enable utilization of specialized nutrients including ethanolamine and 1,2 propane diol have previously been implicated in pathogenesis of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jakobson and Tullman-Ercek, 2016</xref>). Nanocompartments, which are 10 times smaller than a typical bacterial microcompartment, have been identified bioinformatically in over 900 bacterial species; however, very few studies have addressed the role that nanocompartments play in bacterial physiology. Bioinformatic analysis and the heterologous expression of nanocompartment systems from diverse bacteria in <italic>E. coli</italic> have suggested that these systems might function in iron mineralization, oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giessen and Silver, 2017</xref>). However, the only nanocompartment that has been shown to be important for survival under conditions of stress is the ferritin-like protein containing compartment in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, which is required for resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>). Our demonstration that an encapsulin system is required for resistance to oxidative stress in Mtb significantly broadens the potential role and impact of nanocompartment systems in bacterial physiology.</p><p>A previous report examined the Mtb nanocompartment by heterologous expression of the encapsulin gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Coexpression with three potential substrates identified bioinformatically based on a putative signal sequence suggested that three proteins can be encapsulated by the Mtb nanocompartment: DyP, FolB, and BrfB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that Mtb produces this nanocompartment. However, of the three potential cargo proteins, only DyP was identified in encapsulin systems purified from logarithmically growing bacteria. Why is the DyP protein encapsulated? There is almost no understanding of the role of encapsulation in bacterial physiology despite the widespread presence of encapsulins across bacterial species. In this study, we found that DypB alone can protect the bacteria from oxidative stress at low pH. It is possible that in some circumstances, particularly when the stressor is not maximal, encapsulation of DyP may not be necessary. We expect that further investigation of this nanocompartment system in Mtb and in other bacterial species will reveal additional roles of encapsulins in the bacterial physiology.</p><p>We showed that Mtb mutants lacking the DyP encapsulin system have an altered redox balance at baseline, with a significantly more oxidative cytosol than wild-type. However, under standard growth conditions, the mutants are not defective. While mutants exhibit a small defect for survival when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 6.5, they are highly attenuated at low pH in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, the attenuation of the mutants under these conditions requires the presence of fatty acids bound to BSA in the culture medium. Why is the DyP encapsulin system required for growth under these conditions? It is possible that this system is required for detoxifying an oxidative species other than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> itself, such as a lipid peroxide. It is also possible that the low pH compromises the integrity of the cell wall such that oxidative damage is sustained, or that the low pH magnifies the importance of DyP, which has a low pH optimum. Nevertheless, although the exact function of the DyP encapsulin system remains to be elucidated, this system is clearly important for pathogenesis as mutants fail to grow in host macrophages. Intriguingly, encapsulin systems have been shown to confer stability to the enzymatic cargo under harsh conditions, including heat and protease exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>). Cfp29 was originally identified as a component of short-term culture filtrate present in broth of growing cells, leading to the supposition that this protein is secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenkrands et al., 1998</xref>). Given that nanocompartments spontaneously assemble inside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cassidy-Amstutz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Snijder et al., 2016</xref>), it is unlikely that a structure the size of a ribosome could be secreted. We speculate that nanocompartments are released from dying cells, and that their extreme stability promotes their accumulation in axenic bacterial culture. Indeed, this stability may partially explain why Cfp29 is a known immunodominant antigen for T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenkrands et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that nanocompartments released from dying cells in vivo could continue to provide defense against oxidative stress for the surviving bacteria.</p><p>We found that only two peroxidases, KatG and DyP, are required for survival in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5. These findings raise the possibility that these peroxidases have redundant function in vivo, possibly explaining the lack of attenuation we observed in Δoperon mutants in BALB/C mice at 35 days post infection. It is also possible that Δoperon mutants are not attenuated at this timepoint in BALB/C mice as the Tn-seq screen that previously identified Cfp29 as being required for growth in mouse lungs used the C57BL/6 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). KatG mutants are highly prevalent in the clinic as loss of function in KatG prevents activation of the INH prodrug. Importantly, many KatG mutants that fail to activate INH are also defective for catalase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeVito and Morris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). This raises the possibility that the DyP nanocompartment system could partially compensate for a loss of KatG catalase activity, enabling these drug resistant mutants to survive in vivo. In addition to a potential role for DyP in the context of INH treatment and INH resistant infections, we found that DyP encapsulin mutants are susceptible to treatment with PZA, an antibiotic known to require acidic conditions for efficacy. Thus, we predict that this encapsulin system may limit the efficacy of PZA treatment of patients.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that Mtb produces a functional nanocompartment containing the peroxidase DyP. This system is essential for resisting oxidative stress at low pH, conditions that resemble the host lysosome. In addition, the DyP encapsulin system is required for growth in host macrophages and for resistance to the antibiotic PZA. Previously encapsulin systems have been primarily studied in the context of heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> and for bioengineering or structural studies. Our findings demonstrate the significance of encapsulin nanocompartments in bacterial physiology in the globally significant pathogen Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A nanocompartment containing the peroxidase DypB contributes to defense against oxidative stress in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Neeraj Dhar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the detailed reviewer comments, there are several interesting aspects of the work but at this stage, there are notable limitations also. Given this, we are rejecting the manuscript in its current form. That said, your findings are compelling indeed and if you are able to address the concerns, I would be willing to reconsider the study as a new manuscript, where you indicate how you have dealt with the reviewer's comments from the first round of review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Lien and colleagues report on the role of encapsulin Cfp29/Rv0798c and peroxidase DypB/Rv0799c in the resistance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to oxidative stress. The study builds on a previous study (Contreras et al. 2014) which reported the detection of Cfp29-encapsulated DypB in recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic>; here, the authors show that encapsulation also occurs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In addition, the authors show that a cfp29/dypB-null mutant is highly sensitive to H202 at acidic pH, and their data suggest that encapsulation of DypB increases peroxidase activity. Finally, the authors report that dypB- and cfp29/dypB-null mutants are altered in their ability to multiply within macrophages.</p><p>Overall, the concept of compartmentalization in prokaryotes is of great interest; perhaps the most interesting conclusion is that the encapsulation of a virulence factor contributes to resistance to host-imposed stress in a major pathogen, although the role of Cfp29 in enhancing DypB activity seems rather modest, both in vitro and in vivo. However, the study as a whole contains many results that are poorly related (see comments below), the reader is finally left with an attractive hypothesis that is not sufficiently explored mechanistically, and the study appears a bit preliminary in this respect. How are nanocapsules secreted? Are they present in the mycobacterial vacuole? Is the phenotype of dypB- and cfp29/dypB-null mutants in macrophages really related to oxidative stress? What is the phenotype of these mutants in vivo? Addressing these questions, and perhaps others, would have allowed a more comprehensive study, instead of including unrelated or poorly related data on KatG, lipids, etc.</p><p>– Data suggesting that &quot;DypB encapsulation enhances protection against oxidative stress under low pH conditions&quot; are not entirely convincing. In Figure 2D, the expression of DypB in the DypB::Tn mutant almost fully restores resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Is the difference between DypB::Tn+pDypB and DypB::Tn+pOperon significant? Similarly, in Figure 2E, the phenotype of the cfp29-null mutant should be restored by genetic complementation.</p><p>– The phenotype of the Rv1762c mutant is quite clear (Figure 2F), but the mutant has not been complemented, and more importantly, the question of whether this is related to encapsulation is not explored at all; I suggest deleting this data as it adds nothing to the overall message.</p><p>– &quot;Based on the Tn-seq data, we hypothesized that lipids may be responsible for the sensitivity of DypB mutants to oxidative stress under acidic conditions&quot;. I do not understand this hypothesis. The Tn-seq data reveal mutants that are attenuated under conditions of acidic and oxidative stress. As far as I understand, the experiment was not designed to identify the genes involved in the sensitivity of the DypB mutant, which would have required a library of Tn mutants in a dypB-null background.</p><p>– The effect of lipids on the phenotype of the operon-null mutant is clear; but the reader is given no further explanation here. The same applies for katG/INH; these results are poorly related to the study as a whole.</p><p>– The phenotype of both mutants in macrophages is quite modest and should be verified by genetic complementation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors describe and characterize the role of a two-gene operon predicted to encode for an encapsulated nanocompartment in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The authors show that heterologous expression of these genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> produces Cfp29 nanocompartments that encapsulate the DypB peroxidase and protect it from degradation. They also provide first evidence that Cfp29-DypB nanocompartments are produced by Mtb under normal growth conditions. Further characterization revealed that DypB had maximal activity at low pH, an environment that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> faces during its intracellular lifestyle. To determine if the encapsulated DypB serves a protective role against oxidative stress, M. tb strains carrying deletions of the DypB operon were tested against oxidative stress under normal and acidic conditions. The mutant strain was found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress especially in acidic environments. A transposon sequencing screening identified DypB and KatG as the only peroxidades required for survival to oxidative stress at low pH, together with other genes involved in lipid or cholesterol metabolism. Interestingly, the hypersusceptibility of the DypB mutant was found to be dependent on free lipids present in the culture medium. Use of a redox potential fluorescent reporter revealed the mutant to have a more oxidizing intracellular environment compared to wild-type bacteria. These observations leaded to the conclusion that DypB nanocompartments protect bacteria from oxidative stress, low pH, and fatty acids suggesting that this system may be important for survival in phagosomes. This hypothesis is proved by infecting bone-marrow derived macrophages with the WT and the double mutant strains and showing that the mutant is attenuated. Finally, the double mutant was also shown to be more susceptible to Pyrazinamide suggesting that nanocompartments are important for resistance to oxidative stress.</p><p>The manuscript is written well and the experiments have been planned and executed well, to demonstrate the role of the DypB peroxidase against oxidative stress.</p><p>The only major concern is the relatively lesser focus on the encapsulation aspect. The data showing the presence of nanocompartments in Mtb and the encapsulation of DypB is quite convincing. However, all the subsequent characterization and most of the follow-up experiments are done with the mutant strain lacking both the DypB as well as the cfp29 genes. The authors already have a strain (∆cfp29) that expresses an unencapsulated DypB ( or even DypB::tn+pDypB). These mutants should be included in the stress-susceptibility experiments shown in Figures 3 and 4. This set of experiments along with the ones with the deletion of the complete operon will allow the clearer understanding of the role of DypB and the process of encapsulation. Since the main focus of the manuscript is about nanocompartments, disentangling this is crucial to the message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In Lien et al., the authors investigate a nanocompartment in the human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and explore how the cargo DypB, a peroxidase, contributes to bacterial defense against oxidative and acidic stress. Towards this, the authors have isolated nanocompartments and identified DypB as cargo. They show that mutants lacking the nanocompartment are attenuated in vitro by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in an acidic environment in the presence of lipids. The authors propose an attractive hypothesis-- that the bacteria encapsulate DypB to prevent its degradation by host cellular proteases and that it plays a role in resisting oxidative and acidic stress that the bacteria encounter inside macrophages. They show that DypB and nanocompartment mutants are attenuated in their survival inside the macrophages, although they do not show that this is due to their enhanced susceptibility to pH and oxidative stress. Overall, this is an interesting manuscript which has the potential to add important insight into encapsulation systems and the defense mechanisms that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> employs to survive inside acid and ROS rich phagosomes. The work, however, seems preliminary. It could be substantially strengthened by additional macrophage experiments, which currently lack important controls and are under-developed, as well as in vivo experiments.</p><p>1.

However, we do observe that Cfp29 also makes a smaller, yet reproducible and statistically significant contribution. To make this more convincing we have added the significance analysis to figure 2D. We have also complemented the Cfp29 mutant as requested, new Figure 2F. Given that there is a lack of any demonstration in the literature that an encapsulin protein is important in the physiology of a bacterium, despite the widespread presence of encapsulins in hundreds of bacterial species, we believe that this result, though somewhat modest, is important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The phenotype of the Rv1762c mutant is quite clear (Figure 2F), but the mutant has not been complemented, and more importantly, the question of whether this is related to encapsulation is not explored at all; I suggest deleting this data as it adds nothing to the overall message.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have removed the data as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Based on the Tn-seq data, we hypothesized that lipids may be responsible for the sensitivity of DypB mutants to oxidative stress under acidic conditions&quot;.

However, because Tn-Seq is comprehensive, we also identified a wider set of genes required for resistance under these conditions. We were intrigued by our observation that mutants encoding multiple subunits of the Mce1 fatty acid importer were susceptible under these conditions. This led us to hypothesize that importing fatty acids might protect the bacteria from fatty acid toxicity generated under oxidative stress at low pH. This caused us to test whether eliminating fatty acids from the medium entirely eliminated the effect, which we did observe. We realize we did not explain this rationale clearly in the text, so we thank the reviewer for raising this question.

However, we do acknowledge that we do not yet understand the role of fatty acids in the phenotype we describe. This is a recently discovered biological system about which almost nothing is known in any bacterial species, and there is much we need to learn moving forward. However, we would argue that it is beyond the scope of the first publication on the endogenous system in Mtb to fully elucidate the mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The phenotype of both mutants in macrophages is quite modest and should be verified by genetic complementation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that the phenotype is modest in macrophages. The phenotypes of TB bacterial mutants are often modest in macrophages, given the limited dynamic range of growth. We have attempted to complement these results however, complementation of the nanocompartment system has proven to be difficult, particularly in macrophages. The limited dynamic range between wild-type and mutant in macrophages also makes interpretation of the complementation results tricky.</p><p>To confirm that the phenotype of these mutants in macrophages is due to the loss of the two gene encapsuling operon, we performed this experiment with two independently derived mutants &gt;5 times, and always observe attenuation of both mutants in macrophages.</p><p>Furthermore, these genes are predicted to be in a 2 gene operon with no other predicted genes in close proximity, therefore polar effects are extremely unlikely.

First, we have shown that although the DyP mutant has defects in intracellular redox state at baseline, which is exacerbated under conditions of oxidative stress, we do not observe a change in redox state in a Cfp29 mutant (Figure 2G). We have added this to the text. In addition, we have not observed a phenotype of the Cfp29 mutant in exposure to PZA, however it is possible that is because we have not identified conditions under which the bacteria are most susceptible to this antibiotic. We do find consistently that the Cfp29 protein plays a small but significant role in protecting against exposure to oxidative stress at low pH, and we do believe that as we continue to explore this system we will better understand under which encapsulation is important for physiological function. It is important to note that we provide the first evidence that encapsulin systems contribute to oxidative stress in a bacterial pathogen, and only the second demonstration of a functional encapsulin system in any species. We therefore think these findings while exciting and informative for microbiologists across disciplines, are still by necessity preliminary due to the nascent status of the field.</p><p>We have expanded our discussion of the significance of these results in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In Lien et al., the authors investigate a nanocompartment in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and explore how the cargo DypB, a peroxidase, contributes to bacterial defense against oxidative and acidic stress.

Second, we feel that it is difficult to extrapolate the biological significance of a positive result, as providing an enzyme that can function as a catalase should protect bacteria from oxidative stress, regardless of whether it may function naturally outside the cell. We do not feel that this is an important point of the story at this time, and for the sake of clarity prefer to omit the data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.
