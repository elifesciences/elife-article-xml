address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/">citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “Coding-Independent Regulation of the Tumor Suppressor PTEN by Competing Endogenous 'mRNAs' by Tay and colleagues, published in <italic>Cell</italic> in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3C, 3D, 3G, 3H, 5A and 5B, and in Supplemental Figures 3A and B. Tay and colleagues proposed a new regulatory mechanism based on competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which regulate target genes by competitive binding of shared microRNAs. They test their model by identifying and confirming ceRNAs that target <italic>PTEN</italic>. In Figure 3A and B, they report that perturbing expression of putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs affects expression of PTEN. This effect is dependent on functional microRNA machinery (Figure 3G and H), and affects the pathway downstream of PTEN itself (Figures 5A and B). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12470.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12470.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>reproducibility project: cancer biology</kwd><kwd>methodology</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>microRNAs are one of the first identified classes of non-coding RNAs that can modulate the expression of mRNA-coding transcripts by binding to complementary regions in a target gene’s sequence and repressing its expression. Thus, expression levels and availability of these microRNAs can influence gene expression, and there is growing evidence that misregulation of microRNAs is correlated with some forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sen et al., 2014</xref>). Naturally occurring microRNA 'sponges' have been shown to be effective in regulating gene expression by altering the levels of their cognate microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karreth and Pandolfi 2013</xref>). Poliseno and colleagues proposed that pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs with strong homology to coding sequences, could act as the modulators of gene expression as microRNA sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poliseno et al., 2010</xref>). They demonstrated that the pseudogene <italic>PTENP1</italic> could regulate the expression levels of <italic>PTEN</italic> via their cognate microRNAs miR-19b and miR-20a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Poliseno et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, Tay and colleagues expanded upon the previous work to propose a unifying hypothesis of regulatory networks composed of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karreth and Pandolfi 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kartha and Subramanian, 2014</xref>). They suggest that protein-coding RNAs, not just non-coding RNAs, can cross-regulate each other based on competition for shared microRNA regulators; ceRNAs can titrate microRNAs from their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tay et al., 2011</xref>). Continuing their focus on the regulation of <italic>PTEN</italic>, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Song et al., 2012</xref>), Tay and colleagues propose a computational model to identify ceRNAs de novo, termed MuTaME. Using MuTaME, they identified potential ceRNA regulators of <italic>PTEN</italic>, and validated if these candidate ceRNAs could modulate <italic>PTEN</italic> expression in a microRNA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tay et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In Figure 3C, Tay and colleagues examine if silencing ceRNAs targeting <italic>PTEN</italic> would affect the expression levels of a luciferase construct carrying the 3’UTR of <italic>PTEN</italic>. They co-transfected DU145 cells with siRNAs against the candidate <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs along with a luciferase-<italic>PTEN 3’UTR</italic> construct and measured luciferase activity. After confirming knockdown of each target ceRNA (Supplemental Figure 3A), they reported that the loss of three of their candidate ceRNAs - <italic>SERINC1, VAPA</italic> and <italic>CNOT6L</italic>, but not <italic>ZNF460</italic> - reduced the luciferase activity of the <italic>PTEN 3’UTR</italic> construct. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 1.</p><p>In Figure 3D, they demonstrated that only the 3’UTRs of the candidate ceRNAs were required to affect changes in the luciferase activity of the <italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR construct. Ectopic overexpression of the 3’UTRs of the three candidate ceRNAs relieved inhibition of the <italic>PTEN</italic> 3’UTR, as evidenced by increased luciferase activity as compared to controls. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 2.</p><p>To test if this effect was dependent on microRNAs, Tay and colleagues repeated these experiments in <italic>DICER1</italic> mutant HCT116 cells, in which the machinery required for microRNA function is abrogated. Transfection of wild type HCT116 cells with siRNAs targeting the candidate ceRNAs showed a marked reduction in PTEN protein levels, an effect that was not seen in the <italic>DICER1</italic> mutant HCT116 cells (Figures 3G and H). Knockdown of the candidate ceRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR (Supplemental Figure 3B). This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3.</p><p>PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stambolic et al., 1998</xref>), so Tay and colleagues examined if ceRNA modulation affected the phosphorylation of AKT. Loss of <italic>CNOT6L</italic> and <italic>VAPA</italic> in DU145 cells elevated pAKT levels after serum stimulation, an effect that was also observed in wild-type HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). However, this effect was abrogated in <italic>DICER1</italic> mutant HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). They also examined the effect of ceRNAs on the tumorigenic properties conferred by loss of PTEN. Silencing of the ceRNAs <italic>CNOT6L</italic> and <italic>VAPA</italic> increased cell proliferation of DU145 cells and wild-type HCT116 cells, similar to silencing of <italic>PTEN</italic> directly (Figure 5B). This effect was less pronounced in <italic>DICER1</italic> mutant HCT116 cells (Figure 5B). These experiments will be replicated in Protocol 4 and 5.</p><p>Two papers published simultaneously provide support for the actions of ceRNA regulatory networks. Karreth and colleagues, from the same lab as Tay and colleagues, demonstrated in vivo evidence for the actions of ceRNA regulation using the sleeping beauty transposase system in a mouse model of melanoma to identify and confirm putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karreth et al., 2011</xref>). Karreth and colleagues identified <italic>CNOT6L</italic> as a putative <italic>PTEN</italic> ceRNA through the sleeping beauty transposase system, providing further evidence that <italic>CNOT6L</italic> is indeed involved in <italic>PTEN</italic> regulation. Karreth and colleagues focused on <italic>ZEB2</italic>; using siRNA silencing, they reported that the loss of <italic>ZEB2</italic> reduced PTEN protein levels, and affected downstream phosphorylation of AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karreth et al., 2011</xref>). As seen in Tay and colleagues, these effects were dependent on functional microRNA processing; <italic>ZEB2</italic> depletion did not affect PTEN levels in <italic>DICER1</italic> mutant HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karreth et al., 2011</xref>). Sumazin and colleagues used a bioinformatics approach to identify post-translational regulation and elucidated over 7,000 genes they proposed acted as miRNA sponges. By comparing the miRNA programs of genes, they could identify genes with common miR programs, indicating the potential for miRNA-mediated crosstalk between those two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sumazin et al., 2011</xref>). They tested their findings by exploring the regulation of <italic>PTEN</italic>, demonstrating that silencing of putative miRNA program-mediated regulators (mPRs) of <italic>PTEN</italic> decreased <italic>PTEN</italic> expression, and, conversely, that the perturbation of PTEN levels could inversely affect the expression of its mPRs. These manipulations also affected tumor cell growth rates, indicating potential in vivo effects of changes to mPR regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sumazin et al., 2011</xref>). Since the publication of these three papers, numerous other examples of ceRNA regulation have been reported in muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cesana et al., 2011</xref>), human embryonic stem cell renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), regulation of sex determination by SRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Granados-Riveron and Aquino-Jarquin 2014</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zheng et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2015b</xref>), lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karreth et al., 2015</xref>) and the regulation of the tumor-related HMGA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Pandolfi group followed up on their 2011 paper by generating a mathematical model to predict optimal conditions for ceRNA activity, based on a molecular titration mechanism whose effects were correlated to the relative levels of the ceRNA and its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ala et al., 2013</xref>). They then tested their in silico predictions by experimentally exploring the effect of <italic>VAPA</italic> on <italic>PTEN</italic> expression. While silencing of <italic>VAPA</italic> did decrease <italic>PTEN</italic> expression in all five cell lines tested, they noted that the amount of silencing was correlated with the initial <italic>VAPA:PTEN</italic> expression ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ala et al., 2013</xref>). However, Denzler and colleagues challenge the notion that perturbations in ceRNA expression levels could affect target genes at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>). Denzler and colleagues and Ala and colleagues both state that ceRNA effects are dependent on the kinetics of binding, which in turn relies upon the ratio of microRNAs to target sites; increasing the number of target sites through expression of ceRNAs is postulated to affect target gene repression. By quantifying the absolute copy number of the well-studied highly abundant miR-122 and its target sites, Denzler and colleagues showed that large, physiologically unlikely changes in ceRNA expression levels would be required to alter the microRNA: target site ratio enough to perturb target gene expression, casting doubt on the ability of these putative ceRNAs to affect changes in target gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broderick and Zamore 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>). This view was contradicted by Bosson and colleagues, who identified over 3,000 high affinity target sites they claimed could be affected by ceRNAs due to low endogenous microRNA: target site ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bosson et al., 2014</xref>). The activity and impact of potential ceRNA networks is an area of active interest (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

order to produce quantitative replication data, we will run the experiment seven times. Each time we will quantify band intensity. We will determine the standard deviation of band intensity across the biological replicates and combine this with the reported value from the original study to simulate the original effect size. We will use this simulated effect size to determine the number of replicates necessary to reach a power of at least 80%. We will then perform additional replicates, if required, to ensure that the experiment has more than 80% power to detect the original effect.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology core team would like to thank Yvonne Tay and Pier Paolo Pandolfi for generously sharing critical information as well as reagents to ensure the fidelity and quality of this replication attempt.

This study reported a set of genes (NCOA7, BCL11B, SERINC1, ZNF460, NUDT13, DTWD2, and VAPA) regulating the expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The authors describe the following as the essential results of Tay et al., 2011: 1.) When DU145 cells are transfected with a luciferase construct containing the PTEN 3′UTR and siRNAs against each of the putative ceRNAs, luciferase activity decreases in comparison to transfections with the construct and a control siRNA. 2.) When the same cells are transfected with a luciferase construct containing the PTEN 3′UTR and a construct containing the 3′UTR of one of the ceRNAs, luciferase activity increases in comparison to when transfected with the construct and a control construct. 3.) When HCT WT cells are transfected with siRNAs against each of the identified ceRNAs, PTEN expression as measured by protein blot decreases in comparison to transfections with a control siRNA. When this experiment is repeated in HCT Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>, which is impaired in production of miRNA levels, the reduction of PTEN upon ceRNA knockdown is abrogated, supporting the idea that the response to modulating the ceRNAs is miRNA dependent. 4.) When DU125 and HCT WT cells are transected with an siRNA against PTEN or one of two ceRNAs (CNO a VAPA), cell proliferation increases in comparison to when transfected with a control siRNA. When this experiment is repeated in HCT Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>, the increased proliferation upon knockdown of either of the two ceRNAs, but not PTEN, is reduced. 5.) When DU125 and HCT WT cells are transected with an siRNA against PTEN or one of two ceRNAs (CNO a VAPA) and serum starved, phosphorylation of Akt increases after restimulation, in comparison to when transfected with a control siRNA. When this experiment is repeated in HCT Dicer<sup>Ex5</sup>, the increase in Akt phosphorylation upon knockdown of either of the two ceRNAs, but not PTEN, is abrogated.</p><p>Considered questions:</p><p>1) Do the experiments chosen embody the main conclusions drawn from the original article?</p><p>These experiments embody the main conclusions.
