mechanism known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, a paternally delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in multiple species. However, whether CI-induced defects in later stage embryos are a consequence of the first division errors or caused by independent defects remains unresolved. To address this question, we focused on ~1/3 of embryos from CI crosses in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> that develop apparently normally through the first and subsequent pre-blastoderm divisions before exhibiting mitotic errors during the mid-blastula transition and gastrulation. We performed single embryo PCR and whole genome sequencing to find a large percentage of these developed CI-derived embryos bypass the first division defect. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we find increased chromosome segregation errors in gastrulating CI-derived embryos that had avoided the first division defect. Thus, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in the sperm induces developmentally deferred defects that are not a consequence of the first division errors. Like the immediate defect, the delayed defect is rescued through crosses to infected females. These studies inform current models on the molecular and cellular basis of CI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Wolbachia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila simulans</italic></kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic incompatibility</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>mid-blastula transition</kwd><kwd>nuclear fallout</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS-1R35GM139595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differentiation of mitotic errors occurring during late embryonic development from the well-characterized first division defects provides new insight into the mechanisms of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are a bacterial endosymbiont present in the majority of insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weinert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Werren et al., 2008</xref>). While they reside in the germline of both sexes, they are vertically transmitted exclusively through the female germline to all the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have evolved a number of strategies that provide a selective advantage to infected females. This includes male killing, conversion of males to fertile females, induction of parthenogenesis, and most commonly cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Serbus et al., 2008</xref>). CI is a form of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced paternal effect embryonic lethality. Matings between infected males and uninfected females result in dramatic reductions in egg hatch rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoffmann et al., 1986</xref>). However, matings between infected males and infected females, known as the ‘rescue cross’, results in normal egg hatch rates. Additionally, infected females mated with uninfected males results in normal hatch rates. Thus, in a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected population, infected females have an enormous selective advantage over uninfected females as infected females produce normal hatch rates independent of the infection status of the male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turelli and Hoffmann, 1991</xref>). This phenomenon, as well as <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced male sterility, is currently being employed throughout the world as a strategy for combating pest insects and insect-borne human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiggins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Since the discovery of CI and rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghelelovitach, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yen and Barr, 1971</xref>), there have been a number of insights into their molecular and cellular bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shropshire et al., 2020</xref>). Cytological studies demonstrate failures in condensation, alignment, and segregation of the paternal chromosomes during the first zygotic division in embryos derived from the CI cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breeuwer and Werren, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reed and Werren, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryan and Saul, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tram et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tram and Sullivan, 2002</xref>). Subsequent studies demonstrated defects in the protamine-to-histone transition: deposition of the maternally supplied histone H3.3 is significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landmann et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the male, but not the female, pronucleus of CI-derived embryos exhibits delays in DNA replication, nuclear envelope breakdown, and Cdk1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tram and Sullivan, 2002</xref>). As a result, passage of the male pronucleus through mitosis is delayed relative to the female pronucleus. Molecular insight into the mechanism of CI has come from recent studies demonstrating that a pair of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes originating from integrated viral DNA, the CI factors or Cifs, is likely responsible for CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LePage et al., 2017</xref>). One of these genes, <italic>cidB</italic>, encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme and the other, <italic>cinB</italic>, a nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). When the gene pair is expressed in the male germline, paternal chromosome, and embryo abnormalities strikingly similar to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated CI are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LePage et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the well-characterized first division mitotic defects, studies in a number of species demonstrate that CI produces additional developmental defects and lethal phases later in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duron and Weill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jost, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wright and Barr, 1981</xref>). Studies in wasps in which fertilized eggs develop into diploid females and unfertilized eggs develop into haploid males, provide insight into the different developmental outcomes in CI crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tram et al., 2006</xref>). If CI disrupts but does not prevent paternal chromosome segregation, the resulting aneuploid embryos fail to develop. In contrast, if CI results in the complete failure of paternal chromosome segregation, embryos develop into haploid males bearing only the maternal chromosome complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryan and Saul, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tram et al., 2006</xref>). In diplo-diploid organisms (where haploid embryos do not develop to adulthood), complete failure of paternal chromosome segregation in the first division leads to haploid embryos that develop and then subsequently fail to hatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duron and Weill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jost, 1970</xref>). Additionally, in some organisms such as <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>, a small fraction of CI-derived embryos do not undergo any first division defect and consequently hatch as diploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In conjunction with broad developmental abnormalities, embryos developing from CI crosses also experience various cellular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>). For example, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have observed chromosome bridging in CI-derived embryos developing through the pre-blastoderm divisions (nuclear cycles 2–9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LePage et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, irregular spindles are observed in syncytial and cellularized blastoderms (nuclear cycles 10–14) from CI crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>). Other defects in developed embryos from CI crosses include displaced nuclei, clumped chromatin, and disorganized centrosomes in blastoderms and abnormally condensed nuclei in gastrulating embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>). However, due to inherent difficulties in visualizing fertilization and early embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whether the cellular defects observed in later stage embryos are the direct result of aneuploidy from first division errors or due to a poorly understood second, distinct set of CI-induced defects remained unresolved. Therefore, the extent and timing with which CI induces cellular defects throughout development is an open question.</p><p>Here, through a combination of live and fixed analysis, we directly address whether late developmental and cellular defects observed in CI-derived embryos are an outcome of the well-characterized first division errors or caused by a temporally distinct set of CI-induced cell cycle defects. Consistent with previous reports, we find that the majority of embryos derived from the CI cross arrest in the first division. However, we specifically focus our analyses on a population of about one-third of CI-derived embryos that apparently progress normally through the first zygotic and subsequent internal syncytial divisions. While these embryos undergo normal pre-blastoderm divisions, they exhibit significantly increased chromosome segregation defects during the mid-blastula transition, cellularization, and gastrulation. Sequence analysis reveals that ~40% of the CI-derived embryos that reach the blastoderm stage (&gt;nuclear cycle 10) are diploid, having undergone a normal first division to develop with both maternal and paternal chromosomes. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to specifically select these diploid CI-derived embryos, we observe increased chromosome segregation defects during gastrulation, suggesting the late embryonic defects do not strictly require significant first division defects. Crosses to infected females (the rescue cross) reduce the frequencies of the induced division errors. These results reveal that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> CI-induced defects in the sperm produce developmentally deferred chromosome segregation defects in the late blastoderm divisions. Thus, our studies suggest CI produces temporally distinct early and late chromosome segregation defects. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms and timing of CI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced CI produces late embryonic lethality in ~30% of embryos</title><p>We used a combination of fixed and live analyses to determine the timing of defects as CI-derived embryos progressed through the early blastoderm divisions, cellularization, gastrulation, and hatching.

Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoffmann et al., 1986</xref>), we observed a severe decrease in hatching for embryos derived from CI crosses (CI = 2%; <italic>N</italic> = 2397, compare to wild-type = 92%, <italic>N</italic> = 1208; rescue = 88%, <italic>N</italic> = 1281; reciprocal = 91%, <italic>N</italic> = 1299) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, B’</xref>). Thus, both CI-induced embryonic lethality and its corresponding rescue by maternally supplied <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are robust in <italic>D. simulans</italic>.

An alternative potential cause for the segregation errors characterized here is segmental aneuploidy due to an incomplete exclusion of the paternal chromosomes during the first division that does not disrupt early embryonic development. In this scenario, partial chromosome loss or chromosome fragmentation is transmitted from the first division through seemingly normal syncytial divisions and then causes the segregation errors seen in later developmental stages.</p><p>To test the possibility that fragmented paternal chromosomes are transmitted through the syncytial divisions, we sequenced the entire genome of individual cellular blastoderms and then mapped read depth to five specifically chosen coding regions at different locations for each major chromosome or chromosome arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). As above, males in the CI and rescue crosses were homozygous for the <italic>egfp</italic> transgene, allowing us to distinguish between embryos in which paternally derived chromosomes were either present or absent. For each individual embryo, we then compared read depth at each locus to the mean read depth for the embryo’s entire genome. Comparing multiple coding regions on each chromosome arm allowed us to detect large-scale changes in chromosome copy number despite inherent variation in the read depth for single genes in individual embryos. For example, we regularly detected ½ the mean genome depth for reads mapping to coding regions on the X and Y chromosomes in XY male embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). While we cannot rule out small deletions, these data suggest that neither haploid (<italic>egfp</italic>-negative) nor diploid (<italic>egfp</italic>-positive) CI-derived embryos exhibited large-scale chromosome loss consistent with the mitotic transmission of only part of the paternal genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Instead, both haploid and diploid embryos had full euploid sets of chromosomes corresponding to either 1n or 2n, respectively. This suggests that late-stage CI embryos had either (1) lost all their paternal chromosomes during the first division or (2) did not experience any significant chromosome loss during the first division at all. Thus, defects observed in late-stage CI embryos cannot be due to partial chromosome loss or fragmentation carried over from the first division.</p><p>A separate, potentially interesting, outcome of this experiment is that we found CI-derived embryos regularly had less depth of reads mapping to their entire genome than either wild-type or rescue embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was true for both haploid and diploid CI embryos. Normalizing the depth of reads aligning to the whole genome to the depth of reads aligning to the mitochondrial genome (which should be unchanged) for each embryo suggested differences in sequencing input may not fully explain the decrease in reads mapping to CI embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In diplo-diploid species, late embryonic lethality is widely believed to be due to haploid development explained by the behavior of the paternal chromosomes during the first division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duron and Weill, 2006</xref>). While weak CI results in defective paternal chromosome segregation creating aneuploid nuclei that arrest in early embryonic development, strong CI results in complete failure of sister chromosome segregation and haploid nuclei bearing only the maternal chromosome complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duron and Weill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tram et al., 2006</xref>). Haploid embryos develop normally to the cellular blastoderm stage but then fail prior to hatching.</p><p>However, whether the numerous cellular defects observed in late-developing CI-derived embryos are also the result of first division errors has not been resolved. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing the timing, extent, and causes of mitotic defects observed specifically in late <italic>D. simulans</italic> embryos derived from CI crosses that seemingly bypass the first division defects and develop normally through early embryogenesis. Collectively, our results suggest that late embryonic defects are the result of a second CI-induced affect temporally distinct from first division errors. As discussed below, this suggests CI may be produced through either (1) a common acute mechanism that acts at both early and late development time points, or (2) separate and distinct early and late mechanisms that do not depend upon one another.</p><p>In accord with previous studies in <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>), we found that there is a second late embryonic lethality associated with CI-derived embryos: between one-fourth and one-third of embryos die after cellularization but before hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, while we found embryos derived from CI crosses were relatively normal during nuclear cycles 2–9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>) observed pre-blastoderm embryos with substantial mitotic defects. In these experiments, the percentage of abnormal CI-derived embryos fixed after a 6 hr age was similar to that of CI-derived embryos fixed immediately after collection, suggesting pre-blastoderm defects manifest from first division defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>). Therefore, embryos initially undergoing extensive first division defects may develop slowly through pre-blastoderm divisions if they are aged. As we fixed embryos directly after collecting with no aging time, a possible explanation for the low percentage of abnormal pre-blastoderm embryos we observed is that there was not enough time for embryos experiencing substantial first division segregation errors to develop through the pre-blastoderm stages. Instead, our fixing mostly captured the embryos that correspond to the previously reported percentage (~44%) of the CI-derived embryos that develop normally through the pre-blastoderm stage in spite of a later lethal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>).</p><p>As the CI-derived embryos subsequently progressed through the cortical divisions (cycles 10–14), they begin to experience increasingly more severe defects. These late embryonic defects include lagging anaphase chromosomes and chromosome bridging, which directly result in nuclear fallout, and further chromosome bridging during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The normal progression of embryos through cycles 2–9 suggests paternal chromosome segregation was not partially defective in the first division. This is because paternal chromosome bridging in the first division would produce aneuploid daughter nuclei bearing chromosome fragments lacking telomeres. The lack of telomeres would result in detectable breakage–fusion–bridge cycles and amplifications of the aneuploidy in subsequent divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McClintock, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Titen and Golic, 2008</xref>), which we did not observe. Our sequencing analysis of cellularized embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) confirms that late-stage CI embryos did not experience partial chromosome loss during the first division. Thus, the mitotic defects first observed in cortical syncytial divisions are unlikely a consequence of CI-induced segmental aneuploidy following the first nuclear cycle.</p><p>Consequently, our single embryo PCR and whole genome sequencing of cellularized embryos containing a paternally derived <italic>egfp</italic> transgene revealed late-stage CI embryos were either haploid or diploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The percentage of diploid embryos closely corresponded to the percentage of embryos hatched, suggesting late embryonic lethality is associated with CI-induced haploidy in <italic>D. simulans</italic>, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>). Importantly, this experiment also demonstrated that the detection of paternally derived chromosomes in that late-stage CI embryos could be used to distinguish between embryos that had experienced first division defects (haploid = only maternal chromosomes, no paternal chromosomes) and embryos that had not experienced any first division defects (diploid = both maternal and paternal chromosomes). As discussed below, this allowed us to uncouple CI-induced late embryo defects from first division defects.</p><p>In spite of the strong association between haploidy and lethality, first division-induced haploidy in and of itself cannot explain the defects we observed in CI-derived blastoderm and gastrulating embryos. This is because (1) haploidy is not intrinsically harmful to mitotic divisions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, in some <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutations that induce haploidy, chromosome segregation occurs normally during cortical divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, meiosis II—essentially a mitotic division of a haploid nucleus—is highly accurate by necessity. Furthermore, (2) any downstream effects of haploidy—such as changes to zygotic gene copy number or loss of zygotic heterozygosity—cannot explain defects first detected in syncytial cortical divisions (cycles 10–13), which do not require zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the observed defects in CI-derived late embryos are more likely due to a second temporally deferred CI-induced defect.</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, our observation of increased chromosome segregation errors in diploid CI gastrulating embryos bearing paternally derived Y chromosomes establishes that the defects observed in late-stage CI embryos are not limited to haploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Instead, defects are present in diploid late-stage embryos. Significantly, as discussed above for the paternally derived <italic>egfp</italic> transgene, detection of the Y chromosome by FISH allowed us to select late-stage diploid embryos that had ‘escaped’ first division defects and instead continued development with both paternal and maternal chromosome complements. Therefore, the significant increase in mitotic errors observed in diploid CI-derived embryos relative to wild-type-derived embryos demonstrates the existence of a second, CI-induced defect, temporally and possibly mechanistically distinct from the first division defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Significantly, maternally supplied <italic>Wolbachia</italic> independently rescues this later second defect as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) induces independent first division and mid-blastula transition chromosome segregation errors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During the first zygotic division in wild-type derived embryos, paternal (green) and maternal (magenta) chromosomes segregate normally.

Non-Y-bearing embryos may either be diploid (XX) or haploid (XØ). If these embryos were haploid, this observation would suggest that CI could affect both the maternal chromosomes and paternal chromosomes.</p><p>One intriguing aspect of the second CI-induced defect is that the embryos progress normally through the early mitotic cycles and then begin to exhibit mitotic defects in the blastoderm stage. The explanation is likely a consequence of the dramatic structural and regulator cell cycle modifications that occur when the dividing nuclei arrive at the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell and O’Farrell, 2014</xref>). These include heterochromatin formation, initiation of late origins of replication, slowing of DNA replication, activation of zygotic transcription, and metaphase furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell and O’Farrell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seller and O’Farrell, 2018</xref>). The phenotype of numerous maternal-effect mutations that either rely on or disrupt these processes is strikingly similar to the defects observed in CI embryos: normal early pre-cortical divisions followed by extensive mitotic errors and nuclear fallout during the cortical blastoderm divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sullivan and Theurkauf, 1995</xref>). For example, because of the slowing of DNA replication during the cortical divisions, activation of the S-phase checkpoint is specifically required during this stage. Maternal-effect mutants that disrupt this checkpoint progress normally through the early divisions but exhibit anaphase bridging and nuclear fallout during the late cortical blastoderm divisions as a result of entering metaphase with incompletely replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fogarty et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogarty et al., 1994</xref>). Given the similarity of this phenotype, both in timing and chromosome dynamics, CI-induced late division defects may be due to improper or abnormally slow chromosome replication. Additionally, defects in other events specific to the cortical blastoderm cycles, may also contribute directly or indirectly to CI-induced defects. For example, studies of hybrid incompatibilities between <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> show that heterochromatin establishment may be particularly sensitive, and its disruption can result in defects strikingly similar to the late CI defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferree and Barbash, 2009</xref>). Other important processes, such as those involved in DNA integrity, protein turnover, and cell cycle timing, may be also involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Momtaz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In considering the mechanism by which paternal <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may induce these defects, the observation that CI-derived blastoderm embryos progress normally through pre-cortical divisions must be noted. One potential explanation is that the chromosomes in CI-derived embryos could be epigenetically marked by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the paternal germline.

However, DNA methylation does not appear to contribute to CI levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LePage et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An alternative explanation for the specificity of the late blastoderm defects comes from studies into hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> in which unregulated mobilization of transposable elements results in a spectrum of genetic and developmental defects in the germlines of dysgenic progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kidwell et al., 1977</xref>).

This silencing is associated with increased H3K9 methylation, increased heterochromatin levels, and altered splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teixeira et al., 2017</xref>). Given small RNAs can affect chromosomes in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hermant et al., 2015</xref>), CI may induce a similar small RNA pathway that could epigenetically alter both paternal and maternal chromosomes prior to the first division. As the blastoderm divisions do not require zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>), it is unlikely an epigenetic alteration, if occurring, would cause defects via disrupted transcription. Instead, as discussed above, an epigenetic change may disrupt key aspects of the mid-blastula transition, which in turn could result in the observed errors.</p><p>Insight into the molecular mechanism of CI came with the discovery of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-encoded Cifs that play a key role in CI and rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LePage et al., 2017</xref>). A combination of molecular, genetic, and biochemical studies provided compelling evidence that the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> encoded genes, <italic>CidB</italic> and <italic>CidA</italic>, act as a paternally supplied toxin and maternally supplied anti-toxin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, a toxin/anti-toxin model for CI does not easily explain the cortical blastoderm defects occurring after many rounds of normal mitotic cycles. This is because a paternally supplied toxin is expected to be diluted with every round of division, and therefore its induced defects would decrease over time. Similarly, a second set of CI/rescue elements, <italic>CinA</italic> and <italic>CinB</italic>, is also proposed to act in a toxin/anti-toxin manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). An alternative possibility is that Cifs may epigenetically modify paternal and maternal chromosomes to mediate CI and rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaur et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>How and if these proteins also contribute to CI-induced late-embryo defects remains to be determined. It is possible that early and late defects are caused by common acute mechanisms involving the known Cifs. This may be due to an induced chromosomal change that produces defects at different times given natural variation in developmental processes among a population of embryos. In contrast, chromosome segregation errors in diploid embryos that have progressed normally through the first division may suggest minimal Cif activity and an additional set of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes that induce late-embryo defects. Unlike the first division errors, CI-induced mitotic defects in late embryos do not appear to result from abnormal condensation, alignment, or timing of metaphase exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, the observed chromosome bridging is strikingly similar to embryos exposed to the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fasulo et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting CI-derived blastoderm embryos may be entering anaphase with incompletely replicated chromosomes. These differences could suggest a separate proximate cause for early and late defects, or provide additional insight into Cif-induced defects. Thus, any model of CI and rescue, be it toxin/anti-toxin, lock-key, titration, or timing, must account for the fact that some effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on the sperm are not realized until hours and many cell cycles later when the embryos progress through the late blastoderm divisions and the mid-blastula transition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which occurs when male insects harboring the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia fertilize eggs of uninfected females, triggering embryonic lethality. Previous work showed CI-induced defects early in embryogenesis (at first mitosis), whereas this work provides the detailed characterization of later defects including loss of nuclei (&quot;nuclear fallout&quot;), determination of haploidy versus diploidy in the bacteria-mediated lethality, and evidence that the mechanism of late embryonic defects is independent of the ones that drive early embryonic defects. The strength of evidence provided is compelling, including beautiful single embryo PCR analysis, and convincing light microscopy. This is a technically superb set of experiments. The significance of the findings is somewhat modest due to it being an incremental step forward, but it will be useful to those in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81292.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0293rh119</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0293rh119</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Oregon</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Karr</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03efmqc40</institution-id><institution>Arizona State University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.20.496611">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496611v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Chris Q Doe as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Karr (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors cite several examples from other insects showing late developmental defects in embryos derived from CI crosses (Bonneau et al., 2018; Callaini et al., 1997; Callaini et al., 1996; Duron and Weill, 2006). The authors should more clearly mention what is novel about their study compared to previous studies documenting late embryonic defects.</p><p>2. Do you think that it might be worth staining for the Wolbachia CidA/B or CinA/B proteins? Perhaps they find a way to persist until MBT and then become activated by a zygotic maternal factor? If their localization during fertilization to gastrulation is known, it would be good to assay it or at least discuss it.</p><p>3. Beginning line 14, &quot;fail to develop due to the immediate action of Wolbachia-produced factors…&quot; suggests that Wolbachia &quot;factors&quot; are in sperm, but the alternative hypothesis that Wolbachia effect host proteins during spermatogenesis that are responsible for CI cannot be strictly eliminated. Suggest re-wording.</p><p>4. Line 22- &quot;Thus, Wolbachia in the sperm…&quot; is a statement in conflict with previously published work that demonstrated the absence of Wolbachia in sperm Snook, R. R., et al., Genetics 155, 167 178 (2000). Suggest re-wording.</p><p>5. Line 38, while certainly a &quot;conditional sterility&quot; phenotype, should stress that this is also a unique &quot;paternal effect&quot;, an important distinction since there are many hundreds of gene mutations that cause male sterility that have nothing directly to do with sperm function per se.</p><p>6. In the paragraph beginning line 96, it is unclear how the authors distinguish the early and later phenotypes mechanistically, have they excluded the possibility that variation in the severity of the early defects, which may be difficult to observe much less quantify, could lead to the manifestation at later stages? The answer to this question is important in assessing the veracity of the last sentence in the paragraph that clearly states the independence of these two phases of Wolbachia-induced defects during embryonic development.</p><p>7. Having looked at many thousands of developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos over many years, it is a common (albeit infrequent) observation of mitotic defects in normal wild-type embryos. These observations and this reviewer's experience make the claim of &quot;0%&quot; suspect. Can the authors put this number in a larger perspective?</p><p>8. Section line 326, this section was a bit confusing as it relates to Figure 5E. Does the grid plot of coverage indicate just the genes that were measured and are used as representative of the entire chromosome? Can they say with certainty that all genes are present as expected for zero chromosome loss (ie, very small regions?). There appears to be some &quot;noise&quot; in the data as there is a mixture of green and black? The authors appear to allude to this in pp beginning line 352.</p><p>9. Line 395, Figure 6/Figure S4 should/could be explained a bit clearer? This very short paragraph and reference to S4 could be expanded for clarity. For example, is it the case that the 2% of the 966 eggs scored led to only ~70% that led to viable adults? Please clarify further as this result is both novel and important.</p><p>10. Line 418, there is a troubling lack of discussion about the apparent striking difference in CI phenotypes reported in comparison with those of Callaini et al. and Lassy and Karr. Both laboratories reported extensive early pre-blastoderm mitotic defects. This is dealt with in a rather cavalier manner with the sentence, &quot;In contrast with previous reports (Lassy and Karr, 1996), we found that these embryos initially proceeded normally through nuclear cycles 2-9&quot;. It is not clear why the authors did not include the Callaini 1996 paper on this topic, but this discrepancy should be addressed more thoroughly. It should also be noted that Table 1 in the Lassy and Karr paper reported the percentages of CI developmental defects up to 6 hours. They reported ~56% mitotic defects which, by subtraction gives a value for &quot;normal&quot; development at ~44% which is remarkably close to the 40% cited by the authors for embryos that reach the blastoderm stage.</p><p>11. The phrase, (line 469) &quot;completely separate from the first division defect&quot; while clearly separate in time, should be mitigated to reflect the more reasonable phrase, &quot;… more likely due to …&quot; as the authors did above (line 458). Clearly, the authors have built a very strong case for these separate phenomena, but probably best to leave out the hyperbole.</p><p>12. Revise the abstract to acknowledge the previous literature that embryos can manifest with cytological errors hours into development, including in D. simulans. The authors communicated this situation nicely in the Introduction and can adopt the clarity in the abstract that the key question they intend to address is whether or not the chromosome errors at the 1st mitosis and later (both of which are well documented already) occur due to an initial error in the parental chromatin that carries forward or to independent new types of errors after the first mitosis. This is the question they aim to speak to in the work and it can be more clearly delineated as why it's important, what methods they used, and what the basic results were. For instance, this sentence could be revised from &quot;In CI, embryos from crosses…fail to develop due to the immediate action of Wolbachia-produced factors in the first zygotic division&quot; to &quot;In CI, a paternally-delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in a variety of insect species&quot; (published references: Culex, Aedes, Dmel, Dsim, etc).</p><p>13. In the intro, delete the word &quot;sterility&quot; used only in the first paragraph to unify the terminology with embryonic lethality or post-fertilization incompatibility in the paper since many readers may assume sterility refers to a pre-fertilization error that inhibits fertilization. That is not the case here.</p><p>14. Line 113: It would help the paper and readers to change the subheader titles to emphasize the new discoveries of this study rather than what's known in previous literature. For instance, instead of stating CI produces late embryo lethality, add the new details of the percentage and type of delays seen here in the subhead.</p><p>15. Line 121-122. D. simulans is also a useful model since it was previously shown to have defects after the first mitosis. That is worth noting at this point in the manuscript as it sets the stage for your study.</p><p>16. Line 158: Cite Lassy and Karr 1996. -Lassy CW, Karr TL.

We have now rewritten this paragraph to better clarify how we differentiated early and late embryonic defects as well as reflect potential uncertainty that could be caused by difficult-to-observe/quantify variation in the severity of early defects (lines 131-145).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Having looked at many thousands of developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos over many years, it is a common (albeit infrequent) observation of mitotic defects in normal wild-type embryos. These observations and this reviewer's experience make the claim of &quot;0%&quot; suspect. Can the authors put this number in a larger perspective?</p></disp-quote><p>For the experiment referenced, we were interested in whether there were gross abnormalities that would be characteristic of large-scale CI-induced defects. As such, we scored embryos as whole units as either normal/abnormal, and thus minor defects might not be counted. This was not clear in our initial submission. We have added the following sentence to clarify:</p><p>“As we were interested in the timing with which CI induces large-scale defects throughout development, we scored embryos as whole units, which potentially excludes minor defects” (lines 240-242).</p><p>When more sensitive assays are performed (such as scoring individual nuclei or cells), mitotic defects can be observed in wild-type embryos. As the reviewer mentions, we can observe these common but infrequent defects in wild-type embryos when we perform these assays such as in scoring for nuclear fallout (Figure 3) or chromosome segregation errors (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, Figure 6). We discuss this in lines 278-280.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Section line 326, this section was a bit confusing as it relates to Figure 5E. Does the grid plot of coverage indicate just the genes that were measured and are used as representative of the entire chromosome? Can they say with certainty that all genes are present as expected for zero chromosome loss (ie, very small regions?). There appears to be some &quot;noise&quot; in the data as there is a mixture of green and black? The authors appear to allude to this in pp beginning line 352.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the grid plot indicates just the genes that were measured and are representative of the entire chromosome. We chose genes spread across the major chromosome arms where coverage was reliable based on the wild-type and rescue embryos. We agree there is noise, as we are performing single embryo sequencing, which was at the limit of technology. While we cannot rule out small deletions, we believe such small deletions cannot regularly cause the large-scale defects we observe. We have rewritten this paragraph to clarify how our analysis was performed as well as address the uncertainty of very small deletions we cannot detect due to noise (lines 416-430).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 395, Figure 6/Figure S4 should/could be explained a bit clearer? This very short paragraph and reference to S4 could be expanded for clarity. For example, is it the case that the 2% of the 966 eggs scored led to only ~70% that led to viable adults? Please clarify further as this result is both novel and important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded this paragraph (lines 497-515). In brief, we first performed hatch assays and then determined the number of hatched eggs from these assays that subsequently developed into adults. Thus, as the reviewer mentions for CI, out of 966 eggs collected, 137 hatched and from those 94 developed into adults (69% of hatched eggs). In comparison, for wild-type, out of 548 hatched eggs, 520 (95%) developed into adults. We agree this is a potentially important result suggesting CI can act a remarkably delayed time. In our revised paragraph, we more clearly state the experimental setup and results to clarify this finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 418, there is a troubling lack of discussion about the apparent striking difference in CI phenotypes reported in comparison with those of Callaini et al. and Lassy and Karr. Both laboratories reported extensive early pre-blastoderm mitotic defects. This is dealt with in a rather cavalier manner with the sentence, &quot;In contrast with previous reports (Lassy and Karr, 1996), we found that these embryos initially proceeded normally through nuclear cycles 2-9&quot;. It is not clear why the authors did not include the Callaini 1996 paper on this topic, but this discrepancy should be addressed more thoroughly. It should also be noted that Table 1 in the Lassy and Karr paper reported the percentages of CI developmental defects up to 6 hours. They reported ~56% mitotic defects which, by subtraction gives a value for &quot;normal&quot; development at ~44% which is remarkably close to the 40% cited by the authors for embryos that reach the blastoderm stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this. In our revised manuscript, we have more thoroughly discussed these differences. In the Lassy and Karr paper, the percentage of abnormal embryos fixed after a 6h aging period was similar to that of embryos fixed immediately after collection, suggesting the pre-blastoderm defects observed were likely due to first division defects. In our experiments, we fixed embryos directly after collecting with no aging time. We believe this did not allow enough time for embryos experiencing extensive first division defects to substantially develop through nuclear cycles 2-9. We believe if we were to age the embryos 2-6h after our collections we would see a similar percentage of abnormal 2-9 embryos as Lassy and Karr, since these embryos would now have time to develop past the first division defect. Therefore, as mentioned by the reviewer, the cycle 2-9 embryos we observed likely correlates to the ~44% of “normal” development embryos that the Lassy and Karr experiments observed. We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Our revisions (lines 559-572) include the addition of the Callaini reference as well as a more thorough discussion of the differences in experimental setups and potential reasons for why our results differ and are the same, as detailed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The phrase, (line 469) &quot;completely separate from the first division defect&quot; while clearly separate in time, should be mitigated to reflect the more reasonable phrase, &quot;… more likely due to …&quot; as the authors did above (line 458). Clearly, the authors have built a very strong case for these separate phenomena, but probably best to leave out the hyperbole.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this sentence to reflect the temporal distinction more clearly between the defects without hyperbole:</p><p>“The significant increase in mitotic errors observed in diploid CI-derived embryos relative to wild-type-derived embryos demonstrates the existence of a second, CI-induced defect, temporally and possibly mechanistically distinct from the first division defect” (lines 679-682).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Revise the abstract to acknowledge the previous literature that embryos can manifest with cytological errors hours into development, including in D. simulans. The authors communicated this situation nicely in the Introduction and can adopt the clarity in the abstract that the key question they intend to address is whether or not the chromosome errors at the 1st mitosis and later (both of which are well documented already) occur due to an initial error in the parental chromatin that carries forward or to independent new types of errors after the first mitosis. This is the question they aim to speak to in the work and it can be more clearly delineated as why it's important, what methods they used, and what the basic results were. For instance, this sentence could be revised from &quot;In CI, embryos from crosses…fail to develop due to the immediate action of Wolbachia-produced factors in the first zygotic division&quot; to &quot;In CI, a paternally-delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in a variety of insect species&quot; (published references: Culex, Aedes, Dmel, Dsim, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the abstract as suggested:</p><p>“<italic>Wolbachia</italic>, a vertically transmitted endosymbiont infecting many insects, spreads rapidly through uninfected populations by a mechanism known as Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI). In CI, a paternally-delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in multiple species. However, whether CI-induced defects in later stage embryos are a consequence of the first division errors or caused by independent defects remains unresolved. To address this question, we focused on ~1/3 of embryos from CI crosses in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> that develop apparently normally through the first and subsequent pre-blastoderm divisions before exhibiting mitotic errors during the mid-blastula transition and gastrulation. We performed single embryo PCR and whole genome sequencing to find a large percentage of these developed CI-derived embryos bypass the first division defect. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we find increased chromosome segregation errors in gastrulating CI-derived embryos that had avoided the first division defect. Thus, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in the sperm induces developmentally deferred defects that are not a consequence of the first division errors. Like the immediate defect, the delayed defect is rescued through crosses to infected females. These studies inform current models on the molecular and cellular basis of CI” (lines 12-27).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. In the intro, delete the word &quot;sterility&quot; used only in the first paragraph to unify the terminology with embryonic lethality or post-fertilization incompatibility in the paper since many readers may assume sterility refers to a pre-fertilization error that inhibits fertilization. That is not the case here.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have now revised this sentence:</p><p>“CI is a form of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced paternal effect embryonic lethality” (line 40).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Line 113: It would help the paper and readers to change the subheader titles to emphasize the new discoveries of this study rather than what's known in previous literature. For instance, instead of stating CI produces late embryo lethality, add the new details of the percentage and type of delays seen here in the subhead.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the subheader titles as advised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Line 121-122. D. simulans is also a useful model since it was previously shown to have defects after the first mitosis. That is worth noting at this point in the manuscript as it sets the stage for your study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
