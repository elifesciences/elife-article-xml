Studies have shown that the catalytic activities of the evolutionarily conserved Mre11-Rad50 (MR) core complex depend on an ATP-dependent global conformational change that takes the macromolecule from an open, extended structure in the absence of ATP to a closed, globular structure when ATP is bound. We have previously identified an additional ‘partially open’ conformation using luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) experiments. Here, a combination of LRET and the molecular docking program HADDOCK was used to further investigate this partially open state and identify three conformations of MR in solution: closed, partially open, and open, which are in addition to the extended, apo conformation. Mutants disrupting specific Mre11-Rad50 interactions within each conformation were used in nuclease activity assays on a variety of DNA substrates to help put the three states into a functional perspective. LRET data collected on MR bound to DNA demonstrate that the three conformations also exist when nuclease substrates are bound. These models were further supported with small-angle X-ray scattering data, which corroborate the presence of multiple states in solution. Together, the data suggest a mechanism for the nuclease activity of the MR complex along the DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>P. furiosus</italic></kwd><kwd>Mre11-Rad50</kwd><kwd>lanthanide resonance energy transfer</kwd><kwd>DNA damage repair</kwd><kwd>DNA double-strand break repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM128906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Latham</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP180553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Latham</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D-1876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Latham</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple solution-state structures are used for the DNA double-strand break repair functions of the Mre11-Rad50 protein complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) is an essential protein complex required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paull, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Syed and Tainer, 2018</xref>).

Nbs1, found only in eukaryotes, further modulates MR activity and signals downstream repair effectors to the site of the break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshpande et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oh et al., 2016</xref>). If DNA DSBs are not repaired, the cell may undergo cell death via apoptosis, or, if the break is not repaired correctly, a loss of genetic information or gross chromosomal rearrangements can occur, potentially resulting in immunodeficiencies and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oh and Symington, 2018</xref>). Many mechanistic and structural studies have been performed on the evolutionarily conserved Mre11<sub>2</sub>-Rad50<sub>2</sub> (MR) core complex from bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes and have shown that the complex undergoes a dramatic ATP-induced global conformational change that is required for its various functions. This two-state model, which originated from X-ray crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lafrance-Vanasse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lammens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Möckel et al., 2012</xref>), has MR transforming from an extended arms-open-wide conformation, where the two Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are far apart in space, to a ‘closed’ conformation that sandwiches two ATPs between the NBDs in a more compact, globular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the closed conformation, the Mre11 nuclease active sites are occluded and Rad50 can bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Möckel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rojowska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seifert et al., 2016</xref>).

A recent cryo-EM structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MR (called SbcCD) bound to a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate revealed a structure where the ADP-bound Rad50s are associated, and the Mre11 dimer has moved to one side to interact asymmetrically with the two Rad50s and the dsDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we have previously used luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) experiments to illuminate the presence of a ‘partially open’ conformation in a truncated construct of hyperthermophilic <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> MR (Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup>) in both ATP and ATP-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boswell et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a variety of functionally relevant structures of the MR complex may exist in solution. As LRET has been successfully used to characterize the interactions of NBDs in several ABC ATPase membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper and Altenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zoghbi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoghbi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zoghbi and Altenberg, 2018</xref>), we significantly extended our initial LRET studies on the Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex to further characterize this partially open conformation. Multiple LRET probes were introduced throughout the Rad50 NBD to determine a network of distances between residues across the Rad50-Rad50 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These LRET-determined distances were then used as unambiguous distance restraints in the molecular docking program HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>) to obtain models of the ATP-bound MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex. Here, we present structural models of three distinct conformations of the ATP-bound Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex: closed, partially open, and open. We also demonstrate that these three states exist regardless of nucleotide state and in the presence of model DNA substrates. LRET experiments on full-length Pf MR, where Rad50 contains the coiled-coil domains and an apical zinc hook dimerization motif, confirmed that these conformations are also observed for the complete MR complex. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt specific conformations, and the effects on Mre11 and Rad50 activities validated our models and put them into a functional context. Finally, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was also employed to confirm the presence of multiple conformations of MR<sup>NBD</sup> in solution and to assign approximate populations to each. In conclusion, we have combined orthogonal biophysical and computational methods to describe three distinct global conformations of Pf MR in solution and demonstrate that they offer valuable insight into how MR functions along the DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiple LRET probe positions provide a network of measurements</title><p>LRET experiments employ a luminescent lanthanide donor and fluorophore acceptor pair with an appropriate Förster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zoghbi and Altenberg, 2018</xref>). Due to the long lifetime of the luminescence signal, LRET has several advantages over FRET. First, the lanthanide luminescence excited state lifetime is milliseconds, whereas the fluorescent acceptor lifetime is nanoseconds. This difference allows LRET to be measured after background fluorescence has decayed, eliminating artifacts from direct acceptor excitation/emission and scattering by the sample. Second, LRET measurements are insensitive to incomplete labeling because millisecond timescale donor-sensitized acceptor signal only occurs when a donor and fluorophore are in proximity. LRET probes are introduced into a protein most easily through a thiol-maleimide reaction with a unique cysteine. For Pf Rad50<sup>NBD</sup>, where the coiled-coil domains are truncated, single cysteines were introduced into the naturally cysteine-less construct, and MR<sup>NBD</sup> activity was tested to ensure an active complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutations were made primarily in loop regions to minimize disruptions to the protein fold. In all, six separate single-cysteine mutations were made throughout Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These cysteines were subsequently labeled with thiol-reactive LRET donor or acceptor molecules. To make the MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex for LRET experiments, equimolar amounts of donor-labeled (Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate) Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> and acceptor-labeled (Bodipy FL or Cy3) Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> were mixed with twice the molar ratio of Mre11 so that 50% of the resulting M<sub>2</sub>R<sup>NBD</sup><sub>2</sub> complexes had one donor and one acceptor fluorophore (on separate Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> protomers). Not only were identical cysteines mixed within a complex (e.g., Tb<sup>3+</sup>-S13C and Bodipy-S13C), but complexes were also made where cysteine mutants were mixed with other cysteine mutants (e.g., Tb<sup>3+</sup>-S13C and Bodipy-L51C). Additional distance measurements were obtained for a given LRET pair by changing the identity of the acceptor as the Förster radius for Tb<sup>3+</sup> and Cy3 (61.2 Å) is longer than that of Tb<sup>3+</sup> and Bodipy FL (44.9 Å). Finally, donor- and acceptor-labeled cysteines within mixed pairs were swapped (e.g., Tb<sup>3+</sup>-S13C and Bodipy-L51C versus Tb<sup>3+</sup>-L51C and Bodipy-S13C) for added confidence in measurements. In total, 20 different cysteine pairs resulted in 52 unique samples that gave 54 total measured distances between the two Rad50 protomers in the MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LRET measurements reveal three distinct sets of distances</title><p>Following laser excitation of the Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate moiety and a 200 µs delay, donor-sensitized Bodipy FL or Cy3 fluorescence emission decay curves were collected for each of the MR<sup>NBD</sup> LRET samples at 5°C in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 2 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Under these conditions, Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> should be &gt;99% bound to ATP as the K<sub>D</sub> for ATP is ~3 µM and there is no measurable ATP hydrolysis in 1 hr at 50°C. Collecting LRET data at 50°C (the maximum temperature for the fluorimeter) approaches the physiological temperature range for the hyperthermophilic Pf MR (&gt;60°C) while minimizing Rad50-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. In multiexponential fits, the emission decays were best described by two or three exponentials depending on the identity of the LRET pair (see Materials and methods). In all cases, the first lifetime (&lt;100 µs) is a function of instrument response time and was discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper and Altenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zoghbi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoghbi et al., 2012</xref>). The Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate luminescence decays were also recorded at each probe position in donor-only-labeled MR<sup>NBD</sup> complexes. As expected, the value of the Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate lifetime changed with the local environment of each cysteine. Using these Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate donor lifetimes, combined with the donor-sensitized acceptor lifetimes and the R<sub>0</sub> of the dye pair in the sample, distances were calculated between probes for each LRET pair.</p><p>For the majority of the 20 cysteine pairs analyzed, combining the data for the Bodipy/Tb<sup>3+</sup>- and Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup>-labeled samples gave three distinct distances. For 10 of the pairs (e.g., L51C-L51C), the longer distance (d2<sup>Bodipy</sup>) in the Bodipy/Tb<sup>3+</sup> samples matched the shorter distance (d1<sup>Cy3</sup>) in the Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup> samples, and the Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup> samples gave a second, longer distance (d2<sup>Cy3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This longer distance became ‘visible’ in samples where Cy3 was the acceptor because the R<sub>0</sub> for Tb<sup>3+</sup> and Cy3 is longer. For four of the pairs (e.g., L51C-A66C), the one Bodipy/Tb<sup>3+</sup> distance did not overlap with the two Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup>-determined distances, and the combined data resulted in three distances. For two pairs (A66C-A66C and S93C-S93C), only one distance was seen in the Bodipy/Tb<sup>3+</sup> data, while the Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup> data contained two distances. In these samples, the d<sup>Bodipy</sup> matched d1<sup>Cy3</sup> for a total of two distances. And finally, for four pairs (e.g., S13C-S93C) only Cy3/Tb<sup>3+</sup> samples were made, resulting in two distances. Together, these data illuminate the presence of a third solution state in addition to the closed and partially open conformations.</p><p>To confirm that the distances observed in MR<sup>NBD</sup> were the same in full-length MR, all of the cysteine mutations were also introduced into full-length Pf Rad50, which contains the long coiled-coil domains and apical zinc hook motif. We previously reported that the two native cysteines in the zinc hook motif of full-length Rad50 are not efficiently labeled by the LRET probes and do not result in LRET donor-sensitized acceptor signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boswell et al., 2020</xref>). Tb<sup>3+</sup>-chelate donor-only lifetimes measured in these mutants were identical to those measured for the Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> construct, indicating that the local environments of the introduced cysteines do not change between full-length and NBD constructs. Unfortunately, because full-length Rad50 dimerizes at the zinc hook, cysteine mutants could not be mixed and only ‘identity’ LRET pairs (e.g., Bodipy-L51C and Tb<sup>3+</sup>-L51C) could be made. Nonetheless, for all LRET probe positions measured, the distances between full-length MR cysteine pairs were within a few Ångströms of those measured in MR<sup>NBD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HADDOCK models of three MR<sup>NBD</sup> conformations</title><p>The measured LRET distances were input as unambiguous restraints in the HADDOCK molecular docking program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>), defining the Cβ-Cβ distance between the LRET-labeled residues. The unambiguous restraints included symmetrical distances for each LRET pair (e.g., both Rad50a protomer L51 to Rad50b protomer S13 and Rad50a S13 to Rad50b L51). Given the relatively large size and unknown orientation of the fluorophores and their linkers with respect to the protein, ±5 or ±7 Å bounds (for distances less than and greater than 75 Å, respectively) were used for the unambiguous LRET distance restraints in HADDOCK. These unambiguous restraints were used to dock two Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> protomers with one Mre11 dimer in a three-body docking simulation.</p><p>The ‘closed’ HADDOCK model fit very closely to the measured LRET distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). HADDOCK returned 190 structures in five clusters, with 164 in the top-scored cluster. The Rad50 dimer formed in this model is nearly identical to the AMPPNP-bound dimer structure of Pf Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> (PDB: 3QKU, all-atom root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 1.11 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Except in two cases, the Cβ-Cβ distances between the Rad50 LRET pairs in the HADDOCK model were within ±5 Å of their respective unambiguous LRET restraint. LRET pairs A66-A66 and A66-S93 deviated more significantly with differences of 6.6 and 11.0 Å, respectively. This deviation could arise from slight differences in the loop structures between the solution (LRET) and crystal states (i.e., input PDB; note that HADDOCK does not move backbone atom positions during model refinement). Specifically, we observed the expected relative positions within the associated Rad50s for residues in the Walker A motif (N32) of one protomer and the D-loop (D829) and signature motif (S793) of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). In this closed model, Rad50 interacts with Mre11 via the capping domain and along the top of the nuclease domain as observed in the <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (PDB: 3THO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Möckel et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (PDB: 3AV0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>E. coli</italic> (PDB: 6S6V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>) nucleotide-bound structures (with Cα RMSDs of 4.9 Å, 1.9 Å, and 4.7 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Like the <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> structure, each Rad50 protomer makes contact with only one of the Mre11 capping domains mainly through interactions between capping domain β18 and Rad50 Lobe II αE and β8–10. In total<italic>,</italic> eight and four ionic or hydrogen bond interactions are made between Rad50 and the Mre11 capping and nuclease domains, respectively. In particular, unique contacts not seen in the other two conformations are made between Rad50 E831 and Mre11 H17 in the nuclease domain and Rad50 E758/E761 and Mre11 Y325/K327 in the capping domain. The combination of these interactions occludes the Mre11 nuclease active site for dsDNA, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Möckel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup> ATP-bound complex has at least three conformations in solution.</title><p>HADDOCK structural models of the (<bold>A</bold>) closed, (<bold>B</bold>) partially open, and (<bold>C</bold>) open MR<sup>NBD</sup> complex.

Interestingly, all of the pairs with larger (&gt;5.7 Å) deviations included either A66 or S93, again suggesting that the position of those loops differs between the crystal and solution conditions. In the partially open model, only 4.2 Å separates the Rad50 protomers at their closest point between the two D829 residues (Cα-Cα distance). In this conformer, the Walker A/D-loop interactions are no longer formed between the Rad50 protomers as the Walker A motifs have rotated out of the Rad50-Rad50 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Instead, the D-loop and signature motifs face one another and are stacked in the interface. Although there are still significant interactions between the Rad50 protomers and the Mre11 capping and nuclease domains, several of which are maintained from the closed conformation, the partially open conformation has rotated by 22° to interact differently with the capping domain compared to the closed structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Specifically, interactions with the W308-D313 loop in the Mre11 capping domain are similar between the two conformations, but the Rad50 interactions with β18 have been broken in partially open, and Rad50 is now interacting with Mre11 β16 and β17 residues instead. Moreover, the movement of Rad50 has allowed the Mre11 capping domains to rotate inward toward the nuclease domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We observe a total of nine ionic or hydrogen bond interactions between the Mre11 capping domain and Rad50 and five between the nuclease domain and Rad50. In the capping domain, unique interactions occur between Mre11 K277 and Rad50 E750 and Mre11 R303 and Rad50 E754. Even with these contacts between Rad50 and Mre11, DNA could access the nuclease active site of Mre11.</p><p>Finally, HADDOCK returned 14 clusters of models for the ‘open’ complex, and analysis of the top four clusters showed that the distances between LRET pairs for each cluster had an average standard deviation of ~0.7 Å among the top three clusters and ~1.2 Å when adding the fourth. 10 out of 14 of the Cβ-Cβ distances in the top cluster are within ±5.3 Å of the input LRET unambiguous restraints, whereas the remaining 4 are within ±9.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The Rad50 protomers have moved apart considerably (~41 Å D829-D829 Cα-Cα distance). Moreover, the orientation of the Rad50 protomers with respect to Mre11 has changed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) having rotated 13° and the base of the coiled-coil translated ~23 Å away from the partially open model. Because of this rotation and translation, there are minimal contacts (only two) with the Mre11 capping domain, which now occur between Rad50 β10 and Mre11 β16 and the C-terminus of this construct. Now, six ionic interactions are formed between the Mre11 nuclease domain and Rad50. Within the nuclease domain, unique interactions occur between Mre11 R177 and E181 on helix αE with Rad50 E841 and R842 and between Mre11 E152 on helix αD and Rad50 K860. In the capping domain, Mre11 K279 makes a unique interaction with Rad50 E783. With Rad50 rotated fully away, the capping domains move even closer to the nuclease domain and both Mre11 nuclease active sites are now fully accessible to dsDNA for exonuclease activity.</p><p>To ensure that the unambiguous distance restraints obtained from one probe position were not dominating the structure calculations, HADDOCK runs were performed with systematic dropouts of all restraints calculated from a specific cysteine position. For example, for the L51C probe position, L51C-S13C, L51C-L51C, L51C-A66C, L51C-S93C, L51C-N774C, and L51C-V866C distances were all removed from the unambiguous restraints, and HADDOCK runs were repeated for each of the three sets of distances (closed, partially open, and open). In general, none of the dropouts appreciably changed the overall conformation of any of the states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Destabilizing solution-state conformers alters MR activity</title><p>Next, to decrease the stability of one or two conformations over the others, charge reversal mutations were made to several Mre11 residues that directly interact with Rad50. As there are a handful of shared interactions between Mre11 and Rad50 in the various conformation combinations, it was impossible to completely disrupt a given state. The Mre11 mutants were combined with full-length Rad50 to make MR complex, and then both Mre11 nuclease activity and Rad50 ATP hydrolysis activity were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). For Mre11 nuclease activity, three sets of fluorescence-based experiments were performed in 384-well plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). The Exo2 assay interrogates the 3′-to-5′ Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exonuclease activity as only 2 base-pairs need to be excised before the fluorescent 2-aminopurine nucleotide is released from the 3′-end of the double-stranded duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The Exo11 signal results from a combination of exonuclease and endonuclease activity as the fluorescent nucleotide is 11 base-pairs from the 3′ end of the dsDNA and requires either sequential nuclease functions (e.g., endonuclease followed by exonuclease) or processive exonuclease activity to free it from the duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA assay monitors endonuclease activity since the ssDNA needs to be cleaved to separate the quencher from the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition to these plate-based fluorescent assays, the cleavage of four different DNA substrates was monitored on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels: a 40-nucleotide ssDNA, a 40-nucleotide dsDNA, a 36-nucleotide hairpin DNA construct that includes a 2-nucleotide 3′-overhang, and a 50-nucleotide dsDNA with five phosphorothioate bonds that block 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activity at the 3′ end of the labeled strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). MR complexes made with Pf Mre11 H52S (exonuclease inactive) and H85S (exo- and endonuclease inactive) mutants were used as controls in all of these assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hopfner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). In total, when the results of these various experiments were compared, we found that the Exo2 data mirrored the results of the 40-mer dsDNA cleavage in the gels in the absence of ATP – the 3′ nucleotide of the dsDNA was removed, but no further cleavage products were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The Exo11 results, on the other hand, very closely resembled those of the dsDNA 40-mer and hairpin DNA gels in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B C</xref>). Interestingly, the cleavage pattern of the blunt-ended dsDNA, but not the hairpin with the 3′ overhang, showed intense bands where the 3′ nucleotide had been cleaved off, and both of these substrates had a ‘ladder’ of cleavage products. Thus, it appears that the 3′-overhang of the hairpin dsDNA either precludes the 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activity of the complex or MR exonuclease activity occurs at the fifth nucleotide from the end. Unexpectedly, whereas the nuclease-inactive H85S showed no activity on any of the four gel-based DNA substrates, the previously described exonuclease-impaired H52S did show activity on all of these substrates. Note, to the best of our knowledge, that there are no reports in the literature of the nuclease activity of H52S on any substrate other than the Exo2 in the absence of ATP; therefore, the cleavage products observed with that mutant were surprising and perhaps further demonstrate the importance of endonuclease activity in Pf MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA results were nearly identical to the results for the cleavage of the 40-nucleotide ssDNA in the gel as well as to the 3′-end phosphorothioate-blocked dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D E</xref>). Although both of these were worse substrates for MR as compared to the 40-mer dsDNA and the hairpin, they were both cleaved in the absence of ATP. Below, to describe the effects that each destabilizing Mre11 mutant has on MR nuclease activity, we used the results of the quantitative Exo2, Exo11, and Cy3/BHQ2 fluorescence plate assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Partially open and open conformations of the MR complex are important for nuclease activities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mre11 (left) and Rad50 (right) dimers showing residues involved in protein-protein interactions only in closed (red), only in partially open (green), and only in open (blue) conformations or common to closed and partially open (orange) or common to all three (purple).

MR H17E had ~30% of wild-type exonuclease activity on Exo2 DNA but does not cleave Exo11 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2008</xref> identified H17 as a ‘wedge residue’ that helps to unwind the dsDNA helix. H17E is, however, a competent ssDNA endonuclease, showing nearly twice the activity of WT MR on the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA substrate in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This result is consistent with previous reports that dsDNA and ssDNA substrates use different binding sites on Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rahman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). When ATP is added, the ssDNA endonuclease activity of MR H17E decreases to WT levels. Although MR H17E cannot cleave dsDNA, it showed robust activity when the 3′-end of the DNA duplex is blocked with phosphorothioate bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, the banding pattern of the 3′-phosphorothioate-blocked substrate was different for MR H17E when compared to wild-type or the other mutants. Therefore, we suggest that the cleavage products observed on this modified dsDNA for the H17E mutant were all from endonuclease activity, whereas the products of the other MR complexes originate from a combination of endo- and exonuclease activities. Finally, MR H17E decreased the V<sub>max</sub> of ATP hydrolysis to ~60% of wild-type MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), confirming that this residue assists in destabilizing the closed conformation from which hydrolysis proceeds.</p><p>Mre11 Y325 and K327 are located in the capping domain on β18 and interact with E761 and E758 of Rad50, respectively, in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the presence of ATP, the Y325A/K327E double mutant had ~85% of the exonuclease activity of wild-type MR, but only ~50% of the activity for the Exo2 substrate without ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). MR Y325A/K327E had an approximately twofold decrease in endonuclease activity on the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, MR Y325A/K327E decreased the V<sub>max</sub> of ATP hydrolysis to the same level as MR H17E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, like MR H17E, destabilizing the closed conformation through the Mre11 Y325A/K327E mutant had the predictable effect of decreasing Rad50 ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>Mre11 D313 contacts Rad50 K785 in both the closed and partially open conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A B</xref>). D313 and its neighboring residues in a loop at the top of the capping domain might be acting as a pivot point for Rad50 to rotate between the two states. Surprisingly, MR D313K had significantly increased nuclease activity on all of the substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, D313K showed shorter cleavage products, indicating more nuclease cleavage, in the gel-based assays when compared to wild-type or the other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). An approximately twofold increase in activity was observed for Exo2 in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); thus, we hypothesize that destabilizing both the closed and partially open conformations increases the population of the open conformation that accommodates dsDNA substrate. Activity against the Exo11 substrate increased ~2.5-fold in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA results showed an ~1.3- and 3-fold increase in cleavage over WT in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast to its high levels of nuclease activity, MR D313K reduced the V<sub>max</sub> for ATP hydrolysis by more than 50%, which was expected since the closed state is destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, Mre11 nuclease and Rad50 ATPase results for the D313K mutant demonstrate that the ATP hydrolysis function is not directly correlated with nuclease activity.</p><p>In the partially open complex, Mre11 K277 in β16 interacts with Rad50 E750, which is in αE at the base of a coiled-coil, whereas in the open complex, Mre11 K279 also in β16 interacts with Rad50 E783 in the short loop between β9 and β10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B C</xref>). As these two residues are close in sequence space, a double mutant was constructed to destabilize both partially open and open conformations. The most striking feature of MR K277E/K279E was that it had no nuclease activity on Exo2 without ATP but increased to ~50% of wild-type levels when ATP was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). No other mutant tested required ATP for the Exo2 substrate, implying that it requires hydrolysis to open the complex before dsDNA can bind. Moreover, this mutant displayed the lowest activity in the presence of AMPPNP, suggesting that the combination of the mutations and non-hydrolyzable analog effectively stabilized the closed state, fully occluding the dsDNA substrate. On the Exo11 substrate, the activity was also ~50% of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA, the endonuclease activity decreased to ~20% of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In fact, MR K277E/K279E had the worst endonuclease activity of all of the mutants tested, except for the nuclease-deficient H85S, suggesting that the closed state is not productive for endonuclease activity. This double mutant has no effect on ATP hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) since the closed conformation can readily form.</p><p>Finally, mutants were made for Mre11 R177, E181, and E152, which all make unique contacts in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These residues are along the ‘top edge’ of the Mre11 nuclease domain in αD and αE, and R177/E181 and E152 are structurally homologous to part of the so-called ‘latching loop’ and ‘fastener,’ respectively, of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SbcCD cryo-EM ‘cutting state’ structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>). The MR R177E/E181R double mutant had ~60% of wild-type nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) and 60% (no ATP) to 80% (with ATP) Cy3/BHQ2 ssDNA endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but wild-type ATP hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is consistent with there being less open and more closed conformation. On the other hand, MR E152K, which interacts with Rad50 K860 in αE, showed more impaired nuclease activity than R177/E181, but nearly WT endonuclease activity, and, surprisingly, decreased the V<sub>max</sub> for ATP hydrolysis by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As this mutant should readily form the closed conformation, this result was unexpected and, like D313K, demonstrates the independence of nuclease activity on ATP hydrolysis. Similar to the K227E/K279E mutant, both MR R177E/E181R and MR E152K had very little Exo2 activity in the presence of AMPPNP, again suggesting a complete stabilization of the closed conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Multiple conformations of MR persist for various substrate-bound states</title><p>The LRET distances used for the HADDOCK structural model calculations above were determined under saturating ATP conditions.

As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, three distances were observed for each LRET pair in the absence of nucleotide (‘apo’), and these distances did not differ substantially from the distances observed under saturating ATP conditions. Although the ‘open’ distances all increased, most were within the error of the distance observed with ATP and all were within the ±7 Å of the HADDOCK inputs. When the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS was added, three distances were again observed for each LRET pair, these distances did not vary more than 3 Å from the distances recorded in the ATP samples, and nearly all the distances were within the error of the measurement made with ATP. Thus, any changes in MR structure due to binding or hydrolyzing ATP are limited to local conformations invisible to LRET as we have employed it. Additionally, the LRET data on the ATPγS-bound MR demonstrate that the partially open state is a stable conformation of the MR complex and does not appear to be an intermediate in the Rad50 ATP hydrolysis catalytic cycle.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple conformations of the MR complex in various nucleotide- and DNA-bound states.</title><p>Table of the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET)-determined distances (in Å) for a subset of LRET pairs in MR<sup>NBD</sup> (left column) or full-length MR (right column) determined in the absence of nucleotide (apo), ATP-bound, ATPγS-bound, ATP- and hairpin DNA-bound, and ATP- and ssDNA-bound.

substrates affected any of the MR conformations, either a hairpin DNA, with 15 base-pairs and a 2-nucleotide 3′-end overhang, or a 36-nucleotide ssDNA were added to the LRET samples containing 2 mM ATP. The only consistent difference in LRET distances was observed in the ssDNA samples: the open distances were shorter than what was noted in all other conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the two Rad50s in the complex may be slightly closer together. None of the changes in LRET distances in the apo, ATPγS, or DNA-bound samples were large enough to necessitate recalculating HADDOCK. Note that our LRET measurements would not be able to detect if the Rad50 protomers were moving relative to the Mre11 dimer, as observed by cryo-EM in the <italic>E. coli</italic> SbcCD (MR homolog) ‘cutting’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>), or if the Mre11 protomers were moving relative to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saathoff et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, it is likely impossible to measure LRET between Mre11 and Rad50 within an MR complex because of cross-talk between the different protomers (i.e., Rad50a to Mre11a, Rad50b to Mre11b, Rad50a to Mre11b, and Rad50b to Mre11a) within the three states.</p><p>The different nucleotide-bound states and DNA substrates are most likely altering the population distribution of the various conformations of the MR complex. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to assign relative populations to these structures as we may not have a complete inventory of states, we do not know to what extent other structures (e.g., extended or ‘cutting’ state) are populated, and each LRET decay curve only provides population information for the one or two conformations that are described by the data fitting.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SAXS corroborates HADDOCK MR<sup>NBD</sup> models</title><p>To further validate the multiple conformations indicated by the LRET data, SAXS data was collected for samples of MR<sup>NBD</sup> with and without ATP.

The ATP-bound MR<sup>NBD</sup> experimental SAXS profile fit best to the partially open model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.34) followed by the closed model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.51), based on the single-state χ<sup>2</sup> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The open model did not fit well to the experimental SAXS data (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.6). Conversely, for the ATP-free MR<sup>NBD</sup> SAXS profile, a reasonable fit was only obtained with the open model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.26), although a discrepancy between the experimental and back-calculated scattering data was observed for scattering angles of ~0.1–0.2 Å<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left). Next, <italic>MultiFoXS</italic> was used to fit the apo and ATP-bound MR<sup>NBD</sup> SAXS profiles to either two or three of the LRET-derived models simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right, and B). The fit of the ATP-bound SAXS profile to two models improved the χ<sup>2</sup> significantly and combined populations of open (19%) and closed (81%) conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The fit using all three models did not improve the χ<sup>2</sup> but did assign populations of 15% open, 18% partially open, and 67% closed. The two-state fit to the apo MR<sup>NBD</sup> SAXS profile only slightly improved the χ<sup>2</sup> (1.26 vs. 1.05) and gave 90% open and 10% closed, while the three-state fit gave 89% open, 5% partially open, and 6% closed again without improving χ<sup>2</sup> further. Here, minor improvements in the fit were observed in the 0.1–0.2 Å<sup>–1</sup> range; however, the quality was still not as good as the multistate fits to the ATP-bound SAXS data, implying that an additional, unobserved state might be populated in apo MR<sup>NBD</sup>. Thus, the SAXS data generally support the presence of multiple states as observed in LRET data and demonstrate the expected shift in population to the closed form in the presence of ATP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>All three MR conformations play a role in the function of the complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The left panel shows experimental small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for apo (gray) and ATP-bound (black) MR<sup>NBD</sup> superimposed with <italic>FoXS</italic>-calculated theoretical SAXS curves for the closed (orange), partially open (red), and open (blue) HADDOCK models.

Nevertheless, the ATP-bound closed form has been referred to as the ‘resting’ state given the cellular concentration of ATP and the K<sub>D</sub> for ATP-binding to Rad50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>). Even so, both closed and partially open conformations were also identified in apo MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boswell et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, the existing structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) and the LRET-derived HADDOCK models presented here provide evidence for at least three conformations for Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup> in solution: closed, partially open, and open. Our data demonstrate that the MR complex samples these global conformations in both the ATP-free and ATP-bound forms with nucleotide binding shifting their relative populations. It is possible that the partially open state is a ‘transient’ intermediate on the pathway between the closed and open or extended structures. However, LRET data collected in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS also revealed the presence of the partially open state. Additionally, the LRET-derived distances used to define the partially open state were calculated from fluorescence lifetimes of ~0.5 ms. Thus, the partially open state must be populated for at least 5 ms to be observed by LRET, offering a lower limit for the lifetime of the partially open state.</p><p>As LRET is a distance-dependent phenomenon and distances could not be measured for probes more than ~85 Å apart, we did not obtain data for the extended conformation. Likewise, there was no evidence of MR complexes containing dissociated Mre11 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Käshammer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saathoff et al., 2018</xref>) since the LRET probes on the Rad50 NBDs would also be too far apart in that scenario. Interestingly, this is not the first time that conformations with these names have been suggested for MR. Tainer and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) found that a combination of molecular dynamics (MD)-simulated conformational models best described their ATP-free and ATP-bound Pf MR<sup>NBD</sup> SAXS curves. Although those MD models do not resemble the models presented here, they nevertheless opened the door for conformational heterogeneity in MR, a possibility also proposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lafrance-Vanasse et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our characterization of Mre11-Rad50 interaction mutants in full-length MR complexes, along with the 41 Å separation between Rad50 monomers, suggests that only the open conformation can accommodate dsDNA in a productive orientation. When the stability of both the open and partially open conformations is compromised (K277E/K279E), MR cannot cleave the Exo2 substrate without ATP, which once hydrolyzed likely results in destabilization of the closed conformation for enough time to allow DNA to bind. Likewise, this mutant had the worst endonuclease activity, suggesting that the partially open conformation also plays a role in endonuclease function. The R177E/E181R mutant only disrupts the open conformation, but unlike K277E/K279E, there is some residual Exo2 activity without ATP. Perhaps this is because the partially open conformation can form and occasionally flexes open enough for dsDNA to bind. This mutant shows reasonable endonuclease activity, though, suggesting that the partially open conformation does allow room for ssDNA. E152K, which also only disrupts the open, has WT-like endonuclease activity providing further evidence for a role of the partially open state in endonuclease activity. Notably, neither MR K227E/K279E nor MR R177E/E181R that should form more of the closed conformation increases ATP hydrolysis; however, this is expected since that reaction is highly regulated by allostery within Rad50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boswell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, D313K, which destabilizes both the closed and partially open conformations to form the open conformation that binds dsDNA, has the highest levels of nuclease activity and cleaves the Exo2 substrate readily without ATP. Additionally, this mutant is able to create the shortest cleavage products from the substrate DNA even though it has significantly decreased ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that although hydrolysis is required to release the closed state and redistribute the population of the conformations, it may not be specifically required for nuclease activity. This hypothesis is further supported when looking at all of the Exo2 reactions without ATP (i.e., Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>): with the exception of the mutant that has a stabilized closed form (K277E/K279E), all of the MR complexes can cleave DNA. Furthermore, the D313K mutant is in a loop that may act as a pivot between the closed and partially open conformations. By hampering the ability of MR to pivot here, there may be more interconversion between partially open and open conformations, which, we hypothesize, drives MR DNA cleavage, be it sequential endo- and exonuclease action or processive exonuclease activity, along the length of the DNA.</p><p>In order for the Mre11 dimer to accommodate the Rad50 dimer in the closed conformation, the capping domain has flexed outward ~5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>) from its position in the partially open and open conformations. Additional capping domain motions are also observed when transitioning between partially open and open conformers. This movement within the capping domain is reminiscent of motions previously observed in structures of the Pf Mre11 dimer bound to DNA substrates that mimicked either a DNA DSB or a stalled replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, our MR models further confirm that motions within the Mre11 capping domain coupled with the H17 wedge residue are important in DNA unwinding and nuclease activity.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest a model for MR activity where the ATP-bound closed, partially open, and open conformations exist in equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Initial recognition of the DNA DSB occurs with the open state, where at least the first two nucleotides can be excised. Resection proceeds as MR cycles between the open and partially open conformations. Since the D313K mutant can perform extensive nuclease activity with very low ATP hydrolysis activity, we suggest that the closed form may not be necessary for exonuclease function per se. Instead, the closed form could serve to reset the equilibrium of the three states once bound ATP is hydrolyzed and products are released. If the free energy for the conformational changes between the partially open and open states is not driven by Rad50 ATP binding and hydrolysis, where else could it come? Richardson and coworkers measured the release of –5.3 kcal/mol (–22.17 kJ/mol) of free energy for the hydrolysis of a DNA phosphodiester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the free energy released from the Mre11 nuclease activity could be the driving force for the conformational changes proposed here. Importantly, the closed conformation must form in order for MR to be functional as it is required for downstream signaling through ATM. Our model is supported by several recently reported cancer-associated MR DNA DSB separation-of-function mutants that maintain Mre11 nuclease function while losing the ability to signal the presence of the DNA DSB through ATM or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ahmadie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chansel-Da Cruz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hohl et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the conformational heterogeneity we describe here has important functional consequences for DNA DSB repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, protein expression, and purification</title><p>Plasmids for <italic>P. furiosus</italic> full-length Rad50, Rad50 NBD (Rad50<sup>NBD</sup>: aa1-195; GGAGGAGG linker; aa709-882), and Mre11 protein expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boswell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boswell et al., 2018</xref>).

BIOMOL Green signal (A<sub>640</sub>) was corrected by subtracting the A<sub>640</sub> values of the ATP-only reactions at each ATP concentration and then transformed into pmols of PO<sub>4</sub> released/min based on a PO<sub>4</sub> standard curve incubated in BIOMOL Green reagent for 30 min at room temperature. Plots of PO<sub>4</sub> released/min (v<sub>0</sub>) versus ATP concentration were fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation including a Hill coefficient (n).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>384-Well plate nuclease assays</title><p>Nuclease activity was assayed by monitoring the fluorescence of a 2-aminopurine (2-AP) nucleotide incorporated into a dsDNA substrate. 2-AP fluorescence is quenched within the base-pair, and release of the 2-AP from the duplex by Mre11 nuclease activity results in an increase in the 2-AP fluorescence signal.

The reaction was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1.5–2 hr. Labeling of full-length Rad50 cysteine mutants followed the same protocol, except the donor and one acceptor label were added simultaneously to each reaction (twofold molar ratio of each). Unreacted label was removed by running the labeling reaction over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7. Eluted protein was concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (VivaSpin, Sartorius) and then assessed for successful labeling by measuring fluorescence using the following settings and the monochromator in the BioTek Synergy Neo2 plate reader: ex337/em490 for DPTA-Tb<sup>3+</sup>, ex485/em515 for Bodipy FL, and ex535/em570 for Cy3.

Full-length MR LRET mixtures were 1 µM Mre11 + 1 µM dual-labeled (donor + acceptor) Rad50. Each LRET sample was subsequently diluted to 160 µL (0.25 µM complex) with LRET buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7). Next, for samples containing nucleotide, 2 mM of either ATP or ATPγS was added and the samples were heated again for 20 min at 50°C. Finally, for samples containing DNA, either 34 µM hairpin DNA (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">CACGCACGTAGAAGCTTTTGCTTCTACGTGCGTGAC</named-content>-3′) or 16.6 µM ssDNA (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGTAGTGCATTGCGTTTTTGCTTCTACGTGCGTGAC</named-content>-3') was added to ATP-bound LRET samples and heated once more for 15 min at 50°C. These concentrations of DNA should give &gt;95% bound complex in LRET conditions at 50°C. 150 µL were transferred into a 3 mm pathlength cuvette, and LRET data were collected after a final 5 min incubation in the fluorimeter at 50°C. Donor and acceptor lifetimes were calculated from intensity decays measured with an Optical Building Blocks phosphorescence lifetime photometer (EasyLife L). LRET samples were excited through a narrow band 335 nm filter (Semrock FF01-335/7) and after a 200 µs delay (to allow the decay of sample autofluorescence, emission due to direct excitation of the acceptor, and scattering of the excitation pulse), donor emission intensity was collected for Tb<sup>3+</sup> at 50 Hz through a 490/10 nm band-pass filter (Omega Optical), and donor-sensitized acceptor emission intensities were collected at 100 Hz through 520/10 nm (Bodipy FL) or 570/10 nm (Cy3) band-pass filters. PTI FeliX32 software was used to fit the Bodipy FL and Cy3 emission decay curves to either a two- or three-exponential function depending on the identity of the LRET pair. For samples where the distance between the LRET pair in the nucleotide-bound crystal structure was ≤42 Å, the data fit well to three exponentials for both Bodipy- and Cy3-labeled samples. For samples where the LRET pair was separated by more than 45 Å, the Bodipy emission decays fit to only two exponentials while the Cy3 decays fit to three. Lifetime distributions shorter than ~100 µs were discarded as these are largely a function of the instrument response time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper and Altenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zoghbi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zoghbi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zoghbi and Altenberg, 2018</xref>).

Except for increasing the number of structures for rigid body docking (it0) to 3000, all settings used were default. The three linkers attaching the Pf Mre11 capping domain to the nuclease domain were allowed to be fully flexible (Y222-V236, Y249-G254, and V266-F273). To allow HADDOCK to move the two Rad50 monomers relative to each other, we input Rad50 as two identical monomers.

The same set of active and passive AIRs were used in all of the HADDOCK runs with 50% random exclusion of AIRs in each structure calculation. The measured LRET distances were input as unambiguous restraints and defined as the Cβ-Cβ distance between the LRET-labeled residues, ± 5 Å. For distance restraints greater than 75 Å, the bounds were increased to ±7 Å as the lifetime fits giving these distances were in a more error-prone region (i.e., the flat section) of the Tb<sup>3+</sup>-Cy3 LRET efficiency curve. The model with the lowest HADDOCK score in each run was considered as the best structure. To ensure that the unambiguous distance restraints obtained from one probe position were not dominating the structure calculations, HADDOCK runs were performed with systematic dropouts of all restraints calculated from a specific cysteine position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Advances in the understanding of how structural states of Mre11-Rad50 complex are linked to DNA end detection and DNA processing, as addressed in this study, are of central importance to research on genome stability and DNA repair, with implications in human disease such as cancer and immune disorders. Enzymatically, RAD50 is an ATPase and MRE11 is a nuclease with both exo- and endonuclease activities. How all these functions are catalyzed by the complex remains unresolved. Through the combination of biophysical analyses and biochemical activity assays, this study identifies three conformations of ATP-bound <italic>P. furiosus</italic> Mre11-Rad50 complex – open, partially open, and closed – and links these activities to the Mre11-Rad50 function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69579.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Spies</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Iowa</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.04.455035">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455035v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

It would be good to repeat these experiments with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, and in the absence of nucleotide.

Include DNA in the structural studies to determine whether the observed states, and in particular the new state, is relevant to the complex &quot;in action&quot; bound to DNA where quite different conformations might occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion. We have now collected LRET data on ATP-bound MR<sup>NBD</sup> in the presence of a hairpin dsDNA or a ssDNA as substrates. Overall, the same three conformations were observed with both substrates. No significant differences in distances between the Rad50 protomers were observed in the presence of the hairpin dsDNA. However, the ssDNA appeared to have a slightly narrower open conformation (i.e., shorter distances between Rad50 protomers) in each of the LRET pairs tested. This observation was true for MR<sup>NBD</sup> and full-length MR complexes. The differences observed, however, were too small to necessitate re-running the HADDOCK simulations as nearly all of them were within the ±7 Å bounds set on the ‘open’ restraints. This new data is presented in a new figure (Figure 4) and in a new sub-section within the Results section (Multiple conformations of MR persist for various substrate-bound states; pgs. 14-16) of the modified manuscript. We also added a linearized plasmid dsDNA and did not observe any effects in either MR<sup>NBD</sup> or full-length MR constructs (data not shown).</p><p>As we note on pg. 15 of the revised manuscript, the result that DNA substrates do not change the observed conformations of Rad50 protomers within the MR complex is not surprising and does not preclude the existence of the recently proposed “cutting” state observed by cryo-EM on <italic>E. coli</italic> SbcCD. We cannot say anything about the relative orientations of Rad50 protomers to Mre11 from the LRET data presented here because our LRET probes only report on the distances between Rad50s. Indeed, from the perspective of the Rad50 protomers, the “cutting” state is “closed” and would therefore be consistent with our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Use the more relevant endonuclease activity to validate the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion; this gave us the push to get the gel-based assays running in the lab. As can be seen in the modified manuscript, we dramatically expanded the nuclease data presented in the validation mutants section. We now include a fluorescence 384-well plate-based ssDNA endonuclease assay (Figure 3D) along with the existing Exo2 (Figure 3B) and Exo11 (Figure 3C) data. These assays were complemented with nuclease assays resolved by denaturing PAGE using a 40-mer dsDNA, a hairpin DNA containing a two nucleotide 3’-end overhang, a 40-mer ssDNA, and a 50-mer dsDNA where the terminal five phosphodiester bonds on the labeled strand are replaced by phosphorothioate bonds (making this substrate incompatible for 3’-to-5’ exonuclease activity on that strand). The gel-based data is presented in new Supplemental Figure S4. Most of these gel-based nuclease activity assays were performed both in the presence and absence of saturating ATP.</p><p>As described on pgs. 10-12 of the revised manuscript, we found that the Exo2 data compared favorably with the 40-mer dsDNA cleavage in the absence of ATP resolved by the PAGE – the 3’-end nucleotide was removed without further cleavage. The Exo11 results of each mutant MR complex resembled those of the gel-based 40-mer dsDNA and hairpin DNA cleavage in the presence of ATP – combined endo- and exonuclease activities by Mre11 resulted in a ladder of DNA products. Lastly, the ssDNA endonuclease assay results were similar to the data from both the 40-mer ssDNA and the 3’-end phosphorothioate-blocked dsDNA substrates – here, endonuclease activity also resulted in products of different sizes.</p><p>Several interesting observations arose from these data. First, the Exo11 assay is actually an endo/exo assay. Second, we noted that the previously described Pf Mre11 exonuclease-deficient mutant H52S does indeed have exonuclease activity. When assayed with the Exo2 substrate in the absence of ATP, as previously described (Williams, R.S., et al. 2008 Cell 135:97–109), we observed no cleavage; however, the gel-based assays clearly show nuclease activity against all the substrates tested. Second, H17E did not cleave either the dsDNA 40-mer or hairpin DNA, as it is unable to unwind the double helix, but showed robust activity on the phosphorothioate-blocked dsDNA and on the ssDNA. This suggests the primary cleavage of the phosphorothioate-blocked substrate is via endonuclease activity. Finally, the new nuclease data seem to solidify that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, is required for sequential or processive nuclease activity. On dsDNA, leaving ATP out of the reaction results in cleavage that does not proceed past the 3’ base pair. We hypothesize that ATP binding alters the structure of Rad50 which may affect its ability to bind DNA in the partially open and open forms. This is an idea that we are eager to address in follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Repeat the experiments with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, and in the absence of nucleotide</p></disp-quote><p>We also collected LRET data in the absence of nucleotide or with the non-hydrolysable analog ATPγS, which in our NMR experience is more stable at 50 °C than AMPPNP. Overall, we observed the same three conformations of MR<sup>NBD</sup> and full-length MR as for the ATP-bound form. This data is presented in the new Figure 4 and in the new Results sub-section (pgs. 14-16). Although for several of the pairs, the apo open distance was 2-4 Å larger (wider) than nucleotide-bound, the distances did not change significantly, and we did not re-run the HADDOCK calculations and SAXS experiments. These results are not surprising – given the size of the fluorophores and their associated linkers, LRET-based distances do not provide high enough resolution to report on the small, local conformational changes, such as those reported by Tainer and co-workers (Williams, G.J., et al. 2011 Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 18:423–431), within Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> that occur upon ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis.</p><p>What is likely changing within the nucleotide-bound forms is the relative populations of the three observed conformations. Unfortunately, the calculation of populations is very difficult from our LRET measurements. In theory, population information should be contained in the pre-factors of the multi-exponential fit. However, because neither LRET pair is sensitive to all three conformations (i.e., the protomers in open are too far apart for energy transfer with Tb<sup>3+</sup>-BODIPY and they are too close for Tb<sup>3+</sup>-Cy3), we cannot obtain accurate populations from these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) LRET measurements were performed under ATP-saturating conditions, yet it provided conformations compatible with Apo-MR(NBD) (see below).

This being said, it is possible that an open state HADDOCK model made using an apo Rad50<sup>NBD</sup> structure (as opposed to the AMPPNP-bound crystal structure used here) may fit the apo SAXS data even better.
