treatment in pregnant women with opioid use disorder, the effects of methadone on neurobehavioral development remain unclear. We developed a translational mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME) that resembles the typical pattern of opioid use by pregnant women who first use oxycodone then switch to methadone maintenance pharmacotherapy, and subsequently become pregnant while maintained on methadone. We investigated the effects of PME on physical development, sensorimotor behavior, and motor neuron properties using a multidisciplinary approach of physical, biochemical, and behavioral assessments along with brain slice electrophysiology and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. Methadone accumulated in the placenta and fetal brain, but methadone levels in offspring dropped rapidly at birth which was associated with symptoms and behaviors consistent with neonatal opioid withdrawal. PME produced substantial impairments in offspring physical growth, activity in an open field, and sensorimotor milestone acquisition. Furthermore, these behavioral alterations were associated with reduced neuronal density in the motor cortex and a disruption in motor neuron intrinsic properties and local circuit connectivity. The present study adds to the limited body of work examining PME by providing a comprehensive, translationally relevant characterization of how PME disrupts offspring physical and neurobehavioral development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The far-reaching opioid crisis extends to babies born to mothers who take prescription or illicit opioids during pregnancy. Opioids such as oxycodone and methadone can freely cross the placenta from mother to baby. With the rising misuse of and addiction to opioids, the number of babies born physically dependent on opioids has risen sharply over the last decade. Although these infants are only passively exposed to opioids in the womb, they can still experience withdrawal symptoms at birth. This withdrawal is characterized by irritability, excessive crying, body shakes, problems with feeding, fevers and diarrhea.</p><p>While considerable attention has been given to treating opioid withdrawal in newborn babies, little is known about how these children develop in their first years of life. This is, in part, because it is difficult for researchers to separate drug-related effects from other factors in a child’s home environment that can also disrupt their development. In addition, the biological mechanisms underpinning opioid-related impairments to infant development also remain unclear.</p><p>Animal models have been used to study the effects of opioid exposure during pregnancy (termed prenatal exposure) on infants. These models, however, could be improved to better replicate the typical pattern of opioid use among pregnant women.</p><p>Recognizing this gap, Grecco et al. have developed a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure where female mice that were previously dependent on oxycodone were treated with methadone throughout their pregnancy. Methadone is an opioid drug commonly prescribed for treating opioid use disorder in pregnant women and was found to accumulate at high levels in the fetal brain of mice, which fell quickly after birth. The offspring also experienced withdrawal symptoms. Grecco et al. then examined the physical, behavioral and brain development of mice born to opioid-treated mothers. These included assessments of the animals’ motor skills, sensory reflexes and behavior in their first four weeks of life. Additional experiments tested the properties of nerve cells in the brain to examine cell-level changes.</p><p>The assessments showed that methadone exposure in the womb impaired the physical growth of offspring and this persisted into ‘adolescence’. Prenatal methadone exposure also delayed progress towards key developmental milestones and led to hyperactivity in three-week-old mice. Moreover, Grecco et al. found that these mice had reduced neuron density and cell-to-cell connectivity in the part of the brain which controls movement.</p><p>These findings shed light on the potential consequences of prenatal methadone exposure on physical, behavioral and brain development in infants. This model could also be used to study new potential treatments or intervention strategies for offspring exposed to opioids during pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prenatal opioid</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA027214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atwood</surname><given-names>Brady K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AA028687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grecco</surname><given-names>Gregory G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AA07462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haggerty</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Reeves</surname><given-names>Kaitlin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006733</institution-id><institution>Indiana University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Bryan K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hui-Chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Atwood</surname><given-names>Brady K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010506</institution-id><institution>Indiana University Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atwood</surname><given-names>Brady K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011749</institution-id><institution>IU Simon Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masters</surname><given-names>Andrea R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stark Neurosciences Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grecco</surname><given-names>Gregory G</given-names></name><name><surname>Haggerty</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name><name><surname>Atwood</surname><given-names>Brady K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel, translational mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure was developed and a longitudinal assessment of offspring revealed impairments in physical, behavioral, and neuronal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pregnant women and their developing fetuses represent a vulnerable population severely impacted by the opioid crisis. From 1999 to 2014, the annual prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women at delivery increased 333% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haight et al., 2018</xref>). Mirroring this rise, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) increased from 1.2 to 5.8 per 1000 hospital births from 2000 to 2012 with some geographical regions near 33 cases per 1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patrick et al., 2015</xref>). Opioid maintenance therapies, such as methadone and buprenorphine, continue to represent the first-line treatments for pregnant women with OUD because these therapies benefit overall maternal-fetal outcomes at parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ACOG, 2017</xref>). However, it is unknown exactly how prenatal methadone exposure (PME) impacts the brain and behavioral development as these infants mature.</p><p>Prenatal opioid exposure is associated with smaller head circumferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Towers et al., 2019</xref>), lower brain volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartwell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sirnes et al., 2017</xref>), and deficits in white matter microstructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monnelly et al., 2018</xref>), although these studies are limited by small sample sizes making it difficult to control for confounding variables. A recent, large study using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study reported reduced motor cortical volumes and surface area in children with prenatal opioid exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartwell et al., 2020</xref>). These differences remained significant when controlling for multiple additional factors (e.g. socioeconomic factors and prenatal alcohol/tobacco), indicating opioid exposure in utero may specifically disrupt motor cortex development and potentially impact motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartwell et al., 2020</xref>). Prior studies revealed poorer motor performance in children exposed to opioids prenatally suggesting that prenatal opioid exposure produces long-lasting changes in both motor behavior and in brain regions associated with motor functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeoh et al., 2019</xref>). However, clinical studies are often complicated by significant environmental variations which are difficult to control such as the extent of prenatal care or additional prenatal substance exposures which also impact neurodevelopmental outcomes of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a translationally relevant animal model of prenatal opioid exposure is desperately needed to examine the neurological and behavioral consequences of opioid exposure in the absence of confounding variables.</p><p>Animal models of prenatal opioid exposure have demonstrated deficits in several sensorimotor milestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallin et al., 2019</xref>), but the mechanisms underlying disrupted sensorimotor development are unclear. Preclinical studies suggest that prenatal opioid exposure may prevent normal neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ricalde and Hammer, 1990</xref>) and disturb myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jantzie et al., 2020</xref>), which could underlie the aberrant neurobehavioral development. Unfortunately, the translational value of these rodent studies is limited by models that do not adequately model the majority of human prenatal opioid exposure cases. For instance, a large proportion of studies initiate opioid delivery around mid-gestation or later and often utilize morphine, even though methadone and buprenorphine account for a growing majority of prenatal opioid exposure cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrnes and Vassoler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). Initiating opioid exposure at later stages of pregnancy overlooks the effect of opioids on earlier embryonic developmental processes. These weaknesses underlie the call for improved animal models of prenatal opioid exposure, which encompass all stages of prenatal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We developed a more translational mouse model that resembles the typical pattern of opioid use in a pregnant woman who is first dependent on oxycodone, then begins methadone maintenance treatment, and subsequently becomes pregnant while maintained on methadone. We found that PME reduces physical growth in offspring which persists into adolescence and disrupts the development of locomotor activity and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) during the preweaning period. Furthermore, PME delays the development of specific sensorimotor milestones. These impairments were concurrently associated with alterations in layer 5 motor cortical neuron intrinsic properties and local connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of PME on pregnancy and litter characteristics</title><p>An overview of model development and workflow representing the total animals used for these studies is found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> summarizes pregnancy and litter characteristics.

Following nine days of oxycodone injections, mice began receiving methadone injections to simulate treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Following 5 days of methadone administration, the females were mated (gestational day 0) and treatment continued throughout gestation passively exposing the developing embryo and fetus to methadone. Following birth, dam methadone treatment continued which provided minimal, but measurable methadone exposure to offspring (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Using an open field, we measured the development of motor activity by repeatedly testing animals on P1, P7, P14, and P21. Locomotor activity was significantly altered during the pre-weaning period in PME offspring (rmANOVA: Exposure, F<sub>(1,49)</sub>=5.18, p=0.027; Time, F<sub>(1.38,67.84)</sub> = 299, p&lt;0.0001; Interaction, F<sub>(3,147)</sub>=10.5, p&lt;0.0001) with PME offspring demonstrating significantly reduced activity at P1 but greater activity at P7 and P21 (Sidak’s post hoc test: p=0.048, p=0.037, p=0.009, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Inspection of the P1 videos indicated the reduction in motor activity was likely a result of poor coordination as PME displayed a greater propensity to fall over earlier in the testing session. Although 88% of PME and 80% of PSE offspring fell over by the end of five-minute session on P1 (chi square test: χ2 <sub>(1, n=51)</sub>=0.690, p=0.41; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), 53.5% of PME compared to 28% of PSE animals had fallen over immediately upon placement into the arena (chi square test: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1, n=51)</sub>=0.30.52, p=0.061; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). There was a nonsignificant reduction in the latency to fall over in PME offspring (Mann-Whitney test: U = 248.5, p=0.136; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the hyperactivity on P21, PME offspring exhibited significantly more vertical jumps at P21 (Mann-Whitney test: U = 53, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) further indicating a hyperactive phenotype is present in juvenile PME offspring similar to what has been reported in opioid-exposed children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azuine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sundelin Wahlsten and Sarman, 2013</xref>). These jumps may represent escape attempts as some animals were able to jump and reach the top of the arena walls. When this occurred, the animal was outside of the frame of video and our tracking software was not able to record activity. Therefore, the total distance traveled at P21 in the PME animals may actually be greater than we are able to report. As increased anxiety-like behavior has also been reported in some prenatal opioid exposure models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrnes and Vassoler, 2018</xref>), we further examined open field videos for thigmotaxis, grooming, and rearing behaviors. Thigmotaxis was affected by PME (rmANOVA: Exposure, F<sub>(1,49)</sub>=0.17.33, p=0.0001; Time, F<sub>(1.41,68.9)</sub> = 236.3, p&lt;0.0001; Interaction, F<sub>(2,98)</sub>=12.01, p&lt;0.0001), with PME animals spending significantly more time at P7 near the arena walls than PSE animals (Sidak’s post hoc test: p=0.0004 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>) However, this likely reflects the relative hypoactivity of PSE animals which demonstrated very little activity on P7 and mostly remained in the arena center where offspring were placed at the beginning of each trial. Both grooming (Mann-Whitney test: U = 173.5, p=0.0037) and unsupported rearing (unpaired t test: t<sub>49</sub> = 2.48, p=0.017), but not supported rearing (unpaired t test: t<sub>49</sub> = 0.352, p=0.73) were reduced in PME mice which likely reflects an increase in time spent in active locomotion and jumping instead of grooming and rearing in PME mice as opposed to anxiolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b–d</xref>).</p><p>When removed from the dam, pups emit separation-induced USVs which signal distress and encourage retrieving behavior from the mother. USVs typically peak around P8 and extinguish by the third week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehret, 2005</xref>). The production of USVs in the open field was also significantly altered by PME (rmANOVA: Exposure, F<sub>(1,47)</sub>=0.380, p=0.54; Time, F<sub>(3,141)</sub>=13.3, p&lt;0.0001; Sex, F<sub>(1,47)</sub>=4.24, p=0.045; Time x Exposure, F<sub>(3,141)</sub>=3.01, p=0.032; Time x Sex, F<sub>(3,141)</sub>=0.636, p=0.59; Exposure x Sex, F<sub>(1,47)</sub>=1.57, p=0.22; Time x Exposure x Sex, F<sub>(3,141)</sub>=0.947, p=0.42; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and collapsed on sex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Female PME offspring vocalized significantly more than both male and female PSE offspring at P7 (Sidak’s post hoc test; p=0.0045 and p=0.026, respectively) but this difference was not observed in male PME offspring relative to either sex of PSE offspring (Sidak’s post hoc test; both p&gt;0.999, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). When collapsed on sex, vocalizations are nonsignificantly reduced at P1 and significantly increased at P7 in PME offspring (Sidak’s post hoc test: p=0.079 and p=0.015, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Although female PME offspring do not produce significantly more USVs than male PME offspring at P7 (Sidak’s post hoc: p=0.60), the sex-collapsed effect described on P7 is likely driven by the high rate of USV production in female PME offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We next performed further analysis on P7 USVs as this day differed between exposure groups. Total activity correlated significantly with total calls on P7 across all animals (Pearson’s r = 0.41, p=0.0028; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4a</xref>) suggesting that there may be a relationship between hyperactivity and hyper-vocalizations among PME offspring. USV call types were classified into categories based on frequencies, to cluster the types of USVs emitted on P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffey et al., 2019</xref>). The call classification analysis revealed the increase in USVs on P7 may be a result of a higher number of complex, flat, step down, and upward ramp calls emitted by PME offspring (unpaired t tests: t<sub>49</sub> = 2.54, p=0.014; t<sub>49</sub> = 2.98, p=0.0045; t<sub>49</sub> = 2.74, p=0.0086; t<sub>49</sub> = 2.09, p=0.041; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Markov chains of call type transitions (‘syntax’) was further analyzed on P7 which also revealed differences in the transition between call types between exposure groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4c</xref>).</p><p>Beginning on P3 and through P14, offspring began a battery of daily developmental tests assessing the development of sensorimotor milestones. Offspring with PME demonstrated delayed acquisition of surface righting (unpaired t test: t<sub>48</sub> = 4.69, p&lt;0.0001), forelimb grasp (Mann-Whitney test: U = 166, p=0.0029), and cliff aversion (Mann-Whitney test: U = 161, p=0.0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). No differences in the acquisition of the extinguishment of pivoting (Mann-Whitney test: U = 238, p=0.14) or negative geotaxis behavior (Mann-Whitney test: U = 270.5, p=0.42) were observed. As basic locomotor activity is not impaired in PME offspring, these data indicate that PME offspring lack the ability to produce more complex, coordinated motor behaviors in response to multimodal sensory input.</p><p>A recent investigation of prenatal THC exposure revealed deficits in sensorimotor gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frau et al., 2019</xref>); therefore, as sensorimotor performance was impaired in PME offspring, we subsequently tested prepulse inhibition (PPI), a sensorimotor gating task.

The present study adds to the limited body of work examining preclinical models of prenatal opioid exposure. We provide the first longitudinal assessment of behavioral and neuronal development in offspring with PME combined with data on maternal and fetal opioid levels in the brain, placenta, and blood. Furthermore, the present study builds upon previous models by providing a more comprehensive, clinically relevant characterization of how methadone, a commonly used opioid during pregnancy, impacts development when offspring are opioid-exposed during the entire gestational period. Our findings reveal a disruption in physical, behavioral, and neuronal development in PME male and female offspring which persists beyond the immediate neonatal period and supports clinical studies that suggest babies born with opioid exposure are at higher risk for adverse developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeoh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Data on opioid levels in offspring are lacking in the preclinical literature. Bearing in mind differences in metabolism between rodents and humans, the methadone dose utilized here was likely in the clinical range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devidze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dryden et al., 2009</xref>). Although dam plasma levels were lower that what is typically recommended for treating OUD in humans (~400 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eap et al., 2002</xref>), our dosing protocol produced opioid dependency in dams. Others also reported an accumulation of methadone in the rodent fetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kongstorp et al., 2019</xref>). We added to these findings by demonstrating methadone accumulated in the placenta and provided evidence that the placenta may have predictive power to infer the degree of prenatal brain opioid exposure during gestation. Although both methadone and EDDP accumulated in the placenta, EDDP did not concentrate in the fetal brain as methadone did. This observation may suggest the increase in methadone resulted from reduced metabolism in offspring. Methadone undergoes N-demethylation to form EDDP primarily via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eap et al., 2002</xref>), but the expression of most cytochrome P450 enzymes in both mice and humans are dramatically lower during the prenatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hart et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, we are confident that methadone was present in the fetal brain at pharmacologically relevant levels in our model and likely contributed to the aberrant neurobehavioral development.</p><p>The persistent decrease in the size of offspring was striking, and other models of prenatal opioid exposure, including methadone, similarly demonstrated reduced body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrnes and Vassoler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jantzie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunko et al., 1996</xref>). In humans, prenatal opioid exposure is similarly associated with low birth weight and being small for gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nørgaard et al., 2015</xref>), but it remains unclear what underlies this reduced size. Given the delayed acquisition of other sensorimotor milestones, it is possible PME also delayed acquisition of the suckling reflex which could contribute to reduced growth. An alternative hypothesis is that methadone disrupted the hypothalamic–pituitary–somatotropic axis. Central administration of exogenous opioids modulates plasma levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor in adult humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashiguchi et al., 1996</xref>). Work done by Vathy and colleagues revealed that prenatal morphine exposure interacts with other hypothalamic-pituitary axes altering the homeostatic balance of stress-related hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rimanóczy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slamberová et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vathy, 2002</xref>), but the effect of prenatal opioid exposure on growth-related hormones has not been studied and may represent an important area of study for future work.</p><p>Separation-induced USVs emitted by mouse pups are frequently used as a measure of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehret, 2005</xref>). Production of these USVs is dependent on the endogenous opioid system. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists reduce USV rates, and mice lacking MORs do not vocalize when separated from the dam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carden et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moles et al., 2004</xref>). Others showed that PME reduces MOR-binding affinity and alters downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kongstorp et al., 2020a</xref>) suggesting the differences in USV development in our model resulted from changes in the endogenous opioid system. While the exact biological relevance of the increase in USV call rates and the alterations in call types and syntax on P7 is unclear at this time, these complex differences in USVs certainly reflected differential pup-dam communication between PME and PSE offspring.</p><p>PME offspring were hyperactive in the open field on P7 and P21 including a high number of jumps on P21. Combined with the increased USV call rate on P7, these activity findings are indicative of a heightened sensory arousal and hyperactive state in juvenile PME offspring. This hyperarousal phenotype may represent an enduring consequence of PME during the development of neurocircuitry controlling stress and/or sensorimotor activity. Our data support clinical findings that report higher risks of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and increased hyperactivity and impulsivity in children with opioid exposure in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azuine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ornoy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sundelin Wahlsten and Sarman, 2013</xref>). In our model, PME offspring experienced delayed development of several sensorimotor milestones. Again, these findings mirror recent meta-analyses which support the negative impact of prenatal opioid exposure on psychomotor performance and motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeoh et al., 2019</xref>). In regards to animal models, others also reported delayed development of certain sensorimotor milestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallin et al., 2019</xref>), but these reports slightly differ in which specific milestones are delayed and which develop normally in offspring. For instance, offspring from our PME model did not exhibit differences in negative geotaxis, although in other models of prenatal buprenorphine and methadone exposure, negative geotaxis was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallin et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the differences in opioid used, duration and timing of exposure, and differences between rat and mouse development, identifying why specific milestones are delayed and why others are not remains challenging.</p><p>The neural mechanisms that could mediate the sensorimotor deficits and hyperactivity observed in our model are diverse. M1 has a central role in the preparation, execution, and adaptation of motor movements. Although the intrinsic properties of neurons can be affected by numerous ion channels and ion pumps, slice recording data indicated that altered intrinsic properties of M1 L5 pyramidal neurons from PME mice may be mediated by enhanced HCN channel-driven <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>. In cortical pyramidal neurons, there is a gradient of HCN channel expression with the greatest being in the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</xref>). In mouse M1, HCN channels filter synaptic inputs onto L5 corticospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, increased <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> in M1 L5 pyramidal neurons in PME mice suggests a narrowing of both spatial and temporal integration windows for both local and long-range synaptic inputs. Local circuit maps collected here showed that PME enhanced the L2/3→ L5 excitatory pathway in M1, which is the major local excitatory pathway for M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the narrowing of synaptic integration windows leads to compensatory mechanisms that enhanced the strength of synaptic inputs. These findings may suggest HCN channels represent a therapeutic target to prevent the potential neurobehavioral consequences of PME. In addition, methadone inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eap et al., 2002</xref>), which mediate experience-dependent synaptic pruning during maturation of the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, PME-induced changes to dendritic pruning may also contribute to the altered local circuits of layer 5 M1 neurons, which could be further mediated by changes to HCN expression or function. While our morphological analysis revealed no effect of PME on L5 M1 neurons, measurements were highly variable indicating that neurons analyzed were a heterogeneous population of thick-tufted neurons.</p><p>Although methadone may be a necessary and effective treatment for maternal OUD, these findings suggest this treatment during pregnancy may come at the expense of persistent disruptions in offspring development. As clinical evidence strongly indicates the use of opioid maintenance therapies for treating OUD improves pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ACOG, 2017</xref>), these findings which indicate PME impairs physical and neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring should not be interpreted as evidence against the use of opioid maintenance therapies in pregnancy. Instead, early and preventative clinical intervention programs such as neurodevelopmental follow-up programs may be needed to support the healthy development of infants exposed to opioids in utero. Further research is necessary to determine if additional prenatal pharmacotherapies may prevent pathology and behavioral impairments in offspring. There are several limitations which must be considered when interpreting our findings. Prior reports indicated opioid treatment alters maternal behavior which could impact offspring development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slamberová et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallin et al., 2019</xref>). However, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alipio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kongstorp et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), did not observe differences in maternal care suggesting the differences found in offspring are a result of passive methadone exposure during gestational development. As maternal stress can have wide-ranging and persistent effects on physical, behavioral, and neurological development, additional longitudinal assessments of maternal care including maternal-offspring interactions throughout the preweaning period may provide additional information on maternal care. Alternatively, future work is necessary to examine how repeated opioid treatment may disrupt neuroendocrine physiology (e.g. HPA axis dysfunction or corticosterone production) which may indirectly disrupt offspring development. We cannot be confident that subtle differences in maternal behavior interacted with methadone exposure to alter offspring outcomes. We discovered few sex-specific effects in our assessments of offspring. This may be a result of the age at which the animals were tested or, if sex differences were very subtle, we many have been inadequately powered to detect such small differences. Next, we modeled PME via noncontingent treatment using twice daily injections. Although free-access or self-administration would be more translational, noncontingent exposure reduces variability in methadone exposure between pregnant females. The interaction of PME with the stress of injections and repeated handling of dams could produce the differential offspring outcomes. Given that medically supervised opioid withdrawal is not recommended for OUD, our choice of prenatal opioid exposure model was based on epidemiological trends which supports the high usage of methadone by pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). However, there exists numerous variations in human opioid use during pregnancy which our model does not reflect (e.g. women may not initiate opioid maintenance therapy until partway through pregnancy; they may experience a relapse and/or use other recreational opioids at variable intervals during pregnancy; buprenorphine, which has a different pharmacological profile than methadone, is an increasingly frequent choice for opioid maintenance therapy). Further work by our group and others will be required to examine these variants of prenatal opioid exposure. The differences between rodent and human gestational development are an inherent limitation of our model that cannot be overcome. The first week of rodent postnatal life is roughly equivalent to the third trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). In an attempt to maintain a sufficient level of methadone exposure to the newborn pups during P0-P7, the dams were maintained at their highest gestational dose after giving birth and up to P7; however, it is unlikely this strategy completely replicates in utero third trimester opioid exposure in humans. Lastly, our findings in offspring were collected in the preweaning and early adolescent periods. Future studies will examine if alterations in physical, behavioral, and neuronal outcomes persist into adulthood or if PME offspring are able to eventually overcome these differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male and female)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">B6/J</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-Cux1 (polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat# SC-13024, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2261231">AB_2261231</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:250 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-NeuN (monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# MAB377, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2298772">AB_2298772</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-11001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534069">AB_2534069</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-32732;

Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine), single housed, and randomly assigned to either saline (10 mL/kg) or oxycodone treatments. Oxycodone dependence was induced by a dose-ramping procedure with a dose of 10 mg/kg administered on pregestational day (PG) 14, 20 mg/kg on PG13, and then maintained on 30 mg/kg for PG12-6. All saline or oxycodone doses were administered subcutaneously twice daily at least 7 hr apart. On PG5, oxycodone-treated mice were transitioned to 10 mg/kg methadone while saline-treated animals continued to receive saline injections (s.c. b.i.d.). All oxycodone and methadone solutions were prepared in saline. Oxycodone and methadone were obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program. Five days following initiation of methadone treatment, an 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mouse (also acquired from Jackson Laboratories) was placed into the cage of each female for four days. Mucous plugs were assessed each morning to approximate gestational day (G) 0. Food consumption was examined weekly in a subset of these female mice. Female mice were weighed every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday throughout the study with the exception of the mating period.</p><p>Cages were examined for the presence of pups at the time of each morning and afternoon injection, and the day of birth was designated postnatal day (P) 0. Data on litter size, sexes, and neonatal deaths were collected. The presence of unconsumed placentas at 24 hr following birth was also examined. Only litters between three and eight pups were used in subsequent studies of offspring. In an attempt to maintain a sufficient level of methadone exposure to the newborn pups during P0-P7, the dams were maintained at their highest gestational dose after giving birth and up to P7. After P7, the dose of methadone administered to dams was adjusted to their body weight. All treatments to dams were discontinued at weaning (~P28).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Methadone and metabolite concentrations</title><p>All tissue and blood samples were collected 2.5 hr following morning administration of methadone. On G18, three dams were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and fetuses were rapidly removed from the uterine cavity to examine brain and placental drug levels. On P1 and P7, three dams and their litters were sacrificed for the collection of trunk blood and brains. Blood samples were centrifuged for five minutes at 4500 g to collect 20 µL of plasma. Plasma, placenta, and whole brains were frozen in isopentane on dry ice and stored in −80°C until processing. The samples were examined for the presence of methadone and EDDP via high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC–MS/MS; Sciex 5500 QTRAP, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, MA). The analytical method for plasma samples has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzger et al., 2020</xref>). Tissue samples and standards were prepared by adding diphenhydramine (internal standard, 0.1 ng/µL in methanol) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (200 µL, pH 7.4) to tissue samples. Samples were then extracted using a liquid-liquid procedure with 3 mL ethyl acetate. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and evaporated to dryness, then reconstituted in acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (pH 6.5). Ten microliters of sample were then injected and the remaining protocol follows the previously published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metzger et al., 2020</xref>). The limit of quantification for methadone and EDDP detection was 0.1 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL in the plasma, respectively, and 0.08 ng/sample and 0.04 ng/sample of placenta and brain, respectively for methadone and EDDP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Maternal characteristics</title><p>Dams were given a new compressed paper nestlet, and twelve hours later, the ability of dams to build a new nest on P3 was assessed using a five-point nest rating system where one represents a nestlet untouched and a five requires &gt;90% of nestlet to be torn creating a crater with walls higher than the height of the mouse for &gt;50% of the circumference. Further criterion are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deacon, 2006</xref>). A pup retrieval task was completed by first removing one pup and the dam and then placing the pup at one end of the cage (~30 cm away). The dam was then released at the other end of the cage and the time required to retrieve the missing pup was recorded. This was repeated with two other pups and an average pup retrieval latency score was calculated.</p><p>To demonstrate that the oxycodone dosing strategy induced dependency, a subset of mice underwent naloxone-precipitated withdrawal prior to methadone transition. Sixty to 90 min following the final 30 mg/kg oxycodone dose on PG6, all mice were administered naloxone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and somatic signs of withdrawal were assessed for 10 min using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berrendero et al., 2003</xref>). These behavioral signs included number of paw shakes, wet dog shakes, and jumps and the presence of ptosis, body tremor, teeth chattering, piloerection, and diarrhea. The global withdrawal score was calculated using the following equation: (jumps*0.8+wetdogs shakes*1+diarrhea*1.5+paw shakes*0.35+ptosis*1.5+teeth chattering*1.5+body tremor*1.5+piloerection*1.5). These mice which underwent precipitated withdrawal were not used in any subsequent studies. Similarly, following the weaning of offspring, a subset of dams underwent the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal procedure to demonstrate that the transition to the 10 mg/kg methadone dosing regimen maintained opioid dependency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Offspring physical development</title><p>Beginning at P0 and throughout the pre-weaning period, offspring were marked for identification on the paws with a red or black marker. The progression of weight gain and body length on P0, P3, P7, P10, P14, P18, and P21 was examined. A subset of the offspring was also weighed at P35 and P49. From P3 to P18, offspring were examined for the first day both eyes were open, the first day both ear pinnae completely unfolded and the ear canal was patent, and the first day the lower incisors emerged.</p><p>The right femur of P7 and P35 offspring was scanned on a SkyScan 1172 (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) with a 0.5 aluminum filter and a 6 µm voxel size. For P7 samples, mineralized femur length was obtained from a coronal view of the scan. Whole bone volume was obtained in the transaxial plane incorporating the entire mineralized bone. For P35 samples, a 0.5 mm region of interest at the distal femur was selected proximal to the growth plate. Distal femur metaphysis bone volume was obtained in the transaxial plane from this whole region including both trabecular and cortical bone. Trabecular bone was isolated in the same region for trabecular bone volume. Cortical bone in P35 samples was measured from five slices 2 mm proximal the end of the metaphysis region of interest. Cortical bone area and cortical thickness were measured at this site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Offspring behavior</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Open field</title><p>A modified open field (12.5 W x 15.8 L x 13.7 H cm) with a video recording device (Brio Ultra HD Pro Webcam, Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) and an ultrasound microphone (Pettersson Elektronik AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to assess locomotion and USVs development for five minutes on P1, P7, P14, and P21 in offspring. These sessions began at 8:00 A.M following a one-hour acclimation period. The arena was placed on a far infrared warming pad (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) that maintained the surface temperature between 35 and 37°C. The entire apparatus was located within an environmental control chamber (Omnitech Electronics Inc, Columbus, OH) that was layered with sound proofing material. USV audio files were processed using the open-source, deep-learning-based system DeepSqueak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coffey et al., 2019</xref>). Video tracking analysis was accomplished with EthoVision XT software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA). P1 recorded videos were examined for the number of twitches/jerks (defined as sudden and rapid muscle contractions of the limbs and/or whole body), a behavior consistent with NOWS in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kocherlakota, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ward et al., 2020</xref>). As temperature instability is also a symptom of NOWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kocherlakota, 2014</xref>), body temperature was assessed on P1. Without a heating source, body temperature was monitored in offspring at baseline and after 2 min of isolation. Due to the small size of pups preventing collection of rectal temperatures, a FLIR E8 infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR) was used to capture surface body temperature. Post-hoc analysis of duration of time spent near the walls of the arena was assessed using Noldus software. Noldus Automatic Behavior Recognition was used to track the frequency of jumping, unsupported and supported rearing, and grooming behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Sensorimotor milestones</title><p>Beginning on P3 and through P14, offspring were tested daily to examine acquisition of: surface righting to prone position within 5 s of release, expression of negative geotaxis within 15 s of release demonstrated by ascending a slight incline after initial placement facing downwards, display of cliff aversion within 10 s of release on a ledge demonstrated by moving backward off the cliff edge, ability to grasp a suspended rod with both forelimbs for at least 2 s, and extinguishing of pivoting behavior demonstrated by walking outside of a 12 cm diameter circle within 30 s. These assessments are well-established paradigms used to characterize the normal development of newborn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2008</xref>).

T2-weighted images with a three-dimensional Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE) sequence were acquired for volumetric measurements (TR/TE = 1500/11 ms, Rare Factor = 12, FOV = 20×20 x 7 mm with an isotropic voxel of 120 µm<sup>3</sup>, number of averages = 1, scan time = 11.8 min).</p><p>A mouse brain atlas for 4-week-old mice was created by modifying PMOD (PMOD Technologies LLC, Switzerland) Ma-Benveniste-Mirrione mouse brain atlas. Specifically, the T2-weighted MRI images of a 4-week-old control mouse were normalized to the PMOD built-in mouse brain template using a Deform function in the ‘Fuse It’ module. VOIs were then manually adjusted to fit the 4-week-old mouse brain and to create a 4-week mouse atlas for this study. To obtain the brain volume measurements, T2-weighted anatomical images from individual mouse in the native space were normalized to the 4-week mouse template and an inverse transformation matrix was saved in Fuse It module. The native space image data were loaded again in the View module then 4-week-mouse atlas with VOIs was loaded and inverse transformed to obtain the volume measurements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for segmentation).

For acquiring the electrophysiological profiles of neurons, patch pipettes contained potassium-based intracellular solution (in mM: 128 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, and 0.4 GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, three ascorbate; pH 7.2). 3–4 mg biocytin (Sigma-Aldrich) was included in the intrapipette solution for morphological reconstruction. MNI-caged glutamate (Tocris Bioscience, 295325-62-1) [0.2 mM] was combined with recirculating solution for all recordings. The bath solution for recordings contained elevated concentrations of divalent cations [4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 4 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>] and NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [5 mM] (Tocris biosciences, 126453-07-4). Slices were used 1.5‒4.5 hr after preparation. Recordings were performed at room temperature. Pipette series resistance was between 2 and 5 MΩ. Pipette capacitance was compensated; series resistance was monitored but not compensated and required to be &lt;25 MΩ for inclusion in the data set. Current-clamp recordings were bridge-balanced. Current was injected as needed to maintain the membrane potential near −70 mV during select stimulus protocols. Recordings were filtered at 4 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Membrane potential values were not corrected for a calculated liquid junction potential of 11 mV. Ephys software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ephus.org">http://www.ephus.org</ext-link>) was used for hardware control and data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suter et al., 2010</xref>).

The mapping grid (16 × 16; 100 µm spacing) was rotated with the top row of the grid flush with the exterior primary motor area layer one. The grid locations were sampled (every 0.4 s) with a UV stimulus 1.0 ms in duration and 20 mW at the specimen plane. Photo-stimulation sites resulting in activation of glutamate receptors on the dendrites of the recorded neuron were readily detected based on characteristically short onset latencies (7 ms) of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>) and included in the map analyses as synaptic responses resulting from uncaged glutamate activation of presynaptic neurons within the local circuit. Responses overlapped by direct activation of the recorded neuron’s dendrites were excluded and rendered as black pixels in input color maps. These maps thus represent ‘images’ of the local sources of monosynaptic input arising from small clusters of ~100 neurons at each stimulus location. Excitatory (glutamatergic) responses were recorded at a command voltage of −70 mV.

For offspring weight and length, offspring from eight to nine litters per exposure were examined. For all behavioral studies, offspring were taken from four to five different litters per exposure. For neuroimaging and immunohistochemistry studies, offspring from four litters per exposure were utilized. For electrophysiology, mapping, morphology, and imaging, neurons were recorded and imaged from offspring of nine different litters per exposure. With the exception of MRI data, all studies were sufficiently powered to detect sex differences. Therefore, all analyses (with the exception of MRI data) were first completed treating sex as a factor. However, for clarity of focusing on the effect of prenatal exposure, when no main effects of sex or interactions with sex were found in offspring, the data was collapsed on sex and re-analyzed. Chi-square tests for categorical data was used for litter characteristics. A linear regression was performed to assess the relationship between placental methadone levels and offspring brain levels on G18, and offspring plasma and brain levels on P1 and P7. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used to analyze normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U tests or Wilcoxon rank sum test (for electrophysiology data only) were used to analyze non-normally distributed data. For data with multiple groups and/or repeated measures, ANOVAs with Sidak’s post hoc tests were used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program for generously providing the methadone and oxycodone utilized in the experiments of this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alicia Izquierdo as the Reviewing Editor and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lauren L Jantzie (Reviewer #1); W Christopher Risher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Reviewers request edits that fall in the category of additional analyses, methodological details, and discussion. Reviewers do not request additional experiments.</p><p>1) There needs to be clarification of sex differences/analyses.

All analyses, with the exception of the MRI analysis, were powered to detect sex-effects and the analyses were first completed including sex as a factor (Although, we were originally underpowered to detect sex-effects for immunostaining data, we have included additional replicates in this resubmission which has provided us with the power to detect sex-effects (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2). When sex-effects were discovered, they were stated in the Results section and data was represented separated by sexes in figures. When no main effects of sex or interactions with sex were found, the factor was collapsed and the data were re-analyzed, no longer including sex as a factor. Figures were then represented collapsed on sex. Given the large amount of data collected and analyzed, our goal was to ensure the reader was able to focus on prenatal exposure effects as opposed to bogging them down in many null effects of sex. This was originally stated in the “statistics” section of the Materials and methods but was further clarified in this resubmission. To further clarify our analysis approach, we briefly acknowledge within each figure legend how we handled sex in our analyses.</p><p><bold>2) The analysis of structural differences measured by volumetric MRI showed that there were no appreciable differences across grey matter structures with PME.

In contrast to gray matter, white matter tracts are more or less “continuous” making volumetric approaches to white matter changes less than ideal. A more appropriate approach to the examination of white matter structure would be DTI tractography which we unfortunately did not collect during this scan session. Completing DTI would almost certainly be too large of an undertaking for the present manuscript; nonetheless, we are actively interested in examining white matter deficits using DTI and hope to complete this method in future studies using our mouse model of PME.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewers request added details related to drug preparation/administration, and the timeline of administration.

Furthermore, we have expanded our Materials and methods section in several areas with greater detail on experiments completed. We did <italic>not</italic> normalize grey matter volumes to intracranial/total brain volume and body weight. Given that PME animals were smaller at the time of scanning (~P28) and differences were not present using raw volumes, we feel that normalization could falsely inflate region grey matter differences in PME animals. We have now clarified that these values were not normalized to body weight or intracranial/total brain volume (Materials and methods).</p><p><bold>4) Though reviewers do not request additional data or experiments related to this, authors should note potential ways that maternal stress could weigh in to the present results and how they could be addressed in the future.</bold></p><p>We strongly agree with the reviewers that increased maternal stress could impact offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes and thank them for drawing particular attention to this potential limitation of our model. As we were developing this rodent model of PME, the authors shared this concern regarding the effects of repeated handling and injections on maternal stress levels which could, in turn, negatively affect offspring outcomes. Admittedly, we did not utilize age-matched completely naïve (e.g. no injections or handling) dams as a non-stressed control group for all studies would have required a substantial number of additional animals that may not have added significant value to the interpretation of the data. Our primary interest was to examine the effects of prenatal drug exposure, and, therefore, our greatest concern was to ensure that maternal behaviors did not differ between opioid-injected and saline-injected dams. As can be observed in Figure 3, methadone dams demonstrate remarkable resiliency to repeated methadone injections relative to the saline injected animals, although opioid-injected dams are physically dependent on opioids (Figure 3E). This certainly translates to the “bedside” as the purpose of methadone treatment is to reduce opioid craving and curtail withdrawal allowing individuals to live their everyday lives. Therefore, we feel it is unlikely that increased maternal stress among opioid-treated dams contributed to the outcomes we describe in PME offspring. Nonetheless, we previously acknowledged this limitation in our original submission and have expanded on this limitation as requested (Discussion).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors should describe how the methadone was made and the vehicle it was made up in, including any diluents and excipients.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for oversight and have included in this resubmission that the methadone solution was dissolved in saline (Materials and methods).</p><p><bold>2) In the Discussion it would be helpful to have the authors describe how they see this data changing the field or the clinical implications of the findings with greater depth.

Although, we did not observe differences in pregnancy rates, maternal weights, or maternal care behaviors we assessed, it remains plausible that the twice daily injections could impact maternal stress levels which could produce subtle effects on maternal behaviors which interacts with PME to alter offspring outcomes.

Although every effort was made to include an equal number and appropriate numbers of sexes in our studies so that we were sufficiently powered to detect sex differences, in some studies, additional numbers of animals may have increased the power to detect potential sex differences in offspring outcomes. ≥7 mice per sex per exposure were utilized in behavioral experiments, ≥9 mice per sex per exposure were utilized for weight and length assessments, ≥5 mice per sex per exposure were utilized for bone density studies, ≥11 cells per sex per exposure were utilized in electrophysiological assessments, and ≥6 cells per sex per exposure were utilized in morphology studies. For this resubmission, we were able to include more animals for our immunostaining analysis of cell density in ACC, S1, and M1 which provided the power to detect sex-effects (≥4 mice per sex per exposure); however, we do not have the appropriate number of animals to examine sex effects for the grey matter volumes assessed via MRI which is why this data was not analyzed with sex as a factor. We have now provided a statement in the limitations paragraph of our Discussion indicating that increased power may have revealed additional sex-effects.</p></body></sub-article></article>
