pressure is under continuous tight regulation. It is universally accepted that this regulation arises from a two-process model, integrating both a circadian and a homeostatic controller. Here we explore the role of environmental social signals as a third, parallel controller of sleep homeostasis and sleep pressure. We show that, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> males, sleep pressure after sleep deprivation can be counteracted by raising their sexual arousal, either by engaging the flies with prolonged courtship activity or merely by exposing them to female pheromones.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27445.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans spend one-third of their lifetime sleeping, but why we (and other animals) need to sleep remains an unresolved mystery of biology. Our desire to sleep changes depending on how much sleep we’ve already had. If we’ve had a long nap during the day, we may find it harder to fall asleep at night; conversely, if we stay up all night partying, we’ll have a difficult time staying alert the next day. This change in the pressure to sleep is known as “sleep homeostasis”.</p><p>Can sleep homeostasis be suppressed? We know that some migratory birds are able to resist sleep while flying over the ocean. In addition, males of an Arctic bird species forgo sleep for courtship during the three-week window every year when females of its species are fertile. These examples suggest that some behavioral or environmental factors may influence sleep homeostasis.</p><p>Beckwith et al. now show that sexual arousal can disrupt sleep homeostasis in fruit flies. In “blind date” experiments, young male fruit flies were kept in a small tube with female fruit flies, prompting a 24-hour period of courtship and mating. The males went without sleep during that period, and they did not make up for the lost sleep afterward.</p><p>In other experiments, male fruit flies were kept awake by a robot that disturbed them every time they tried to sleep. After such treatment, the flies normally attempted to nap. But if the sleep-deprived flies were exposed to a chemical emitted by female flies that increased their sexual arousal, they no longer needed to sleep.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Beckwith et al. show that sleep is a biological drive that can be overcome under certain conditions. This will be important for sleep researchers to remember, because it means that it’s possible to affect sleep regulation (perhaps by making the animal stressed or aroused) without activating the brain circuits directly involved in regulating sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>sex</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M003930/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>French</surname><given-names>Alice S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilestro</surname><given-names>Giorgio F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 57-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckwith</surname><given-names>Esteban J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>705930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckwith</surname><given-names>Esteban J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J014575/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geissmann</surname><given-names>Quentin</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilestro</surname><given-names>Giorgio F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sexual arousal, exposure to aphrodisiac pheromones, or mere activation of peripheral pheromone-sensing neurons can modulate sleep homeostasis and are able to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The two-process model for regulation of sleep, first postulated by Borbély in 1982, is still considered the most accurate conceptual framework to describe how sleep pressure builds and dissipates along the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borbély, 1982</xref>). According to the model, sleep propensity at any given time integrates two independent biological mechanisms: a circadian regulator (process C) and a homeostatic regulator (process S). The circadian regulator is under control of the circadian clock and independent of external factors. The homeostatic regulator, on the other hand, is a tracker of past sleep and is responsible for the accumulation of sleep pressure upon sleep deprivation, or its release after a nap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borbély and Achermann, 1999</xref>). The idea of a ‘process S’ is historically based upon electrophysiological recordings obtained in mammals and, in particular, on the observation that low-frequency electrophysiological correlates of neuronal activity — Slow Wave Sleep — increase with sleep deprivation, dissipate with sleep, and thus can ultimately act as biological markers for sleep pressure. The basic separation between a circadian and a homeostatic regulator, however, is a fundamental concept that lives beyond electrophysiology and can be adopted to model sleep pressure also in animals where the electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of sleep are very different or unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>). In virtually all animals tested so far, sleep deprivation leads to a subsequent increase in sleep rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirelli and Tononi, 2008</xref>). Understanding the biological underpinnings of process C and process S is an important investigative task, not only to uncover the mechanisms regulating sleep, but ultimately its function too. Discovering how and why sleep pressure increases upon sleep deprivation may be critical to ultimately unravel what sleep is for.</p><p>Besides a homeostatic and a circadian controller, we do know that other factors can modulate sleep. Most people in western society will lament poor sleep habits and this is generally not due to malfunctioning of process S or process C but, instead, to societal or generally environmental and emotional causes (e.g. stress, anxiety, excitement, hunger, love) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohayon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolescent Sleep Working Group et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>From the experimental perspective, changes in environmental temperature and food restriction constitute two important examples of sleep modulation by environmental conditions. In flies, an increase in temperature during the night has been shown to have profound effects on sleep pattern, but not necessarily on total sleep amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamaze et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parisky et al., 2016</xref>). In rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danguir and Nicolaidis, 1979</xref>), humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacFadyen et al., 1973</xref>), and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keene et al., 2010</xref>) starvation has been shown to lead to a rapid decrease in sleep amount. In mammals, this also correlates with qualitative differences in the EEG pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danguir and Nicolaidis, 1979</xref>). Besides a strong evolutionary conservation at the behavioural level, caloric intake and sleep are also genetically linked, as the same proteins and neuromodulators have been shown to control both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Willie et al., 2001</xref>). However, the relationship between the two is also complicated by the fact that caloric restriction has profound consequences on metabolism.</p><p>Here we describe a new paradigm to study the behavioural, neuronal, and genetic connection between environment and sleep: sex drive. We find that, in male flies, sexual arousal has profound effects on sleep, and that sexual experience or even exposure to pheromones alone are sufficient stimuli to counteract sleep pressure after sleep deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Paradoxical effects of social sleep deprivation on sleep rebound</title><p>After being forcefully deprived of sleep, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> consistently show an increase in sleep pressure, in the form of a concomitant increase in sleep amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2004</xref>) and in arousal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faville et al., 2015</xref>). In other words, flies, like mammals, appear to sleep longer and deeper after sleep deprivation and both are clear signs of what is normally referred as ‘sleep rebound’, a hallmark of sleep homoeostasis. To deprive flies of sleep, most researchers would use mechanical machines, such as laboratory shakers, that subject animals to frequent, if not continuous, vibratory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2004</xref>). We previously showed that a spatially restricted, forced interaction between two males also leads to a robust sleep deprivation that has the same behavioural and cellular characteristics of mechanical deprivation, including a similar extent of detectable rebound and comparable biochemical correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilestro et al., 2009</xref>). To further investigate how social interaction affects sleep, we devised an experimental paradigm based on computer-assisted video analysis of behaviour. Using <italic>ethoscopes</italic>, video tracking machines recently developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>), we monitored and annotated the behaviour of flies either in isolation (baseline and rebound days) or in groups of two (interaction day). The advantages of using video tracking over the infrared beam split system when measuring sleep have been discussed at length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilestro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmerman et al., 2008</xref>) and, arguably, video tracking becomes even more compelling when monitoring multiple flies interacting in the same space.</p><p>In our archetypical experiment, wild-type male flies (CantonS) were kept in social isolation in small glass tubes for five days, in order to acclimatise to their environment and to record their baseline activity (see Materials and methods). Then, at the beginning of interaction day, we introduced a second individual in the restricted recording space: the <italic>intruder.</italic> For MM interactions, the intruder was another male of different eye colours (<italic>white</italic><sup>1118</sup>, cyan in figures). For MF interactions, a wild-type virgin female (peach in figures). Mock control male animals underwent the same experimental manipulation but were kept in isolation also during interaction day (mock, grey in figures). In all cases, interaction lasted no more than 24 hr. Confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilestro et al., 2009</xref>), we found that MM interactions consistently led to a sleep deprivation during the interaction period, and to a noticeable rebound immediately after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The MF interaction led to an even greater deprivation of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) but, surprisingly, did not show any subsequent rebound (peach in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

N<sub>mock</sub> = 12, N<sub>MM</sub> = 11, N<sub>MF</sub> = 11). Human scoring confirmed machine scoring, as well as previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2007</xref>), and showed that the MF interaction led indeed to a sustained increase in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, even though all couples copulated within minutes from the start of the interaction (16.6 ± 15.7 min; mean ±SD), male flies still spent on average 47% of their time actively courting the female (47 ± 16% over 24 hr; 61 ± 25% during the day and 33 ± 12% during the night; mean ±SD). Flies engaged in MM interaction, on the other hand, were not as physically active as flies in MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus not explaining but instead reinforcing the apparent paradox of absence of sleep rebound after interaction with a female.</p><p>To further characterise the consequences of social interaction, we also used a recently established CaLexA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) to compare, <italic>a posteriori,</italic> the neuronal activity in the R2 neurons of the ellipsoid body after 24 hr of social interaction (MM or MF) or 24 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The CaLexA system uses a calcium-responsive transcription factor to drive a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in neurons that undergo prolonged firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masuyama et al., 2012</xref>). Firing rate of R2 neurons was shown to correlate with sleep drive, therefore an increase of CaLexA fluorescence in those neurons can be interpreted as a <italic>bona fide</italic> proxy for neuronal firing, and ultimately, for sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In all three experimental conditions, R2 neurons labelled by the R30G03-GAL4 driver showed a sustained and similar increase in detectable CaLexA-GFP levels compared to mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), suggesting that all three conditions elicit a comparably efficient sleep deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rebound sleep is regulated by species-specific pheromones</title><p>Together, these results show that males who engaged in sexual interaction (a) experience a highly efficient sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and (b) exhibit increases in neuronal markers which typically appear after prolonged wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Why do they show no rebound sleep, then? One possibility is that the memory of their recent sexual encounter could motivate them to keep searching for a mating partner. To test this hypothesis, we subjected two canonical memory mutants to the same experimental paradigm: <italic>dunce</italic> and <italic>rutabaga</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We speculated that if recollection of past experience is responsible for the suppression of rebound, one may expect to see a regular rebound in forgetful flies. This was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). As observed in wild-type flies, learning mutants also experienced a strong degree of sleep deprivation when forced to interact with females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), but they also lacked sleep rebound the day after.

Could either a volatile or non-volatile sex pheromone be left in the tube after the MF interaction, thus contributing to prolonging a signal of sexual arousal? We reckoned one way to approach this hypothesis would be to force an inter-species sexual interaction: a large number of olfactory and gustatory stimuli contributes to the complex courtship ritual between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>) and a convenient way to rule many at once is to force interaction between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males and a close evolutionary relative, such as <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manning, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sturtevant, 1919</xref>). We therefore placed <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wild-type males with <italic>D. simulans</italic> females on interaction day and video-recorded, then scored, their behaviour. In accordance with the classical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schilcher and Dow, 1977</xref>), the inter-species MF interaction resulted in limited copulation (only 2 flies out of the 11 that were visually monitored, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but with some degree of courting mainly during the day (10.8 ± 2.3% over 24 hr but only 2.3 ± 1.4% during ZT 12–24; mean ±SD), followed by sleep deprivation throughout the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, after inter-species MF interaction, male flies finally did show a sleep rebound that was even greater than the rebound observed after MM interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, even though we never observed fighting behaviour between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males and <italic>D. simulans</italic> females, the activity profile, the limited courtship, and the rebound were more reminiscent of MM interaction than MF interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Role of non-volatile pheromones</title><p>The sleep rebound observed after inter-species interaction suggests that a possibly arousing chemical signal left by the female may be responsible for the suppression of rebound after <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> specific MF interaction. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, some pheromones have a certain degree of volatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farine et al., 2012</xref>) and, to test whether an olfactory signal was involved with this process, we measured rebound after social interaction in the anosmic <italic>orco</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>) but found no difference between wild-type and <italic>orco</italic> mutant flies: anosmic males also lacked rebound after MF-induced sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). If there is an arousing signal that anosmic flies can still perceive, could this be a non-volatile pheromone? Females of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> have different cuticular hydrocarbons acting as sex pheromones, with the former bearing predominantly 7,11-Heptacosadiene (7,11-ND) and the latter 7-Tricosene (7-HD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jallon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marcillac et al., 2005</xref>). If olfactory signals are not involved, we reasoned that a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> specific cuticle pheromone could be responsible for the puzzling phenotype. We, therefore, subjected wild-type male flies to MM interaction and then, at the dawn of rebound day, we removed the intruder and inserted in the recording tube a fragment of paper on which we had previously diluted a mix of the species-specific sex pheromones 7,11-ND and 7,11-HD or the solvent alone as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). At last, we found that the mere presence of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> female cuticular pheromones could indeed inhibit sleep rebound after MM interaction, suggesting the pheromones left by the female were sufficient to counteract sleep pressure accumulated at rebound day.</p><p>Male flies sense female non-volatile pheromones through neurons located on the distal tip of their forelegs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starostina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vijayan et al., 2014</xref>). At the beginning of the sexual courtship ritual, male flies tap the female to presumably taste and recognise sex-specific signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spieth, 1974</xref>) that are important for courting to continue. In particular, 7,11-ND and 7,11-HD are sensed by neurons expressing members of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family — Ppk25, Ppk23, and Ppk29 — and male flies mutants in either of these receptors show a decreased level of courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starostina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vijayan et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the attentive reader will have realised that all experiments performed so far rely on a social paradigm for sleep deprivation, therefore introducing a confounding condition: is the mere presence of pheromones truly sufficient to suppress sleep deprivation, or is this somehow connected to the social nature of our behavioural paradigm? After all, we do know that social interaction in flies can have profound effects on their sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>). To test sufficiency of pheromones effect on sleep rebound, we devised two sets of experiments, in which we replaced social-driven sleep deprivation with mechanical sleep deprivation, using the sleep deprivation module of our ethoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Ethoscopes can interact with single flies in a context dependant manner, triggering events upon a real-time analysis of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). We programmed the ethoscopes to rotate a tube whenever the animal inside was detected completely inactive for 60 s. We call this paradigm: dynamic sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). In the first set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), CantonS flies were subjected to dynamic SD for 24 hr, then transferred into their same tube (mock manipulation – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), to a clean and fresh tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), or transferred into a tube where a virgin female was previously housed for five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Sleep rebound after SD was observed in the first two cases, but not in the last, suggesting that pheromones left by the previously hosted female are indeed sufficient to suppress rebound. To ultimately test the sufficiency of sex pheromones, we conducted a second set of experiments in which flies were engineered to express the thermo-activated channel TrpA1 in the pheromone sensing cells expressing the <italic>ppk23-</italic>GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These flies were also subjected to dynamic SD for 24 hr and then the temperature was raised from the inactivating (22°C) to the activating (29°C) condition to synaesthetically stimulate pheromone sensation. Of all experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), lack of rebound after SD was observed only when pheromone sensing cells were thermogenetically stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27445.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Presence of female pheromones is sufficient to suppress sleep rebound after sleep deprivation.</title><p>(<bold>A,C,E</bold>) Sleep profile of Cantons S flies that, immediately after sleep deprivation, were sham transferred into the same tube (<bold>A</bold>), into a clean fresh tube (<bold>C</bold>), or into an empty tube were a virgin female fly was previously housed for 24 hr (E, ‘female tube’).

However, is pheromone the only cue able to do so? After all, suppression of sleep observed in the archetypical experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) appears to be even stronger than the suppression observed after exposing flies to pheromone alone. To address this question, we performed two sets of experiments. In a first set, we subjected flies to the usual social interaction paradigm but, at the end of the interaction day, we removed the intruders and transferred the focal flies not in their own tube as done previously, but instead in a clean, fresh tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Indeed, we found that also when transferred to a clean tube — and therefore in the absence of residual female pheromones in their environment — male flies did show a suppressed rebound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> - compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

As expected, silencing of the pheromone signalling cells after MF interaction did not rescue the sleep rebound phenotype. These findings strongly suggests that suppression of sleep rebound may be due to a general state of sexual arousal, which could be elicited either by the recent sexual experience or by the presence of sex pheromones: the combination of both factors may then act in synergy to manifest the stronger effect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27445.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Perception of female pheromones after social interaction is not required to suppress sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three day sleep profile of CantonS flies, showing baseline day, interaction day and rebound day.

The octopaminergic system is a key regulator of <italic>Drosophila</italic> behaviour, involved among others, with modulation of sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), male-male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>) and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker and Sehgal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crocker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

We use different behavioural paradigms to promote a state of sexual arousal in male flies and show that, in all cases, this results in a suppression of sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. Why is this important?</p><p>In the past 15 years, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has emerged as one of the most promising animal models to study the biological underpinnings of sleep. Many genes that affect sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been identified so far, and many neuronal circuits that can alter sleep when manipulated have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Potdar and Sheeba, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the framework for sleep regulation is stably centred around the two-process model, newly identified neurons modulating sleep are normally classified either as involved with circadian regulation — and thus belonging to process C — or as involved with homeostatic regulation — and thus belonging to process S. Here, we identified an internal state that has the ability to modulate sleep and sleep pressure but arguably does not belong to either process.</p><p>Historically, accessory regulation of sleep has been attributed to neuromodulators and, again, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has proven instrumental in understanding how neuromodulators influence sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffith, 2013</xref>). However, environmental control of sleep is likely to extend beyond neuromodulators and indeed likely to encompass specific sensory and central circuits. Using optogenetics and thermogenetics, it is now possible to activate and silence single neurons or entire circuits looking for functional correlates of behaviour. A proper characterisation of possible outcomes is a necessary step: how can we distinguish if a neuron’s main job is to <italic>directly</italic> regulate sleep pressure or, for instance, to create a state of anxiety, hunger or sexual arousal, that <italic>indirectly</italic> modulates sleep pressure? Paraphrasing a famous assay by Thomas Nagel, we cannot know <italic>what is like to be a fly</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel, 1974</xref>): does exposure to sex pheromones create an inner status of sexual arousal that then counteracts sleep, or does it directly interfere with sleep regulation without any further sexual implication? Manipulation of <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons, either thermogenetically or by the use of chemicals, does not elicit any clear sign of courtship (data not shown) and this is in accordance with previous literature, where it was also shown that activation of <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons alone is not sufficient to induce any sign of sexual behaviour in isolated flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starostina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toda et al., 2012</xref>) and that the right pheromones can act, instead, to potentiate other concomitant sexual stimuli. In our paradigm, activation of P1 neurons also does not show any clear sign of courtship, such as singing through wing extension (data not shown).</p><p>For the sleep field, this work offers a novel experimental paradigm that could be used to dissect, in an ecologically meaningful way, how internal drives or environmental stimuli affect sleep regulation and sleep homeostasis. The interaction between sex and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and more specifically the hierarchy of those two concurrent biological drives, was initially described in the frame of circadian interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2007</xref>) and very recently the neuronal underpinnings were investigated by two independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al. (2017)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al. (2017)</xref> also find a role for the P1 neurons in diverting an animal’s interest from sleep to sex. Our work, however, does not focus on the binary choice between sleep and courtship, but rather uncovers a new role for sexual arousal on modulation of sleep homeostasis, also in absence of a female partner. The concept that sleep homeostasis is not inviolable and can actually be modulated is not a novel one: migratory birds and cetaceans were reported to have the ability to suppress sleep at certain important periods of their lives, namely during migration or immediately after giving birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyamin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rattenborg et al., 2004</xref>); flies, similarly, were shown to lack sleep rebound after starvation-induced sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thimgan et al., 2010</xref>) or after induction of sleep deprivation through specific neuronal clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seidner et al., 2015</xref>). Perhaps even more fitting with our findings is the observation that male pectoral sandpipers, a type of Arctic bird, can forego sleep in favour of courtship during the three weeks time window of female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lesku et al., 2012</xref>). It appears, therefore, that animals are able to balance sleep needs with other, various, biological drives. It would be interesting to see whether these drives act to suppress sleep through a common regulatory circuit. Rebound sleep has always been considered one of the most important features of sleep itself. Together with the reported death by sleep deprivation, it is frequently used in support of the hypothesis that sleep is not an accessory phenomenon but a basic need of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirelli and Tononi, 2008</xref>). Understanding the regulation of rebound sleep, therefore, may be crucial to understanding the very function of sleep. Interestingly, in our paradigm rebound sleep is not postponed, but rather eliminated. Moreover, on rebound day, the sleep architecture of sexually aroused male flies does not seem to be affected: the sleep bout numbers appear to be similar to their mock control counterparts, while the length of sleep bouts is, if anything, slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The last remark that arises from our finding concerns the use of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model for complex brain functions, such as emotions. <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurobiology is experiencing a period of <italic>renaissance</italic>, driven by a Cambrian explosion of genomics, ethomics and connectomics. The field may soon be able to use fruit flies for behavioural models that were once considered to be an exclusive of mammals - or even humans. Past examples of these behaviours are aggression or sleep itself. Studying emotions or internal states in animals is not an easy task, given their subjective nature. However, studying the effects of emotions on sleep may open a window of opportunity, by providing an easily quantifiable output.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were raised under a 12 hr light:12 hr dark (LD) regimen at 25 on standard corn and yeast media.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Leslie C Griffith (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This paper is on an incredibly important subject, the regulation of sleep homeostasis. The authors show that there is suppression of rebound sleep after courtship-based sleep deprivation. The initial data seem strong, but the follow up is less convincing on several fronts detailed in the reviews. At the end of the day there is not a convincing mechanistic story here, just a very interesting observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper shows very nicely that sleep deprivation in males induced by courtship of females does not generate significant rebound sleep. The idea that sleep deprivation and homeostatic processes are inviolable has a lot of traction. Reports of the homeostat apparently being &quot;turned off&quot; (migrating birds, postpartum whales etc.) have been dismissed as idiosyncratic to certain species. This report (and to an extent the accompanying paper) finally give us a tractable model system for investigating how the homeostat can be modulated. I think this is an important paper for that reason alone.</p><p>That said, there are a few problems with the more mechanistic aspects of the paper. In particular:</p><p>1) While the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> A, B, C are very compelling, i.e. the differences in the ZT0-3 window are fairly obvious and the onset of sleep is similar for each condition, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> are not. The time course of sleep is altered, not just the amount in that ZT0-3 window. The effect is also very small. If the authors think that it is residual pheromone that is driving the suppression of rebound, a simple manipulation to try is to move the male to a CLEAN tube after the interaction instead of just removing the female.</p><p>2) There is also a problem with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>. The authors want to make the point that pheromone does not suppress rebound in ppk, but they clearly <italic>do</italic> if you look at a longer time window. By picking ZT0-3 they cut out the main effects which are seen later. I don't think these data are very strong at all.</p><p>3) The ppk-GAL4 experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are also quite problematic. There are several very important controls missing here: namely the GAL4 and UAS lines alone. Temperature has huge effects on the amount and distribution of sleep. Typically daytime sleep is increased and shifted later in the day and nighttime sleep is suppressed. This is basically what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the total amount of sleep in the 29 °C after sleep deprivation is probably the same (data are not shown) but the peak is shifted. The loss of nighttime sleep is quite profound (though more than one would expect with just temperature in WT) but one needs to see the GAL4 and UAS controls and how they behave at 29 °C to interpret any of these effects. As it stands, I don't think the implication of ppk in this effect is very well supported especially in light of the reported failure of activation of the cells.</p><p>4) The focus on ppk (which is not very convincing) has led the authors to ignore some obvious experiments like looking at fru, <italic>Dsx</italic> etc. mutants. If the suppression is sex specific does it require that circuitry?</p><p>5) In the Koh paper they show that sleep deprivation can suppress courtship. Yet PRIOR courtship suppresses rebound. This makes no sense – why would a male stop courting an actual female to sleep if he will suppress sleep just due to pheromone reside? Some resolution should be sought on this issue or it at least should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors aim to discover new environmental factors affecting sleep rebound, after sleep deprivation, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies. The authors have designed an elegant set up to measure the activity (or sleep) in individual flies before, during and after their interaction with another fly (interactor). Their important data concern their measures of the sleep profile of exposed (or mock) flies few hours or a day after this interaction. They have manipulated both the interactor fly (with eventual addition of molecules potentially acting as pheromones) and/or the focal male fly by targeted alteration of several properties of his nervous system (associative memory, olfaction, perception of cuticular hydrocarbons).</p><p>Although this paper contains a large series of observations, I was not completely convinced by the main conclusions reached by the authors based on the interpretation of the data shown. While they used many state-of-the art genetical tools, I found that the major question and some crucial experiments were missing. Also, some of the statistics seem to be inappropriate.</p><p>I have two major concerns:</p><p>1) I do not think that the authors showed that female predominant cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs; 7, 11-heptacosadiene and nonacosadiene) induced a clear effect on sleep rebound for at least two reasons:</p><p>Sleep rebound depends on the activity of the focal male fly engaged with the interactor fly. Therefore, with a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> male or a <italic>D. simulans</italic> female interactor (both flies produce similar CHCs that inhibit <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> male courtship) the focal male will not show an important activity and will be very quickly inhibited by predominant CHCs produced by these interactor flies. This may explain why he shows higher sleep activity during the beginning (ZT0-3) of the rebound day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Differently, with a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> female the activity of the focal male will be higher than with the two latter interactor flies making possible that he will continue to be excited few hours after the end of interaction (ZT0-3; but however not during the complete day).</p><p>The effect shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> is pivotal relatively to the main conclusions of this paper. However, the statistics do not seem to be valid, at least with the elements provided in the stats supplementary files. In the subsection “Statistical analysis and data reproducibility”, the authors wrote &quot;statistical analysis consisted of pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test with P value adjustment for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)&quot;. However, I believe that while the Wilcoxon test is appropriate to compare matched data, here the sets of data compared two by two are independent. For such comparison, a Mann-Whitney test seems more suitable. This therefore casts doubt on the significance (or non-significance) of the two left cyan box plot bars shown to compare the effect induced by the vehicle control vs. the two 7,11-dienes in CantonS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and ppk23 mutant males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>A Kruskall-Wallis test followed by a post-comparison between pairs of data set (but only in case of a significant difference for the K-W test) would be a reliable complement to test each data set with all the other data sets. This comment also applies for other Figure items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C, D</xref>).</p><p>2) A more reliable manner to test the effect of female CHCs would consist to use females genetically depleted for the production of these substances. The authors may find plenty of these genotypes after a careful lecture of the literature. Then, after using CHCs depleted females then could add female CHCs on these females, after a mechanical transfer of CHCs of control females, and decipher whether these compounds really affect sleep rebound. Only this type of experiment would provide a decisive experiment to state whether (or not) female 7,11-dienes are involved in the sleep rebound effect. At the moment, any other effect could cause this difference (if significant?) including the difference of activity (see the first point above).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors study the effect of environmental factors on sleep. Sleep loss is induced by pairing a male fly with either a male or a female intruder. The first pairing results in partial sleep loss for the original inhabitant while the presence of a female intruder keeps him up all night. The authors note that male-male paired flies show increased rebound sleep after partial sleep deprivation while male-female paired flies show no rebound sleep, even though they'd been awake for 24 hours. The authors subsequently show that pheromone sensing circuits underlie this decrease in rebound sleep. While these results are interesting, there remain important experiments and clarifications to substantiate the conclusions.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) Do female pheromones affect sleep architecture in isolated males?</p><p>2) Rebound sleep can take many forms: increased total sleep is what the authors look at. However, sleep deprivation also decreases brief awakenings, suggesting deeper sleep (Huber, 2004). Likewise, sleep deprivation increases arousal thresholds, resulting in reduced responsiveness to mechanical stimulation (van Alphen, 2013; Faville 2015). Have the authors looked at changes in sleep architecture (for example, increased bout length and decreased bout number or altered arousal thresholds) after social interactions?</p><p>3) There are other examples where sleep deprivation doesn't result in rebound sleep – see Paul Shaw's work on the lack of rebound sleep after starvation (Thimgan, 2010) and William Joiner's work on rebound (Seidner, 2015) which showed that homeostatic recovery time can be uncoupled from prior wake time. Seidner et al. also show that many types of neurons can drive wake, but only a few neurons drive sleep homeostasis and that specifically activating cholinergic neurons creates sleep loss followed by strong rebound sleep, activating dopaminergic circuitry causes strong sleep loss that is not followed by rebound and that activating octopaminergic circuitry decreases sleep but also decreases sleep homeostasis (i.e. negative rebound). It would strengthen the paper if the authors discuss their own work in the light of these established findings.</p><p>4) The paper relies heavily on the use of 'ethoscopes' to quantify behavior but this method is not properly validated. Referring to an 'in preparation' manuscript is not sufficient for reviewers to comment on the validity of this method.</p><p>5) Please show the TrpA1 activation data of ppk23 neurons rather than omitting it.</p><p>6) How are the intruder males or females removed? Is it possible that this manipulation stresses the original inhabitant and overrides its rebound sleep?</p><p>7) The R2 CaLexa data suggest that flies are still sleep deprived. Would pheromone exposure alone reduce CaLexA activity signals in these neurons thus reducing homeostatic sleep drive?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> one cannot exclude the possibility that observed effects are due to temperature rather than Gal4/Shi. The authors should include Gal4/+ and UASshi/+ controls to exclude this possibility. Also, why is rebound only quantified for the first three hours? It seems that ppk25 silencing delays rebound, as the yellow curve is substantially shifted to the right, suggesting that this manipulation delays rebound sleep onset, rather than cancel it out.</p><p>9) Materials and methods section, “bootstrap re-sampling with 5000 replicates, was performed in order to generate 95% confidence interval”. Can the authors comment on this procedure and provide either references or validation of this approach?</p><p>10) The claim that 'sleep pressure after sleep deprivation can be counteracted by the mere presence of aphrodisiac pheromones' is not fully supported by the data. A direct way of showing this would be to mechanically sleep deprive flies, then present them with pheromones at the onset of rebound sleep and compare rebound sleep amount to vehicle-only controls.</p><p>11) Also, if truly counteracting sleep pressure shouldn't the pheromone suppress CaLexA changes in R2? Are the pheromones essentially acting as a sex-specific stimulant?</p><p>12) Does pheromone application cancel out rebound sleep or does it delay it? I.e. what happens when the pheromone-saturated paper is removed? Do flies then show an even stronger rebound sleep?</p><p>Figure comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> – Why is rebound sleep only quantified in the first 3 hours? During that period, there is no difference in total sleep between mock and MF (peach) flies. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> suggests that sleep is reduced in MF flies compared to mock flies in the 1-6 (and possibly the 1-12 hour) range.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – the color coding is unclear, making it hard to distinguish between the different behaviors. Please use a larger range of the color palette.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> what does sleep data look like for undisturbed flies?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27445.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major thing that all reviewers agreed needed revision is the focus on &quot;process E&quot;.

In particular, the very experiment suggested by the reviewer is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and goes along with two new experiments in which we modulate sexual arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). At the same time, we reinforced the observation that simple exposure to pheromones is sufficient to suppress sleep rebound, performing a new series of experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and 5.

We believe this presentation better highlights the extent of the effect itself. In ppk23-/-, the presence of pheromone does not suppress rebound in the ZT0-3 window (compare peach with blue in 3B and light-purple to blue in 3C). However, the effect is complicated by the fact that the vehicle itself appear to slightly increase rebound (3A and 3C). On top of this, the <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant experiment is also complicated by the fact that <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant male flies have a reduce courtship to start with. We agree with the reviewer that this this experiment taken alone may at best be suggestive, but definitely not conclusive.

We show that tube change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or TrpA1 activation of ppk23-GAL4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are sufficient to suppress rebound after mechanical sleep deprivation – thus completely removing social interaction from the equation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The ppk-GAL4 experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are also quite problematic. There are several very important controls missing here: namely the GAL4 and UAS lines alone. Temperature has huge effects on the amount and distribution of sleep. Typically daytime sleep is increased and shifted later in the day and nighttime sleep is suppressed. This is basically what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the total amount of sleep in the 29 °C after sleep deprivation is probably the same (data are not shown) but the peak is shifted. The loss of nighttime sleep is quite profound (though more than one would expect with just temperature in WT) but one needs to see the GAL4 and UAS controls and how they behave at 29 °C to interpret any of these effects. As it stands, I don't think the implication of ppk in this effect is very well supported especially in light of the reported failure of activation of the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer was absolutely right. We repeated all those experiments using different thermogenetic lines, after proper clean up by backcrossing several generations and found that all of the shiTS results were indeed artefacts. The effect of temperature was not present on the GAL4 parental line, but it was very strong in the uas-shiTS control line.</p><p>We now use uas-TrpA1 in combination with the ppk23 GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and in combination with the split P1-GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In both cases, we include all parental controls and all temperature controls and all lines were backcrossed against <italic>w1118</italic>for five generations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The focus on ppk (which is not very convincing) has led the authors to ignore some obvious experiments like looking at fru, Dsx etc. mutants. If the suppression is sex specific does it require that circuitry?</p></disp-quote><p>We now explore the <italic>fru</italic> pathway by using the P1-GAL4 line as a way to induce sexual arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We also use two previously described mutants in the tyrosine-tyramine-octopamine pathway to manipulate sexual arousal and place our results in the bigger picture of the sex literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Koh paper they show that sleep deprivation can suppress courtship. Yet PRIOR courtship suppresses rebound. This makes no sense – why would a male stop courting an actual female to sleep if he will suppress sleep just due to pheromone reside? Some resolution should be sought on this issue or it at least should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult for me to comment on this issue at this stage, not having read the Koh paper. However, we manually scored and annotated behaviour of all our paradigmatic interactions with a resolution of 60 seconds, and we clearly see an extremely resilient courtship activity in wild type males, with several instances of repeated copulation (in one case, one male copulates three times in 24 hours with the same female partner). We believe this unprecedented level of sexual activity may partly be due to the fact that flies are housed in small glass tubes, which probably increase their sensory stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Although this paper contains a large series of observations, I was not completely convinced by the main conclusions reached by the authors based on the interpretation of the data shown. While they used many state-of-the art genetical tools, I found that the major question and some crucial experiments were missing. Also, some of the statistics seem to be inappropriate.</p><p>I have two major concerns:</p><p>1) I do not think that the authors showed that female predominant cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs; 7, 11-heptacosadiene and nonacosadiene) induced a clear effect on sleep rebound for at least two reasons:</p><p>Sleep rebound depends on the activity of the focal male fly engaged with the interactor fly. Therefore, with a D. melanogaster male or a D. simulans female interactor (both flies produce similar CHCs that inhibit D. melanogaster male courtship) the focal male will not show an important activity and will be very quickly inhibited by predominant CHCs produced by these interactor flies. This may explain why he shows higher sleep activity during the beginning (ZT0-3) of the rebound day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Differently, with a D. melanogaster female the activity of the focal male will be higher than with the two latter interactor flies making possible that he will continue to be excited few hours after the end of interaction (ZT0-3; but however not during the complete day).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the previous conclusions were drawn on an insufficient amount of findings. We now reinforce the role of pheromones through a novel series of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and expand it through a novel line of hypothesis and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The manuscript has changed considerably thanks to suggestions from the reviewers. Regarding the <italic>D. Simulans</italic> experiment: although we absolutely agree that it is not a conclusive experiment on its own, we still believe it can be used as piece of the puzzle. We now show the behavioural annotation of the <italic>D. melanogaster + D. simulans</italic> MF interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also show the annotated high-definition video (Supplementary Video S4). From the behavioural profile it is clear that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> does show some courtship activity, mainly in the day, but in general the <italic>D. simulans</italic> interaction is more similar to MM interaction that MF. We discuss this in the manuscript too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> is pivotal relatively to the main conclusions of this paper. However, the statistics do not seem to be valid, at least with the elements provided in the stats supplementary files. In the subsection “Statistical analysis and data reproducibility”, the authors wrote &quot;statistical analysis consisted of pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test with P value adjustment for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)&quot;. However, I believe that while the Wilcoxon test is appropriate to compare matched data, here the sets of data compared two by two are independent. For such comparison, a Mann-Whitney test seems more suitable. This therefore casts doubt on the significance (or non-significance) of the two left cyan box plot bars shown to compare the effect induced by the vehicle control vs. the two 7,11-dienes in CantonS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and ppk23 mutant males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>A Kruskall-Wallis test followed by a post-comparison between pairs of data set (but only in case of a significant difference for the K-W test) would be a reliable complement to test each data set with all the other data sets. This comment also applies for other Figure items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C, D</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is conceptually flawless but it highlights a clear misunderstanding: we actually already do use the statistical test suggested by reviewer #2! I believe the confusion springs from the fact that the reviewer believes we used the &quot;Wilcoxon test&quot; (more accurately known as &quot;Wilcoxon signed-rank test&quot;), which is for paired data, while instead we used the &quot;Wilcoxon rank sum test&quot; (aka &quot;Mann-Whitney U test&quot;), which is for two-sample unpaired data. Therefore, we are in fact in full agreement with reviewer #2. Unfortunately, there are many aliases for the same test in the literature (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, Mann–Whitney U test or Mann– Whitney–Wilcoxon test) and we had adopted to use the default name in the statistical package “R”, which is what we used for all data analysis. We now unambiguously clarified our description by stating &quot;statistical analysis consisted of pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test (i.e. Mann–Whitney U test) with P value adjustment for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more reliable manner to test the effect of female CHCs would consist to use females genetically depleted for the production of these substances. The authors may find plenty of these genotypes after a careful lecture of the literature. Then, after using CHCs depleted females then could add female CHCs on these females, after a mechanical transfer of CHCs of control females, and decipher whether these compounds really affect sleep rebound. Only this type of experiment would provide a decisive experiment to state whether (or not) female 7,11-dienes are involved in the sleep rebound effect. At the moment, any other effect could cause this difference (if significant?) including the difference of activity (see the first point above).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment would work too. However, having now moved the focus of the manuscript away from pheromones, we were satisfied by the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and 5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this paper, the authors study the effect of environmental factors on sleep. Sleep loss is induced by pairing a male fly with either a male or a female intruder. The first pairing results in partial sleep loss for the original inhabitant while the presence of a female intruder keeps him up all night. The authors note that male-male paired flies show increased rebound sleep after partial sleep deprivation while male-female paired flies show no rebound sleep, even though they'd been awake for 24 hours. The authors subsequently show that pheromone sensing circuits underlie this decrease in rebound sleep. While these results are interesting, there remain important experiments and clarifications to substantiate the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Comments:</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Do female pheromones affect sleep architecture in isolated males?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the result of this experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and the answer is that no, it does not seem to have an effect (gray line to be compared to gray line in C, E: the difference between gray line in G and C is not significant (P=0.2) and neither is the one between 4G and 4E (P=0.09)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Rebound sleep can take many forms: increased total sleep is what the authors look at. However, sleep deprivation also decreases brief awakenings, suggesting deeper sleep (Huber, 2004). Likewise, sleep deprivation increases arousal thresholds, resulting in reduced responsiveness to mechanical stimulation (van Alphen, 2013; Faville 2015). Have the authors looked at changes in sleep architecture (for example, increased bout length and decreased bout number or altered arousal thresholds) after social interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>We did look at number of bouts, length of bouts, and latency to first sleep episode in the ZT0-3 interval and in the ZT0-6 interval. We have not seen anything relevant. In particular, number and duration of bouts follow closely the measurement of sleep and it is different between MM and Mock but not different between MF and Mock. We now mention this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are other examples where sleep deprivation doesn't result in rebound sleep – see Paul Shaw's work on the lack of rebound sleep after starvation (Thimgan, 2010) and William Joiner's work on rebound (Seidner, 2015) which showed that homeostatic recovery time can be uncoupled from prior wake time. Seidner et al. also show that many types of neurons can drive wake, but only a few neurons drive sleep homeostasis and that specifically activating cholinergic neurons creates sleep loss followed by strong rebound sleep, activating dopaminergic circuitry causes strong sleep loss that is not followed by rebound and that activating octopaminergic circuitry decreases sleep but also decreases sleep homeostasis (i.e. negative rebound). It would strengthen the paper if the authors discuss their own work in the light of these established findings.</p></disp-quote><p>This a good suggestion. We have added a section in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The paper relies heavily on the use of 'ethoscopes' to quantify behavior but this method is not properly validated. Referring to an 'in preparation' manuscript is not sufficient for reviewers to comment on the validity of this method.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has another valid point. We now uploaded the ethoscope manuscript on biorxiv <underline>http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/02/113647</underline> and we reference that version throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please show the TrpA1 activation data of ppk23 neurons rather than omitting it.</p></disp-quote><p>TrpA1 activation of <italic>ppk23</italic> neurons is now the bulk of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. All thermogenetic experiments were repeated using lines backcrossed 5 times to <italic>w1118</italic>.

The shi<sup>TS</sup> result was an artefact of non-backcrossed lines and we have now omitted that part completely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How are the intruder males or females removed? Is it possible that this manipulation stresses the original inhabitant and overrides its rebound sleep?</p></disp-quote><p>Animals are removed by tipping the intruder into another tube. It is possible that the procedure is somehow stressful but the MM combination really controls for that, because it is done in the very same way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The R2 CaLexa data suggest that flies are still sleep deprived. Would pheromone exposure alone reduce CaLexA activity signals in these neurons thus reducing homeostatic sleep drive?</p></disp-quote><p>CaLexa experiment suggests that MM and MF and MechanicalSD all show the same amount of CaLexA signal. We do not know what this truly means because we do not know enough about the molecular underpinning of this experiment. I think the reviewer is asking what happens at ZT3 in all conditions, which is a very good question. The answer is: we do not know and we cannot really address this issue using CaLexA because of the nature of the GFP based assay: CaLexA can be used to measure build up but not fading out. How sleep pressure dissipates in MF flies is a total new adventure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> one cannot exclude the possibility that observed effects are due to temperature rather than Gal4/Shi. The authors should include Gal4/+ and UASshi/+ controls to exclude this possibility. Also, why is rebound only quantified for the first three hours? It seems that ppk25 silencing delays rebound, as the yellow curve is substantially shifted to the right, suggesting that this manipulation delays rebound sleep onset, rather than cancel it out.</p></disp-quote><p>That <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3</xref> does not exist anymore, but all thermogenetics experiments now shown in the paper have all the parental and temperature control conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Materials and methods section, “bootstrap re-sampling with 5000 replicates, was performed in order to generate 95% confidence interval”.

We now added this reference to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The claim that 'sleep pressure after sleep deprivation can be counteracted by the mere presence of aphrodisiac pheromones' is not fully supported by the data. A direct way of showing this would be to mechanically sleep deprive flies, then present them with pheromones at the onset of rebound sleep and compare rebound sleep amount to vehicle-only controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely right. We now did this and it is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Also, if truly counteracting sleep pressure shouldn't the pheromone suppress CaLexA changes in R2? Are the pheromones essentially acting as a sex-specific stimulant?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point about the nature of the molecular correlates of sleep pressure. The honest answer is that we do not know what to hypothesise. A correct answer to this question would require some knowledge of what the CaLexA changes in R2 ultimately mean. As I mentioned before, understanding how sleep pressure dissipates without rebound is a fantastic question that goes well beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Does pheromone application cancel out rebound sleep or does it delay it? I.e. what happens when the pheromone-saturated paper is removed? Do flies then show an even stronger rebound sleep?</p></disp-quote><p>We looked at sleep for 48 hours after interaction and we never found any sign of rebound. It looks like pheromone application does cancel rebound indeed.

We now briefly discuss this synergy in the manuscript. We prefer not to overload the paper with stats for the ZT0-6 window – it would then prompt a whole series of other measurements (e.g. 0-12, 12-24, 0-24, etc.) which are as arbitrary but also, in our opinion, less biologically relevant given the rebound is always best expected in the ZT0-3 window. One aspect to keep in mind is that the use of bootstrap c.i. in ethograms implies that when two lines do not overlap, they may be considered statistically significant in their difference.
