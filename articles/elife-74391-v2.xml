Dyslipidemia is associated with both excessive deposition of triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets (LDs) and lipotoxicity. Yet, it is unclear how these two effects correlate with each other in the kidney and how they are influenced by dietary patterns. By using a diabetes mouse model, we find here that high-fat diet enriched in the monounsaturated oleic acid (OA) caused more lipid storage in LDs in renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs) but less tubular damage than a corresponding butter diet with the saturated palmitic acid (PA). This effect was particularly evident in S2/S3 but not S1 segments of the proximal tubule. Combining transcriptomics, lipidomics, and functional studies, we identify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as the main cause of PA-induced PTC injury. Mechanistically, ER stress is caused by elevated levels of saturated TAG precursors, reduced LD formation, and, consequently, higher membrane order in the ER. Simultaneous addition of OA rescues the cytotoxic effects by normalizing membrane order and increasing both TAG and LD formation. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of monounsaturated fatty acids for the dietary management of DKD by preventing lipid bilayer stress in the ER and promoting TAG and LD formation in PTCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diabetic nephropathy</kwd><kwd>proximal tubules</kwd><kwd>lipotoxicity</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>membrane order</kwd><kwd>lipid bilayer stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jiayi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011747</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0052457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Suresh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG SI1303/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simons</surname><given-names>Matias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>804474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grand</surname><given-names>Kelli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research Kidney Control of Homeostasis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_189102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lienkamp</surname><given-names>Soeren S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF20170938629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-Martí</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Monounsaturated fatty acids protect against DKD by enhancing membrane fluidity and decreasing ER lipid bilayer stress in renal proximal tubules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD; or diabetic nephropathy) is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus defined as diabetes with albuminuria or an impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or both. It is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or transplantation. Despite improved management of diabetes, the number of DKD patients continues to rise, causing an enormous health and economic burden worldwide. Classical histopathological features of DKD are glomerular changes such as podocyte hypertrophy and loss, glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, and Kimmelstiel–Wilson nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oshima et al., 2021</xref>). Often overlooked are the tubulointerstitial alterations, including peritubular fibrosis, that contribute to or even drive DKD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonventre, 2012</xref>). The recent success of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors highlights the proximal tubule cell (PTC) as an important target in DKD therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeFronzo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Constituting more than half of renal mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2018</xref>), PTCs reabsorb most of the solutes and proteins filtered by the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chevalier, 2016</xref>). While solute transport is carried out by dedicated transporters using ion gradients established by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, protein uptake occurs via an endocytic machinery with low cargo specificity and unusually high capacity. The energy for both tasks is almost exclusively provided by mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bobulescu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). The fatty acids are taken up from the blood side or by albumin that is partially filtered by the glomerulus and delivers bound fatty acids from the luminal side to the PTCs. Accordingly, in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) or in individuals with type 2 diabetes, lipids accumulate predominantly in PTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herman-Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rampanelli et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that these cells may be equipped with a high capacity to take up and store lipids. Lipid overabundance, however, can lead to ‘lipotoxicity,’ which is a main driver of kidney disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbate et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bobulescu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moorhead et al., 1982</xref>). This is particularly true in DKD, where albuminuria combined with dyslipidemia leads to a tubular overload of albumin-bound fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonventre, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeni et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Within cells, lipid overabundance leads to enhanced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and lipid droplet (LD) formation. This process occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where three fatty acids are consecutively added via esterification to the glycerol backbone beginning with <italic>sn</italic>-glycerol-3-phosphate. Once enough TAGs (and cholesterol esters) have been deposited between the ER lipid bilayer leaflets, LDs bud into the cytoplasm enwrapped by a phospholipid monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilfling et al., 2014</xref>). In adipocytes, which are specialized in lipid storage, this is a physiological process. In other cell types, excessive LD formation is often a sign of impaired cellular homeostasis. A well-known example is hepatic steatosis that is featured by increased lipid storage in LDs of hepatocytes and often progresses towards liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seebacher et al., 2020</xref>). Also in type 2 diabetes, lipid accumulation is a common feature in many organs contributing to insulin resistance. However, as free fatty acids (in particular, saturated ones) can activate pro-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2006</xref>) or generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon excessive mitochondrial ß-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gehrmann et al., 2015</xref>), storing fatty acids in LDs could also prevent damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Listenberger et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, it has been shown in neural stem cells that LDs can sequester polyunsaturated acyl chains, protecting them from the oxidative chain reactions that generate toxic peroxidated species and ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dierge et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, sequestering free fatty acids by LDs has been shown to protect mitochondrial function during starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, LDs can be damaging or protective depending on the tissue context. In the context of DKD, however, there is only limited knowledge of the role of TAG and LD formation.</p><p>In this study, we treated hyperglycemic mice with two different HFDs, one enriched in butter (containing high amounts of palmitic acid [PA]) and one enriched in olive oil (containing high amounts of oleic acid [OA]). While the butter diet caused more tubular damage and renal fibrosis than the olive oil, less lipid accumulation was observed in the renal proximal tubules. The tubular damage was more pronounced in PTCs showing less LDs. On a wider level, the integration of lipidomic, transcriptomic, and functional studies revealed that PA induced rapid cytotoxicity by increasing the relative proportion of disaturated TAG precursors in cellular membranes. This leads to ER stress, which can be fully suppressed by co-incubating with OA. This protective effect is tightly connected with the formation of unsaturated phospholipids and the formation of LD that serve as a lipid reservoir to protect against lipid bilayer stress in the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An HFD enriched in saturated fatty acids causes tubular LD accumulation and kidney damage in diabetic mice</title><p>We wanted to study the effect of overloading PTCs with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (SFA) for DKD progression in mice. For this, we combined a low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) regimen, which destroys β-pancreatic islets and produces insulin deficiency, with two types of HFD enriched in SFA and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Both HFDs contained 20 kcal% of protein, 35 kcal% of carbohydrates, and 45 kcal% of fat, whereas the control diet contained 24 kcal% of protein, 58 kcal% of carbohydrates, and 18 kcal% of fat. The source of fat was butter for the SFA-HFD, olive oil for the MUFA-HFD, and the standard soybean oil for the control diet (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The different diets were started at 7 weeks of age, and mice were followed for 20 weeks in four groups: while mice on control diet, SFA-HFD and MUFA-HFD received five consecutive daily injections of STZ (50 mg/kg) at 11 weeks of age, one group of mice on control diet was injected with the vehicle. Nonfasting hyperglycemia became apparent 4 weeks after STZ injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, STZ-injected mice presented polyphagia and polydipsia as a sign of increased glucosuria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). In addition, they showed increased levels of albumin in the urine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p><p>All three STZ-injected groups showed impaired weight gain over the entire experiment compared to vehicle-injected mice. Among the STZ-injected groups, no differences in body weight were observed except for the last two weeks when the mice fed a control diet decreased weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All STZ-injected mice had an extreme loss of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), with some mice losing all their eWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Concomitantly, plasma TAGs levels were increased in diabetic mice fed with MUFA-HFD and SFA-HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Liver weight was only increased in mice fed with the two HFDs while all diabetic groups showed increased kidney weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O (ORO) staining to determine whether the increase in kidney weight was due to ectopic fat deposition. Diabetic mice on both HFDs massively accumulated LDs in the kidney cortex. In the MUFA-HFD group, the percentage of kidney cortex stained with ORO was higher than in the SFA-HFD group. Individual LDs could be seen in tubules but not in glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To determine what tubular segments accumulated the lipids, LDs were labeled using BODIPY, a neutral lipid staining dye, while PTC segments were marked with either megalin for all three PTC segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) or SGLT2 for only the S1 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vallon et al., 2011</xref>).

First, iRECs were treated with increasing concentrations of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) to determine the toxicity of albumin itself. However, none of the concentrations of BSA induced any cytotoxicity as measured by the uptake of Cytotox dye using the IncuCyte Live-Cell analysis system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With this approach, we assessed the cytotoxicity in iRECs treated with PA, OA, and combinations of both.

As we were particularly interested in biological processes that were up- or downregulated by the addition of PA and reverted to normal levels when cells were co-incubated with OA, we clustered genes accordingly and applied Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Cluster 1, which included genes upregulated by PA and normalized by OA co-treatment, proved to be strongly enriched in genes involved in oxidative stress, ER stress, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

We obtained TFs whose predicted target genes associated with one or more of the five different conditions (PA vs. control, PA vs. PA/OA, PA/OA vs. control, OA vs. control, OA vs. PA/OA). Interestingly, several of the identified TFs whose activities were upregulated by PA and downregulated by OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) have known roles in lipid metabolism (e.g., HNF4A, SREBF1) and ER stress (e.g., ATF4, ATF6). By contrast, several TFs whose activities were regulated in the opposite way function in cell cycle control (e.g., E2F4, MYC, FOXM1).

To study the oxidative stress response, we used dihydroethidium (DHE) to measure the generation of ROS. Superoxide levels were increased by PA treatment in a dose-dependent manner. When OA was added together with PA, the DHE staining returned to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Next, we wondered whether the protective effect of OA on ROS formation was due to changes in mitochondrial activity. Using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), which is an indicator of mitochondrial membrane polarization, PA was found to increase mitochondrial activity while OA reduced it. The combination of PA with OA returned mitochondrial activity to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). As β-oxidation requires the import of fatty acids into the mitochondria by CPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miguel et al., 2021</xref>), which was upregulated by PA and OA, we used the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir that was previously shown to decrease mitochondrial β-oxidation in iRECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marchesin et al., 2019</xref>).

For functional validation, we first performed immunocytochemistry against the autophagy markers LC3 and p62. PA treatment mildly induced the formation of LC3 puncta as well as large perinuclear structures positive for p62, all of which were cleared by the addition of OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In order to investigate the autophagic flux, we analyzed p62 and LC3 I/II protein levels of cells treated with PA by immunoblotting. While there was no significant change in LC3I/II levels between BSA and BSA-PA-treated cells, p62 was clearly increased in BSA-PA-treated cells. The addition of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 caused an increase in LC3I/II and an additional increase in p62, which was stronger in PA-treated cells vs. control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This suggests that the accumulation of p62 occurs in the presence of normal autophagic flux, possibly because the amount of misfolded proteins due to ER stress exceeds the autophagic clearance capacity. However, due to the presence of LC3 puncta and the transcriptional regulation of autophagy in PA-treated cells, it cannot be fully excluded that PA also affects the autophagic process itself.</p><p>Altogether, the data demonstrate that ER stress (and p62 accumulation as a consequence thereof) can be induced by PA.

Accordingly, ROS and ER stress markers were increased upon DGAT inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Interestingly, the protective effect of OA concerning cytotoxicity and ER stress was unaltered in the presence of the DGAT inhibitors, suggesting that OA co-treatment can balance the saturation level of ER phospholipids even if TAG formation is blocked. Accordingly, our lipidomics data show that OA co-treatment can reduce disaturated DAG levels (especially DAG 16:0_16:0 and DAG 16:0_18:0) and the ratio between disaturated and monounsaturated DAG compared to PA alone no matter if DGATs are inhibited or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). With regard to ROS formation, the protective effect of OA was attenuated but did not reach statistical significance. Our results thus suggest that blocking TAG and LD formation, respectively, through DGAT inhibition aggravates PA-induced cell death and ER stress because saturated TAG precursors accumulate in the ER membrane. In this situation, OA treatment can still rescue the lipotoxic effects by influencing DAG composition.</p><p>As LDs are dynamic organelles able to fine-tune the release of fatty acids in a lipolysis and re-esterification cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitraju et al., 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that MUFAs that are already stored in LDs could be released and help to channel PA towards TAG synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated the cells with OA 0.5 mM with or without DGAT inhibitors and after washout, we challenged them with PA. Pretreatment with OA reduced PA-mediated cytotoxicity. When TAG synthesis was inhibited through DGAT inhibition, OA pretreatment did not show any effect on PA-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that LDs rich in OA could protect from PA lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). To study the underlying mechanism, we used the ATGL inhibitor atglistatin to block the lipolytic release of fatty acids from LDs. Treatment with atglistatin in normal and starved conditions caused an increase in cell area occupied by LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>). In order to test whether the release of fatty acids from LDs protects against PA-induced cytotoxicity, we pretreated cells with OA and exposed them to PA with and without the ATGL inhibitor. ATGL inhibition caused a significant increase in PA-induced cytotoxicity when compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Our results, therefore, suggest that LDs serve as a reservoir of MUFAs that can be released via lipolysis to buffer an overload of SFAs. MUFAs released from LDs could then facilitate the incorporation of SFAs into TAGs or decrease the packing density of ER membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>An HFD enriched in SFA increases DAG saturation and induces injury in tubules without LDs</title><p>Our cell culture experiments pointed towards disturbances in TAG synthesis as a key mechanism driving lipotoxicity in DKD.

Vice versa, in the MUFA-HFD mice there were more LD-positive cells that in turn were mostly KIM-1-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>).

So far only limited data is available on the importance of monounsaturated fat in the dietary management of DKD in humans. While one study showed no protective effect of a Mediterranean diet compared to a low-fat control diet with regard to the DKD incidence in type 2 diabetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>), two studies demonstrated renoprotective effects with adherence to Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Mediterranean diets in cohorts of diabetic women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jayedi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In our mouse model, in which STZ-induced hyperglycemia was combined with an HFD, we found a depletion of the white adipose tissue that was accompanied by a significant weight gain in liver and kidney. Accordingly, the circulating lipids were increased, and in the kidney, lipid deposition was found in the tubular cells of the cortex. This suggests that, in addition to increased dietary fat intake, lipolysis in white adipose tissue might have contributed to renal fat accumulation. Strikingly, lipid deposition was primarily observed in the straight S2/S3 PTC segments while omitting glomeruli, S1 PTC segments, and distal tubules. This lipid pattern could be explained by differences in fat uptake between the different nephron segments. As the activity of the main albumin receptor cubilin is known to be restricted to the S1 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2020</xref>), other uptake pathways may account for lipid uptake in S2/S3. Uptake pathways that we tested are the apical FATP2 and the basolateral CD36 fatty acid transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Susztak et al., 2005</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, our expression analysis showed strong downregulation of both genes in all three mice groups treated with STZ compared to the control group, which may argue against an important role for them in DKD. Alternatively, it was recently shown that the scavenger receptor KIM-1 mediates apical albumin-PA uptake in PTCs to promote DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). However, as we detected an inverse correlation between KIM-1 expression and LDs, it seems at least unlikely that KIM-1 can promote lipid storage. Therefore, it is more conceivable that the preferential lipid accumulation in S2/S3 is caused by differences in lipid metabolism. Indeed, it is known that PTCs in the straight segments contain less mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maunsbach, 1966</xref>), possibly resulting in LD build-up due to decreased β-oxidation. Also, restricted expression of SCD1 to the straight S2/S3 segments could explain the lipid deposition pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Upon cell entry, the intracellular fate and toxicity of the fatty acids clearly depended on the saturation of the acyl chain. While lipid storage in LDs was stronger in the MUFA-HFD-treated mice than in SFA-HFD-treated mice, tubular damage was reduced. This argues for a protective role of the MUFA diet in the tubules, which was corroborated by our findings that the cells showing KIM-1 expression were mostly devoid of LDs. However, as our mouse experiment was ended already 20 weeks after introducing the HFD, it would be interesting to study more long-term effects on renal function.</p><p>Using our cell culture model, we identified both mitochondrial and ER homeostasis as the main determinants of cell viability during PA-induced lipotoxic stress. The functional link between the two organelles was revealed by the finding that the inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake by etomoxir worsened ER stress and cytotoxicity induced by PA. Free SFAs that cannot be oxidized in mitochondria were found to be incorporated into TAG precursors causing ER lipid bilayer stress. This could be suppressed by the addition of OA that promoted TAG and LD formation, which was also reflected by a reduction of free fatty acids by OA.</p><p>Due to the high degree of unsaturated lipids, the ER membrane is normally one of the most fluid membranes in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barelli and Antonny, 2016</xref>). Using Laurdan imaging, the ER membrane showed higher packing density upon PA treatment, most likely due to the accumulation of disaturated TAG precursors, in particular DAGs. This is in agreement with previous findings that disaturated DAGs are a poor substrate for DGAT activity and that the inhibition of GPAT enzymes that catalyze the first addition of fatty acids to the glycerol backbone is a promising approach for preventing lipotoxic cell injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piccolis et al., 2019</xref>). For diabetic kidneys, this might be particularly important as DAGs have been implicated in insulin resistance due to their role in activating protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). How disaturated DAGs cause ER stress is not fully understood, but studies have shown that this likely involves PERK and IRE1-induced sensing of membrane lipid saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Volmer et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the altered ER membrane environment may lead to the misfolding of transmembrane proteins and subsequent induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Finally, the impairment of LD formation by PA may lower the capacity to buffer the lipotoxic stress in the ER.</p><p>The main finding of our study is that all observed PA-induced cytotoxic effects could be suppressed by adding OA. OA increased DGAT-mediated TAG, which in turn facilitated LD formation. Both in cell culture and in the mouse kidneys, LD formation correlates positively with the protective effects of MUFAs and negatively with cell damage. Yet, LD formation was also shown to be dispensable for OA-mediated rescue effects in PA-induced stress because OA can reduce disaturated DAGs even in the presence of DGAT inhibitors. Only when cells were pretreated with OA, then OA-mediated rescue effects were DGAT-dependent, suggesting that the preexistence of LDs is relevant for these rescue effects and/or that the beneficial effects of LD formation lag behind those associated with the formation of unsaturated phospholipids. As we also show that ATGL-mediated lipolysis is required for the OA rescue effect, our interpretation is that LDs can function as a reservoir for unsaturated lipids that can be released, for example, when the ER membrane desaturation is increased. How this crosstalk between the ER and LDs could be regulated is an interesting question and should be subject of further studies.</p><p>In summary, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of PTC responses to lipotoxic stress. We find that mice exposed to HFD show a striking lipid accumulation pattern with more LDs in the straight S2/S3 PTCs. As these segments also seem to be the site where less tubular injury occurs, this points towards a protective role of lipid storage. Accordingly, MUFA-HFD that leads to more LDs is associated with less injury while the opposite is true for SFA-HFD. Mechanistically, we identify ER membrane saturation as a key determinant of cell viability that is regulated by LDs as a reservoir for MUFAs. Moreover, we identify transcriptional networks activated during PA-induced stress that can be used as a resource for a systems-level understanding of lipotoxic stress. As dietary effects on DKD progression are so far understudied in humans, our findings provide new rationales for emphasizing MUFAs in the dietary management of DKD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Free fatty acid quantification Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#MAK044</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Triglyceride determination kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#MAK266</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mouse NGAL (Lipocalin-2) ELISA Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="top">#443,707</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">T863</td><td align="left" valign="top">MedChemExpress</td><td align="left" valign="top">HY-32219</td><td align="left" valign="top">(30 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">PF 06424439</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bio-Techne</td><td align="left" valign="top">#6348/5</td><td align="left" valign="top">(30 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Etomoxir</td><td align="left" valign="top">Calbiochem</td><td align="left" valign="top">#236,020</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">(50 nM; 200 nM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bafilomycin A1</td><td align="left" valign="top">VWR</td><td align="left" valign="top">#J61835.MX</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">(200 nM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">CAY10566</td><td align="left" valign="top">MedChemExpress</td><td align="left" valign="top">#HY-15823</td><td align="left" valign="top">(2.5 μM; 5 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Atglistatin</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">SML1075</td><td align="left" valign="top">(25 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">GSK2606414</td><td align="left" valign="top">MedChemExpress</td><td align="left" valign="top">HY-18072</td><td align="left" valign="top">(5 μM; 10 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">GSK2850163</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#1,684</td><td align="left" valign="top">(10 μM; 30 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Ceapin-A7</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#SML2330</td><td align="left" valign="top">(1 μM; 2 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tunicamycin</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#5045700001</td><td align="left" valign="top">(10 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thapsigargin</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">#586,005</td><td align="left" valign="top">(1 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">BODIPY 493/503</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#D3922</td><td align="left" valign="top">(2.5 μg/mL)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">C1-BODIPY 500/510C12</td><td align="left" valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">#D3823</td><td align="left" valign="top">(2 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">C-Laurdan</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dr. B.R.

The viper function was used with default parameters, except minimum regulon size of 5, eset.filter parameter set to FALSE, and pleiotropy parameter set to FALSE.</p><p>Biweight midcorrelation (bicor) was systematically estimated between TFs and lipid abundances using the bicor function of the WGCNA R package. To do so, average TF activities were first estimated at the level of individual conditions using the same method as described in the previously. Then, average TF activities across conditions (Ctrl, OA, PA/OA, PA) were correlated with average lipid abundance across the same conditions. To focus on the top associations between TFs and lipids, we selected TFs-lipids bicor coefficients above 0.97 or under –0.97. This coefficient value was chosen because it allowed us to select a number of associations that could be humanly investigated (i.e., less than 30).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study addresses the role of different lipids on renal damage in DKD and demonstrate differences in saturated versus mono-unsaturated lipids on tubular damage in a mouse model of DKD. These diet models are combined with transcriptomic, lipidomics, and in vitro analyses, including the analyses of mitochondrial effects. The topic is timely and provides new insights into the effects of lipids on DKD. However, there remain concerns that the mechanistic studies were only done in vitro and there is limited attempt to correlate with in vivo observations. A number of other issues were raised that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be considered further for possible publication.</p><p>There needs to be a clear identification of nephron segments accumulating the lipid droplets. Further experiments are required to quantitate and characterize the lipid accumulation and definitively identify the nephron segments accumulating lipid droplets. Although discussion suggests possible differences for lipid accumulation in S1, S2 and S3 segments, there is no demonstration of specific segments of the nephron provided In addition, since there was not evidence of altered uptake in the S1 segment, does this indicate that the increased uptake in vivo is predominantly basolateral rather than through fatty acid bound albumin? The authors should examine altered expression of fatty acid binding proteins such as FATP and CD36.</p><p>There remains uncertainty about the mechanism by which MUFA inhibit injury by simultaneous addition of SFA. although the authors postulate it is due in part to increased TGA formation, the protective effect remained even with dacylglycerol transferase inhibition.</p><p>Existing literature provides strong support that saturated fatty acids, in particular palmitate, are associated with lipotoxicity, whereas unsaturated lipids such, as oleate, are protective against palmitate toxicity. Oleate protection is thought to promote triacylglycerol formation from palmitate preventing its metabolism and being a preferred substrate for DGAT1 and DGAT2. The manuscript describes several of the established cellular effects of SFA and MUFA. The authors should describe the current understanding of the different pathways for palmitate and oleate metabolism leading to their distinct effects and clearly identify the new and different pathways for palmitate and oleate metabolism in the kidney.</p><p>Existing literature provides strong support that saturated fatty acids, in particular palmitate, are associated with lipotoxicity, whereas unsaturated lipids such, as oleate, are protective against palmitate toxicity.

By using immunohistochemistry on the four different conditions (control, STZ, MUFA-STZ and SFA-STZ) we have now indeed confirmed that lipid droplet (LD) accumulation occurs mainly in S2 and S3 segments. To label LDs we used BODIPY, while segments were marked with either megalin for all three PT segments or SGLT2 for only the S1 segment. The results provide strong evidence for LD accumulation within proximal tubular cells of the S2/S3 segments upon high fat diet treatment. Interestingly, we also found that the damage marker KIM-1 was found in cells distinct from these cells, confirming our cell culture findings that cells with TAG and LD formation protects against lipotoxic injury. These new important data are now presented in Figure1—figure supplement 2B and Figure 8B,C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, since there was not evidence of altered uptake in the S1 segment, does this indicate that the increased uptake in vivo is predominantly basolateral rather than through fatty acid bound albumin? The authors should examine altered expression of fatty acid binding proteins such as FATP and CD36.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now performed expression analysis of the apical FATP2 and the basolateral CD36 by qPCR. The data show that both FATP and CD36 are strongly downregulated in all three mice groups treated with STZ compared to the control group (new Figure1—figure supplement 2). This result may argue against a role of FATP2 and CD36 in the observed differences in LDs accumulation between groups. We therefore suspect that LD accumulation in S2/S3 segments is caused by enhanced capacity for TAG formation, potentially due to the reported higher levels of the desaturase SCD1 in these segments. Alternatively, it may be that the enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation in S1 segments prevents lipid storage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There remains uncertainty about the mechanism by which MUFA inhibit injury by simultaneous addition of SFA. although the authors postulate it is due in part to increased TGA formation, the protective effect remained even with dacylglycerol transferase inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>The observation that the protective effect of OA remained upon DGAT inhibition may suggest that OA co-treatment can balance the saturation level of ER phospholipids even when TAG and LD formation is blocked. In fact, our lipidomics analysis could show that in OA/PA-treated cells DGAT inhibition increases DAG levels (at the expense of TAG) but does not change the saturation level of DAG. In other words, OA co-treatment can reduce di-saturated DAG levels, especially 16:0_16:0, compared to PA alone no matter if DGAT is inhibited or not. Consequently, there is also more 16:0_18:1 that does not harm the ER membrane as 16:0_16:0 is able to do.</p><p>In the revised version, we have attempted to explain the DGAT inhibition results in more detail (p.10, line 14-22; p.13, line 18-23) and we are also showing the abovementioned DAG profile in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Existing literature provides strong support that saturated fatty acids, in particular palmitate, are associated with lipotoxicity, whereas unsaturated lipids such, as oleate, are protective against palmitate toxicity.

This is important because it could otherwise be argued that lipid bilayer stress is secondary to other ER stressors, such as misfolded proteins. We added a sentence to emphasize this conclusion (p.7, line 28-30).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 8: did the authors also measure cardiolipines and their oxidation? This would strengthen the results obtained in regard to the mitochondrial phenotype and increased ROS generation.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the advice of the referee, we have now rechecked our lipidomics data, and we could indeed detect a strong effect of OA on cardiolipin formation. In particular, we see that cardiolipin levels are decreased in IRECs treated with OA, possibly because they share precursors with TAG biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Moreover, while we could not detect cardiolipins with less than 4 double bounds in OA treated cells, PA treatment increased the amount of cardiolipin species with only two double bounds. These findings are interesting because they could partly be responsible for the lower mitochondrial membrane potential observed in iRECs treated with OA. Yet, we decided not to include the cardiolipins in the manuscript due to the length restrictions and our focus on ER phospholipids.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cardiolipin profile of iRECs treated with PA, OA and PA/OA (A) Cardiolipin levels in iRECs treated for 16h with BSA, PA 250µM, OA 250µM and PA 250µM plus OA 125µM.</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SEM; **p&lt;0.01; One-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test; n=3.

We have now performed shotgun lipidomics on the renal cortices of all four mouse groups. As stated above, the data show a striking similarity with the cell culture lipidomics data, despite the fact that the type and duration of HFD treatment differs vastly between the two models. In particular, we were able to confirm our key finding namely that monounsaturated lipids promote TAG synthesis, while saturated lipids cause accumulation of di-saturated TAG precursors. These results can be found in the new Figure 8A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, it is a limitation that the mechanistic studies have been done in vitro. This is a limitation for the conclusions drawn. This needs to be acknowledged in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised version has overcome this limitation. On the one hand, we performed lipidomics on mouse renal cortical samples. The obtained lipidomes for MUFA-STZ and SUFA-STZ mice are indeed very similar to the OA and PA treatment on cultured cells despite the differences in the length of the treatment. In particular, we were able to show that SFA also leads to the accumulation of di-saturated DAGs. On the other hand, we found that KIM-1 positive cells in the renal cortex are mostly devoid of LDs, suggesting that TAG and LD formation may also be protective in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am surprised that spot urine was used. Spot urine values show large variations and metabolic cages are commonly used to avoid this. I do not share the authors concern.</p></disp-quote><p>In the approval by the local Animal Ethics Committee for our mouse work, one of the defined humane endpoints was a weight loss that is bigger than a 20%. As mice usually reduce the food intake during the habituation to the metabolic cages, we decided not to use metabolic cages to preserve enough mice in the study, given that some of the mice were already near the endpoint. It is indeed possible that this might have had some impact on the quality of the urine samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study examined the potential role of unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) vs. saturated fatty acids (SFA) in mediation of kidney proximal tubule injury in a model of diabetes. Utilizing cultured proximal tubule cells, they find that MUFA led to increased tubule lipid droplets by stimulating triacylglycerol formation and prevented injury by decreasing ER stress compared to SFA. Of note simultaneous administration of MUFA still inhibited the effect of SFA. In general, the results appear consistent and the studies appear to be well performed.</p><p>There remains some uncertainty about the mechanism by which MUFA inhibit injury by simultaneous addition of SFA. although the authors postulate it is due in part to increased TGA formation, the protective effect remained even with dacylglycerol transferase inhibition. The authors may wish to speculate further.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we believe that this result demonstrates that OA co-treatment can balance the saturation level of ER phospholipids even if LD formation is blocked by DGAT inhibition. In fact, our lipidomics analysis could show that OA co-treatment can reduce di-saturated DAG levels, especially 16:0_16:0, compared to PA alone no matter if DGAT is inhibited or not. As a result, there is more 16:0_18:1 that does not harm the ER membrane as 16:0_16:0 is able to do. These data can now be found in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. We also added a passage in the discussion about this point (p. 13, line 18-23), and we changed title and abstract to put more emphasis on ER membrane saturation than on LDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since there was not evidence of altered uptake in the S1 segment, does this indicate that the increased uptake in vivo is predominantly basolateral rather than through fatty acid bound albumin? The authors should examine altered expression of fatty acid binding proteins such as FATP and CD36&gt;</p></disp-quote><p>We repeat here our response to the same comment from the editor: As requested, we have now performed expression analysis of the apical FATP2 and the basolateral CD36 by qPCR. The data show that both FATP and CD36 are strongly downregulated in all three mice groups treated with STZ compared to the control group (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This result may argue against any role of FATP2 and CD36 in the observed differences in LDs accumulation between groups. We therefore suspect that LD accumulation in S2/S3 segments is caused by an enhanced capacity for TAG formation, potentially due to the reported higher levels of the desaturase SCD1 in these segments. Alternatively, it may be that the enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation in S1 segments prevents lipid storage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other questions:</p><p>Was there any significant difference in UACR between SFA and MUFA since MUFA appears to be higher?</p></disp-quote><p>No, there is not a significant difference. Despite a visible trend, the data did not pass the normality test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The studies with autophagy are incomplete since the increased p62 suggests ineffective autophagy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. We have now performed a more thorough autophagy analysis by using Western Blotting of p62 and LC3 in combination with Bafilomycin A1 treatment. The results suggest that autophagic flux is preserved but autophagic cargo accumulates, most likely due to an excess of autophagic cargo (e.g. misfolded proteins due to ER stress). These new results can be found in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the PERK inhibition with 5 µM GSK206414 significantly different than the DMSO group?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry about this.

We have now changed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The central tenet of this investigation that accumulation of lipid droplets within the kidney tubules is beneficial in kidney injury should be supported with additional studies. These experiments should clearly quantitate and characterize the lipid accumulation and definitively identify the nephron segments accumulating lipid droplets. Although discussion suggests possible differences for lipid accumulation in S1, S2 and S3 segments, there is no demonstration of specific segments of the nephron provided.</p></disp-quote><p>By using immunohistochemistry on the four different conditions (control, STZ, MUFA-STZ and SFA-STZ) we have now confirmed that LD accumulation occurs mainly in the S2 and S3 segments. To label LDs we used BODIPY, segments were marked with either megalin for all three PT segments or SGLT2 for only the S1 segment. Altogether, the findings provide strong evidence for LD accumulation within proximal tubular cells of the S2/S3 segments upon high fat diet treatment. See also our comments above (first point of editor).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that LD are protective would be strengthened by concurrent assessment in lipid accumulation and cellular injury in the disease setting (e.g., KIM1). This seems especially pertinent in view of the heterogeneity in lipid accumulation among the tubular segments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this very important issue. We have now performed additional immunohistochemistry. They show that KIM-1 immunoreactivity is mainly seen in PTCs with no or less LDs. By contrast, KIM-1 immunoreactivity overlapped with markers for the S1 segment. Due to the more widespread expression of these damage markers in SFA-STZ mice this colocalization was more evident in these mice. Altogether, these results provide strong in vivo-validation for the protective effects of TAG and LD formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As presented, the in vitro studies document many of the expected pathways for cellular handling of palmitate and oleate. The novelty of the observations concern that these pathways are occurring in kidney cells in a disease setting. At present there is no adjustment in the design of the cell culture studies that accounts for renal cell handling of these fatty acids in the diabetic setting which may include the effects of glucose on lipid metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>The regular medium for iRECs culture is indeed DMEM with high glucose (4.5mg/mL). This concentration is comparable to the plasma glucose concentration in diabetic mice. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now additionally studied the effect of a stepwise glucose increase for PA-induced cytotoxicity. As can be seen in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, increasing glucose concentrations showed a visible but non-significant enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of PA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Existing literature provides strong support that saturated fatty acids, in particular palmitate, are associated with lipotoxicity, whereas unsaturated lipids such, as oleate, are protective against palmitate toxicity. Oleate protection is thought to promote triacylglycerol formation from palmitate preventing its metabolism and being a preferred substrate for DGAT1 and DGAT2. The manuscript describes several of the established cellular effects of SFA and MUFA. The authors should describe the current understanding of the different pathways for palmitate and oleate metabolism leading to their distinct effects and clearly identify the new and different pathways for palmitate and oleate metabolism in the kidney.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeat here our response to the same comment from the editor: Our manuscript indeed describes some of the known effects of PA and OA but for the first time this is put into the context of proximal tubular pathophysiology in DKD. We provide a comprehensive and mechanistic explanation of the toxic and protective effects of PA and OA, respectively. Moreover, we highlight the differential effects of excess lipids on the different PTC segments that should stimulate follow-up studies about the differences in lipid uptake and metabolism between the segments. In the revised version, we have attempted to highlight the novel pathways for MUFA/SFA metabolism in the kidney (e.g. p. 3 , line 23-24 and p. 13, line 31-37). We now also provide more references for the damaging effects of SFAs in the introduction (please see p. 3, line 15-22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the design of the studies uses dietary manipulation to assess effects of butter and olive oil rich diets to study renal response to injury, these results should be put in the context of inconsistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that dietary change in proteins, lipids, nutritional supplements etc. alter kidney disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeat here our response to the same comment from the editor: In fact, the first paragraph of the discussion is already dedicated to the current knowledge about the effects of Mediterranean diets on kidney health. To put this into the general context of DKD management, however, we have now added the dietary recommendations of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative from 2020 (p.11, line 36- p.12 line 4). It is of interest that in these important guidelines, the fat type does not play a major role. Clearly, more emphasis was placed on low protein and low sodium, which probably reflects the limited knowledge on the impact of unsaturated fat for kidney health.</p></body></sub-article></article>
