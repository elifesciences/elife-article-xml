Using flow-cytometry analysis, we observed increased proliferation dynamics and decreased MHC-I cell surface expression in MmuPV1-treated tissues which could have implications in tissue regenerative capacity and ability to clear the virus.

Mucosotropic high-risk HPVs, a group which includes HPV16 and HPV18, have been associated with malignancies, mainly cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers, and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">zur Hausen, 2009</xref>). For this reason, the contribution of these viruses to cancer has been extensively studied with significant advances in cancer prevention, prophylaxis, and detection. In addition to representing a significant source of pathogenesis, it is clear that papillomaviruses also abundantly colonize human epithelia without causing an apparent pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hannigan et al., 2015</xref>), an aspect of their biology which is more poorly understood.</p><p>Since differentiation of stratified epithelia is essential for the productive HPV replication cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Roden and Stern, 2018</xref>), and due to the species specificity of papillomaviruses, it has been challenging to study the host-virus interaction and the progress of infection of HPV in the laboratory. Furthermore, the outcome of HPV infection is greatly influenced by the host immune system and inflammation induced by tissue damage that is required in order to expose the underlying basal layer to the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amador-Molina et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the best system to study virus-host interaction taking into consideration all the factors that influence infection outcome is to explore this in vivo.</p><p>This is now possible due to the discovery of a mouse specific papillomavirus (MmuPV1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ingle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). This mouse papillomavirus provides the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in the context of a small common laboratory animal for which abundant reagents are available and for which many strains exist. Even though the genome of the human and mouse papillomavirus is similar, with the exception of the lack of E5 gene in the mouse virus, HPVs, and MmuPV1 do indeed show differences at the level of nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joh et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, by studying the mouse papillomavirus-host interaction, we can gain a better understanding on how the presence of the papillomavirus alters the host cell behavior over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Spurgeon and Lambert, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Existing approaches in the field have relied on long-term phenotypes leading to clearer understanding regarding the mechanisms of oncogenesis. This remains true in the development of a novel mouse model of spontaneous high-risk HPV E6/E7-expressing carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henkle et al., 2021</xref>), an inducible mouse model of HPV oncogene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Böttinger et al., 2020</xref>) and other novel models based on infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brendle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Spurgeon and Lambert, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wei et al., 2020</xref>) and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Spurgeon and Lambert, 2019</xref>). Reliance on cytopathic effects has resulted in a severe understudy of the majority of the papillomavirus infections which do not lead to overt signs of infection. Additionally, subclinical MmuPV1 infections have also been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). These infections remain critical to study as they can offer significant insights on the prevention of substantial morbidities such as laryngeal respiratory papillomatosis, genital wart recurrence etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Egawa and Doorbar, 2017</xref>). This underscores the clear need for a model where one can observe directly the MmuPV1 infected cells and furthermore, trace them over time during the course of the infection.</p><p>Here, we have designed and developed a model for in vivo lineage tracing of the cells initially harboring MmuPV1. We have created an MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid which we deliver to the tail skin of reporter R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice. Expression of self-deleting Cre from the plasmid results in recombination of the loxP sites and excision of the sequence flanked by the loxP sites. Therefore, introduction of the plasmid in mouse cells leads to the production of Cre recombinase and loss of the Cre sequence and its promoter from the plasmid and, more importantly, recircularization of the MmuPV1 genome, and the loss of the stop codon upstream of the yellow florescence protein (YFP) gene. This lets us observe and trace longitudinally, cells that initially harbored the plasmid containing the viral genome. Since YFP expression is genetically activated, it is conserved in the following progeny cells of the initial cell that taken up the plasmid. This model provides, for the first time, a promising tool to study the biology of MmuPV1 infection and its target cells along with the impact of the virus on these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cre expression from MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox leads to reporter activation and plasmid recombination in vitro</title><p>To validate the generated MmuPV1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) in vitro, we transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (isolated from R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice) with the generated MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid (MmuPV1-Cre) or with the control plasmid, pBABE-GFP.

It is known that infection with MmuPV1 is mainly cleared by the functions of the CD8+T cell-dependent adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Handisurya et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, immunocompromised mice are more susceptible to the mouse papillomavirus. Thus, we transiently immunocompromised mice before delivering the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid by using UV-B radiation. UV-B was shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, whereas the innate immune response remains largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Uberoi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Following the UV-B radiation, the base of the tail skin of R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice was superficially abraded with a pipette tip to expose the tail basal layer. Then, MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid was delivered and skin samples were harvested at the specified time points to check the presence of YFP expression by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cells which taken up MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid can be detected and traced over time in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design; the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid is delivered to the tail skin of R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice (of pure C57BL/6 genetic background) after a UV-B irradiation and a superficial scarification.

Additionally, we were able to follow-up YFP+ cells at later time points. These results indicate that our model can indeed be used as an in vivo lineage-tracing model for MmuPV1, where virus-hosting cells and their progeny can be individually observed via their genetically induced YFP expression.</p><p>As a control for our lineage-tracing model, we use CAG-Cre plasmid which drives the expression of a self-deleting Cre recombinase, just as in the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid, but it does not encode any MmuPV1 genes. As performed above, pCAG-Cre was delivered to R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice after UV-B irradiation and tail skin scarification. Tail skins were isolated and treated in an identical manner as MmuPV1-treated tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, indicated with white lines).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tissues treated with MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid show evidence of active MmuPV1 gene transcription in vivo</title><p>We also examined the presence of the viral genes and transcripts in the cells of the same tissue samples and same time points as above. Firstly, we used the RNA in situ hybridization assay of RNAscope to check for the expression of MmuPV1 transcripts, E1/E4 and E6/E7. We observed that in the cells that have taken up the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid, E6/E7 transcripts started to appear as early as 3 days post-delivery (p.d.) and peaked around day 7 p.d. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas the E1/E4 transcripts were detected at day 5 p.d. onward and peaked at day 10 p.d. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, we did not detect any of the tested MmuPV1 viral transcripts in the cells that have taken up the CAG-Cre plasmid since the viral genome of MmuPV1 is lacking in this control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Additionally, we distinguished the viral RNA signal from the viral genomic DNA signal by treating the tissue sections with DNAse and/or RNAse prior to probe hybridization in which we confirmed that the majority of the observed signal for MmuPV1-E6/7 and E1/E4 was indeed viral RNA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tissues with MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid express viral transcripts in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) RNAscope of the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid delivered tail sections of the R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice at the indicated time points to assess the presence of viral transcripts E6/E7 and E1/E4, respectively.

The presence of the recircularized MmuPV1 plasmid on the surface of the skin could be a result of the eventual migration of the progeny cells to the superficial layer from the initially MmuPV1-harboring cell at the basal layer and shedding the viral particles on the skin surface.

Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we were able to visualize virion-like structures in the perinuclear area of epithelial cells in all the MmuPV1-Cre treated mice, whereas none of these structures were observed in mice treated with the control CAG-Cre plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, we were able to detect the MmuPV1 transcripts of E1/E4 and E6/E7 in the cells which harbor the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid and also confirmed the recombination of the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid after Cre expression by detecting the sequence flanking the Cre cassette (Cre loss).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Progeny of cells which received MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox plasmid exhibit higher proliferation dynamics and lower surface expression of MHC-I in vivo</title><p>To provide proof of principle that our model system may be used to answer question regarding papillomavirus biology and taking advantage of the ability to detect YFP expressing cells, we applied the plasmids to the tail skin of R26R-lox-STOP-lox-eYFP mice as mentioned above. Then, skin samples were harvested at the specified time points and processed and stained for flow cytometric analysis.</p><p>Firstly, we applied a standard gating strategy to exclude dead and doublet cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then, we detected the YFP expressing cells and compared numbers and frequencies between groups and different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that both numbers and percentages of YFP+ cells were much higher in MmuPV1 samples at day 5 p.d., which decreased overtime as seen at day 10 and day 30 p.d. Whereas, pCAG-Cre samples only start to have increased YFP+ cells around day 10 p.d. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results are also in line with the IF data we saw previously and can indicate to a difference in the actual amount of plasmid delivered to the tissue or the different dynamics of the plasmids due to the presence of the MmuPV1 genes. Furthermore, coinciding with the increased number of YFP+ cells, we observed that MmuPV1-harboring cells exhibit significantly increased levels of Ki-67 around day 5 p.d. compare to other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We further directly visualized Ki-67-positive cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the regions of infected skin where we previously detected the MmuPV1 transcripts via RNAscope and observed that the cells harboring MmuPV1-Cre plasmid indeed exhibit higher proliferation around day 5 p.d. compare to the cells harboring CAG-Cre control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Papillomaviruses have previously been reported to reduce MHC-I expression, but evidence was generated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Georgopoulos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2010</xref>). To evaluate the levels of MHC-I specifically on the cell surface of the MmuPV1-harboring cells, we used flow-cytometry to interrogate MHC-I levels within the YFP+ population. Interestingly, we observed significantly lower expression of MHC-I molecules on the YFP+ cells of MmuPV1-treated tissues at day 5 p.d., whereas YFP+ cells in control treated tissues exhibit increased MHC-I expression at this time point, presumable due to YFP neo-antigen expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These effects waned at later time points. Our results agree with previous in vitro studies and indicate a possible immune evasion strategy by the MmuPV1 where the virus is causing a decreased expression of MHC-I molecules on the cell surface to reduce the antigen exposure to the immune cells.</p><p>It is important to note, that the differences in proliferation and MHC- I expression were specific to the YFP + cells within the tissue. Also, within the same tissues, we analyzed the Ki-67 and MHC-I levels of the neighboring YFP- cells which have not taken up the given plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed no significant difference between time points or between the YFP- cell population of the MmuPV1 plasmid-treated tissue and the CAG-Cre plasmid-treated tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). These results suggest that any differences observed are specific to plasmid uptake.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that during early acute infection, MmuPV1 causes increased proliferation which may be accompanied by decreased antigen presentation. Additionally, here we show that our novel in vivo lineage-tracing model can be used as a tool to answer such key questions in the field of MmuPV1 biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions and significance</title><p>Here, we describe a novel in vivo lineage-tracing model for MmuPV1 infected cells in laboratory mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). We propose that the ability to trace MmuPV-1 harboring cells and their progeny by microscopy, as well as to quantify and analyze by means of flow-cytometry renders this model a suitable and convenient tool for answering a variety of outstanding questions in papillomavirus biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lambert et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, we believe that the novel model described here can be used to investigate the early effects of papillomavirus on the target cells, transcriptional and phenotypic changes of the papillomavirus-harboring cells during the acute phase of the infection, and investigate the initial viral-host immune interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>To generate a plasmid with a self-deleting Cre sequence and the full MmuPV1 genome, we combined sequences from four plasmids: puC19-MmuPV1 (gift from Paul F.

To construct the final plasmid, we first PCR amplified the sequence in large_pMA-T that contains the lox and part of the E6 sequence using primers to introduce PstI and HindIII restriction sites in the 5’ and 3’ ends of the sequence, respectively. Using PstI and HindIII, we cloned lox-E6 in the pCAG-Cre plasmid. In this new plasmid, we subcloned the L1-lox sequence from small_ pMA-T plasmid using blunt end ligation (L1-Lox sequence was isolated using SacI and KpnI restriction enzymes, the Cag-cre plasmid was digested with SalI and T4 DNA polymerase was used to generate blunt ends). We refer to this plasmid as plox-cre-lox which was sequenced to confirm the correct insertion of L1-lox-Cre-lox-E6 sequence. To generate the plasmid for animal infection, we removed the ampicillin bacterial selection cassette from lox-cre-lox and MmuPV1 plasmids using XhoI and XbaI. The two fragments (lox-cre-lox and MmuPV1) were gel purified and ligated overnight at 16 °C (ligation was done using a ratio of 1:2.5, MmuPV1 to lox-cre-lox).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Megan E Spurgeon (Reviewer #1); Neil D Christensen (Reviewer #2); Sheila Graham (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Specifically comments and suggestions from reviewer 1 meet the concerns of all reviewers.</p><p>Additional Experiments/Data/Analyses:</p><p>1. One of the major pieces of evidence that the MmuPV1-lox-Cre-lox virus can infect murine skin and ultimately establish a productive viral infection is the expression of viral transcripts by RNA in situ hybridization provided in Figure 3. It has been noted by multiple groups that the RNAscope assay using MmuPV1-specific probes can detect MmuPV1 viral DNA. In order to distinguish between viral DNA versus RNA transcripts, treatment with DNAse and/or RNAse can be performed (for example, see Xue et al., 2017 and Spurgeon and Lambert, 2019). The images in Figure 3 are blurry, but it does appear that there is ample nuclear signal in some of the tissues (usually indicative of viral DNA). Because the presence of MmuPV1 viral gene transcription is being used as a readout for active infection and is therefore such a foundational piece of evidence supporting their infection model system, the authors should make an effort to perform DNAse/RNAse treatment in their RNAscope assays to verify the signal is, in fact, due to the presence of MmuPV1 viral transcripts.</p><p>2.

Interestingly, some of the early work by Campo's group with BPV and HPV identified E5 as a viral protein that down-regulated MHC1 (e.g. Oncogene. 2002 Jan 10;21(2):248-59. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205008. Down-regulation of MHC class I by bovine papillomavirus E5 oncoproteins G Hossein Ashrafi, Emmanouella Tsirimonaki, Barbara Marchetti, Philippa M O'Brien, Gary J Sibbet, Linda Andrew, M Saveria Campo). MmuPV1 is noted to not have an E5 protein, however, other viral proteins impact MHC1 as shown here. Note also that Lamberts group conducted some interesting studies using an E5-expressing transgenic mouse with MmuPV1 infections (Virology. 2020 Feb;541:1-12. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2019.12.002.

For example, I don't agree that all HPV are commensal since they have an exquisitely tight relationship with the host epithelium and some are pathogenic. In this resepct it would be useful to discuss cutaneous versus mucosa PV infection since we now know of a huge number of commensal γ HPVs. HPVs colonise only epithelia, not &quot;human tissues&quot;, which is too general a term. We understand how papillomaviruses enter, replicate and spread in epithelia so this aspect of their biology is understood. We do not know precisely how the life cycle is initiated from a single infected stem cell. So it is important to carefully discuss what is and is not known. Infection of the basal layer of the epithelium via tissue damage may not be necessary for infection: e.g. infection of single layer columnar cells e.g. in the endocervix is likely (see Doorbar and Griffin https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30974183/). HPV6/11 laryngeal papillomas and genital warts do show cytopathic effects.</p><p>Throughout, the paper is written in quite a superficial manner and lacks proper discussion of relevant literature. There are almost no points of discussion in the paper that are fully explored. Some of the figures/data are hard to see, or to decipher, and could be improved. There is a lack of breadth of data which means that the authors conclusions are not fully substantiated.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Figure 1 is hard to understand for the Cre non-specialist. A diagram of the plasmids that relate to the predicted band on the gel would be useful and well as annotation of the plasmid diagram in (A) with larger and clearer fonts for the primers. In (D) why is the E4 band the same size and the GAPDH band? Positions of the primers on the MmuPV1 genome should be given in a table. Why is the E6 band so faint compared to the L1 band when transcriptome analyses have shown that E6 is much more highly expressed than L1 (see https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006715#). Since this is puzzling, these data should be backed up with qRT-PCR data.</p><p>UV irradiation of the mice may not affect the innate immune response but as this paper deals with validation of a model data showing the effects of UV on the adaptive and innate immune response in the mice is required.</p><p>In Figure 2B there is clear evidence of clonal expansion of MmuPV1 infected cells. However, I don't understand why K14, a basal cell marker is expressed in the upper epithelial layer, apparently in all tissues. Moreover, why is K14 staining colocalising with GFP at Day 3 (which could be explained by de-differentiation of the MmuPV1 cells) but not at subsequent days? It is expected that PV infected cells show decreased expression of differentiation markers such as K10 or involucrin and staining with at least these markers should be carried out to properly characterise the infection.</p><p>In Figure 3 the stainings for viral RNAs are quite indistinct. Perhaps removing haematoxylin staining and showing higher magnification would help. H and E staining for each tissue and +/- DNAse in the RNAScope would also be required. The bands for Cre loss and MmuPV1 DNA in Figure 3E are too faint to assess.</p><p>The investigation of MHC class I on the cell surface is interesting but the authors do not properly explain the background to this study, namely that HPV E5 is the main mediator of MHC downregulation. HPV E7 had been reported to also contribute. Of course, MmuPV1 does not express E5 but neither (to my knowledge) has MmuPV1 E7 been shown to regulate MHC class 1. The finding that cells surrounding the recombinant MmuPV1-containing cells is indicative, but more work would be necessary to firm up this potentially important conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72638.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Specifically comments and suggestions from reviewer 1 meet the concerns of all reviewers</p><p>Additional Experiments/Data/Analyses:</p><p>1.

We propose, however, that the main utility of the system is the ability to track the cells which initially received viral genome, the ability to study and compare them with likewise tracked cells in uninfected tissue (systems using in vitro or in vivo generated virions would be superior systems to study infection per se). Nevertheless, we did try to study the formation of virions in our system. Using TEM we were able to visualize virion-like structures in the perinuclear area of epithelial cells (added to Figure 3F). None of those structures were observed in mice treated with the control CAG-Cre plasmid. We provide evidence for capsid formation (Figure 3F), genome recircularization (Figure 3E), early and late gene transcription (Figure 3A-B). However, presumably due to the low amounts of virus replication in the time points studied, and the genetic background of the mice infected which we examined here (C57BL/6), we were unable to detect L1 using a commercially available antibody (Papillomavirus antiserum polyclonal goat antibody, ViroStat, 5001, 1:100), and we were not able to infect immunocompromised animals from swabs of infected mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Moreover, why is K14 staining colocalising with GFP at Day 3 (which could be explained by de-differentiation of the MmuPV1 cells) but not at subsequent days? It is expected that PV infected cells show decreased expression of differentiation markers such as K10 or involucrin and staining with at least these markers should be carried out to properly characterise the infection.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to preserve epitopes for YFP staining we have used frozen sections instead of paraffin embedded ones. In our experience, frozen sections are not optimal for use of antibodies to K14 etc. K14 staining is only useful to provide orientation to epithelium but not make conclusive characterization of tissue differentiation status in this context. We kindly remind this reviewer that this paper was submitted as a short report and is at the upper limit in terms of length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3 the stainings for viral RNAs are quite indistinct. Perhaps removing haematoxylin staining and showing higher magnification would help. H and E staining for each tissue and +/- DNAse in the RNAScope would also be required. The bands for Cre loss and MmuPV1 DNA in Figure 3E are too faint to assess.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have added controls (+DNAse, +DNAse and RNAse) in Figure 3 Supplement 1 panels A and B. These support the initial conclusion that most of the signal detected is a result of RNA transcripts and not due to DNA. Additionally, we made several changes to the images presented in the Figures 2 and 3, such as enhancing or replacing the blurry and out of focus ones. As for the bands for Cre loss and MmuPV1 DNA in Figure 3E, we continue to detect very low amounts of recombined plasmid which we believe reflects the limited amount of genome present 5 days post-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The investigation of MHC class I on the cell surface is interesting but the authors do not properly explain the background to this study, namely that HPV E5 is the main mediator of MHC downregulation. HPV E7 had been reported to also contribute. Of course, MmuPV1 does not express E5 but neither (to my knowledge) has MmuPV1 E7 been shown to regulate MHC class 1. The finding that cells surrounding the recombinant MmuPV1-containing cells is indicative, but more work would be necessary to firm up this potentially important conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our interesting finding of decreased MHC-I expression is certainly in need of further investigation to discover the underlying mechanims. However, given the nature of a short report paper, our purpose here is to provide an example of usage of the described novel infection model which can be used to answer such questions about the interplay between virus and host immune system. Our future work will certainly include such investigations by using this novel model and determine the possible role of MmuPV1 -E7 in regulating immune responses to MmuPV1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
