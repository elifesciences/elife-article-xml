Cells must repair DSBs while blocking the action of telomerase on these ends. Short telomeres must avoid recognition by the DNA damage response while promoting telomerase recruitment. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> the Pif1 helicase, a telomerase inhibitor, lies at the interface of these end-fate decisions. Using Pif1 as a sensor, we uncover a transition point in which 34 bp of telomeric (TG<sub>1-3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> repeat sequence renders a DNA end insensitive to Pif1 action, thereby enabling extension by telomerase. A similar transition point exists at natural chromosome ends, where telomeres shorter than ~40 bp are inefficiently extended by telomerase. This phenomenon is not due to known Pif1 modifications and we instead propose that Cdc13 renders TG<sub>34+</sub> ends insensitive to Pif1 action. We contend that the observed threshold of Pif1 activity defines a dividing line between DSBs and telomeres.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA double-stand breaks</kwd><kwd>Telomeres</kwd><kwd>Genome stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strecker</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Durocher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004089</institution-id><institution>Krembil Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durocher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stinus</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durocher</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A sharp transition in the fate of DNA ends with telomere sequences is identified, which suggests a boundary between DNA double-strand breaks and telomeres.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental question in chromosome biology is how cells differentiate between DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and telomeres, the natural ends of chromosomes. A failure to distinguish between these structures has severe consequences for genome integrity. For example, the engagement of the non-homologous end-joining pathway at telomeres can lead to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles that wreak havoc on the genome. Similarly, the activity of telomerase at DSBs can generate new telomeres at the cost of the genetic information distal to the break. Telomere addition has been observed in a variety of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kramer and Haber, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biessmann et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fouladi et al., 2000</xref>) and has been linked to human disorders involving terminal deletions of chromosome 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilkie et al., 1990</xref>) and 22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 1997</xref>). While DSBs and telomeres reflect extreme positions on the spectrum, a continuum of DNA ends exists between them, including critically short telomeres and DSBs occurring in telomeric-like sequence. All these require a decision: should the end be repaired or should it be elongated by telomerase?</p><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> whose telomeres consist of 300 ± 75 bp of heterogeneous (TG<sub>1-3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> repeats, has been a key model to study mechanisms of genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zakian, 1996</xref>). The telomere repeats organize a nucleoprotein structure minimally composed of the double-stranded (ds) DNA binding protein Rap1, its interacting factors Rif1 and Rif2, and the telomere-specific single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) complex, which caps the chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewar and Lydall, 2012</xref>). These telomere-bound proteins prevent activation of DNA damage signaling pathways and the ability of the DSB repair machinery to use telomeric ends as substrates. This so-called capping function is a universal property of eukaryotic telomeres; while different in composition, a set of human proteins collectively known as shelterin accomplishes a similar function in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase-mediated extension does not occur at every telomere in every cell cycle, but the probability of telomere extension steadily increases as telomere length decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teixeira et al., 2004</xref>). Telomerase also acts more processively at telomeres less than 125 bp in length, resulting in more extensive elongation of critically short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). The preferential extension of short telomeres can be rationalized since short telomeres are most in danger of becoming dysfunctional. Thus, while telomerase must be tightly inhibited at DSBs, its activity must also be suppressed at telomeres that are sufficiently long. A number of proteins have been implicated in this process, including Rif1, Rif2, and the Tel1 (ATM) kinase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wellinger and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In addition, the telomerase inhibitor Pif1, which is a helicase that unwinds RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro and removes telomerase from telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulé et al., 2005</xref>), has recently been shown to act preferentially at long telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, Pif1 is also required to inhibit telomerase at DSBs. Pif1 has both mitochondrial and nuclear isoforms encoded from separate translational start sites; mutation of the second start site in the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> mutant abolishes the nuclear isoform, resulting in telomere elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schulz and Zakian, 1994</xref>) and a 240-fold increase in telomere addition at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myung et al., 2001</xref>). The Mec1 (ATR)-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 also guards against the inappropriate recruitment of the CST complex to DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Durocher, 2010</xref>).</p><p>One striking feature of Pif1 is that it is able to distinguish between DSBs and telomeres, as a <italic>pif1-4A</italic> mutant affects telomere addition frequency at DSBs but without influencing native telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makovets and Blackburn, 2009</xref>). This observation makes Pif1 an attractive candidate for a protein that controls the distinction between DSBs and short telomeres. We noted in our previous work that Pif1 suppresses telomere addition at HO-induced DSBs containing 18 bp of (TG<sub>1-3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> telomeric repeats (referred to as TG<sub>18</sub>) but has no impact on the telomerase-dependent elongation of DNA ends containing a TG<sub>82</sub> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Durocher, 2010</xref>). This observation suggests that the TG<sub>82</sub> substrate behaves as a critically short telomere and that cells elongate it in a manner that is uninhibited by Pif1. Thus, this system appears to recapitulate the end-fate decisions undertaken at DSBs versus critically short telomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a Pif1-insensitivity threshold at DNA ends</title><p>To characterize the dividing line between a DSB and a short telomere, we used a genetic system in which galactose-inducible HO endonuclease can be expressed to create a single DSB at the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus on Chr VII-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diede and Gottschling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gottschling et al., 1990</xref>). By placing different lengths of telomeric (TG<sub>1-3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> sequence immediately adjacent to the HO cut site, one can study the fate of DNA ends using two readouts: a genetic assay for telomere addition based on the loss of the distal <italic>LYS2</italic> marker, and by Southern blotting to monitor the length of the DNA end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The HO cut site in this system contributes one thymine nucleotide to the inserted telomeric seed, accounting for a one base pair discrepancy from prior reports. As previous work indicated that Pif1 is active at TG<sub>18</sub>, but not TG<sub>82</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Durocher, 2010</xref>), we first constructed strains containing 34, 45, 56, and 67 bp of telomeric repeats in both wild-type and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for all TG repeat sequences). We observed similar rates of telomere addition at all DNA ends in both backgrounds, indicating that 34 bp of telomeric repeats are sufficient to render a DNA end insensitive to Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To account for variations in HO cutting efficiency and the propensity to recruit telomerase at each DNA end, we also normalized telomere addition frequency to <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells to provide a clear readout of Pif1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

We selected three different sequences from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> telomeric DNA and constructed strains with DNA ends containing either 26 or 36 bp of each sequence. Consistent with our initial observations, telomere addition was inhibited by Pif1 at all TG<sub>26</sub> ends, while the corresponding TG<sub>36</sub> ends resulted in telomere addition in the presence of Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>; source data for panel c are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>Visualization of the combined genetic assay results across different lengths of TG-repeat substrates reveals a striking transition with regard to Pif1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). By using Pif1-insensitivity as an operational definition of a short telomere, we propose that the 26 to 34 bp window of telomeric sequence is the dividing line between what the cell interprets to be a DSB and what is considered to be a critically short telomere. These data suggest that DNA ends containing 34 bp or more of telomeric DNA are allowed to elongate in a manner unimpeded by Pif1 and we herein refer to this phenomenon as the DSB-telomere transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A DSB-telomere transition also exists at chromosome ends</title><p>To validate the threshold that defines the DSB-telomere transition, we set up a system based on the STEX (Single Telomere EXtension) assay to monitor telomerase-mediated extension events at chromosome ends at nucleotide resolution after a single cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teixeira et al., 2004</xref>). In the STEX assay, a clonal population of telomerase-negative cells is mated to a strain expressing telomerase. Telomeres that had shortened in the telomerase-negative cells can then be re-extended in the zygote. DNA is isolated from the zygotes and telomere elongation can be detected by amplifying, cloning and sequencing telomeres originating from the telomerase-negative strain. Since yeast telomerase adds imperfect 5′-(TG)<sub>0-6</sub>TGGGTGTG(G)<sub>0-1</sub>-3’ repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Förstemann and Lingner, 2001</xref>), telomere elongation can be detected after sequence alignment of the telomeres because newly added sequences do not align with the non-elongated telomeres. We call these newly added sequences ‘sequence divergence events’ because they diverge from the original sequences. We introduced two major modifications to the STEX assay: (1) we use a strain where the expression of <italic>EST1</italic>, encoding a subunit of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>), is under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter, allowing us to avoid the challengingly high mating efficiency needed in the classical STEX assay; (2) we make use of a <italic>tlc1</italic> template mutant (<italic>tlc1-tm</italic>) that introduces 5′-[(TG)<sub>0–4</sub>TGG]<sub>n</sub>ATTTGG-3’ telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2007</xref>), enabling us to distinguish sequence divergence events that are telomerase-dependent (i.e. the divergent sequence is mutant) from those that are telomerase-independent (i.e. the divergent sequence is wild type). This modification was found to be important since a fraction of sequence divergence events can occur due to homologous recombination, as well as from errors introduced during amplification, cloning and sequencing of the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claussin and Chang, 2016</xref>).

These data indicate that the presence of telomerase does not influence these events. Strikingly, at both the V-R and VI-R telomeres, the frequency of telomere extension drops dramatically at extremely short telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). At the V-R telomere, only two out of 32 telomeres (6.3%) shorter than 44 bp were extended by telomerase, while 65 out of 136 telomeres (47.8%) between 44 bp and 86 bp long were extended. Similarly, at the VI-R telomere, two of the 13 telomeres below 38 bp (15.4%) were extended, while 51 out of 115 telomeres (44.3%) between 38 bp and 74 bp long were extended. Thus, while telomerase preferentially elongates short telomeres, those below ~40 bp are inefficiently extended. These data suggest that the DSB-telomere transition identified at HO-induced breaks also exists at native chromosome ends.</p><p>To determine whether Pif1 is also important for the DSB-telomere transition at chromosome ends, the iSTEX assays were repeated in a <italic>pif1-m2</italic> background [(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>)].

Consistent with this model, Pif1 is reported to be phosphorylated after DNA damage in a Mec1-Rad53-Dun1-dependent manner and further characterization of this activity led to the identification of the <italic>pif1-4A</italic> mutant (T763A/S765A/S766A/S769A) that is unable to inhibit telomere addition at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makovets and Blackburn, 2009</xref>).

If Pif1 phosphorylation only occurs at DNA ends with short lengths of telomeric repeats, such as TG<sub>18</sub>, then mimicking phosphorylation may be sufficient to inhibit telomere addition at DNA ends with longer telomeric repeats. Contrary to this prediction, the <italic>pif1-4D</italic> mutant did not restore Pif1 activity at the TG<sub>34</sub> DNA end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of these sites is not sufficient to regulate the DSB-telomere transition.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that Pif1 functions differently at DSBs and telomeres.

The inability of the <italic>pif1-4D</italic> allele to inhibit telomerase at TG<sub>34</sub> therefore provides indirect evidence that the cell interprets this DNA end as a short telomere. A second mutation that affects Pif1 activity has also been identified: the <italic>est2-up34</italic> mutation, which affects the finger domain of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eugster et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>est2-up34</italic> mutant results in over-elongated telomeres in wild-type but not <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells, indicating that the <italic>est2-up34</italic> allele can at least partially bypass Pif1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eugster et al., 2006</xref>).

single amino acid residues (F236, S255, Q256) could completely account for the phenotype of the remaining three alleles (<italic>cdc13-sp63</italic>, <italic>cdc13-sp42</italic>, and <italic>cdc13-sp77</italic>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). These residues all map to the Cdc13 telomerase recruitment domain, suggesting that weakening the association of Cdc13 with telomerase is another means to facilitate Pif1 activity at TG<sub>34</sub>. In particular, the S255A mutation has previously been shown to impair telomerase recruitment, resulting in telomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tseng et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, the classic telomerase null <italic>cdc13-2</italic> (E252K) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nugent et al., 1996</xref>) was also sensitive to Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Telomere length in several other <italic>cdc13-sp</italic> alleles was also reduced in both wild-type and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> backgrounds, and the severity of the defect generally correlated with the magnitude of the telomere addition phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p><p>The diversity of Cdc13 mutations that sensitize the TG<sub>34</sub> end to Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>) suggests that generally disrupting Cdc13 function facilitates Pif1 activity by shifting the balance away from telomere addition. In agreement with this idea, the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutant grown at permissive temperature was also sensitive to Pif1, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>); its P371S mutation is now known to disrupt OB2 dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mason et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of hits from our screen that decreased telomere addition in both wild-type and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells revealed double mutations of critical residues including S255L/Q256R in clone 37, I87T/F236Y in clone 40, and F236S/E252K in clone 48, suggesting that strongly disrupting Cdc13 function eventually impairs telomere addition even in the absence of <italic>PIF1</italic>. In line with this idea, the F235S/E252K/Q583K triple mutant prevented telomere addition at a TG<sub>34</sub> end even in <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p><p>The striking effect of the <italic>cdc13</italic> recruitment domain mutants led us to explore in greater detail how disrupting the ability of Cdc13 to recruit telomerase influences the DSB-telomere transition. We determined the telomere addition frequency of the <italic>cdc13-Q256H</italic> mutant on a series of DNA ends of varying telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>; source data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). While telomere addition frequency was very low at TG<sub>34</sub>, it gradually increased as the telomere sequence lengthened. Thus, mutating the recruitment domain of <italic>CDC13</italic> abolished the sharp DSB-telomere transition and increased the length of telomere sequence needed to allow telomere addition to become resistant to Pif1 action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The work presented here sheds light on how cells distinguish between DSBs and short telomeres and reveals a sharp transition in the fate of DNA ends with regards to their sensitivity to the telomerase inhibitor Pif1. Our findings agree with previous reports demonstrating that linear plasmid substrates containing 41 bp of telomeric repeats are efficiently converted into telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lustig, 1992</xref>). We find that the DSB-telomere transition also exists at natural chromosome ends and that Cdc13 is a key player in setting this transition.</p><p>The observed behavior of Pif1 complements several known mechanisms that tightly integrate telomeric sequence length and the regulation of telomerase. The identified activity of Pif1 at telomeric repeats under 34 bp joins a Mec1-dependent mechanism that inhibits Cdc13 binding at repeats under 11 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Durocher, 2010</xref>), highlighting the importance of inhibiting telomerase at DSBs. Conversely, we propose that DNA ends containing telomeric sequences of 34 bp to 125 bp are recognized as critically short telomeres and are preferentially elongated. Tel1 is implicated as a key regulator in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabourin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hector et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnerić and Lingner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>), although the exact phosphorylation targets are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the canonical counting mechanism of telomeres is known to limit the extension of long telomeres through the negative regulators Rif1 and Rif2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcand et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levy and Blackburn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, although short telomeres of 34 bp or longer are insensitive to Pif1, Pif1 preferentially binds and acts at wild-type length or longer telomeres, thereby helping to promote the elongation of short telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to maintain genome stability, the length of telomeric repeat sequence necessary to overcome Pif1 should be greater than any natural sequence occurring within the genome. Any longer sequences should therefore be prone to conversion into new telomeres and might be under negative selection during evolution due to the loss of genetic material. Consistent with this idea, the two longest (TG<sub>1-3</sub>)<sub>n</sub> sequences in the correct orientation outside of telomeric regions in budding yeast include a 35 bp sequence on Chr VII, and a 31 bp sequence on Chr VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mangahas et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our investigation into the molecular trigger of the DSB-telomere transition points to a key role for the DNA-binding protein Cdc13. This conclusion is supported by work revealing that microsatellite repeats containing Cdc13-binding sites stimulate telomere addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Piazza et al., 2012</xref>), and recent data that a hotspot on Chr V also promotes Cdc13 binding and telomere addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obodo et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the tethering of Cdc13, but not Rap1, to this site was shown to be sufficient for the formation of new telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obodo et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, resection at DNA ends with short stretches of telomere repeats may remove all potential Rap1-binding sites, strongly suggesting that the DSB-telomere transition depends either on ssDNA-binding proteins like Cdc13 or the ssDNA itself.</p><p>The ability of the Cdc13 OB1 domain to dimerize and bind DNA provides an attractive solution to the DSB-telomere transition; however, our results clearly indicate that sensitivity to Pif1 is not unique to any one domain and can result from a variety of mutations throughout Cdc13, most notably in the recruitment domain. Weakening the ability of Cdc13 to recruit telomerase provides a satisfying explanation for the sensitivity of the TG<sub>34</sub> end to Pif1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) but is unable to explain why the TG<sub>34</sub> end is resistant to Pif1 in the first place, especially as fusing telomerase to Cdc13 was unable to overwhelm Pif1 at the TG<sub>18</sub> substrate. Interestingly, the mammalian CST complex can bind single-stranded telomeric DNA of 32 bp and longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyake et al., 2009</xref>) suggesting that Cdc13 in combination with Stn1 and Ten1 may also possess unique binding properties.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23783.039</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model to explain how Cdc13 and Pif1 cooperate to establish the DSB-telomere transition.</title><p>At the TG<sub>18</sub> end, Pif1 is able to efficiently prevent telomerase-mediated extension (top left). At the TG<sub>34</sub> end, Cdc13-mediated recruitment of telomerase overpowers Pif1 activity, allowing the extension of the end (top right). This is impaired if the recruitment domain of Cdc13 is mutated (bottom left). Further mutation of <italic>PIF1</italic> restores the ability of telomerase to elongate the TG<sub>34</sub> end (bottom right).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23783-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>One key unresolved issue is the mechanism by which Pif1 inhibits telomerase on either side of the DSB-telomere transition, and our results with the <italic>pif1-4A</italic> and <italic>-4D</italic> alleles suggest that these activities may be distinct. It is clear that Pif1 can remove telomerase RNA from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulé et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>), but genetic data reveal that Pif1 also has telomerase-independent activity as <italic>PIF1</italic> loss increases the growth of <italic>cdc13-1 tlc1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewar and Lydall, 2010</xref>). One potential activity for Pif1 at DSBs is through the promotion of DNA end resection, first observed in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewar and Lydall, 2010</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, end resection impairs telomere addition, and new telomeres are added closer to DSB sites in <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). This model therefore predicts that the TG<sub>18</sub> end may be resected with the help of Pif1, but that resection is blocked at the TG<sub>34</sub> end, thus providing an explanation as to why tethering telomerase to the TG<sub>18</sub> end does not increase telomere addition. In line with this prediction, a TG<sub>22</sub> end was previously observed to partially suppress DNA end resection compared to a TG<sub>11</sub> substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirano and Sugimoto, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, using Pif1 as a cellular indicator for the DNA-end fate decision reveals a striking threshold that recapitulates several properties of DSBs and telomeres. We propose that a TG<sub>34</sub> DNA end, which is approximately a tenth of the size of a healthy budding yeast telomere, is interpreted by the cell as a minimal telomere.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain construction and growth</title><p>The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>.

The Pif1 mutagenesis screen was performed in TG<sub>82</sub><italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells co-transformed with gapped pRS416-<italic>pif1-m1</italic> and purified inserts. Cells harbouring repaired plasmids were selected on SD-ura.

Cells harboring repaired plasmids were selected on SD-ura before replica-plating to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to remove the covering plasmid. Mutant <italic>cdc13</italic> alleles that are defective in capping should be inviable at this step. Colonies from both screens were patched onto raffinose plates and grown for 2 days before replica plating to galactose plates for 4 hr, and finally to α-AA plates after reducing cell density by first replicating plating to a blank agar plate. Plasmids were rescued using a phenol-chloroform extraction and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Plasmids were sequenced to identify mutations and retransformed into the parental yeast strain to confirm that the phenotype resulted from the plasmid mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>The statistics carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were done using a Fisher’s exact test and for this analysis, telomeres containing only wild-type divergence were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Katrin Paeschke and members of the Durocher laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Kathleen Collins and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Teresa Teixeira (Reviewer #3); Dorothy Shippen (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cells must distinguish short telomeres from DNA double strand breaks to preserve genome stability, yet the mechanism that underlies the distinction remains poorly understood. Recent studies implicate the Pif1 helicase as a pivotal player in determining the fate of these two types of chromosome termini. Here the authors investigate the mechanism by which Pif1 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> blocks de novo telomere formation on DSBs with less than 26bp of telomeric DNA, but not at tracts of longer telomere sequence. Using a classical HO-induced DSB system, and a single molecule telomere length assay, the authors establish a telomere length &quot;window&quot; of ~26-40bp that distinguishes DSBs from short telomeres.</p><p>To examine how Pif1 activity is repressed at telomeric DNA sequences that exceed this length threshold, they use a genetic approach to test the contributions of DDR kinases (Mec1, Tel1 and Rad53), telomerase recruitment, and Pif1 phosphorylation. They find no correlation with Pif1 activity at telomeres longer than the &quot;DSB-telomere transition length&quot;. Similarly, Rap1 binding does not significantly impact Pif1 activity. However, the authors find a correlation between various aspects of Cdc13 function and Pif1 activity at telomeres longer than 34bp. Using a suppressor screen they identify numerous residues in Cdc13 important for suppressing Pif1 activity.</p><p>This study is important for its discovery of a link between Cdc13 and Pif1 in distinguishing DSBs from short telomeres. Overall the study was solid technically and communicated clearly, with a few omissions detailed below. The major shortcoming of the work is that it doesn't satisfyingly resolve the nature of the link between Cdc13 and Pif1 in the context of previously known properties/roles of Cdc13. The impact of the study could be considerably strengthened by additional mechanistic insight about how Cdc13 modulates Pif1 activity at different DNA ends.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Major experiments using the HO cut assay are elegant and well controlled. However, the evidence that what is learned applies to native telomeres is less strong because it lacks the positive control in <italic>pif1-m2</italic> background. This control would be ideal to show that absence of telomerase action at critically short telomeres is not due to some transient cell cycle arrest due checkpoint activation or cell death in the (small) portion of cells containing the exact same critically short telomeres we are looking at. Note that despite differences in the experimental settings, STEX is done 2h after telomerase re-expression, while in Southerns shown for the HO cut we see no telomere elongation at this time point after Gal addition to induce HO. This is challenging (need to construct an inducible system for Pif1 to prevent telomeres from lengthening before the experiment), but it would help in more confidently extend the conclusions to native ends. Alternatively, STEX could be tried in mutants of MEC1 or RAD53, but it's not obvious that these mutations wouldn't affect telomerase action at these very short telomeres (see effect at TG82-HO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Anyway, authors should try to provide evidence that the portion of cells carrying the critically short telomeres contain active telomerase.</p><p>2) The STEX result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (reduced telomere addition to very short endogenous telomeres) is at odds with a number of published STEX results that don't show this effect. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? How do the authors eliminate the possibility that use of a mutant template sequence alters the results? I do not understand the derivation of the p value given for the VI-R telomeres. The Fisher Exact Test gives a p value of 0.07 (75 extended and 159 not extended among the longer telomeres vs. 0 extended and 7 not among the shortest telomeres). How do the authors justify using a different cut-off length in the two cases?</p><p>3) The authors state in the Materials and methods that the total cell counts both pre- and post-galactose treatment are obtained, but the fraction of cells that survive the 4-hour treatment with galactose is not given. Could the authors comment whether this rate differs greatly between situations in which the end either is or is not efficiently healed by telomere addition?</p><p>4) In several experiments, the authors fail to see an effect on TG34-HO healing by expression of a <italic>pif1-m1</italic> allele in a <italic>pif1-m2</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> for the 5AQ allele and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for the 4D allele). The authors should verify that the mutant Pif1 protein is expressed and functional by virtue of its ability to complement the telomere lengthening phenotype of the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> allele.</p><p>5) If &quot;WT&quot; results are presented in multiple figures, the legend must clearly state that data are identical to those shown previously. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, and 5C. Are the same <italic>sml1</italic> and <italic>sml1 pif1-m2</italic> data shown in panels B and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3— – figure supplement 1</xref>? What is the n value for these samples?</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the authors should show the effect of high copy expression in the TG18 PIF1 and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> strains. Low copy Cdc13 does not fully complement since telomere addition at TG18 in the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> background is less than half of what is seen in other experiments. Does overexpression of WT Cdc13 render TG18 partially or fully resistant to Pif1 action?</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the effect of the cdc13-S255A mutation is particularly strong, but this mutant is not included on the telomere length analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. Why? If a mutation like S255A raises the threshold (in terms of telomere length) required for an end to become resistant to Pif1 action, one might predict that longer telomeric seeds will regain that ability. It would be informative to repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with one of the stronger cdc13 alleles (or at least to check one of the longer TG strains) to test this idea.</p><p>8) In the Discussion, the authors provide only a cursory mention of nucleolytic resectioning at the HO cut site prior to telomere addition. The DNA substrate that arises following HO cleavage will be grossly distinct from a natural short telomere, but this is glossed over in the text. Because resectioning is not discussed, the rationale for looking at the contribution of the double strand telomere binding protein RAP1 versus the single strand telomere protein Cdc13 is not established.

However, the evidence that what is learned applies to native telomeres is less strong because it lacks the positive control in pif1-m2 background. This control would be ideal to show that absence of telomerase action at critically short telomeres is not due to some transient cell cycle arrest due checkpoint activation or cell death in the (small) portion of cells containing the exact same critically short telomeres we are looking at. Note that despite differences in the experimental settings, STEX is done 2h after telomerase re-expression, while in Southerns shown for the HO cut we see no telomere elongation at this time point after Gal addition to induce HO. This is challenging (need to construct an inducible system for Pif1 to prevent telomeres from lengthening before the experiment), but it would help in more confidently extend the conclusions to native ends. Alternatively, STEX could be tried in mutants of MEC1 or RAD53, but it's not obvious that these mutations wouldn't affect telomerase action at these very short telomeres (see effect at TG82-HO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Anyway, authors should try to provide evidence that the portion of cells carrying the critically short telomeres contain active telomerase.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important point. We have completed the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> iSTEX controls (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). At telomere VR, there is a statistically significant increase in the extension of telomeres below the DSB-telomere boundary in <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells. A similar result is seen for telomere VI-R, but the number of short telomeres was not sufficient to reach statistical significance (p=0.151) despite our best efforts to accrue the number of short telomeres. Nevertheless, our new findings strengthen our conclusion that there is a telomereDSB transition at native telomeres that is regulated by Pif1.</p><p><italic>2) The STEX result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (reduced telomere addition to very short endogenous telomeres) is at odds with a number of published STEX results that don't show this effect. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? How do the authors eliminate the possibility that use of a mutant template sequence alters the results? I do not understand the derivation of the p value given for the VI-R telomeres. The Fisher Exact Test gives a p value of 0.07 (75 extended and 159 not extended among the longer telomeres vs. 0 extended and 7 not among the shortest telomeres). How do the authors justify using a different cut-off length in the two cases?</italic> </p><p>This comment can be subdivided in a number of points. First, regarding the comparison of our results with those of the literature, we note that there are only four papers that show STEX data (Teixeira et al., 2004; Arnerić and Lingner, 2007; Ji et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2015). The Philips et al. paper is not highly relevant to this comment because there was a high background of telomerase-independent divergence events at telomeres below 50 nt in length. The other papers did indeed show some extension events at telomeres below our 30-40 nt threshold, but their sample size was quite small in each of these studies. However, it is critical to note that since those studies used strains with wild-type telomerase, it is simply impossible to differentiate between telomerase-dependent and -independent events, and therefore it is impossible to assess how many of the divergence events observed in the previous papers were due to telomerase activity.</p><p>As for the second point regarding the impact of the telomerase template, we contend that it is unlikely that the mutant template alters the iSTEX results for the following reasons. First, the incipient telomeres are wild-type and we only express the mutant telomerase for a single cycle. Second, previous work (Chang et al., 2007) alongside the present work here show no difference in terms of repeat addition processivity, frequency of extension, length of extension, and preferential elongation of short telomeres by the mutant template-containing telomerase. This important point is now emphasized in the first paragraph of the subsection “A DSB-telomere transition also exists at chromosome ends”.</p><p>With respect to the third point, the reviewers were correct and we had indeed miscalculated the p value in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. During the revision period, the number of sequenced telomeres accrued and a new p value is now reported (p=0.039).</p><p>As for the last point, the difference in the DSB-telomere threshold for telomere V-R (43 nt) and telomere VI-R (37 nt) is likely due to experimental variation and/or the sample size of telomere ends analyzed by iSTEX. We contend that the 6-nt difference is a rather small difference. In addition, the exact sequences of these telomeres are different, and this may impact somewhat the threshold length.</p><p><italic>3) The authors state in the Materials and methods that the total cell counts both pre- and post-galactose treatment are obtained, but the fraction of cells that survive the 4-hour treatment with galactose is not given. Could the authors comment whether this rate differs greatly between situations in which the end either is or is not efficiently healed by telomere addition?</italic> </p><p>The fraction of cells that survive the 4-h treatment with galactose varies from 10% to 40%, and this variation cannot be easily explained by genotype or TG length. We believe this variation could be due to differences in HO-cutting efficiency from experiment to experiment. This difference does not alter in any way the interpretation of our results. Whether we calculate telomere addition frequency from the total number of cells or from only the surviving cells, TG18 is sensitive to PIF1 status while TG34 is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Telomere addition frequency at DNA ends containing 18 or 34 bp of TG sequence normalized either to the total amount of cells (total) or only the surviving cells after the 4h galactose induction (surviving).</title><p>Data represent the mean ± s.d. from a minimum of n=3 independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23783-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p><italic>4) In several experiments, the authors fail to see an effect on TG34-HO healing by expression of a pif1-m1 allele in a pif1-m2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> for the 5AQ allele and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for the 4D allele). The authors should verify that the mutant Pif1 protein is expressed and functional by virtue of its ability to complement the telomere lengthening phenotype of the pif1-m2 allele.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. We have now included a new experiment (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) that shows, as expected, that the <italic>pif1-m1</italic> allele rescues the telomere lengthening phenotype of the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> allele.</p><p><italic>5) If &quot;WT&quot; results are presented in multiple figures, the legend must clearly state that data are identical to those shown previously. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, and 5C. Are the same sml1 and sml1 pif1-m2 data shown in panels B and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>? What is the n value for these samples?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the oversight. The mentioned figures (3C, 4E, 5A, 5C) did indeed show the same WT data. The telomere addition of <italic>sml1∆</italic> cells is also the same in panels B and D of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (n=3). The figure legends have been modified to explicitly mention this.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the authors should show the effect of high copy expression in the TG18 PIF1 and pif1-m2 strains. Low copy Cdc13 does not fully complement since telomere addition at TG18 in the pif1-m2 background is less than half of what is seen in other experiments. Does overexpression of WT Cdc13 render TG18 partially or fully resistant to Pif1 action?</italic> </p><p>This is a good suggestion. As requested, we have tested the impact of high-copy expression of <italic>CDC13</italic> and <italic>cdc13-L91A</italic> in the <italic>PIF1</italic> and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> strains (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type <italic>CDC13</italic> clearly does not render TG<sub>18</sub> resistant to Pif1 action and therefore the differences seen between low- and highcopy expression was specific for <italic>cdc13-L91A</italic>.</p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the effect of the cdc13-S255A mutation is particularly strong, but this mutant is not included on the telomere length analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>. Why? If a mutation like S255A raises the threshold (in terms of telomere length) required for an end to become resistant to Pif1 action, one might predict that longer telomeric seeds will regain that ability. It would be informative to repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with one of the stronger cdc13 alleles (or at least to check one of the longer TG strains) to test this idea.</italic> </p><p>The <italic>cdc13-S255A</italic> mutation has previously been shown to have short telomeres by two independent groups (Tseng et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2010). This has now been noted in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Cdc13 function influences the fate of DNA ends” and the work are cited. To answer the second part of the reviewers’ comments, we have tested the <italic>cdc13-Q256H</italic> mutant across a range of TG substrates (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). As predicted, we find that the <italic>cdc13-Q256H</italic> mutant has the ability to elongate longer TG substrates. Interestingly, the threshold is no longer as sharp as in the wild-type situation, but instead is more gradual.</p><p><italic>8) In the Discussion, the authors provide only a cursory mention of nucleolytic resectioning at the HO cut site prior to telomere addition. The DNA substrate that arises following HO cleavage will be grossly distinct from a natural short telomere, but this is glossed over in the text. Because resectioning is not discussed, the rationale for looking at the contribution of the double strand telomere binding protein RAP1 versus the single strand telomere protein Cdc13 is not established. Clearly, the 3' overhang depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is not consistent with the major conclusions from the paper. A more accurate description of the actual substrate for action at the &quot;DSB-telomere transition&quot; is required.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point and we agree that the resection of DNA ends would preclude Rap1 from binding in the first place. We should have mentioned the impact of resection on short telomeric substrates in the original Discussion. Furthermore, since the G-tails of very short telomeres also likely remove Rap1 binding sites, ssDNA formation at DSBs and critically short telomeres further suggests that Cdc13 rather than Rap1 regulates the DSB-telomere transition. We now mention this possibility in the revised Discussion.</p><p>The reviewers should also note that the DNA substrate depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is the structure produced immediately after HO cleavage. This was noted in the figure legend and it was never intended to suggest that this was the substrate at the time of telomerase action. Since extensive resection inhibits de novo telomere addition, one could predict that the exact structure of the cleaved TG<sub>34+</sub>-HO substrates would be similar, to some extent, to that of a short telomere with a G-tail.</p><p><italic>9) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Identification of a Pif1-insensitivity threshold at DNA ends”, a major conclusion of this paper is there is a sharp boundary for the DSB-telomere transition length between 26 to 34bp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> provides evidence to support this conclusion. However, with the TG30 sequence there is a 30% addition rate, arguing that the addition frequency actually gradually increases inside this window. Additional experiments that test Pif1 activity on TG28 and TG32 are needed to determine whether there is indeed a sharp length threshold or a more diffuse window. Furthermore, according to the hypothesis that Pif1 regulation is mediated by Cdc13 binding to DNA and that three Cdc13 binding sites are needed for regulation (11bp each), then both TG30 and TG26 should be insensitive to Pif1 activity since neither contain three complete Cdc13 binding sites.</italic> </p><p>Although the word “sharp” is obviously subjective, when viewed in the context of a full-length telomere (~300 bp), we believe the transition window (~8 bp) from a Pif1sensitive to a Pif1-insensitive end is quite narrow. To further highlight this point, when the DSB-transition is altered by mutation of <italic>CDC13</italic>, the transition is much more gradual (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In addition, the TG<sub>30</sub> telomere addition rate (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) is 19% (normalized to <italic>pif1-m2</italic>), not 30%.</p><p>While it is true that the minimum length for Cdc13 binding was determined to be 11 bp, there is no evidence to suggest that three Cdc13 molecules would bind a 33 bp telomere sequence. Indeed, steric hindrance could well prevent this from occurring. To avoid confusion, these sentences have now been removed from the text.</p><p><italic>10) The suppressor screen is powerful, but the data provide little molecular insight into how Cdc13 impedes Pif1 function.

The S255A mutant has previously been carefully studied and shown to be defective in telomerase recruitment (Gao et al., 2010). We have now included telomere addition assays for the <italic>cdc13-2</italic> (E252K) mutant, which is also known to be defective in telomerase recruitment (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
