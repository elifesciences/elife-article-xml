through the repositioning of nucleosomes. Isw2 is an enzyme that has been previously defined as a genome-wide, nonspecific nucleosome spacing factor. Here, we show that Isw2 instead acts as an obligately targeted nucleosome remodeler in vivo through physical interactions with sequence-specific factors. We demonstrate that Isw2-recruiting factors use small and previously uncharacterized epitopes, which direct Isw2 activity through highly conserved acidic residues in the Isw2 accessory protein Itc1. This interaction orients Isw2 on target nucleosomes, allowing for precise nucleosome positioning at targeted loci. Finally, we show that these critical acidic residues have been lost in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage, potentially explaining the inconsistently characterized function of Isw2-like proteins. Altogether, these data suggest an ‘interacting barrier model,’ where Isw2 interacts with a sequence-specific factor to accurately and reproducibly position a single, targeted nucleosome to define the precise border of phased chromatin arrays.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA encodes the genetic instructions for life in a long, flexible molecular chain that is packaged up neatly to fit inside cells. Short sections of DNA are wound around proteins to form bundles called nucleosomes, and then spun into chromatin fibres, a more compact form of DNA. While nucleosomes are a fundamental part of this space-saving packaging process, they also play a key regulatory role in gene expression, which is where genes are decoded into working proteins.</p><p>Placing nucleosomes at regular intervals along DNA invariably controls which parts of the DNA – and which genes – the cell’s machinery can access and ‘read’ to make proteins. But the nucleosomes’ positions are not fixed, and gene expression is a dynamic process. The cell often uncoils and repackages its DNA while molecular motors called chromatin remodelling proteins move nucleosomes up and down the DNA, exposing some genes and obstructing others.</p><p>One group of chromatin remodelling proteins are called Imitation Switch (ISWI) complexes. It has long been thought that these complexes position nucleosomes with little regard to the underlying DNA sequence or the genes encoded, that is to say in a non-specific way. However, this theory has not been thoroughly tested. It is possible that ISWI complexes actually place nucleosomes on certain parts of DNA at particular times in an organism’s development, or in response to other environmental factors. Except how such precision is achieved remains unknown.</p><p>To test this alternative theory of nucleosome positioning, Donovan et al. studied ISWI proteins and nucleosomes in common baker’s yeast. This involved systematically removing sections of ISWI proteins to see whether the complexes could still position nucleosomes, and which parts of the proteins where essential for the job. By doing so, Donovan et al. identified multiple ‘targeting’ proteins that bind to ISWI proteins and deliver the complexes to specific target sequences of DNA. From there, the complex remodels the nucleosome, positioning it at a specific distance from its landing site on DNA, as further experiments showed.</p><p>This research provides a new model for explaining how nucleosomes are positioned to package DNA and control gene expression. Donovan et al. have identified a new mechanism of interaction between nucleosomes and chromatin remodelling proteins of the ISWI variety. It is possible that more interactions of this kind will be discovered with further research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Isw2</kwd><kwd>chromatin arrays</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Drake A</given-names></name><name><surname>Banks</surname><given-names>Orion GB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Drake A</given-names></name><name><surname>Truong</surname><given-names>Vi N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM129242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKnight</surname><given-names>Jeffrey N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007491</institution-id><institution>Donald E. and Delia B.

The most basic regulatory and structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome. Each nucleosome is defined as an octamer of histone proteins, which is wrapped by approximately 147 base pairs of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kornberg, 1974</xref>). The specific positioning of nucleosomes on the underlying DNA can have significant effects on downstream processes, such as promoter accessibility and molecular recruitment, which ultimately serve to alter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai and Pugh, 2017</xref>). Despite decades of research, the mechanisms leading to precise nucleosome locations in cells are still being defined.</p><p>Nucleosome positioning is dynamically established by a group of enzymes known as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins (ChRPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Extensive biochemical and structural characterization has been performed on this group of proteins from various families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>c</italic>hromodomain-<italic>h</italic>elicase-<italic>D</italic>NA binding (CHD) and <italic>i</italic>mitation <italic>swi</italic>tch (ISWI) families of ChRPs have been characterized as nonspecific nucleosome sliding and spacing factors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stockdale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKnight et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pointner et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, flies, and mammals, ChRPs generate evenly spaced nucleosome arrays at transcription start sites and organize genomic chromatin at other defined boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pointner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mavrich et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiechens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). However, relatively little is known about the in vivo biological regulation of these spacing factors, and it is not understood how they can accurately and reproducibly position nucleosomes throughout the genome in different cellular contexts.</p><p>A widely accepted model is that ChRPs pack nucleosome arrays against a noninteracting barrier, such as an unrelated DNA binding protein or another nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mavrich et al., 2008b</xref>). In this way, general regulatory factors (GRFs) could establish chromatin landscapes with differing nucleosome arrays in response to changes in the cellular environment. In support of this model, nucleosome arrays near GRFs and other DNA binding elements appear to be phased relative to the binding motifs of the sequence-specific DNA binding factors in cells and in biochemically reconstituted cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). This model suggests that boundaries of nucleosome arrays are determined by the binding of barrier factors. Implicit in this barrier model are the assumptions that ChRPs act as nonspecific nucleosome spacing machines throughout the genome and that specific ChRP and GRF interactions are not required to establish nucleosome positions. While this model provides a good explanation for how phased nucleosome arrays can be established throughout the genome by a combination of DNA binding factors and nonspecific chromatin remodeling factors, the fundamental assumptions of the barrier model have not been thoroughly tested.</p><p>It has been shown through genetic and recent biochemical experiments that members of the ISWI family of ChRPs functionally interact with transcription factors in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krietenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelbart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldmark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yadon et al., 2013</xref>). One of the most well-defined interacting partners of ISWI proteins is the meiotic repressor <italic>u</italic>nscheduled <italic>m</italic>eiotic gene <italic>e</italic>xpression (Ume6), which is found in yeasts. It has been previously demonstrated that Ume6 and Isw2, an ISWI-containing ChRP complex in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (homologous to the <italic>A</italic>TP-dependent <italic>c</italic>hromatin assembly <italic>f</italic>actor [ACF] complex in humans and flies), share genetic targets of repression and likely interact physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldmark et al., 2000</xref>). While interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins can potentially determine precise nucleosome targeting and final nucleosome positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman and McKnight, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKnight et al., 2016</xref>), the mechanisms through which physical interactions between Isw2 and any genomic recruitment factor like Ume6 influence nucleosome positioning activity in cells have not been defined. For example, it is not known how these physical interactions occur or what role they play in the biochemical outcomes of chromatin remodeling reactions and the resulting downstream biological outputs.</p><p>In this work, we have successfully identified the mechanism of interaction between Isw2 and Ume6 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. By taking a protein dissection approach combined with genome-wide nucleosome profiling, we have identified a previously uncharacterized helical domain in Ume6 that allows for Isw2 binding, specific genomic recruitment, and precise nucleosome positioning outcomes. We further demonstrate that conserved attributes of this helical domain are observed in the cell cycle regulator Swi6, which we have identified as a new Isw2-recruitment adapter protein that allows for specific nucleosome positioning at Mbp1/Swi6 (MBF) and Swi4/Swi6 (SBF) targets. We have also determined that the transcription factor-interacting interface of Isw2/ACF-like remodeling complexes contains a few key and highly conserved residues within the WAC (<italic>W</italic>TSF/<italic>A</italic>cf1/<italic>c</italic>bp146) domain. Finally, we show that these residues, which are essential for directional, sequence-specific remodeling, were lost in the evolution of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage, where extensive biochemical, genetic, and genomic characterization has been performed on the <italic>ITC1</italic> ortholog ACF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isw2 activity in cells is inconsistent with known biochemistry and the barrier model for nucleosome packing</title><p>We wished to understand how the conserved Isw2 protein complex in yeast behaves genome-wide and at specific promoter nucleosomes at target sites. Yeast Isw2 has been characterized extensively in biochemical assays, which all suggest that it has nonspecific DNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, nucleosome sliding, mononucleosome centering, and nucleosome spacing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stockdale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lusser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kassabov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zofall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>). These nonspecific nucleosome mobilizing activities suggest that the Isw2 protein should be able to organize nucleosome arrays against a barrier across the genome in yeast cells since (1) it is estimated that there are enough Isw2 molecules for every 10–20 nucleosomes in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelbart et al., 2005</xref>), (2) <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ACF, an Isw2 ortholog, can organize nucleosomes into evenly spaced arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>), and (3) other nonspecific and related nucleosome spacing factors can globally space nucleosomes across the genome in yeast and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pointner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiechens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). To first determine how Isw2 positions nucleosomes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we examined nucleosome positioning activity in an <italic>isw1/chd1</italic> deletion background to remove known and potentially overlapping global spacing factors and highlight ‘isolated positioning activity’ by Isw2. When examining the positioning of nucleosomes with and without Isw2 at all yeast pre-initiation complex sites (PICs), it is evident that Isw2 activity is specialized at only a subset of target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>), no global nucleosome spacing or organizing activity is detected by Isw2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Close inspection of Isw2-targeted PICs suggests that Isw2 can only organize a single PIC-proximal nucleosome, while subsequent nucleosomes become more poorly phased as the distance from the initially positioned nucleosome increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, the PICs that display specific Isw2-directed activity are bound by Isw2, while those lacking any detectable nucleosome organization by Isw2 are unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isw2 is a specialist remodeler that positions single nucleosomes at target sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Clustered heatmap showing differences in nucleosome dyad signal between <italic>isw2</italic>/<italic>isw1</italic>/<italic>chd1</italic> and <italic>ISW2</italic>/<italic>isw1</italic>/<italic>chd1</italic> strains at 5942 pre-initiation complex sites (PICs).

Isw2 activity at Ume6-bound loci has been previously characterized as precise, with Isw2 reproducibly moving nucleosomes until the predicted edge of the nucleosome core particle is 30 base pairs from the center of the Ume6 binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKnight et al., 2016</xref>). Because of the connection to Ume6, we examined nucleosome positions in an <italic>isw1</italic>/<italic>chd1</italic> background in the presence and absence of Isw2 to determine whether Isw2 is similarly restricted at known target sites. Again, we determined that Isw2 is efficient at positioning the Ume6-proximal nucleosome but positioning of nucleosomes decays rapidly as the distance from the proximal nucleosome increases, suggesting that Isw2 may only position single nucleosomes at target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, clusters 1 and 3). Nucleosomes also appear to always be positioned toward Ume6 motifs as nucleosome positions in the absence of Isw2 are always more distal to the Ume6 motif than when Isw2 is present. Finally, these nucleosomes are positioned with the dyad only separated from the Ume6 motif by 100 nucleotides rather than the ~200 nucleotides that would be expected between dyads in a nucleosome array based on Isw2 preferentially leaving 60 base pairs of linker DNA between nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukiyama et al., 1999</xref>). Of note, a subset of Ume6-bound sites do not display Isw2-dependent nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, cluster 2). We have observed slightly reduced chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signal for Ume6 at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We speculate that for cluster 2 sites where Ume6 is bound, the Isw2 complex might in fact be recruited but that the nearest nucleosome is too distant from the recruitment site, making it out of reach of the remodeler and thus resulting in no change in nucleosome position at these sites.</p><p>The observations that (1) Isw2 is solely required to move single nucleosomes at target sites, (2) Isw2 does not have global nucleosome spacing/organizing activity, and (3) Isw2 moves nucleosomes within 100 nucleotides of bound Ume6 suggest that Isw2 behavior in cells is distinct from our understanding of Isw2 activity from decades of biochemical characterization. Similarly, these specific movements toward Ume6 (a barrier) are inconsistent with previous biophysical studies, where ISWI proteins were shown to move nucleosomes away from inert DNA-bound factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Because of these inconsistencies, we wished to know if Isw2 followed the ‘barrier model’ for positioning nucleosomes at Ume6-bound targets. To initially test this, we created a variant Ume6 construct where all residues were deleted except for the DNA binding domain. This Ume6(∆2–763) construct binds to the same targets as full-length Ume6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, Isw2 does not appear to have any activity on global Ume6-proximal nucleosomes in the presence of the Ume6 DNA binding domain alone as nucleosomes in this strain occupy identical positions when Ume6 or Isw2 are completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the presence of full-length Ume6, the Isw2 complex appears to be necessary and sufficient for moving motif-proximal nucleosomes as nucleosome positions in the <italic>ISW2/isw1/chd1</italic> strain could achieve identical motif-proximal nucleosome positions as the wild-type strain. Additionally, the <italic>CHD1/isw1/isw2</italic> and <italic>ISW1/chd1/isw2</italic> strains were unable to move any Ume6-proximal nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>), which strongly argues that Ume6 is not acting as a passive barrier against which nucleosome spacing factors can pack nucleosomes. Instead, these data are more consistent with the recent characterization of Isw2 as a ‘puller' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubik et al., 2019</xref>), with Ume6 being a DNA-bound factor that may immobilize Isw2 to create leverage for ‘pulling’. Consistent with this immobilized pulling model and consistent with the directional movement of single nucleosomes toward Ume6-bound sites, artificially tethered chromatin remodeling proteins were previously shown to always move nucleosomes toward target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2019</xref>). We suspected that Ume6 and Isw2 likely interact in a specific fashion to faithfully select and precisely move single-target nucleosomes toward a recruitment motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A small helical epitope is necessary and sufficient for Isw2-directed nucleosome positioning at Ume6 targets</title><p>To determine which region(s) on Ume6 are required for specific nucleosome positioning by Isw2, we initially created a panel of N-terminal Ume6 truncations to determine when nucleosome positioning by Isw2 is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This initial truncation panel was necessary due to the poor overall conservation of the Ume6 protein even within related yeasts, as well as the disordered structure predicted by Phyre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). Our truncation panel indicated that Isw2 activity was retained if the N-terminus was deleted to residue 322 but lost when deleted to residue 508. Closer inspection of the residues between 322 and 508 revealed a conserved region with a proline-rich segment followed by a predicted alpha helix, altogether spanning Ume6 residues 479–508 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Deletion of residues 2–479 preserved Isw2-positioned nucleosomes at Ume6 sites, while an internal deletion of 480–507 in the context of an otherwise full-length Ume6 abrogated nucleosome positioning by Isw2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Ume6 recruits both Isw2 and Sin3-Rpd3 for full repression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldmark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>). If either Isw2 or Sin3-Rpd3 is present, there is partial repression at Ume6-regulated genes. However, if Sin3-Rpd3 and Isw2 are both lost, Ume6 targets are fully de-repressed. We examined transcriptional output at Ume6 genes in Ume6(∆2–479) +/– Rpd3 and Ume6(∆2–508) +/– Rpd3. Transcription was modestly increased at Ume6 targets in Ume6(∆2–508)/<italic>RPD3+</italic> compared to Ume6(∆2–479)/<italic>RPD3+</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), which would be expected if only Isw2 is lost when residues 479–508 are deleted.

To test this, we employed the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>), which creates a spontaneous covalent bond between a short SpyTag peptide and a SpyCatcher domain. We fused the SpyTag peptide to the C-terminus of Ume6(∆2–596), a construct that is incapable of positioning motif-proximal nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then appended Ume6 residues 479–508 to the C-terminus of the SpyCatcher domain and introduced this fusion on a yeast expression plasmid driven by the ADH1 promoter. In yeast cells, this would create a fusion protein where the helical element is ectopically displayed on the C-terminus of a DNA binding competent but nucleosome-positioning-deficient construct, connected via a SpyTag-SpyCatcher linker. This fusion protein was capable of fully recapitulating Isw2-positioned nucleosomes at a subset of Ume6 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>). Perhaps not surprisingly, considering the non-native positioning of the recruitment helix in this fusion construct, not all Ume6 sites were able to gain proper nucleosome positioning with this chimeric system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). We conclude that the region spanning residues 479–508 in Ume6 is a yeast-conserved Isw2-recruitment domain and is required and sufficient for recruiting Isw2 nucleosome positioning activity to Ume6 targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A similar helical element exists in Swi6, a newly identified Isw2-recruitment adapter protein</title><p>While dissecting the Isw2-recruitment domain in Ume6, we discovered that deleting the <italic>MBP1</italic> gene resulted in ectopic nucleosome positioning at a subset of Mbp1 target loci, which was identical to mispositioned nucleosomes in a ∆<italic>isw2</italic> strain. Mbp1 is a conserved cell cycle regulator that complexes with Swi6 to form the MBF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch et al., 1993</xref>).

Indeed, we observed ectopic nucleosome positioning at the HSP12 locus (an SBF target) when either Isw2, Swi6, or Swi4 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Wild-type nucleosome positions were observed in the absence of Mbp1, indicating that this is specific to SBF. Similarly, wild-type nucleosome positions were observed at Mbp1 targets when Swi4 was missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), again suggesting that MBF and SBF have individual Isw2-targeting capacity at their respective binding sites. Swi6 appears to be an adapter protein responsible for recruiting Isw2 to Mbp1 and Swi4 sites since Swi6 has no intrinsic DNA binding domain.</p><p>To determine if Isw2 recruitment to Mbp1 sites was sufficient to recapitulate proper nucleosome positioning, we again used a SpyTag-SpyCatcher approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mbp1 was truncated to the DNA binding domain alone (Mbp1 1–136), which abolishes its interaction with Swi6 but still allows for proper genomic localization. This truncation construct was appended with SpyTag, and nucleosome positions were examined in the absence of any SpyCatcher partner present. As expected, we observed aberrant chromatin structure identical to the ∆<italic>isw2</italic> strain near the Isw2-dependent Mbp1 targets, adjacent to Mbp1 consensus motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then introduced SpyCatcher fused to the helical element from Ume6, which was characterized above for bringing Isw2 to Ume6-bound loci. Introduction of the SpyCatcher-Ume6 fusion to the Mbp1(1–136)-SpyTag background resulted in the rescue of proper Isw2-directed nucleosome positioning at Mbp1 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly support our model that these conserved, putatively helical sequences are important for recruiting Isw2 to establish proper chromatin structure at multiple sequence-specific motifs throughout the genome. We also implicate Swi6 as an adapter protein for bringing Isw2 to a small subset of both Swi4 and Mbp1 targets to create Isw2-specific nucleosome positioning at these genes. Finally, the ectopic display of an Isw2-recruitment helix can recapitulate proper Isw2-directed nucleosome positioning, further supporting the notion that a small epitope is necessary and sufficient for communicating specific nucleosome positioning outputs to the Isw2 chromatin remodeling protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The conserved WAC domain in Itc1 is the targeting domain of the Isw2 complex</title><p>The Isw2 complex contains two major subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We first attempted to recapitulate the result from Hwang et al. and made the identical Itc1(∆2–374) deletion.

We show that a recruitment factor, the sequence-specific repressor Ume6, harbors a helical domain that interacts with the N-terminus of the Isw2 accessory protein Itc1. Further, we reveal this geometrically restricts the binding of the Isw2 catalytic subunit to a motif-proximal nucleosome. The complex then remodels the nucleosome, repositioning it to a specific distance from the Ume6 recognition motif. At this point and for reasons to be elucidated, this complex is strained or inactivated, and it fails to remodel any further, leaving the nucleosome in a precise location with respect to the bound recruitment factor. The activity of Isw2 and the interacting barrier sets the absolute phase of a nucleosome array that is propagated by true nonspecific spacing activities of Chd1 and Isw1 in yeast, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>).

Unlike the arrays established by nonspecific ChRPs, these nucleosome arrays are organized in a sequence-specific and directional manner. Establishing large swaths of chromatin structure by appending a small epitope on a genome-associated protein creates opportunity for diversity with few evolutionary constraints. Only changes in relatively small DNA binding motifs and the small peptide sequences with which they interact can have a large impact on chromatin structure. Supporting this notion, we were able to identify a strikingly similar motif to that found in Ume6 in the unrelated cell cycle regulator Swi6, which we identified as a new Isw2-recruitment adapter for Swi4 and Mbp1. For these reasons, we find it likely that more ChRP-interacting motifs will be discovered in multiple transcription factors from a variety of organisms, and these motifs may play a significant role in sequence-specific nucleosome positioning for precisely phased and tunable nucleosome arrays in eukaryotic genomes. Importantly, the identification of such epitopes in human cells could lead to the development of targeted drugs to specifically disrupt defined remodeler–transcription regulator interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Isw2 is obligately targeted to specific nucleosomes without global spacing activity</title><p>We found that Isw2 acts on specific targets through these specific transcription factor interactions rather than acting on all nucleosomes genome-wide. We therefore speculate that Isw2 is in a globally repressed state in cells and activated solely on target nucleosomes. This inactivity is not consistent with work in vitro and may be caused by a regulatory interaction that has not been previously observed in biochemical systems. For example, an unknown inhibitory factor that interacts with Isw2 or the nucleosome in cells may be lost during protein purification, allowing for the ubiquitous Isw2 chromatin remodeling activity observed in vitro. Additionally, it is conceivable that Isw2 is unable to bind to linker DNA the same way in a genomic context as it can bind in vitro, potentially due to the presence of unknown chromatin interacting components, molecular crowding, chromatin folding, or other physiological differences not recapitulated in vitro. Maintaining Isw2 in an inactive state may allow organisms to conserve energy by controlling errant ATP hydrolysis while simultaneously enabling for rapid changes in chromatin structure and cellular output in differing contexts. It will be of great interest to determine how interactions with recruitment factor epitopes may alter the activity of Isw2 to elicit such precise nucleosome positioning outcomes in a cellular context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The conserved WAC domain tethers Isw2 to transcription factor epitopes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>The WAC domain, a broad N-terminal region of the Itc1 accessory protein, has been previously characterized as a DNA binding element that shares sequence conservation from flies to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). In this work, we have identified a previously undefined function of the WAC domain in mediating protein–protein interactions between ChRPs and transcription factors in vivo. We have further demonstrated that this mediation requires two conserved acidic residues within the WAC domain, which may allow future work to distinguish the DNA and protein binding capacity of the broader WAC domain region. Intriguingly, these critical acidic residues that are conserved between yeast, humans, mice, and fish have undergone an evolutionary charge reversal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

In this model, the human Acf1 N-terminus binds to extranucleosomal DNA in nucleosomes with long linker length, allowing the Snf2h (Isw2) catalytic subunit to engage the H4 tail. Snf2h engagement of the H4 tail relieves known autoinhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludwigsen et al., 2017</xref>), thereby activating the remodeling complex. When linker DNA length shortens, the N-terminus of Acf1 switches to binding the H4 tail, thus displacing the Snf2h catalytic subunit and inactivating the complex through autoinhibition. This model was used to describe how ISWI complexes can be allosterically inactivated when linker DNA length shortens on nucleosomes and is a mechanistic model for how nucleosome length sensing can be achieved.</p><p>Our results indicate that the N-terminus of Itc1 does not have a primary cellular function of length sensing and nucleosome spacing. If the Itc1 N-terminus can bind H4 tail and transcription factor epitopes similarly to extranucleosomal DNA and H4 tail, the Hwang et al. model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>) can mechanistically explain the precise distance measurements made at targeted sites in cells. In this speculative model, Itc1 binds a targeting epitope at a genomic locus when the upstream nucleosome is far away. This orients the catalytic subunit on the appropriate nucleosome, which is remodeled toward the recruitment site. When the length between the nucleosome and the recruiting epitope is short enough, the Itc1 N-terminus may bind the H4 tail to inactivate Isw2 through autoinhibition. This function of binding the positively charged H4 tail may be facilitated by the clustered acidic residues in the WAC domain or may be mediated by another domain within the broadly defined 374 base pair Itc1 N- terminus implicated in putative H4 tail binding. Determining whether this interplay between a transcription factor epitope and the H4 tail can tune distance measurements in cells will be important in future biophysical characterizations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The benefits of epitope-mediated chromatin remodeling and an interacting barrier</title><p>What advantage may an interacting barrier provide that a general barrier cannot, particularly since a noninteracting barrier can still phase nucleosome arrays? We envision at least two major advantages of the interacting barrier model. First, an interacting barrier can behave directionally while a non-interacting barrier cannot. Indeed, Isw2 seems to be positioned on a specific barrier-proximal nucleosome through interactions between the WAC domain of Itc1 and the epitope on Ume6 or Swi6. Directionality allows for more refined establishment of transcriptionally relevant chromatin arrays. Second, an interacting barrier can be modulated in a condition-specific manner through post-translational modification of the small epitope on the Isw2-recruitment factor. For example, one of the proteins that we identified as containing an Isw2- recruitment helix in yeast is Swi6, a critical regulator of the cell cycle in the G1/S transition. Interestingly, only three Swi6-regulated genes were identified as Swi6-mediated Isw2-recruitment sites. It is thus likely that the Swi6–Isw2 interaction can be tuned by cellular context, which is not possible for noninteracting barriers. Importantly, a tunable interacting barrier allows for continuous expression of the barrier and the ability to alter its barrier activity. This is a versatile mechanism through which chromatin structure may be spatiotemporally regulated in a dynamic fashion through these ChRP-recruitment factor interactions. We predict that other targeting factors likely exist, which might recruit the Isw2 complex to specific sites in the genome through a variety of different domains, and that this creates a mechanism by which remodeling occurs at specific subsets of genomic loci in response to the presence of these recruitment factors. The expression level of transcription factors is controlled by cellular context, such as cell cycle progression or stress response, and in this way the recruitment of Isw2 to specific sites might also

were derived from the parent strain <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> W303 RAD5+. Gene deletions were made by replacing the gene of interest with antibiotic resistance markers amplified from pAG vectors. C-terminal deletions of genes were also made by replacing the region to be deleted with antibiotic resistance markers. N-terminal gene deletions were made by first replacing the region to be deleted with a URA3 marker, and then counterselecting with 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) to delete the URA3. Ume6-helix was introduced to yeast through plasmid transformation of a p416 vector containing the Ume6 helix fused to the SpyCatcher protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>). To make SpyTagged yeast strains, a C-terminal 3x FLAG tag followed by the SpyTag sequence (AHIVMVDAYKPTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>) was cloned into a pFA6a vector. Tags were then inserted at the endogenous locus of interest by homologous recombination of PCR products from the respective tagging vectors using selectable drug markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Growth conditions</title><p>Cells were grown at 30°C and 160 rpm in yeast extract–peptone–2% glucose (YPD) medium unless otherwise indicated. Strains were streaked from glycerol stocks onto 2% agar YPD plates and grown at 30°C for 2–3 days. An isolated colony was then grown overnight in 25 ml of YPD. This pre-culture was used to inoculate 25 ml of YPD at an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2, which was grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6–0.8 for chromatin analysis. Yeast containing nonintegrating plasmids (p416) were grown in SD (-)Ura overnight, diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 in YPD and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6–0.8 for chromatin analysis. Cells were then fixed with 1% formaldehyde and harvested for chromatin analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Yeast strains containing the Isw2 variants of interest appended with a FLAG tag were grown at 30°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1. Yeast were pelleted, washed with binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid], 0.1 mM EDTA [ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid], 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20% glycerol, 0.02% NP-40, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF [phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride], 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Expedeon, Cambridge UK]), and then lysed via cryogrinding. Yeast powder was incubated with binding buffer for 90 min before the addition of 200 μl bed volume anti-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma M2; Sigma, St. Louis MO USA). After 3 hr incubation at 4°C, beads were collected with magnets and washed three times with binding buffer and three times with elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20% glycerol, 0.02% NP-40, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Expedeon, Cambridge UK]). A 0.5 mg/ml solution of FLAG peptide in 100 ml elution buffer was then added to the beads and allowed to incubate for 30 min. This process was repeated three more times for a total of four elutions. Elutions were analyzed by silver staining and combined by estimated purity for aliquoting and storage at −80°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nucleosome sliding assay</title><p>Sliding assays were performed at least three independent times with reproducible results.</p><p>Recombinant yeast histones were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luger et al., 1999</xref>) and dialyzed by gradient salt dialysis onto the Widom 601 positioning sequence to create end-positioned nucleosomes with 60 base pairs of linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>). Nucleosome sliding was performed at 25°C in sliding buffer (50 mM KCl, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% sucrose, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, with or without 5 mM ATP) by incubating 1 ml or 1.5 ml of purified Isw2 with 12.5 nM reconstituted mononucleosomes for 40 min in 6 ml reaction volume. Reactions were quenched by diluting 1:2 with solution containing 3 mM competitor DNA and 5% sucrose. Native PAGE (6%) was used to separate the positioning of the mononucleosomes, with Cy5.5-labeled nucleosomal DNA detected by a LiCor Odyssey FC imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln NE USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Micrococcal nuclease digestions and library construction</title><p>Micrococcal nuclease digestions were performed with a minimum of two biological replicates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown to mid-log phase and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Chromatin was digested with 10, 20, and 40 units of MNase for 10 min. Proper nuclease digestion of DNA was analyzed by agarose gel, and samples with approximately 80% mononucleosomes were selected for library construction. After crosslink reversal, RNase treatment, calf intestine phosphatase (NEB, Ipswich MA, USA) treatment, and proteinase K digestion, mononucleosome-sized fragments were gel-purified and resulting DNA was used to construct libraries with the NuGEN Ovation Ultralow kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced at the University of Oregon’s Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility on an Illumina NextSeq500 on the 37 cycle, paired-end, High Output setting, yielding approximately 10–20 million paired reads per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and library construction</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with biological replicates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown to mid-log phase, fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and lysed by bead-beating in the presence of protease inhibitors. Chromatin was fragmented by shearing in a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode, Denville NJ, USA) for a total of 30 min (high output, 3 × 10′ cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off). Sonication conditions were optimized to produce an average fragment size of ∼300 base pairs. FLAG-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibody (Sigma, St. Louis MO, USA) and Protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Waltham MA, USA). After crosslink reversal and proteinase K digestion, DNA was purified using Qiagen MinElute columns and quantified by Qubit High-Sensitivity fluorometric assay. Libraries were prepared using the NuGEN Ovation Ultralow kit by the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced at the University of Oregon’s Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility on an Illumina NextSeq500 with 37 cycles of paired-end setting, yielding approximately 10 million single-end reads per sample. Only the first read (R1) of each paired read was taken for downstream alignments and processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA extraction and library construction</title><p>For RNA-Seq (minimum two biological replicates), RNA was purified by hot acid phenol extraction followed by polyA selection and strand-specific library construction using the NuGEN Universal Plus mRNA Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 on the 37 cycle, paired-end, high-output setting. Paired-end reads were quality filtered for adapter contamination and low-quality ends using trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). After quality filtering, an average of 10.5 million reads per paired-end sample remained. Surviving reads were mapped to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>) using STAR (V.2.5.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene counts were quantified from uniquely aligning reads using HTSeq (V.0.9.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Differential gene expression was performed using DESeq2 (V.1.22.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>), and expression graphs were generated using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wickham, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>MNase sequencing data were analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKnight and Tsukiyama, 2015</xref>). Briefly, paired-end reads were aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>) using Bowtie 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) and filtered computationally for unique fragments between 100 and 200 bp. Dyad positions were calculated as the midpoint of paired reads, then dyad coverage was normalized across the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome for an average read/bp of 1.0. Dyad coverage is displayed in all figures. Nucleosome alignments to transcription Ume6 binding sites were performed by taking average dyad signal at each position relative to all 202 intergenic instances of a Ume6 motif center (<italic>WNGG<underline>CG</underline>GCWW</italic>). PIC locations were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>. For ChIP-Seq data, single-end reads were aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference genome with Bowtie 2 and total read coverage was normalized such that the average read at a genomic location was 1.0. ChIP peaks were called using a 400 bp sliding window with a threshold average enrichment within the window of 3.0.

In this study, the McKnight lab use creative genetic and genomic approaches to understand how the apparently nonspecific biochemical activity of one such chromatin remodeler, Isw2, is targeted to specific nucleosomes in the budding yeast genome. The use of an isw1/chd1 mutant is a nice approach to remove the effects of spacing factors, and the SpyTag/SpyCatcher approach is a novel idea for artificial recruitment of factors. The bottom line of the study is that small, conserved epitopes in transcription factors act as recruiting elements for Isw2, allowing precise targeting of a nonspecific biochemical activity to specific genomic loci. From a larger perspective, the results lend support to an interacting barrier model of nucleosome positioning, wherein positioning of specific nucleosomes defines the borders of nucleosomal arrays. The data appear to be of high quality and soundly interpreted, and I believe that the results will be of great interest to those interested in chromatin and transcription. There are many questions raised by the results that I believe will drive further investigation into specificity in chromatin remodeling. My one major criticism (not that major in the scheme of things) is that the authors analyze the interesting subsets of their sites, as detailed below. One example is the analysis of the Isw2/Itc2 co-bound sites to the exclusion of the Isw2-alone sites. I think some exploration of these sites would be warranted, as discussed below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In Figure S1C, there is nice correspondence between strong Isw2 K215R binding and Isw2-dependent nucleosome remodeling. However, at PICs where there is no apparent Isw2 remodeling, there does seem to be some Isw2 K215R ChIP-seq signal, albeit at a lower level. Does this potentially represent capture of transient sampling-type interactions, or something else?</p><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Ume6 ChIP (WT and DBD alone) is shown at 202 intergenic Ume6 motifs. It is stated that the rows are linked with Figure 1B – it would be nice to see the nucleosome data next to the ChIP data in this panel, as it appears that Ume6 is bound to at some level to the majority of these 202 sites, while Isw2 seems only to be active at the 58 sites of cluster 1. Germane to this point, I of course understand why the authors focused on the cluster 1 sites, but it would be nice to have some speculation on why Isw2 only seems to function at a fraction of Ume6-bound loci. Also, the lengths of the cluster-denoting bars appear to be off here relative to Figure 1B.</p><p>3) In Figure 5C, it appears that only a subset of Isw2 sites are bound by Itc1 as well. Again, as with the selection of the 58 Ume6 sites, I understand why the Isw2/Itc1 co-bound sites are selected for further analysis, but the Isw2 sites without Itc1 could be discussed as well. Are these sites non-functional? How does Itc1 ChIP-seq data compare to the Isw2 remodeling activity shown in Figure 1A? How does it compare to Ume6 binding? Does it specify the Isw2-remodeled nucleosomes?</p><p>4) Did the authors perform western blots to ensure that their various truncation constructs were stable? This is important for interpretation of the results vs deletions.</p><p>5) To summarize the above points, a major thing missing from the discussion is why only subsets of TF binding sites recruit Isw2. For instance, as mentioned above, 58 Ume6 sites seem to specific Isw2 remodeling – what is special about those sites versus the other ~150 sites that appear to be bound by Ume6? It's mentioned briefly in the discussion that only three Swi6 sites were identified as Isw2-recruiting and that this may be tuned by cellular context, but this is quite vague and superficial. More speculation on what differentiates these sites from the TF-bound but non-Isw2 recruiting sites could be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64061.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In Figure S1C, there is nice correspondence between strong Isw2 K215R binding and Isw2-dependent nucleosome remodeling.

As you have suggested, it is possible that crosslinking in the ChIP experiment captures transient interactions, indicative of a sampling process. We do believe that this sampling likely occurs, as we have observed that Isw2 is able to nonspecifically bind histones and DNA, but that remodeling only occurs when there is a specific/stable interaction. However, we are reluctant to draw specific conclusions from the ChIP data due to the noise in the sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Ume6 ChIP (WT and DBD alone) is shown at 202 intergenic Ume6 motifs.

Figure 1B actually shows that both Cluster 1 and Cluster 3 have Isw2-dependent nucleosome shifts; those in Cluster 3 are shifted in the opposite direction, but the Ume6-proximal nucleosomes are consistently more distal to the URS in the absence of Isw2 than in the presence of Isw2. We have updated the language in the second paragraph of the Results section of the text to make this more clear.</p><p>We believe that there are several reasons that Isw2 is not active at cluster 2 URS sites. Many of these sites show reduced Ume6 binding, according to our ChIP data, which could in turn lead to the inability to recruit the Isw2 complex. We also suspect that, at least for a subset of these sites, Isw2 is recruited to the motif but the nearest nucleosome is out of reach of the remodeling complex, resulting in an unproductive binding event; we have added this idea to the end of paragraph two of the Results section. We would like to explore this concept further in the future but we feel it is outside the scope of this publication.</p><p>We have also adjusted the bar for cluster 1 in Figure 1—figure supplement 3, which was incorrect, to reflect the appropriate clustering as shown in Figure 1B. Thank you for pointing out this discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5C, it appears that only a subset of Isw2 sites are bound by Itc1 as well.

We attempted to analyze the Itc1-FLAG ChIP-seq data, but unfortunately we were unable to replicate the exact processing that was used for the original heatmaps, so we could not link the rows to the prior data; therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions from this analysis. However, as we have demonstrated, there are factors other than Ume6 that interact with the Isw2 complex, and we predict that there are many more factors that target Isw2 to specific subsets of sites in the genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors perform western blots to ensure that their various truncation constructs were stable? This is important for interpretation of the results vs deletions.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that Western blots are generally standard to show evidence of functional protein, but full-length Ume6 is largely unstructured, making it very unstable outside of the cell so that it degrades rapidly, thus we have been unable to get a satisfactory Western blot of full-length Ume6 or the truncations. However, the ChIP-seq data for the truncated Ume6 constructs recapitulates the data from wild type, which we believe is strong evidence that these truncations are stable, since they occupy the same sites in the genome as full-length Ume6. We have added heatmaps of this data to Figure 1—figure supplement 3 to further strengthen this evidence.</p><p>We have purified the Isw2 complex with a more truncated Itc1 construct (∆9-374) for use in some in vitro sliding assays, and the remodeler complex with that truncated Itc1 functions in the same way as the wild type complex; we predict that constructs with fewer amino acids deleted would be less disruptive, and therefore expect all of our truncations are stably folded. We believe the ChIP data for Itc1(1-73) and Itc1(1-132) shown in Figure 5B is also good evidence that these constructs are stable, as they show similar localization to wild type Itc1. There are differences, which we highlight, but it seems unlikely that these differences are the result in protein stability as one would expect a more global change in that case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To summarize the above points, a major thing missing from the discussion is why only subsets of TF binding sites recruit Isw2.

We have been reluctant to speculate without more concrete data, but we have added language in the final paragraph of the Discussion section of the manuscript to indicate that this is something we have thought about and suggest our ideas on the matter. It is a complex tertiary interaction, which requires assembly of all the necessary elements (the components of the Isw2 complex, along with a recruiting transcription factor, such as Ume6) at the same time. It is likely that there are simply few genomic loci which have all the right pieces of the puzzle in the right place at the right time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
