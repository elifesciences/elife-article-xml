This study shows that muscle activation involves the following sequence of structural changes: thin filament activation, disruption of the helical array of myosin motors characteristic of resting muscle, release of myosin motor domains from the folded conformation on the filament backbone, and actin attachment. Physiological force generation in the ‘twitch’ response of skeletal muscle to single action potential stimulation is limited by incomplete activation of the thick filament and the rapid inactivation of both filaments.

This, in turn, initiates a change in the thin filament structure in which tropomyosin moves from its blocking position in resting muscle, allowing myosin head or motor domains from the thick filaments to bind to actin and generate force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>). The duration of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient is much briefer than the mechanical response in the twitch, but peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is an order of magnitude larger than the dissociation constant of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory sites on troponin, which become fully occupied with a delay of less than 1 ms after peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in mammalian muscle at 28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>). The movement of tropomyosin in the thin filament is also much faster than force development, with a half-time of about 5 ms as determined by time-resolved X-ray diffraction in amphibian fast-twitch muscles at 22°C, conditions in which the twitch duration is about 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kress et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>Although the thin filaments are rapidly and fully activated in the twitch, the peak force in the twitch is much less than that produced at full activation, as produced in intact muscles by repetitive high-frequency stimulation in a tetanus. The force at the tetanus plateau is about four times larger than that at the peak of the twitch in mammalian fast-twitch muscles at near-physiological temperature. Tetanic stimulation increases the duration, but not the peak amplitude, of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient or the peak occupancy of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory sites on troponin compared to that in the twitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>). It follows that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient provides a ‘start’ signal for contraction but does not control either the amplitude or the time course of the twitch in skeletal muscle.</p><p>What molecular mechanisms do then determine the strength and speed of the twitch? The rate of force development is effectively limited by the rate of binding of myosin motors to thin filaments, as determined from the time course of instantaneous stiffness during force development in tetani of amphibian muscle at 4°C after taking filament compliances into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fusi et al., 2014a</xref>). The question then becomes ‘What determines the rate at which myosin motors bind to thin filaments?’ One possibility, suggested by mechanical and biochemical studies on demembranated muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Eisenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldman, 1987</xref>), is that a rate-limiting biochemical step in the actin-bound motor controls the transition between weakly and strongly actin-bound states, the latter being detected by the instantaneous stiffness measurements and required for active force generation.</p><p>An alternative or additional possibility emerged more recently from accumulating evidence that the thick filament also has a regulatory role. In resting muscle, the myosin motors are not available to interact with actin and generate contraction because they are folded back against the filament backbone in a helical array stabilised by interactions with other myosin motors and other thick filament components, including myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C) and titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irving, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>). This thick filament ‘off’ state, sometimes described as the ‘super-relaxed’ state, minimises ATP hydrolysis and the associated whole-body metabolic cost in resting muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>), but its existence raises the question of how the <italic>thick</italic> filament, which does not appear to have a direct calcium signalling mechanism, is activated by electrical stimulation. Part of the answer to that question was provided by the discovery that the thick filament can be directly activated by mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fusi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linari et al., 2015</xref>). More generally, X-ray studies of the rising phase of the tetanus in amphibian muscle at 4°C showed that switching on the thick filaments is faster than force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reconditi et al., 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which the thick filament is switched on during a twitch, or controls the strength and dynamics of the twitch, has not been investigated.</p><p>Finally, the mechanisms that control the strength and speed of contraction in the twitch cannot be separated from those that control relaxation. From the perspective of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, and thin filament regulation, almost the entire time course of the twitch force occurs after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> has returned almost to baseline, although there may be a small, slow tail in the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caputo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konishi, 1998</xref>), which, even at a very small fraction of the peak, could significantly slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation from troponin. Moreover, the thin filament may not switch off immediately after Ca<sup>2+</sup> has dissociated from troponin because myosin motors that remain bound to actin would hold tropomyosin in its ‘on’ position in the thin filament. Changes in the length of intact muscle fibres during relaxation alter the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caputo et al., 1994</xref>), implying that the extent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] binding to the thin filament during relaxation is sensitive to muscle length or load. Thick filament mechano-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linari et al., 2015</xref>) could also contribute to maintaining the ‘on’ state of the thick filament during relaxation. In isolated myofibrils and in single fibres from amphibian muscle, relaxation can be clearly separated into a slow, almost linear phase in which sarcomere lengths remain almost constant (‘isometric relaxation’) followed by mechanical yielding and rapid ‘chaotic relaxation’ in which the remaining force is rapidly lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poggesi et al., 2005</xref>). The extent to which this phenomenon contributes to the time course of relaxation in intact, fast-twitch mammalian muscle fibres at more physiologically relevant temperatures is unknown.</p><p>Here we used time-resolved X-ray diffraction of intact, electrically stimulated, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of mice to address these fundamental gaps in understanding the mechanisms that determine the amplitude and complete time course of the twitch in mammalian muscle, focusing on the X-ray reflections that report the structure and regulatory state of the thick filaments and the conformations of the myosin motors. The results are complementary to those of a pioneering time-resolved X-ray study of twitch and tetanus in amphibian muscle that focused on the thin filament-based X-ray reflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kress et al., 1986</xref>). All of the present measurements on mouse EDL muscle were made at 28°C, a temperature at which the muscles contract reproducibly as required for signal averaging in X-ray experiments. Moreover, the time course of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient and its binding to troponin has been characterised in mouse EDL at 28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>), and the peak force is very close to that at the mammalian body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caremani et al., 2019</xref>). Most importantly, the off structure of the thick filament is preserved in mammalian muscle at this temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caremani et al., 2021</xref>), in contrast with nearly all the published studies of thin filament regulation, for example, those using pCa titrations with steady-state Ca buffering in skinned muscle fibres, which were made at a relatively low temperature in order to minimise the irreversible effects of sustained high levels of activation at a high temperature. The role of thick filament regulation was inadvertently excluded from such experiments, because the thick filaments were already switched on at the low temperature used, even in the absence of calcium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sarcomere length changes during twitch and tetanic contractions at a fixed muscle length</title><p>The I22 beamline at the Diamond Light Source allows the X-ray diffraction pattern from intact muscles to be collected over a wide range of diffraction angles, corresponding to structural periodicities from about 300 to 5 nm.

The functional significance of these structural changes is clearer for tetanus than for twitch, in which activation and relaxation are clearly separated by a period of steady-state sarcomere-isometric contraction in which the thin filaments are maximally activated by calcium. Changes in thick filament structure during the tetanus can be correlated with force changes in five sequential phases, which we refer to as activation, tetanus plateau, isometric relaxation, chaotic relaxation, and mechanically relaxed, where the latter is distinct from the resting state achieved several minutes after a previous contraction. Where analogous protocols have been employed, the changes in the thick-filament-based X-ray reflections in these five phases are qualitatively similar to those described previously in fast-twitch amphibian muscles, as described below. The structural mechanisms of thick filament regulation in skeletal muscle have been well conserved across evolution in these species, and this allows the present results to be integrated into the large body of physiological, structural, and mechanical studies on isolated single fibres of amphibian muscle, exploiting the greater homogeneity and lower end-compliance of that preparation. However, most of the published X-ray studies on amphibian muscle fibres were conducted before the significance of thick-filament-based regulation was appreciated; so the synthesis leads to new insights into the underlying mechanisms. No previous muscle X-ray study, to our knowledge, has considered the five phases of the tetanus together or related those phases to the unitary physiological response of skeletal muscle to a single nerve impulse, the twitch.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Activation</title><p>The fastest changes in thick filament structure during activation are the loss of the helical order of the myosin motors, signalled by the ML1 reflection, and the elongation of the filament backbone, signalled by <italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub>. The fraction of molecules in a given conformation is proportional to the amplitude (<italic>A</italic>) of an X-ray reflection, the square root of its intensity. Therefore, the half-time for the loss of the helical order of the myosin motors during the tetanus rise was estimated from the change in <italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub>, which has a half-time of about 8 ms, the same as that of <italic>S</italic><sub>M6 </sub>(<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). A second group of signals, including the equatorial intensity ratio (<italic>I</italic><sub>1,1</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>1,0</sub>), the fractional intensity of the LA peak of the M3 reflection (<italic>L</italic><sub>M3</sub>), and the axial spacing of the myosin motors (<italic>S</italic><sub>M3</sub>), have half-times that are slightly slower, about 11 ms. Moreover, in the early activation time-frame, centred at 6.5 ms after the stimulus, <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> had reduced by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, green), but there was no axial movement of the centre of mass of the myosin motors (<italic>hbz</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), strongly suggesting that the helical order of the myosin motors is lost <italic>before</italic> their release from the folded conformation on the filament backbone. At the time resolution of these experiments, the change in the spacing of the filament backbone (<italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub>) is synchronous with the loss of helical order of the motors, whereas the axial periodicity of the motors (<italic>S</italic><sub>M3</sub>) and their radial motion (<italic>I</italic><sub>1,1</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>1,0</sub>) are synchronous with the loss of the folded population.</p><p>The amplitude of the first actin layer line (<italic>A</italic><sub>AL1</sub>), signalling myosin motor binding to the thin filaments, has a half-time of 15 ms, similar to that of force. The only X-ray signal that is slower than force is <italic>A</italic><sub>M3</sub> (half-time, 21 ms), and this is likely related to its biphasic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), with a fast decreasing phase followed by a slower rising phase.</p><p>This sequence of structural changes during activation is similar to that reported for single fast-twitch fibres from frog skeletal muscle at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piazzesi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reconditi et al., 2011</xref>), although all the changes are about three times faster in the conditions of the present experiments. Sarcomeres shortened by about 12% during the tetanus rise in these experiments, much larger than the typical 2% in previous studies on single fibres from frog muscle. Sarcomere shortening delays force development and the X-ray signals associated with the loss of the helical order of the myosin motors to the same extent, and the relationship between force and those X-ray signals is unaffected by imposing an additional ~5% shortening at the start of force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linari et al., 2015</xref>). The half-time measured for thick filament activation in the present experiments, about 8 ms, may therefore underestimate the speed of this process under sarcomere-isometric conditions by a few milliseconds, but the above conclusions about the relative time courses of the various structural changes and force development would not be affected by the greater sarcomere shortening in mouse EDL muscle.</p><p>The fastest structural changes in the thick filaments, those reported by <italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub>, are slower than calcium activation of the thin filaments. The peak of the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient is only 2.0 ms after the stimulus in mouse EDL muscle at 28°C, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to troponin lags this by less than 1 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>). Fluorescent probes on troponin in demembranated fibres from rabbit psoas muscle showed that the rate of calcium-binding in response to a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] jump is greater than 1000 s<sup>−1</sup> at 12°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fusi et al., 2014b</xref>). The half-time of the subsequent azimuthal rotation of tropomyosin around the thin filaments can be estimated by X-ray diffraction from changes in the amplitude of the second actin layer line reflection (<italic>A</italic><sub>AL2</sub>), which lies outside the detector in the present experiments. In frog sartorius muscle at 22°C, the half-time of the increase in <italic>A</italic><sub>AL2</sub> was less than 4 ms, about twice as fast as the change in <italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub> in those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kress et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the thick filaments in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, therefore, has two structural components with time courses intermediate between those of thin filament activation and attachment of myosin motors to actin. The delay between thick filament activation and actin attachment is thought to be the result of a structural or biochemical transition in the myosin head in which its catalytic domain becomes strongly bound to actin in a state capable of generating force or filament sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Eisenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldman, 1987</xref>). The delays between thin filament activation and the two components of thick filament activation are less well understood, as is the underlying mechanism of inter-filament signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irving, 2017</xref>). The transient appearance of the star peak, corresponding to an axial periodicity of 14.85 nm, suggests that this mechanism may be linked to the two closely spaced axial periodicities in the thick filament, the canonical 43 nm periodicity generated by the axial packing of the myosin tails and a longer, ~45.5-nm, periodicity associated with the region of the half-filament associated with a distinct titin-super-repeat in the region of the thick filament containing MyBP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caremani et al., 2021</xref>). The simple single-periodicity structural model of the thick filament that we used to fit the main part of the M3 reflection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) only considered the third order of the 43 nm periodicity. The simple model does not reproduce the star peak and does not use the structural information contained in other parts of the X-ray diffraction pattern, including the M6 reflection, the M1 and M2 meridional reflections that would not be produced by a perfect 43 nm helix, and the myosin layer lines. No structural model has yet been developed that can quantitatively reproduce all these features, in any state of a muscle. Such a model would have many more adjustable parameters than the parsimonious model used here, and X-ray data with a higher spatial resolution and signal:noise ratio would probably be required to separate and accurately characterise the interference peaks associated with structural components with different periodicities in distinct zones of the thick filament, in an attempt to constrain those parameters. New synchrotron beam lines and X-ray detectors may allow suitable data to be collected in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The tetanus plateau</title><p>The thin filaments are fully activated at the tetanus plateau, and about 30% of the myosin motors are likely to be strongly attached to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caremani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linari et al., 2007</xref>). Modelling the axial profile of the M3 reflection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) showed that the average movement of the centre of mass of the myosin motors between the resting state and the tetanus plateau was 11 nm, the same as that reported previously for single fibres from amphibian muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reconditi et al., 2011</xref>), in which the conformation of the motors at the tetanus plateau had been determined by perturbation experiments using length or load steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irving et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piazzesi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piazzesi et al., 2002</xref>). Given the similarity of sarcomere structure and filament protein isoforms in the two muscle types, it seems very likely that the conformation of both the actin-bound myosin motors at the tetanus plateau and their helical folded conformation in resting muscle is the same in amphibians and mammals.</p><p>It is not clear whether there is a residual population of helical or folded motors at the tetanus plateau. The intensity of the ML1 reflection, the X-ray signature of the helical packing of the motors in resting muscle, is about 10% of its resting value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caremani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). Although it is difficult to exclude the possibility that this is due to a population of fibres in the EDL muscle that were not activated by the stimulus, the presence of a similar residual <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> at the tetanus plateau in single fibres from frog muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reconditi et al., 2011</xref>) suggests that it may be a general property of fully activated fibres. If the residual <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> were due to a population of myosin motors remaining in the resting conformation at the tetanus plateau, about one-third of motors would remain in that conformation (<italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub> is 0.35 ± 0.03; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A slightly higher estimate was obtained from the residual intensity of the fourth myosin layer line in mouse EDL muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). Since about 30% of motors are actin-attached, and their partners in the same myosin molecule would account for another 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caremani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piazzesi et al., 2002</xref>), these estimates would account for all the motors, leaving no disordered motors at the tetanus plateau. However, an alternative explanation would be that the region of the myosin motors close to the head-rod junction retains its helical order during activation, although the catalytic domains have lost that order as a result of actin-binding and changes in head conformation. It is also possible that the residual <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> at the tetanus plateau is associated with another thick filament component that takes up the myosin helical periodicity. Further assessment of those explanations would require further structural modelling constrained by additional in situ structural data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Isometric relaxation</title><p>Isometric relaxation was first characterised in single fibres from amphibian muscle as a relatively slow, almost linear phase of force decline to about half the tetanus plateau value at a constant sarcomere length after the end of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunello et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edman and Flitney, 1982</xref>). Subsequent studies on isolated myofibrils showed that the rate of isometric relaxation is not limited by the rate of removal of calcium from the intracellular solution but by the isometric rate of detachment of myosin motors from actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poggesi et al., 2005</xref>). In intact muscle fibres, the initial rate of dissociation of calcium from troponin following electrical stimulation is fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caputo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konishi, 1998</xref>) and has been estimated as about 200 s<sup>−1</sup> in mouse EDL at 28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>). Thin filament inactivation may be slower than this if the remaining actin-bound myosin motors prevent tropomyosin from returning to its off position. In amphibian muscle, the amplitude of the second actin layer line recovers slightly faster than force during early relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kress et al., 1986</xref>) but, as discussed by those authors, the difference may be explained by faster inactivation in the segment of the thin filament that does not overlap with thick filaments. Therefore, the available data seem consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of isometric relaxation is limited by that of motor detachment from actin.</p><p>Mouse EDL muscles do not show a clear linear phase or ‘shoulder’ in the time course of mechanical relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and a sarcomere-isometric phase of relaxation has not been reported previously to our knowledge, probably because it is difficult to measure the sarcomere length in these muscles by diffraction of visible light. However, ultra-low-angle X-ray diffraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) shows that sarcomeres in mouse EDL muscle <italic>do</italic> remain precisely isometric for the first ~20 ms after the last stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while force decays to about 80% of its plateau value at a progressively increasing rate. <italic>I</italic><sub>1,1</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>1,0</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>AL1</sub> decrease during isometric relaxation, signalling detachment of myosin motors from thin filaments.</p><p>In contrast with the X-ray signals related to detachment of myosin motors from actin, those related to the regulatory state of the thick filament, including <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>1,0</sub>, and <italic>S</italic><sub>M3</sub>, and the fractional intensities of the sub-peaks of the M3 reflection do not recover during isometric relaxation; there is no detectable recovery of the helical or folded motor conformations characteristic of resting muscle.

The possible origins of these recovery deficits are discussed in the following section.</p><p>The overall half-time of the detachment of myosin motors from actin during isometric and chaotic relaxation estimated from <italic>A</italic><sub>AL1</sub>, about 23 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), or from <italic>I</italic><sub>1,1</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>1,0</sub> (30ms), is similar to that of mechanical relaxation itself (27 ms). There was no clear evidence that the rate of detachment estimated from these two X-ray parameters increased on the transition to chaotic relaxation, as might be expected from filament sliding in the latter phase. Recovery of the helical order of the motors during chaotic relaxation, as assessed by <italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub>, is slower, with a half-time of about 42 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), indicating a significant delay between motor detachment and reformation of the helically ordered resting state. This delay is much smaller than that reported for relaxation of mouse soleus muscle at 22°C, in which the half-time of force relaxation was 210 ms, but that for <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> recovery was 430 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Isometric and chaotic relaxation was not resolved after a tetanus in mouse soleus muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Delayed recovery of the thick filament structure characteristic of resting muscle</title><p>The incomplete recovery of <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> during mechanical relaxation shows that the helical order of the motors characteristic of resting muscle had not recovered when force was close to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Only about 80% of motors had regained that conformation as estimated by <italic>A</italic><sub>ML1</sub>. Moreover, neither <italic>I</italic><sub>ML1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) nor <italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) recovered further in the remainder of the X-ray sampling period, which ended approximately 130 ms after the last stimulus. In contrast, the axial profile of the M3 reflection and the inferred average centre of mass of the myosin motors had completely recovered at mechanical relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), showing that the myosin motors had folded back against the filament backbone but had not fully reformed the resting helix. Mean sarcomere length had recovered almost to its resting value at the end of chaotic relaxation, but the intensity of the sarcomere reflections remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating maintained sarcomere heterogeneity. The spacing of the inter-filament lattice (<italic>d</italic><sub>1,0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) had also not recovered to its resting value. The incomplete recovery of the helical packing of myosin motors is unlikely due to sarcomere inhomogeneity or the expanded filament lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caremani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reconditi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The incomplete recovery of helical packing of myosin motors after mechanical relaxation is likely to be the structural correlate of the enhanced twitch force observed after a tetanus, post-tetanic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Close et al., 1968</xref>). Myosin motors that have not returned to the helical array would be expected to be recruited more readily by a subsequent stimulus, leading to an enhanced twitch response. Post-tetanic potentiation has been attributed to enhanced phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) and, by inference, to release of some myosin motors from the helical array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamm and Stull, 2011</xref>), raising the possibility that the incomplete recovery of the helical array is related to RLC phosphorylation during the tetanus. However, the likely extent of phosphorylation in the present experiments makes this explanation seem implausible. During a 2 s tetanus of mouse EDL muscle at 30°C, RLC phosphorylation increases from about 0.1 to 0.5 mol/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhi et al., 2005</xref>). If the extent of phosphorylation is proportional to tetanus duration, as expected for a slow calcium-activated kinase, it would have increased by about 0.02 mol/mol in the present experiments, which seems too small to be responsible for the 20% of myosin motors not returning to the helical array.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the incomplete recovery of the helical array after a 100 ms tetanus would be that the structural changes in myosin motors and other thick filament components required to reform this state are intrinsically slow on the 100 ms timescale. However, the observation that the return to the helical array induced by unloaded shortening from the tetanus plateau is already half-complete in about 40 ms in frog muscle fibres at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linari et al., 2015</xref>) argues against this explanation in its simplest form.</p><p>Another, perhaps more likely, explanation would be that return of the thick filament to the helical array after a tetanus may be slow because the <italic>thin</italic> filament is not fully off at this time. Several previous studies have reported a slow tail in intracellular free calcium transients following a short tetanus, in both mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calderón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollingworth et al., 1996</xref>) and amphibian fast-twitch muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caputo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konishi, 1998</xref>). Fast-twitch fibres from both amphibian and mammalian muscles contain millimolar concentrations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchange buffer parvalbumin, which binds Mg<sup>2+</sup> in resting muscle. During a tetanus, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is replaced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hou et al., 1991</xref>), and the slow release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from parvalbumin would maintain [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] above its resting level on the timescale of seconds after the tetanus. Although the magnitude and time course of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and the activation state of the thin filament after short tetani in the conditions of the present experiments are incompletely characterised, it seems plausible that the incomplete recovery of thick filament structure described above might be related at least in part to that of the thin filament.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Thick-filament control of the strength and dynamics of the twitch</title><p>Peak force in a twitch is only about one-quarter of that produced during steady full activation at the tetanus plateau in mouse EDL muscle at 28°C. The X-ray data presented above show that this is primarily due to the lower fraction of myosin motors attached to actin at the peak of the twitch, in comparison with the ~30% of motors attached at the tetanus plateau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caremani et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>I</italic><sub>M3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and <italic>I</italic><sub>AL1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) actually <italic>decrease</italic> in the twitch, in contrast with their threefold increases at the tetanus plateau. The intensity of the equatorial (1,1) reflection was almost unchanged during the twitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), again suggesting a very low fraction of actin-attached motors. The average motor conformation at the peak of the twitch estimated from the axial profile of the M3 reflection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) was also distinct from that at the tetanus plateau, suggesting a small fraction of actin-attached motors combined with a broader range of motor conformations.</p><p>The conclusion that the lower force in the twitch is associated with a relatively small number of actin-attached motors is supported by the low number of ATP molecules hydrolysed in a twitch. Heat production in a fixed-end twitch of mouse EDL at 20°C is about 8 mJ/g muscle wet weight, and about half of this is due to the myosin-actin ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leijendekker et al., 1987</xref>). This corresponds to about 0.6 ATP molecules hydrolysed per myosin motor, as calculated from the molar enthalpy of phosphocreatine splitting, which buffers ATP hydrolysis in situ, muscle density, and the number of motors per cm<sup>3</sup> of the muscle, estimated as 1.04 × 10<sup>17</sup> for mouse EDL from well-known parameters of muscle ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barclay et al., 2010</xref>). The mammalian muscle twitch is therefore driven by a fraction of the myosin motors present. The interference fine structure of the M3 reflection suggested that the active motors are preferentially located in the central region of each half filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Despite the low force and number of actin-attached motors, the calcium regulatory sites on troponin in the thin filaments are likely to be fully occupied, albeit transiently, at the peak of the twitch. Peak intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is almost the same in the twitch and tetanus, and calcium binding to troponin is fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>). In contrast, <italic>thick</italic> filaments are not fully activated at the peak of the twitch. Although the helical array of myosin motors has been disrupted, as signalled by the decreased intensity of the ML1 layer line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a significant fraction of motors remain folded back onto the filament surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), making them unavailable for binding to the activated thin filament. The low level of thick filament activation is at least partially responsible for the low fraction of actin-attached motors and force in the twitch.</p><p>Although the rate of force development in a twitch, like that in a tetanus, is limited by the rate of thick filament activation and actin attachment, the overall duration of the twitch is primarily determined by the brevity of thin filament activation. The calcium transient has a half-time of only about 2 ms at 28°C. The half-time of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation from troponin is about 50 ms in mouse EDL at 16°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylor and Hollingworth, 2003</xref>), likely corresponding to about 25 ms at 28°C, close to the half-time of force relaxation in the twitch at this temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The intensity of the AL2 layer line associated with tropomyosin movement in a twitch of frog muscle has a half-time of about 36 ms at 24°C, slightly faster than force relaxation (45 ms) in those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kress et al., 1986</xref>). Thick filament inactivation in the twitch as monitored by the ML1 layer line has a half-time of about 29 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), only slightly slower than force relaxation and <italic>thin</italic> filament inactivation as estimated above. Thus, in contrast with the delayed thick filament inactivation during isometric relaxation after a tetanus, thick and thin filament inactivation in twitch relaxation is almost synchronous.</p><p>In summary, the force generated in the twitch—the unitary physiological response of skeletal muscle to action potential stimulation—is partly limited by the incomplete activation of the thick filament, although thin filament activation is transiently complete. The rate of attachment of myosin motors to actin, resolved more clearly in the tetanus, is also partly limited by thick filament activation. Thin and thick filament <italic>inactivation</italic> are rapid and synchronous within the time resolution of current data, and this also contributes to the low fraction of myosin motors attached to actin and peak force in the twitch. This dual-filament description of the regulation of muscle contraction extends the previous narrower focus on structural changes in the thin filament and establishes a physiological structural and functional framework for testing small molecules as potential therapeutics for muscle weakness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male mice (strain C57BL/6J) aged 4–6 weeks were housed at MRC Harwell in groups of four to five in 12:12 hr light:dark cycles at 50% relative humidity, with ad libitum access to water and a standard lab diet.

They provide evidence that thick filaments are not fully activated during a twitch contraction and that there are differences in how fast myosins can resume there resting positions on the thick filament backbone for twitch versus tetanic contraction of a fast twitch mammalian muscle The data also allow estimations of populations shifts of myosin states, e.g. resting disordered and actin bound, in different contraction and relaxed conditions.

This report provides equivalent measurements from mammalian muscle and improves on previous measurements in which the sarcomere length was measured by laser diffraction simultaneous with those structures probed by the X-ray diagram. This report measured sarcomere length from the set of very low angle X-ray reflections that come from the sarcomere length itself. Thus, the high angle measurements describing the changes in the thick filament and the myosin heads and the low angle measurements providing the sarcomere length all come from the same region of the muscle at the same time using the same irradiation. The authors have also carefully controlled temperature which has a disordering effect on the myosin head arrangement in mammalian muscle. Consequently, more insightful interpretations are possible from these data.</p><p>Decades of study of the X-ray diffraction from mammalian striated muscle has established what information is reported by many of the key reflections. The equatorial 1,0 reflection generally reports mass at the thick filament position, and the 1,1 generally reports mass at the thin filament position; when the 1,0 reflection goes down, the 1,1 reflection goes up showing mass movement toward the thin filament. If tension rises when this occurs, it means myosin heads are binding actin strongly and producing tension. The myosin first layer line reports the ordering of myosin heads around the thick filament, the actin first layer line reports myosin heads binding actin. The M6 meridional reflection reports on homogeneity of the 14.3 nm periods on the thick filament and changes in this average spacing, which generally are believed to indicate activation of the thick filament. This paper puts the relative timing of these changes on a firmer footing as well as establishes that relaxation following a tetanus occurs slowly, thereby leaving the myosin heads in a potentiated state where a subsequent contraction can be produced more quickly.</p><p>The changes in the M6 reflection are somewhat unexpected. The plots showing the axial profile show the normalized peak intensity dropping but the width does not change much, yet the integrated intensity appears to remain rather constant throughout the whole process. If the muscle shortens, expectation is that the increase in the number of repeats brought about by the shortening should increase the integrated intensity if there is a large enough shortening. If the peak intensity drops, there should be an increase somewhere else to keep the integrated intensity constant, radial broadening (?), to compensate yet the graphs do not seem to bear this out. The spacing increase occurs quickly and precedes force development, further attesting to the early observations that the spacing change was due to activation, not tension development. The novel observation of this experiment is that recovery to the resting value is very slow, not occurring even 120 msec following recovery to resting tension. The time constant of the relaxation phase is very different from the activation phase, thus leaving the muscle in a potentiated state.</p><p>There are plenty of novel observations in this manuscript which should serve as good food for thought toward an understanding of striated muscle contraction.</p><p>Data availability: The authors provide Excel spread sheets giving the intensity data etc. The actual X-ray videos themselves are not provided. However, I believe there is no public depository for such data that I am aware of, though there should be. Possibly, the BioCAT (Tom Irving) is making progress on creating such a depository.</p><p>When the reader sees Figure 4A,B, the change in peak height and spacing is their first impression while Figure 4C and the text suggests no change in intensity. It is quite unbelievable that the red curves and the cyan curves in Figure 4A,B have the same integrated intensity; they have very different peak intensities. It might be a good idea to clarify that the peak intensity falls, but the integrated intensity remains constant if indeed that is what is meant. Since the integrated intensity would be a function of the number of diffracting entities, the peak intensity would be a measure of how similar in spacing these entities are. The myosin heads assume very different structures during relaxation and activation, some so disordered that they don't contribute to the intensity of reflections that report myosin head structure. The M6, however, is reporting on the backbone structure, which due to the packing of myosin coiled-coil domains, has far less freedom for structural change other than to change length either homogeneously or heterogeneously. Heterogeneity in the spacing would reduce the peak intensity and increase the axial width of the reflection. Being a skeptical reviewer, I cannot fathom that the graphs shown in Figure 4A,B have the same intensity as attested to in Figure 4C. They have very different peak heights and roughly similar widths, yet they are said to have the same integrated intensity. I think the authors would be well advised to be careful in these comparisons, perhaps specifying peak intensity and integrated intensity in those instances where the difference might be important. I don't believe this is a niggling point. One of the main points of the paper is the thick filament tension sensing, which is a backbone issue. It may be that a more sophisticated graphical display, perhaps a 3-D graph plotting axial, radial coordinates in x and y and intensity in z for the four states would be more convincing.</p><p>The changes in the M3 reflection are also somewhat confusing. Presumably, the M3 and M6 are reporting on the spacings in the filament itself due to the arrangement of myosin molecules, yet, the M3 spacing change (1.36%) is less than the M6 spacing change (1.54%). Why is this? The M3 reports on the heads in the relaxed muscle are already irregularly spaced, but the average is the same fundamental period. How can the heads get out of sync with the tails to which they are attached? I am not sure this can be blamed on the non-myosin proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68211.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The magnitude of the delay can be estimated from the effects of imposing an additional ca 5% shortening at the start of force development in isolated frog muscle fibres (Brunello et al., 2006; Linari et al., 2015), in which the central sarcomeres shorten by typically only 2% during fixed end contractions, compared with the ca 12% in the mouse EDL muscles. Those authors found that imposition of an additional ca 5% shortening at the start of force development produced the same delay, within the precision of the measurements, in force and the activation state of the thick filament as determined by the spacing of the M6 reflection (<italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub>). In fact, there was a unique relationship between force and <italic>S</italic><sub>M6</sub> in the two protocols (Linari et al., 2015). Therefore, although sarcomere shortening does delay the structural changes reported here, it does so by the same extent as force, so conclusions related to the relative time courses are unaffected. The section of the Discussion at lines 436 to 442 of the resubmitted manuscript has been expanded to clarify and quantify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> on and off rates and subsequent kinetics of the thin filament regulatory system should be considered more carefully in regard to kinetics of the x-ray reflections.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinetics of the structural changes reported by the X-ray reflections were compared quantitatively with those of the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient in the same preparation and at the same temperature in lines 444-454 of the resubmitted manuscript. The same paragraph described the quantitative relationship with the ON rates for troponin binding as calculated from in vitro rate constants, and the in situ rate determined using caged calcium experiments with probes on troponin. The rate of the subsequent azimuthal motion of tropomyosin determined in situ from the second actin X-ray layer line was also discussed and quantitatively compared with the kinetics of the myosin-based layer lines in the same paragraph. Similar quantitative comparisons with relevant published in vitro and in situ measurements of the corresponding OFF rates (including experiments with isolated myofibrils in which it is possible to make fast decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) were made in the three paragraphs, now on lines 525-542 (isometric relaxation phase), lines 628-641 (incomplete recovery of the OFF structure after mechanical relaxation) and lines 682-695 (summary of the relative kinetics of thin and thick filament activation and inactivation) of the resubmitted manuscript. We are unaware of additional published data that could significantly further illuminate those extensive quantitative comparisons in the conditions of our experiments, although substantive empirical uncertainty remains (well recognised in the literature and discussed on lines 628-641 of the resubmitted manuscript) about a possible slow tail of the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The model of the thick filament assumes that the structures are homogeneous within each region with sharp borders between regions.

However, the potential influence on conclusions of possible more complex structural distributions should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer says, we chose a parsimonious model with parameters that could be constrained by the observed profiles of the M3 reflection at key phases of the experimental protocols used here (Figure 6). Some limitations of the simple model originally discussed on ll. 444-449 of the submitted manuscript are now expanded upon on lines 460-474 of the resubmitted manuscript, and more extensively by Caremani et al. (2021), who used the same model. There are two fundamental limitations of the model, in our view, which are related to the lack of a high-resolution structure of a vertebrate thick filament in any state. One is that the simple model does not account for the presence of multiple periodicities in the thick filament (Caremani et al., 2021), with its empirical correlate, the presence of additional sub-peaks that don’t index on the fundamental <italic>d<sub>m</sub></italic> periodicity. The other is that the model is limited to fitting the M3 reflection, and does not use the information in the other reflections, in particular the M6 reflection from the thick filament backbone, the ‘forbidden’ reflections M1 and M2, and the myosin-based layer lines. At present there is no structural model that can reproduce all these features, in any state of a muscle. However the increased spatial resolution and sensitivity available at new synchrotron beam lines with the latest detectors seems to offer the possibility to separate the interference peaks associated with the structural components in distinct zones of the thick filament with two closely-spaced periodicities, which may allow such more complete models to be constrained in future studies. These considerations have now been added to the Discussion of the present paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4 A,B and C are visually inconsistent; Figure 4A shows the M6 intensity at the selected time points of a tetanus as different but Figure 4C shows the M6 intensity as constant at literally all points.

We have now removed the confusion by replacing the profiles in Figure 4 A and B by width-corrected profiles. For consistency, we have done the same for the M3 reflection profiles in Figure 5 A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:[…] 1. Lines 32 and 42.

[…] In contrast, <italic>thick</italic> filaments are not fully activated at the peak of the twitch.” This statement is fully consistent with those on ll. 32 and 42 of the Introduction. However, it implicitly considers that the activation state of the thin filament is uniquely defined by the calcium occupancy of troponin. The reviewer is probably thinking of thin filament regulation models in which their activation state is additionally determined by the extent of myosin binding. Because the X-ray signals in the present paper only give structural information about myosin motors and filaments, they do not give new information about the possible complexity of thin filament activation. Therefore, we considered only the simplest model for thin filament activation in this paper, but we have now edited this section of the Discussion on lines 671-672 to remove our explicit assumption of that simplest model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, the role of thick filament regulation was inadvertently excluded from such experiments because the thick filaments are already switched on at low temperature, even at pCa 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In that regard we would like to point out that although, where direct comparisons can be made, results from mammalian and amphibian muscles are qualitatively similar, there is to our knowledge no published X-ray study in amphibian muscle in which twitch and tetanic contractions are compared directly. The relatively low twitch:tetanus force ratio in mammalian muscles at physiological temperature makes this distinction significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several of the reflections do not return to their pre-stimulus values promptly after the contraction.

There is a lot of speculation about phosphorylation of RLC or residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm, no substantive data are presented on these ideas.</p></disp-quote><p>We intend to investigate the time course of recovery of the fully OFF structure of the thick filament after a tetanus in future studies, and it may be informative to compare that time course with that of dephosphorylation of the RLC. However, the rate of RLC phosphorylation <italic>during</italic>tetanic stimulation in mouse EDL muscle would lead to only 2% of the RLCs being phosphorylated in the protocol used in our experiments (Zhi et al., 2005). Therefore, as argued on lines 564-578 of the submitted manuscript (lines 605-619 in the resubmitted manuscript), alternative explanations for the incomplete recovery of thick filament structure after a short tetanus should also be explored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Data availability: The authors provide Excel spread sheets giving the intensity data etc. The actual X-ray videos themselves are not provided. However, I believe there is no public depository for such data that I am aware of, though there should be. Possibly, the BioCAT (Tom Irving) is making progress on creating such a depository.</p></disp-quote><p>We will be happy to provide the time-resolved X-ray data upon request, and to deposit them in a suitable repository should one become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When the reader sees Figure 4A,B, the change in peak height and spacing is their first impression while Figure 4C and the text suggests no change in intensity. It is quite unbelievable that the red curves and the cyan curves in Figure 4A,B have the same integrated intensity; they have very different peak intensities. It might be a good idea to clarify that the peak intensity falls, but the integrated intensity remains constant if indeed that is what is meant. Since the integrated intensity would be a function of the number of diffracting entities, the peak intensity would be a measure of how similar in spacing these entities are. The myosin heads assume very different structures during relaxation and activation, some so disordered that they don't contribute to the intensity of reflections that report myosin head structure. The M6, however, is reporting on the backbone structure, which due to the packing of myosin coiled-coil domains, has far less freedom for structural change other than to change length either homogeneously or heterogeneously. Heterogeneity in the spacing would reduce the peak intensity and increase the axial width of the reflection. Being a skeptical reviewer, I cannot fathom that the graphs shown in Figure 4A,B have the same intensity as attested to in Figure 4C. They have very different peak heights and roughly similar widths, yet they are said to have the same integrated intensity. I think the authors would be well advised to be careful in these comparisons, perhaps specifying peak intensity and integrated intensity in those instances where the difference might be important. I don't believe this is a niggling point. One of the main points of the paper is the thick filament tension sensing, which is a backbone issue. It may be that a more sophisticated graphical display, perhaps a 3-D graph plotting axial, radial coordinates in x and y and intensity in z for the four states would be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The discrepancy between panels A,B and C of Figure 4 was due to <italic>I</italic><sub>M6</sub> in Figure 4C being corrected by the cross-meridional width of the reflection, whereas the axial profiles in A and B were not corrected for differences in cross-meridional width. We have now removed the confusion by replacing the profiles in A and B by width-corrected profiles. For consistency, we have done the same for the M3 reflection profiles in Figure 5A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The changes in the M3 reflection are also somewhat confusing. Presumably, the M3 and M6 are reporting on the spacings in the filament itself due to the arrangement of myosin molecules, yet, the M3 spacing change (1.36%) is less than the M6 spacing change (1.54%). Why is this? The M3 reports on the heads in the relaxed muscle are already irregularly spaced, but the average is the same fundamental period. How can the heads get out of sync with the tails to which they are attached? I am not sure this can be blamed on the non-myosin proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>In general the observed M3 and M6 spacings are not related by exactly a factor of two, e.g. in their time course during activation and relaxation, in both skeletal (Brunello et al. 2006) and heart muscle (Brunello et al. 2020), and in their sarcomere length dependence in skeletal muscle (Reconditi et al. 2014), and temperature-dependence in skeletal muscle (Caremani et al., 2019, 2021). One possible explanation is that different regions of the thick filament (e.g. the C zone vs the D zone) have slightly different axial periodicities and their relative contribution to a given reflection is not constant (Brunello et al., 2020).</p></body></sub-article></article>
