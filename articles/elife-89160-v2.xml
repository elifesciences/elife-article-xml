of photoreceptor cells. In rod photoreceptors, discs are enclosed inside the outer segment and contain deep indentations in their rims called ‘incisures’. The presence of incisures has been documented in a variety of species, yet their role remains elusive. In this study, we combined traditional electron microscopy with three-dimensional electron tomography to demonstrate that incisures are formed only after discs become completely enclosed. We also observed that, at the earliest stage of their formation, discs are not round as typically depicted but rather are highly irregular in shape and resemble expanding lamellipodia. Using genetically manipulated mice and frogs and measuring outer segment protein abundances by quantitative mass spectrometry, we further found that incisure size is determined by the molar ratio between peripherin-2, a disc rim protein critical for the process of disc enclosure, and rhodopsin, the major structural component of disc membranes. While a high perpherin-2 to rhodopsin ratio causes an increase in incisure size and structural complexity, a low ratio precludes incisure formation. Based on these data, we propose a model whereby normal rods express a modest excess of peripherin-2 over the amount required for complete disc enclosure in order to ensure that this important step of disc formation is accomplished. Once the disc is enclosed, the excess peripherin-2 incorporates into the rim to form an incisure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>disc</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>incisure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY030451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY005722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY033763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Tylor R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD010997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horb</surname><given-names>Marko E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD030008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horb</surname><given-names>Marko E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unrestricted Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>Vadim Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS120055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM82949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maturation of light-sensitive 'disc' membranes in vertebrate photoreceptors requires a precise balance between their content of the visual pigment rhodopsin forming the disc body and tetraspanin proteins forming the disc rim.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the vertebrate retina, photoreceptor cells perform the first step of vision by capturing light and generating a neuronal signal. This process, called phototransduction, occurs within a stack of disc-shaped membranes, or ‘discs’, confined within the ciliary outer segment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for a schematic representation). The outer segment undergoes continuous renewal whereby new discs are added at its base and old discs are phagocytosed from its tip by the apposing retinal pigment epithelium. New discs are formed as serial evaginations of the ciliary membrane, which eventually separate from the outer segment plasma membrane. This separation, known as disc enclosure, can be either complete in rods or partial in mammalian cones. The resulting mature disc contains a highly curved ‘rim’ supported by large oligomeric complexes of two tetraspanin proteins, peripherin-2 and ROM1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spencer et al., 2020</xref> for a recent review on disc morphogenesis).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of incisure arrangements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustrating the structure of rod photoreceptors in mice and frogs. In each species, the outer segment contains hundreds of disc membranes in a stack. For simplicity, the connecting cilium and the axoneme are not shown. Of note, rod outer segments in frogs are much wider than in mice. (<bold>B</bold>) Cartoon illustrating two different types of incisure arrangements in a stack of rod discs. Incisures are indentations of the disc rim that are longitudinally aligned across the disc stack. Mouse discs have a single incisure, whereas frog discs have multiple incisures.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89160-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Early ultrastructural studies revealed that fully enclosed discs contain longitudinally aligned indentations of their rims, termed ‘incisures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sjostrand, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilsson, 1965</xref>). Depending on the species, the number of incisures varies greatly: while mouse rods have only a single incisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 1960</xref>), frog rods have up to 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilsson, 1965</xref>). These incisure arrangements are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Considering their functional role, it has been proposed that incisures can promote longitudinal diffusion of signaling molecules in the outer segment during the course of a light response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichikawa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holcman and Korenbrot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caruso et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisegna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruso et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of incisures, including the relationship between the processes of disc enclosure and incisure formation. Work by Steinberg and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref>) has suggested that incisure formation is not dependent on disc enclosure, based on the occasional observation of small discontinuities in the newly forming ‘open’ discs at the base of the outer segment. Yet, these discontinuities were not aligned longitudinally, suggesting that they may not have been incisures. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal relationship between disc enclosure and incisure formation by combining traditional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with 3D electron tomography, which provides a high-resolution reconstruction of the entire outer segment base where new discs are formed. This analysis revealed that incisures are formed immediately after discs are fully enclosed. Additionally, we observed that, as new discs evaginate from the ciliary membrane, they are not round as typically depicted but rather are highly irregular in shape and resemble expanding lamellipodia of motile cells.</p><p>Considering the molecular mechanism of incisure formation, it has been shown that variations in the expression level of rhodopsin, the predominant protein constituent of disc membranes, can influence incisure size. While incisures of WT mice extend approximately halfway into the disc, the incisures of rhodopsin hemizygous mice extend nearly the entire disc diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, transgenic overexpression of rhodopsin reduces incisure length or precludes incisure formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Another parameter controlled by rhodopsin expression level is disc diameter, which is decreased by a reduction in rhodopsin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2012</xref>) and increased by rhodopsin overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these observations led Makino and colleagues to hypothesize that each disc has a set number of molecules responsible for the formation of its rim; smaller discs containing less rhodopsin direct more of these molecules to incisures, whereas larger discs require them to be incorporated along their circumference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The two proteins most critical for disc rim formation are the homologous tetraspanins, peripherin-2 and ROM1, which form very large oligomeric structures fortifying the entire disc rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stuck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pöge et al., 2021</xref>). The knockout of peripherin-2 (but not ROM1) completely precludes disc formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jansen and Sanyal, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>), while transgenic overexpression of some peripherin-2 mutants in frogs can disrupt incisure structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>). This makes peripherin-2 the prime candidate for being the limiting disc rim component postulated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>. Therefore, we explored the role of peripherin-2 in incisure formation in the current study. We analyzed outer segments of genetically modified mice and frogs, in which the relative outer segment content of peripherin-2 was either reduced or increased. We found that a high level of peripherin-2 causes an increase in incisure size and structural complexity, while a low level precludes incisure formation.</p><p>Taken together, our findings suggest that rods express a modest excess of peripherin-2 over the amount needed for completing disc enclosure. Once enclosure is finished, an excess pool of peripherin-2 remaining in the disc incorporates into the rim to form an incisure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Incisure formation follows the completion of disc enclosure</title><p>We first sought to determine the spatiotemporal relationship between incisure formation and enclosure in newly forming discs. Our initial approach was to use traditional TEM to image longitudinally sectioned mouse rod outer segments that had been contrasted with a combination of tannic acid and uranyl acetate. This contrasting technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2015</xref>) allows for the discrimination between newly forming ‘open’ discs that are stained darker than fully enclosed discs. Several examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> reveal that incisures are never found in the newly forming, open discs at the base of the outer segment, but become evident as soon as discs become enclosed. These observations suggest that incisure formation is a process that only occurs after complete disc enclosure.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Incisures are observed only in fully enclosed discs of mouse rods.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Representative TEM images of longitudinally sectioned WT mouse rods contrasted with a combination of tannic acid and uranyl acetate, which stains newly forming ‘open’ discs more intensely than mature enclosed discs.

Scale bars: 1 µm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89160-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To fully appreciate the architecture of disc incisures, we conducted electron tomography, which provides a three-dimensional reconstruction of a sample with a resolution of ~1–3 nm in each dimension. Since we were interested in examining the status of disc enclosure and incisure formation in multiple discs at the outer segment base, we utilized a variation of this technique called scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography, which allows for the imaging of thicker sections than other electron tomography approaches.</p><p>Using STEM tomography, we imaged ~750 nm plastic sections of mouse retinas cut tangentially at the region containing the interface between photoreceptor inner and outer segments. A representative example of a 3D reconstruction of such a section imaged at low magnification is shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref> and an individual 3 nm <italic>z</italic>-section from this tomogram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Because the bases of outer segments from individual photoreceptors are not precisely aligned in the retina, individual cells are sectioned across either inner or outer segments or their junctions. Notably, discernable incisures were observed in outer segments sectioned in the plane of mature, enclosed discs. To better appreciate the appearance of incisures, we pseudo-colored the surfaces of enclosed discs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. To assess the stage of disc formation at which incisures are formed, we performed higher magnification tomography of individual rods whose outer segment base was in the section. Two major observations from these experiments can be appreciated from the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2 fig4video3 fig4video4">Figure 4—videos 1–4</xref>, as follows:</p><p><italic>First</italic> and consistent with TEM data, no incisures were observed in the newly forming discs. <italic>Second</italic>, the newly forming discs are surprisingly lamellipodia-like in shape. While traditionally illustrated as round evaginations of the ciliary plasma membrane (such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spencer et al., 2020</xref>), the newly forming discs are actually irregular in shape, oftentimes with multiple protrusions. This observation, best appreciated in the individual <italic>z</italic>-sections shown in the left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, is consistent with the notion that new discs are formed in a process akin to lamellipodia formation mediated by polymerization of a branched actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spencer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Representative <italic>z</italic>-section from a STEM tomogram of a 750-nm-thick tangential section of a WT mouse retina.</title><p>The retina was contrasted with tannic acid/uranyl acetate.

As described above, peripherin-2 plays an essential role in the formation of disc rims and transgenic overexpression of some peripherin-2 mutants in frogs disrupts the structure of incisures. The role of peripherin-2 in incisure formation should be considered in the context of its relative abundance with rhodopsin. Whereas rhodopsin serves as an essential structural element of the disc lamella, peripherin-2 (along with its homologous partner ROM1) form the disc rim. Together, rhodopsin and peripherin-2/ROM1 comprise ~99% of the total transmembrane protein material in normal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skiba et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we sought to investigate whether the relationship between the surface area of a disc and the length of its rim, including both circumference and incisure, is determined by the molar ratio between rhodopsin and peripherin-2/ROM1.</p><p>The knockout of peripherin-2 (which occurs in homozygous <italic>rds</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Travis et al., 1991</xref>) is not a useful model to study incisure formation because it completely abolishes outer segment morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jansen and Sanyal, 1984</xref>).

This cross-species difference could be explained by <italic>Xenopus</italic> expressing multiple peripherin-2 homologs. It was reported that <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> expresses three peripherin-2 homologs termed xrds38, xrds36, and xrds35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kedzierski et al., 1996</xref>). The current annotations of the <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> genomes suggest that xrds38 (knocked out in our current study) is the frog peripherin-2 homolog (XenBase: XB-GENEPAGE-985593) while xrds36 and xrds35 are isoforms of ROM1 (XenBase: XB-GENEPAGE-962405). In addition, these genomes contain another peripherin-2-like gene, termed <italic>prph2l</italic> (XenBase: XB-GENEPAGE-5759091). Therefore, it is plausible that peripherin-2-like protein and/or ROM1 isoforms are sufficient or even play a primary role in supporting outer segment morphogenesis in frog photoreceptors.</p><p>As previously shown, discs of WT frogs contained numerous incisures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Like in mice, one of these incisures was aligned with the ciliary axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, rods of <italic>prph2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> frogs displayed a nearly complete lack of incisures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), apart from rare examples of discs containing a single incisure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). This phenotype resembles that of <italic>rds/+</italic> mice and shows that peripherin-2 is an important contributor to the formation of the entire disc rim structure in frogs that cannot be fully replaced by other homologous tetraspanins expressed in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying the formation of disc incisures in rod photoreceptors and report two central findings. <italic>First</italic>, we found that incisures are formed only after the completion of disc enclosure. Notably, this is contrary to the conclusion in the classical paper by Steinberg and colleagues which first described the currently accepted mechanism of disc morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref>). The authors concluded that “incisure formation occurs … before rim formation is complete around the entire perimeter of the disc … Closure of the disc, therefore, is not a prerequisite for incisure formation”. However, the structures in nascent discs that were interpreted as incisures in Figure 11 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref> were not aligned longitudinally, which is a hallmark property of incisures. Such a lack of alignment suggests an alternative explanation for the small discontinuities of disc membranes that they interpreted as incisures. These discontinuities could be explained by a thin plastic section being cut through an uneven edge of an expanding disc, which created an appearance of a gap between the most expanded portions of the disc lamella. How uneven nascent disc expansions can be prior to assuming their final round shape is well-illustrated in the 3D tomograms presented in our study. A related argument was made in another study employing 3D tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volland et al., 2015</xref>), which illustrated that, when analyzed in thin sections, enclosing discs may artificially appear as intracellular vesicles.</p><p>It is generally accepted that the formation of incisures is limited to rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2016</xref>). This could be appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> showing two cones lacking incisures alongside rods having multiple incisures in a WT frog retina. Because mature cone discs do not enclose or enclose partially in mammals, the lack of cone incisures is consistent with our conclusion that incisure formation takes place after disc enclosure. However, we must note that there have been a few reports of mammalian cones with a single incisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steinberg and Wood, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Fisher, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979</xref>), which warrants further investigation into the status of disc enclosure and the presence of incisures in mammalian cones.</p><p>Our <italic>second</italic> central finding is that incisure size and complexity are dependent on the relative outer segment contents of rhodopsin and peripherin-2. An excess of peripherin-2 leads to longer, more complex incisures, whereas a deficiency precludes incisure formation along with an occasional inability of discs to enclose. Less clear is the exact contribution of ROM1 to these processes. In the case of <italic>rds/+</italic> mice, characterized by a rather severe defect in outer segment morphogenesis, the ratio of rhodopsin to total tetraspanin protein in disc membranes decreases only modestly compared to WT mice (~15:1 vs. ~13:1) due to an increase in ROM1 content. It is intriguing to speculate that the gross morphological defects of <italic>rds/+</italic> discs may not be caused by this modest reduction in total tetraspanin content, but rather by the nearly 2-fold reduction in the relative peripherin-2 content. This would argue that ROM1 is unable to efficiently compensate for a deficiency in peripherin-2. Consistent with this line of thought, <italic>Rom1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> outer segments have relatively minor morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2000</xref>) despite ROM1 accounting for ~30% of the total tetraspanin content of the outer segment. The specific role of ROM1 in supporting disc structure remains to be determined in future experiments.</p><p>Taken together, these findings led us to propose that rod photoreceptors have evolved to express a slight excess of peripherin-2 over the amount needed to fully enclose their discs. Ensuring full enclosure is important because defects in this process lead to uncontrolled disc membrane outgrowth and ultimate photoreceptor cell death. Such a pathology is observed in photoreceptors with a reduced molar ratio of peripherin-2 to rhodopsin, such as in <italic>rds/+</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawkins et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanyal et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanyal and Hawkins, 1986</xref>) and in mice overexpressing rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2012</xref>). The same pathology is caused by mutations in peripherin-2 that affect its oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zulliger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milstein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike peripherin-2 deficiency, an excess of peripherin-2 does not lead to severe morphological outer segment defects, such as in <italic>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- or mice overexpressing peripherin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nour et al., 2004</xref>). These differences could be appreciated in the side-by-side comparison of <italic>rds/+</italic> and <italic>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></italic> outer segments in +/-. Therefore, the fact that rods express a slight excess of peripherin-2 over the amount required for disc enclosure may be viewed as an evolutionary adaptation to prevent severe pathology arising from incomplete disc enclosure. Following the completion of disc enclosure, this excess of peripherin-2 is deposited in the form of an incisure, which may serve to protect the flat lamellar disc membranes from undesirable deformations.</p><p>A second, not mutually exclusive function of incisures that has been long-discussed in the literature is to promote longitudinal diffusion of signaling molecules, such as cGMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in the outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichikawa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holcman and Korenbrot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caruso et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisegna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruso et al., 2020</xref>). This may increase the sensitivity and uniformity of light responses, particularly those evoked by a small number of photons. Theoretical analysis shows that this mechanism is particularly relevant in wider rods containing multiple incisures, but may be less significant in thin rods containing a single incisure, such as in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caruso et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruso et al., 2020</xref>). These conclusions remain to be tested in physiologically intact photoreceptors.</p><p>Another unanswered question is how the number of incisures in a disc is determined. While mouse rods have a single incisure, amphibian rods may have over 20. It is unlikely that incisure number is regulated merely by the relative tetraspanin content, as we typically observed elongated incisures rather than multiple incisures in <italic>Rho<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/-. It is likely that incisure number is regulated by the abundance of outer segment microtubular structures. In fact, the presence of non-axonemal microtubules aligned with incisures was documented in frog rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckmiller, 2000</xref>). The goal of future studies is to elucidate the specific role of microtubules in controlling incisure formation and number.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jax#:000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rho</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lem et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:2680822</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rds</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Nie et al., 1978</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:1856523</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nigerian</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National <italic>Xenopus</italic> Resource</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:NXR_1018">NXR_1018</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">genetic reagent (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>prph2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:NXR_3003">NXR_3003</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">National <italic>Xenopus</italic> Resource</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Animal maintenance and experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Duke (Durham, NC; protocol #A184-22-10) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA; protocol #22–29).

The incisures in Figure 5 are, on the other hand, very easy to see. If Figure 5 had come before Figure 4, I would have had no problem.

We made two changes to improve the presentation of these images. First, we pseudo-colored several examples of enclosed discs in Figure 3, which highlights the structure of incisures.

Incisures refer to the indentations that occur on the rim of the photoreceptor disc membranes. The presence of incisures has been noted for decades and have been identified across a number of species. The role of incisures is not entirely clear and the mechanisms governing their formation have largely been inferred from early transmission electron microscopy studies 40-60 years ago. More recent ultrastructural studies of rod outer segment discs from mice carrying mutant alleles of rhodopsin or periperhin-2 described changes in the length or presence of incisures, suggesting that these proteins likely play a fundamental role in incisure formation in mouse. The authors take advantage of advances in electron tomography to provide unprecedented analyses of incisure formation, size, and structural complexity in stacked discs within mouse photoreceptors. They also use genetic models to explore how rhodopsin and peripherin-2 contribute to incisure formation and length. The authors find that new discs are highly irregular in shape and do not contain incisures during disc formation. Incisures are only formed are discs are enclosed. They find that the incisures in adjacent discs always align adjacent to the ciliary axoneme. Intriguingly, they find evidence of physical connections on opposing sides of the incisure. Critically, they find that elevated levels of peripherin-2 increase incisure size and complexity while low levels of peripherin-2 prevent incisure formation. In contrast, reduced molar ratios of rhodopsin lead to smaller disc surface area but increased incisure complexity. These results lead the authors to conclude that incisure formation is mechanistically linked to the relative molar ratio of peripherin-2 to rhodopsin and that rods make a slight excess of peripherin-2 in order to drive proper disc closure. The excess peripherin-2 within the disc rim forces formation of an incisure.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy that the reviewer liked our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>1. Line 145-146: the location of the incisure adjacent to the ciliary axoneme is an interesting observation indeed. As frogs have a number of incisures, is this a similar observation in species with multiple incisures or more exclusive to those species with a single incisure?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we did observe that one of the many incisures in a frog disc is aligned with the ciliary axoneme. We have now included Supplementary Figure S2 to highlight this observation using an example of two adjacent cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While the presence of non-axonemal microtubules aligned with incisures in frog rods may provide an explanation for the number of incisures, the correlation with peripherin and rhodopsin content was lacking. In other words, do frog rods have considerably more peripherin-2 per disc than mouse rods?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question and one that we are interested in pursuing in the future. However, adapting the mass spectrometry-based protein quantification approach that we used to determine the absolute numbers of peripherin-2, ROM1 and rhodopsin molecules per disc was a significant undertaking that took several years (Skiba et al., PMID: 36711880). This approach is currently applicable to only a particular set of outer segment proteins in the mouse and cannot be automatically re-purposed to quantification of proteins in other species that have different amino acid sequences. Thus, designing, validating and employing this quantification protocol to all peripherin-2 and ROM1 isoforms along with rhodopsin in the frog would be a major undertaking that cannot be completed in the context of this revision. Nonetheless, we are very appreciative for the reviewer’s enthusiasm for this topic and plan to address this question in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. The location of the incisures are difficult to see in Figure 4. The arrowhead is pointing to a very low contrast area of the disc and the thin incisure can be seen, but it's difficult. If it is possible to pseudocolor the image in some way to highlight the disc vs the extramembrane space, it would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this issue, which was also commented by another reviewer. As described above, we pseudo-colored several examples in Figures 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 138-142: As with any descriptive narrative of cell structures, it is important to ensure the reader can fully understand and appreciate the interpretation of the authors. The shape of the newly forming discs can be difficult to appreciate in Figure 4. The authors are strongly encouraged to perhaps take 1-2 examples and provide a drawing or schematic of the image that can be more clearly annotated to assist readers in finding the outline of the discs and incisures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and pseudo-colored the surfaces of new forming discs in the examples shown in Figure 4A. We feel that pseudo-coloring helps the reader better visualize not only the structure of incisures, but also the irregular shape of the newly forming discs as in this specific example.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the paper is well-written and organized logically. The figures are generally easy to interpret although some additional annotations would help readers identify incisures in some low-contrast images (see comments). The authors utilized state-of-the-art electron tomographic data and mouse genetics to address a fundamental question. This will be of considerable interest to cell biologists in the vision community and likely to the broader cell biology community on how peripheral/rim proteins can shape membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>It is needless to say that we are very pleased by these comments and that the reviewer found our study to be of considerable interest to the broader cell biology community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide a well-reasoned model for how incisures form in mouse rod photoreceptors: a relative excess of peripherin-2 drives incisure formation. This agrees with their mass-spectrometry data and molar ratios of peripherin-2 and rhodopsin. The main concern and outstanding question is whether these results are specific to mouse photoreceptors? The experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> were limited and only found that a CRISPR knockout of one peripherin-2 ortholog prevented incisure formation. While this result agreed with the general model and how molar ratios of peripherin-2 contribute, the knockout phenotypes are different than that of mouse. Some hypotheses are mentioned to explain this, but none were tested. The authors provide a model that agrees with mouse data, but is this generalizable? The model should permit several predictions for incisure formation beyond that of mouse rods. It would be most helpful to look in a species with multiple incisures and calculate the molar ratios of rhodopsin and peripherin-2. Do <italic>Xenopus</italic> require significantly more peripherin-2 to form multiple incisures? Alternatively, is it possible for the authors to mine publically available proteomics studies to assess rhodopsin and peripherin-2 content from other species (e.g. human, non-human primates, rats, etc…) and correlate to incisure number and/or length? The study overall is interesting and thought-provoking, but the overall impact would be greatly enhanced if additional evidence was provided that their model is broadly generalizable given the variety in incisure number and photoreceptor disc morphology (e.g. surface area, diameter) across species.</p></disp-quote><p>Related to a comment above, we are interested in pursuing each of these directions in frogs and other species in future studies, although it is not feasible to accomplish the required body of work in the context of manuscript revision. There are three other photoreceptor tetraspanins homologous to peripherin-2 that remain to be quantified and knocked out in frogs, alone and in combinations (the xrds36 and xrds35 isoforms and the peripherin-2-like protein). Testing the function of each of these in incisure formation would be an endeavor spanning several years of work. Additionally, there are no publicly available proteomic datasets that would contain information allowing an accurate quantification of rhodopsin and these homologous tetraspanins in other species. This question would require us to adapt our protein quantification approach, which would indeed be valuable, but would take significant time to complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Summary. This work explores the formation of incisures in rod outer-segment (OS) disks. The visual pigment rhodopsin is the major lamellar protein in rod OS disks, while peripherin is the major structural protein of the disk rim. The authors used wild-type, Rho+/- and Rds+/- mice to vary the ratio of rhodopsin to peripherin in vivo, and compared these ratios to incisure length and complexity in rod OS.</p><p>Comments. This study presents several new findings. The authors convincingly show by EM tomography that incisures only form after each OS disk has reached maturity (fully separated from the plasma membrane). This new finding corrects an earlier published observation. Next, they examined disk morphology in Rds+/- heterozygous null-mutant mice and showed that an ~50% reduction in peripherin levels resulted in rod OS disks with no incisures. They performed a similar study on Rho+/- heterozygotes mutants. This time they observed that an ~50% reduction in rhodopsin levels resulted in OS disks with excessively long incisures. MS analysis of rod OS proteins and quantitative analysis of the EM images showed that incisure length varies with the ratio of peripherin to rhodopsin. They further showed that wild-type rods contain a small excess of peripherin over the amount required to form mature disks with normal incisures. Finally, the authors examined the effects of peripherin levels in rods from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, an animal containing large OS disks with multiple incisures and three homologs of peripherin. They used gene editing to generate <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> with a null mutation in the xrds35 gene, which is most like mammalian peripherin. OS disks from xrds35-/- frogs contained no incisures by EM tomography, further supporting their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this nice summary of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another protein in the rims of rod OS disks is ABCA4, an ATP-driven flippase that translocates PE conjugated to retinaldehyde from the lumenal to cytoplasmic leaflets of the disk membrane. Retinaldehyde is a toxic photoproduct of rhodopsin bleaching. It has been suggested that the large number of incisures in frog disks is due to the larger diameter of frog versus mouse rod OS, and hence the greater number of rhodopsins per disk. This relationship is thought to ensure sufficient ABCA4 flippase activity to process the larger flux of retinaldehyde released by rhodopsin in these wide disks during light exposure, and possibly to minimize the diffusion distance of retinaldehyde from the disk lamella to the rim. The authors' findings seem in conflict with this explanation. They may wish to comment on this facet of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is possible for incisures to promote the encounter rate between retinaldehyde and ABCA4 in the disc. We do not find this idea to conflict with any of our interpretations; rather, this may be a complementary function of incisures. However, we failed to find any place in the literature where this hypothesis has been explicitly proposed and feel uneasy to present it as a new idea of our own in discussion. Fortunately, these reviews are public and truly interested readers could appreciate this idea. It is also worth noting that the correlation between incisure number and disc diameter is not perfect. For example, owl monkey discs appear to have a large number of incisures despite having a similar diameter to the mouse (Kroll and Machemer, PMID: 4970987).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance. The manuscript presents novel and significant findings into an important cell biological problem, development of the rod OS. It is clearly written and the data are of high quality. The manuscript should be of broad interest to cell biologists and vision scientists. It is strongly recommended for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer found our study to be of broad interest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
