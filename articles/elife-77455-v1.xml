After being bound by BDNF, TrkB and p75 are endocytosed into endosomes and continue signaling within the cell soma, dendrites, and axons. We studied the functional role of BDNF axonal signaling in cortical neurons derived from different transgenic mice using compartmentalized cultures in microfluidic devices. We found that axonal BDNF increased dendritic growth from the neuronal cell body in a cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent manner. These effects were dependent on axonal TrkB but not p75 activity. Dynein-dependent BDNF-TrkB-containing endosome transport was required for long-distance induction of dendritic growth. Axonal signaling endosomes increased CREB and mTOR kinase activity in the cell body, and this increase in the activity of both proteins was required for general protein translation and the expression of Arc, a plasticity-associated gene, indicating a role for BDNF-TrkB axonal signaling endosomes in coordinating the transcription and translation of genes whose products contribute to learning and memory regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BDNF</kwd><kwd>TrkB</kwd><kwd>axonal signaling</kwd><kwd>signaling endosome</kwd><kwd>Dynein</kwd><kwd>dendritic

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Somatodendritic growth during CNS development is essential for the establishment of proper connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>). In addition, the morphology of dendritic arbors is maintained and undergoes plastic changes through a process that requires activity-dependent transcription factors (TFs), protein translation, and extracellular neurotrophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong and Ghosh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yap et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known neurotrophin whose transcription is regulated by neuronal activity and is required for the maintenance of dendrites of adult neurons in the CNS. BDNF binds two receptors, tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75). The classical trophic, growth-promoting actions of BDNF largely involve activation of TrkB, as mutant mice with inducible deletion of TrkB receptors exhibit a significant reduction in the number of dendritic arbors and degeneration of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horch and Katz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and Reichardt, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Dendritic arborization mediated by TrkB activation in neurons is triggered by signaling pathways such as the ERK1/2 and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finkbeiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xing et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Alonso et al., 2019</xref>). CREB also mediates activity-dependent transcription by regulating early gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>). In addition, activation of the class 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway increases the translation of a subset of mRNAs, including those that encode proteins related to BDNF-mediated regulation of dendritic size and shape in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ravindran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schratt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Minichiello et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dijkhuizen and Ghosh, 2005</xref>).</p><p>A large amount of evidence has shown that a complex of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors continue signaling inside the cell in specialized organelles named signaling endosomes, where neurotrophin receptors encounter specific signaling adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grimes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lazo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debaisieux et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have shown that endocytosis of TrkB is required for survival, dendritic arborization, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that endosomal signaling has a role in the physiological responses to TrkB. Consistent with these observations, studies from our laboratory have shown that there is a functional relationship between BDNF/TrkB signaling and the early recycling pathway in the regulation of dendritic morphology and CREB-dependent transcription of plasticity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moya-Alvarado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Gutiérrez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Long-distance communication between neurotrophins in the target tissue and cell bodies has been described in the PNS and requires microtubule-associated molecular motors, such as cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lazo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). During this process, NGF/TrkA signaling endosomes originating from the synaptic terminal propagate distal neurotrophin signals to the nucleus to allow transcriptional regulation, inducing neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosker and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riccio et al., 1997</xref>). Although it has been shown that BDNF is retrogradely transported along axons of cortical neurons, whether central neurons respond to distal neurotrophic signals is a relevant and understudied question in the neurobiology field. Indeed, no studies have directly assessed whether axonal BDNF signaling endosomes induce long-distance effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Olenick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stuardo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we studied whether axonal BDNF/TrkB signaling has a dendritic growth-promoting effect in the cell bodies of cortical neurons. We demonstrated for the first time that dynein-mediated transport of BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes can modulate neuronal morphology. We also explored the BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling mechanism that regulates this process and showed that axonal BDNF-TrkB signaling endosomes coordinate the phosphorylation of CREB and PI3K-mTOR pathway-related proteins in cell bodies to increase protein translation and dendritic branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Axonal BDNF signaling promotes dendritic branching in a TrkB-dependent manner</title><p>Using cortical neurons in compartmentalized cultures in microfluidic chambers, we evaluated whether axonal stimulation with BDNF promotes dendritic arborization in a TrkB activity-dependent manner. We used two different systems: rat cortical neurons incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tapley et al., 1992</xref>) and cortical neurons derived from TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> knock-in mice. This mutation in TrkB enables pharmacological control of TrkB kinase activity using small molecule inhibitors, including 1-naphthylmethyl 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(p-methyl phenyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (1NM-PP1), which selectively, rapidly, and reversibly inhibits TrkB activity. In the absence of such inhibitors, TrkB is fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). We also used cortical neurons derived from p75 exon III knockout mice (p75 KO<sup>exonIII</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 1992</xref>) to assess the dependence of dendritic growth and morphology on p75 expression and activity.</p><p>To evaluate morphological changes in neurons, we transfected cortical neurons in compartmentalized cultures (DIV 6) with plasmids expressing EGFP and then performed MAP2 immunostaining after fixing the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify the neurons that projected their axons to the axonal compartment (AC) and to assess leakage of media from the AC into the cell body compartment (CB), we used fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B subunit (Ctb). Ctb is internalized and retrogradely transported along neuronal axons and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escudero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Chambers with neurons that showed Ctb accumulation in the cell body but not those in which Ctb diffusely labeled the soma of neurons were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Only neurons in which the cell body was labeled with Ctb were used for quantification. Since BDNF is also released from dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>), axonal BDNF was selectively stimulated by incubating somas in the CB compartment with TrkB-Fc chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shelton et al., 1995</xref>). TrkB-Fc neutralized the activity of endogenous BDNF released by neurons; when TrkB-Fc was not added to the CB compartment, axonal BDNF induced a nonsignificant increase in the number of distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Addition of BDNF to axons promotes dendritic branching in a TrkB-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of compartmentalized microfluidic chambers (400 µm long and 15 µm wide microgrooves) after addition of BDNF/Ctb-555.

KG501 is a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Best et al., 2004</xref>). We found that KG501 abolished the increase in dendritic arborization induced by treating axons with BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).

Since CREB has been widely described as a significant regulator of neurotrophin-induced survival of PNS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finkbeiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>), we assessed whether KG501 has an effect on neuronal survival under our experimental conditions by assessing neuronal apoptosis using TUNEL staining. We found that after 48 hr of treatment, KG501 did not affect neuronal survival. We used oligomycin A, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, as a positive control to induce apoptotic death of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To validate the findings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref> with a molecular biology approach, we cotransduced cortical neurons (DIV 4) with adeno-associated virus (AVV) serotype 1 (AAV1) expressing dominant negative CREB (CREB-DN-EGFP) or control (EGFP) together with AAV1 expressing mCherry. The expression was for four days in the presence or absence of axonal BDNF and TrkB-Fc was present in all conditions in the cell body compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). About 75% of neurons were cotransduced with EGFP or CREB-DN-EGFP and mCherry. We found that the expression of CREB-DN-EGFP did not reduce the number of mCherry-positive cells containing a Hoechst-labelled nucleus compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This result indicates that CREB-DN-EGFP did not cause neuronal cell death and is consistent with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, where inhibition of CREB by KG501 did not increase neuronal apoptosis.</p><p>On the other hand, the fluorescence associated with mCherry clearly labeled neurites in the cell body (CB) compartment of cortical neurons grown in compartmentalized cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G1</xref>). The addition of BDNF in axons increased mCherry-labeled neurites in the CB compartment of EGFP-expressing cells but not in cultures expressing CREB-DN-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>). The fact that the total amount of neurites is diminished in neurons expressing CREB-DN-EGFP compared to EGFP (non-significant differences) expressing cells is consistent with the idea that neurons require CREB activity to maintain normal morphology. Similar results are obtained when adult pyramidal neurons (cortical layers II-III) in the sensory-motor cortex express CREB-DN-EGFP in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Consistently, immunofluorescence revealed that 1NM-PP1 treatment after BDNF stimulation reduced the nuclear phosphorylation of CREB and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6 ribosomal protein (S6r), two proteins downstream of mTOR activation induced by BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). These results indicate that 1NM-PP1 can turn off TrkB after it is activated by BDNF.</p><p>Then, to evaluate whether axonal-derived activated TrkB reaches the cell body and is required for the propagation of axonal BDNF signaling, we performed transfection, pulse chase and NM-PP1 inhibition experiments as follows. We first transfected neurons with a plasmid expressing TrkB containing a Flag NH2-terminal epitope (Flag-TrkB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazo et al., 2013</xref>) and then incubated the axons with a Flag-specific antibody at 4 °C, washed them, and treated them with BDNF at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After fixation, we evaluated the colocalization of Flag with pTrkB in microgrooves in proximity to the AC (distal microgrooves), in the vicinity of the CB (proximal microgrooves) and in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that signaling endosomes containing activated TrkB move along axons and reach the cell body upon stimulation of axons with BDNF. Subsequently, we directly assessed whether we could reduce TrkB activity in the cell bodies of TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> mouse-derived neurons after stimulation of axons with BDNF. Somatodendritic TrkB activity was evaluated after applying 1NM-PP1 to the CB or AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Application of BDNF to the axons increased the immunostaining intensity of endogenous pTrkB in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Consistent with the observations in noncompartmentalized neuronal cultures, the application of 1NM-PP1 to the AC completely abolished the accumulation of pTrkB in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Furthermore, the application of 1NM-PP1 to the cell body decreased the amount of activated TrkB in the cell body after stimulation of axons with BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Somatodendritic activity of axonal TrkB is required for long-distance BDNF signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the protocol used to label axonal TrkB.

Additionally, PI3K has been shown to mediate retrograde NGF signaling in sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuruvilla et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, it was reported that axonal endosomes are positive for TrkB and Akt in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goto-Silva et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that axonal PI3K/Akt signaling may contribute to long-distance dendritic arborization induced by BDNF. Thus, we applied BDNF to the AC of compartmentalized cortical neurons in the presence or absence of LY294002, a potent general PI3K inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, the application of LY294002 to axons did not affect dendritic arborization induced by axonal BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). This result was not due to a lack of LY294002 effect in cortical cultures since, confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finsterwald et al., 2010</xref>), LY294002 reduced BDNF-induced dendritic arborization in noncompartmentalized cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K activity in axons did not reduce the transport of BDNF-QDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). This result indicates that PI3K activity is not required for the retrograde transport of axonal BDNF signals.

First, to evaluate BDNF-mediated activation of the mTOR pathway in cortical neurons, we stimulated noncompartmentalized cultures with BDNF for 1 hr in the presence or absence of LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) and Torin1, a specific inhibitor of mTOR that reduces the activity of both the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Western blotting revealed that BDNF promoted the phosphorylation of TrkB, Akt, S6r, and 4E-BP1 in cortical neurons and that LY294002 and Torin1 fully inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, S6r and 4E-BP1 but not TrkB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected. Then, we evaluated whether the mTOR pathway is involved in increasing protein translation upon arrival of pTrkB signaling endosomes in the cell body. To this end, we evaluated the time course of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the neuronal cell body induced by axonal BDNF stimulation. We observed that BDNF increased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at 90 min and that 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was even higher at 180 min and was down-regulated at 360 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the phosphorylation of S6r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To evaluate whether activation of 4E-BP1 by axonal BDNF is dependent on the somatodendritic activity of PI3K and mTOR, we applied LY294002 or Torin1 to the CB of compartmentalized neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The somatodendritic 4E-BP1 phosphorylation induced by axonal BDNF was significantly reduced by these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we metabolically labeled newly synthesized protein using Click-iT chemistry, which involves incorporation of L-azidohomoalanine (AHA). AHA is a modified amino acid that resembles methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dieterich et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we evaluated the level of de novo protein synthesis by using immunofluorescence to assess the levels of Arc, an immediate-early gene that encodes a protein required for synaptic plasticity induced by BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ying et al., 2002</xref>) and whose synthesis is regulated by CREB and mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ying et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takei et al., 2004</xref>).

Although long-distance communication between neurotrophins in the PNS has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosker and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>), whether signaling endosomes have a physiological role in the CNS in mammals, have not been addressed before. Our current study is the first to demonstrate direct evidence for BDNF long-distance signaling contributing to the shape of neuronal morphology in CNS neurons. We showed that this effect depends mainly on the activity of TrkB and not p75 in axons. Additionally, we positioned CREB activity as the central mediator of this effect. In PNS neurons, CREB activity has been associated mainly with neuronal survival and axonal growth induced by target-derived NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>) and in injured neurons to the increase in neuronal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caracciolo et al., 2018</xref>). However, our study is the first to indicate that CREB activity, in the context of BDNF long-distance signaling, is mainly associated with BDNF-induced dendritic growth and not survival. Furthermore, our findings are the first to demonstrate that axonal BDNF and endogenous active TrkB are in signaling endosomes in cell bodies where their activity is required to propagate axonal BDNF signals to the nuclei of cortical neurons. Also, our work is the first report showing that BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes generated in axons activate mTOR downstream effectors and increase general protein translation, including Arc, upon reaching the cell body. This last activity depended on CREB and mTOR, indicating that axonal signaling endosomes control the transcription and translation of a subset of proteins.</p><p>In this study, we have favored pharmacological inhibitors of the different components of downstream BDNF/TrkB signaling over genetic tools. The various drugs used allowed us to inhibit enzymatic or biological activities in a localized manner, that is, in the compartment of cell bodies or the axonal compartment of microfluidic cultures, since current genetic tools do not allow this type of evaluation. Complementary reagents were used to address the limitation in specificity that implies the use of drugs. For example, to evaluate axonal TrkB’s participation in dendritic arborization induced by axonal BDNF we studied rat cultures using the Trks inhibitor K252A and in TrkBF616A knock-in mice cultures, the 1NM-PP1 kinase inhibitor. KG501 and a CREB dominant negative were used to assess CREB involvement. Finally, to evaluate the activation of p4EBP1 in cell bodies in the retrograde signaling of BDNF, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 were used. In these experiments, the inhibitors abolished immunofluorescence, indicating a high specificity, at least for the evaluated substrate. Undoubtedly, pharmacological inhibitors have an explicit limitation of selectivity. There is still room for the development of inhibitors that can be used to assess local activities in neuronal cells, such as optogenetic inhibition, as it has been used for RabGTPases and the TrkA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khamo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornejo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we clearly showed that BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes originating in axons are required for dendritic arborization from the cell body. Our studies are in line with previous work showing that snapin, a protein that regulates autophagy and dynein transport, is required for dendritic branching in cortical neurons upon BDNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>) and with the fact that BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes generated in presynaptic boutons in the hippocampus locally regulate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres-Alonso et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, our results are related to the retrograde effects of BDNF on dendritic arborization observed in vivo in retinal ganglion cells in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lom et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Using TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> knock-in mice and 1NM-PP1, we showed that the application of BDNF to axons increases the transport of activated TrkB to the cell body and that activated somatic TrkB in neurons is required for nuclear responses. The fact that 1NM-PP1 reduced the activation of already activated TrkB suggests that 1NM-PP1 binds the ATP-binding site of the receptor, reducing the tyrosine activity of TrkB without affecting its neurotrophin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). There are two possible mechanisms that can explain our results. The first is that TrkB is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated during its transport along the axon; thus, 1NM-PP1 binds the ATP-binding cassette of the receptor and prevents its phosphorylation. Our finding of signaling endosomes containing axonal BDNF and active TrkB in cell bodies supports this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similar results were found in sympathetic neurons, where TrkA activated in distal axons is required to induce neuronal survival by axonal NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). The second possible mechanism is that BDNF retrograde signaling promotes the phosphorylation of somatodendritic TrkB and that this process is required to maintain CREB phosphorylation. In agreement with this last idea, other groups have shown that retrogradely transported TrkA in sympathetic neurons locally accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. The process increases the phosphorylation of other TrkA receptors in cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lehigh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we also observed activated TrkB receptors positive vesicles not containing BDNF in axonally stimulated cortical neurons in our studies (unpublished observation). These results suggest that axonal BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes are required to propagate BDNF signaling in cell bodies, which includes activating the cell body TrkB receptors.</p><p>Since BDNF can bind p75 and TrkB, we analyzed whether long-distance signaling is dependent on TrkB activation and the dependence of this process on p75 expression. p75 signaling has been reported to have an opposite role as Trk signaling since p75 can induce apoptosis or reduce axonal growth by binding to different ligands and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ibáñez and Simi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kraemer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pathak et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, p75 negatively regulates dendritic complexity and spine density in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zagrebelsky et al., 2005</xref>). We observed that the absence of p75 resulted in a decrease in basal dendritic arborization of cortical neurons in microfluidic devices. Nevertheless, BDNF was able to rescue this phenotype, suggesting that p75 participates in the regulation of dendritic arborization but is not required for axonal BDNF signaling.</p><p>We found that PI3K activity in axons does not play a role in the retrograde transport of signaling endosomes. It was speculated that PI3K plays a role in this process due to the role of phosphoinositide accumulation in early endosome-mediated regulation of the early-to-late transition process (transition of Rab5- to Rab7-positive endosomes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Numrich and Ungermann, 2014</xref>) required for retrograde sorting of signaling endosomes in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deinhardt et al., 2006</xref>). Our results are also different from findings regarding TrkA signaling in sympathetic neurons, as PI3K activity is required for the retrograde transport of TrkA signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuruvilla et al., 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway is required for somatic responses to axonal BDNF. Indeed, our studies showed that PI3K activity is required for axonal BDNF-induced dendritic branching and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6r, which are downstream targets of mTOR, a process that is also dynein dependent. Consistent with these results, we demonstrated that axonal signaling endosomes activate the general translation of proteins in the cell body and that this process is dependent on CREB-mediated transcription and mTOR-dependent translation. These processes are accompanied by an increase in the protein levels of Arc. The fact that protein translation is also dependent on CREB suggests that CREB-dependent transcripts are specifically translated upon the arrival of signaling endosomes in the cell body in an mTOR-dependent fashion. <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA is anterogradely transported to dendrites to be locally synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steward and Worley, 2002</xref>), suggesting that axonal signaling may increase local translation in dendrites.</p><p>We performed a time-course study of CREB activation after application of BDNF to axons and found sustained activation of CREB after 3 hr of BDNF treatment. These results are different from what we have observed in noncompartmentalized hippocampal neurons, as CREB activity is decreased in these cells after 1 hr of BDNF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Gutiérrez et al., 2020</xref>). While a dynein inhibitor reduced early activation of CREB by 40%, it reduced late CREB activation (after 3 hr of BDNF treatment) by 80%, suggesting that there is an additional component that contributes to the early activation of CREB by axonal BDNF in our study. In injured PNS neurons it has been observed calcium waves, as mediator of the nuclear regenerative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that similar calcium waves are contributing to early CREB activation by axonal BDNF in our studies. Interestingly, it has been reported that both rapid and sustained CREB phosphorylation is required for proper transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolmetsch et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that in neurons, retrograde BDNF signaling may contribute to sustained CREB phosphorylation for CREB-dependent maintenance of dendritic arborization.</p><p>CREB plays a central role in processes such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finkbeiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xing et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>).

In this work, we showed that CREB is required for long-distance BDNF-induced dendritic arborization in cortical neurons, suggesting that axonal BDNF signaling may contribute to the development and maintenance of different circuits in the brain, including those involved in learning and memory in the hippocampus and motor learning in the cortico-callosal and cortico-striatal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that CREB is required for the development of dendrites in vitro or during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Redmond et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herzog et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Gutiérrez et al., 2020</xref>).

A total of 5–7 optical sections over a width of 0.5 covering the whole neuron were obtained. Images of tissue sections were acquired with a confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SP8) with a 40 x oil objective at a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. Fifteen to 20 optical sections of isolated mCherry-labeled neurons in layer II/III of the sensory-motor cortex of injected mice were obtained over a width of 0.5 µm along the z-axis. Subsequently, the z-stacks were integrated, and neurons were manually drawn guided by the original fluorescence image using the pencil tool in ImageJ and segmented to obtain binary images. The numbers of total primary dendrites and branching points of all dendrites were manually counted from the segmented images using the ImageJ open source platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For Sholl analysis, concentric circles with increasing diameters (10 µm per step for primary cultured cortical neurons and 5 µm for cortical neurons in tissue sections) were traced around the cell body, and the number of intersections between dendrites and circles was counted and plotted for each circle. The analysis was performed using Sholl analysis plug in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, for cortical neurons in tissue sections, the cell body size and apical dendrite diameter were measured from the segmented images using the straight tool in ImageJ.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Avraham Yaron (Reviewer #2); Wilma J Friedman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews and major concerns with one another. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this summary of their discussions to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based upon the concerns raised by the reviewers, a number of issues need to be addressed in a revised manuscript-</p><p>1. Additional direct evidence for retrograde signaling of BDNF. BDNF applied to distal axons of cortical neurons induces dendrite growth in vitro. It is concluded that BDNF can signal retrogradely, not that it does. Additional data is needed to support this latter point.</p><p>2. Explain how this study is an advance over previous experiments in the PNS.</p><p>3. There is a dependence on the use of chemical inhibitors. Alternate methods and results to support the use of several of the inhibitors are needed. The limitations should be discussed.</p><p>4. The CREB data should be removed since it is downstream of many processes, including retrograde BDNF signaling. Also, there is no evidence for signaling endosomes in vivo.</p><p>The cell biology methodology is carried out in a solid fashion. Previous results were confined to peripheral neurons. In this case, cortical neurons are being analyzed. An effort should be made to emphasize the novelty of the studies. The requirement for target-derived neurotrophins has not been clearly established in the CNS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. One important limitation is that essentially all of these results have already been published in other studies examining BDNF-TrkB signaling, or especially in NGF-TrkA signaling in peripheral neurons. Therefore, this manuscript represents a more incremental study of more limited interest to developmental neurobiologists, and as such is more appropriate for a specialized neuroscience journal rather than <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2. The authors do not present data demonstrating a role for BDNF-TrkB retrogradely-transported signaling endosomes in dendritic growth in vivo. The authors do present data in Figure 3 that CREB is required in vivo for dendrite growth in cortex, but this is not surprising given the importance of CREB in many growth and plastic events. While the paper doesn't absolutely need this data, and the compartmentalized culture experiments are well done, its absence limits the impact of this study.</p><p>3. In Figure 4, the 30-minute P-CREB signal was not completely blocked with Ciliobreven D, although it is at 180 minutes (Figure 4D-F), a point they allude to in the Discussion. This raises the question: does NM-PP1 inhibit P-CREB in the cell bodies at this early 30 minute time? Is there some rapid signaling cascade involved, such as calcium waves that they suggest in the Discussion?</p><p>4. In Figure S3, the P-TrkB westerns are not very convincing (the induction by BDNF). The quantifications look good, suggesting this Western blot is not representative of the data. Data showing a clear BDNF-induced TrkB phosphorylation should be included.</p><p>5. In the discussion, the authors debate whether TrkB kinase inhibition in cell bodies and dendrites (which blocks dendrite growth and signaling) is mechanistically due to continuous re-autophosphorylation of TrkB coming from axons, or TrkB from axons activating TrkB in cell bodies. The authors propose the latter and cite papers that support this. However, the former is clearly true in peripheral neurons with NGF-TrkA signaling (Ye et al., Cell, 2003). Both possibilities are plausible at this point and should be equally proposed.</p><p>6. The authors forgot to include the Cho et al. 2013 paper in the bibliography. Related to this paper, the authors cite it to propose that calcium waves may cause early CREB phosphorylation. This paper, however, showed retrogradely moving calcium waves after a peripheral nerve injury, not after neurotrophic factor signaling. This should be written more clearly in the discussion because it is misleading/confusing as currently written.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3A CREB is activated in 30 minutes, seems fast, is it in agreement with what is known about BDNF retrograde signaling?</p><p>Figure 3G, S2D – I don't understand how this in vivo data adds to the paper and I think the authors should take it out. Also, the authors write that there is nonapoptotic cell death (S2D) and then that CREB has no effect on neuronal survival.</p><p>As I noted in the public review there is heavy use of pharmacology, if the authors cannot back it up by other approaches they should mention the caveats.</p><p>The experiment in Figure 5 – really nice and clever use of the F616A mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>On line 161 they refer to cultures derived from p75 KOexonIII as p75+/+ and this is confusing.</p><p>The dose of 50 ng/ml of BDNF was used to treat the axons, was this an optimal dose determined from a dose-response analysis? In mass cultures, TrkB can be activated by 10 ng/ml BDNF, so it would be interesting to know whether this retrograde signaling required a higher dose.</p><p>In the Results section, they should clearly indicate the experiments that were performed in vivo, since all the other data are in vitro this was not immediately apparent. Moreover, in their presentation of the results from the in vivo experiment, they mention &quot;nonapoptotic cell death, as indicated by fragmentation of the nucleus&quot; and this phrase needs to be clarified since nuclear fragmentation is often indicative of apoptosis.</p><p>Line 83 – TrkB stands for tropomyosin receptor kinase, not tyrosine kinase receptor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77455.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have performed additional experiments treating axons with fluorescently labeled BDNF and visualizing their accumulation in cell bodies and dendrites. Then, we mark these vesicles by immunostaining with an antibody against phosphorylated TrkB. This antibody is against tyrosines of the intracellular catalytic domain of TrkB (tyr674/675). The group of Martin Korte used the same antibody to follow pTrkB by immunostaining (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.945348">https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.945348</ext-link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2022.945348). During the process of setting up these experiments, we tested several pTrkB antibodies and this one gave the stronger signal to noise ratio and allowed double labeling with BDNF. We have analyzed more than 300 BDNF-positive vesicles and found that more than 60 % contain detectable levels of pTrkB (new Figure 6).</p><p>Figure 5A and B show representative compartmentalized neurons transfected with Flag-TrkB and co-localization of TrkB receptors retrogradely transported (labeled with Flag antibodies in axons) with pTrkB (tyr816). The experiments explained in Figure 6 and Figures 5A and B, together with those in Figures 5 D-G, are solid evidence that signaling endosomes containing BDNF and its cognate active TrkB receptors trigger signaling cascades. Figure 5 D-G shows the results of experiments where axons or cell bodies of compartmentalized cultures, derived from TrkBF616A knock-in mice, were treated with the kinase inhibitor 1NM-PP1 and reduced activity of pTrkB and CREB was found in cell bodies treated with 1NM-PP1. Indicating that retrogradely transported BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes triggers nuclear responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Explain how this study is an advance over previous experiments in the PNS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in general the novelty of the work and the differences with PNS neurons required more emphasis. Therefore, we have added to the description of Results section, after the end of the different subsection, a short sentence that directly indicates the novelty. Also, we have overviewed the novelty of the findings and discusses the differences with PNS in the discussion.</p><p>We can summarize them in the following points.</p><p>a – Using pharmacology and genetics models, we demonstrated, for the first time, direct evidence for BDNF long-distance signaling contributing to dendritic arborization in neurons from the CNS. Also, we showed that this effect depends mainly on the activity of TrkB (and not p75) in axons. Most of the evidence supporting retrograde signaling in PNS neurons is related to neuronal survival, axonal growth, or dendritic arborization and is associated with TrkA signaling, not TrkB. One paper by the group of David Ginty (doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.03.028) describes that endosomes containing active TrkA are found in dendrites in close association with synaptic markers. in vivo, inhibition of TrkA kinase activity in cell bodies decreased synaptic punctate in cervical ganglia. No studies directly demonstrated that adding NGF to axons increases dendrite lengths, dendritic branching, or increases the number of synapses.</p><p>b – We demonstrated for the first time that CREB activation is required for long-distance induction of dendritic branching by BDNF in compartmentalized cortical neurons in vitro<italic>.</italic> In PNS neurons, CREB is mainly related to preserving neuronal survival. We also showed that CREB was needed for sustaining normal neuronal dendritic arborization in long-projecting neurons, such as the pyramidal neurons of the sensory-motor cortex. These neurons require BDNF/TrkB signaling to support normal dendritic arbors. We agree that the role of BDNF long-distance signaling regulating CREB activation in vivo remains to be demonstrated and we have clearly stated this fact in the discussion.</p><p>c – Our findings are the first to demonstrate that axonal BDNF and endogenous active TrkB are in signaling endosomes in cell bodies where their activity is required to propagate axonal BDNF signals to the nuclei of CNS neurons.</p><p>d – Our findings are the first to show that PI3K signaling is not required for the axonal transport of signaling endosomes along the axon but is needed to increase dendritic branching upon their arrival to cell bodies. In PNS neurons, PI3K activity is required for the axonal transport of NGF signaling endosomes. Therefore, BDNF signaling endosomes may share signaling and transport pathways, but they may differ in the molecular pathways that regulate their traffic.</p><p>e – Our study is the first to give evidence that axonal BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes activate mTOR downstream effectors and increase protein translation, including Arc protein, upon reaching the cell body. To our knowledge, no proof of mTOR activation and increase of protein synthesis (including Arc) are reported for PNS neurons.</p><p>f – Our study is the first to give evidence that the increase in protein translation mentioned above depends on CREB and mTOR activity, indicating that axonal signaling endosomes control the transcription and translation of a subset of proteins in a coordinated fashion, including Arc, in cell bodies. This has not been demonstrated for PNS neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is a dependence on the use of chemical inhibitors. Alternate methods and results to support the use of several of the inhibitors are needed. The limitations should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that, ideally, alternate methods are required to support the use of several inhibitors. For this reason, we have included experiments expressing CREB dominant negative mutant in the new Figure 3 that complement the findings with small molecule KG501, an inhibitor of CREB association with CBP. On the other hand, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion section explaining why we have used inhibitors and their limitation. This paragraph reads as follows:</p><p>“In this study, we have favored pharmacological inhibitors of the different components of downstream BDNF/TrkB signaling over genetic tools. The various drugs used allowed us to inhibit enzymatic or biological activities in a localized manner, that is, in the compartment of cell bodies or the axonal compartment of microfluidic cultures, since current genetic tools do not allow this type of evaluation. Complementary reagents were used to address the limitation in specificity that implies the use of drugs. For example, to evaluate axonal TrkB's participation in dendritic arborization induced by axonal BDNF we studied rat cultures using the Trks inhibitor K252A and in TrkBF616A knock-in mice cultures, the 1NM-PP1 kinase inhibitor. KG501 and a CREB dominant negative were used to assess CREB involvement. Finally, to evaluate the activation of p4EBP1 in cell bodies in the retrograde signaling of BDNF, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and mTOR inhibitor Torin 1 were used. In these experiments, the inhibitors abolished immunofluorescence, indicating a high specificity, at least for the evaluated substrate. Undoubtedly, pharmacological inhibitors have an explicit limitation of selectivity. There is still room for the development of inhibitors that can be used to assess local activities in neuronal cells, such as optogenetic inhibition, as it has been used for RabGTPases and the TrkA receptor (Khamo et al., 2019, Nguyen et al., 2016, Cornejo et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The CREB data should be removed since it is downstream of many processes, including retrograde BDNF signaling. Also, there is no evidence for signaling endosomes in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the form in which these results were presented in the previous manuscript version gives space for confusion. We have prepared a new supplementary Figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) that gathers all the results performed in vivo by injecting AAV1 intracerebrally, driving the expression of a dominant negative mutant of CREB and mCherry (the same AAV used in new Figure 3G-J). These results complement the results obtained in new Figure 3G-J and they may be valuable information to other scientists. Also, we have stated in the discussion and the description of results that these results are not evidence for in vivo signaling endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>4. In Figure S3, the P-TrkB westerns are not very convincing (the induction by BDNF). The quantifications look good, suggesting this Western blot is not representative of the data. Data showing a clear BDNF-induced TrkB phosphorylation should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have changed the Western blot in what is now new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the discussion, the authors debate whether TrkB kinase inhibition in cell bodies and dendrites (which blocks dendrite growth and signaling) is mechanistically due to continuous re-autophosphorylation of TrkB coming from axons, or TrkB from axons activating TrkB in cell bodies. The authors propose the latter and cite papers that support this. However, the former is clearly true in peripheral neurons with NGF-TrkA signaling (Ye et al., Cell, 2003). Both possibilities are plausible at this point and should be equally proposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we have now added a new paragraph in the discussion that include this paper and it reads as follow in the discussion of the new version of the article.</p><p>“The first is that TrkB is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated during its transport along the axon; thus, 1NM-PP1 binds the ATP binding cassette of the receptor and prevents its phosphorylation. Our finding of signaling endosomes containing axonal BDNF and active TrkB in cell bodies supports this possibility (Figure 6). Similar results were found in sympathetic neurons, where TrkA activated in distal axons is required to induce neuronal survival by axonal NGF (Ye et al., 2003). The second possible mechanism is that BDNF retrograde signaling promotes the phosphorylation of somatodendritic TrkB and that this process is required to maintain CREB phosphorylation. In agreement with this last idea, other groups have shown that retrogradely transported TrkA in sympathetic neurons locally accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment. The process increases the phosphorylation of other TrkA receptors in cell bodies (Lehigh et al., 2017, Yamashita et al., 2017). In addition, we also observed activated TrkB receptors positive vesicles not containing BDNF in axonally stimulated cortical neurons in our studies (unpublished observation). These results suggest that axonal BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes are required to propagate BDNF signaling in cell bodies, which includes activating the cell body TrkB receptors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors forgot to include the Cho et al. 2013 paper in the bibliography. Related to this paper, the authors cite it to propose that calcium waves may cause early CREB phosphorylation. This paper, however, showed retrogradely moving calcium waves after a peripheral nerve injury, not after neurotrophic factor signaling. This should be written more clearly in the discussion because it is misleading/confusing as currently written.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake, and we have now included the paper in the bibliography and re-written the sentence as follow in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>“In injured PNS neurons it has been observed calcium waves, as mediator of the nuclear regenerative response (Cho et al., 2013). It is possible that similar calcium waves are contributing to early CREB activation by axonal BDNF in our studies”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 3G, S2D – I don't understand how this in vivo data adds to the paper and I think the authors should take it out.
