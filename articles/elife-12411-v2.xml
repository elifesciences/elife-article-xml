Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Arf-GEFs) regulate virtually all traffic through the Golgi by activating Arf GTPase trafficking pathways. The Golgi Arf-GEFs contain multiple autoregulatory domains, but the precise mechanisms underlying their function remain largely undefined. We report a crystal structure revealing that the N-terminal DCB and HUS regulatory domains of the Arf-GEF Sec7 form a single structural unit. We demonstrate that the established role of the N-terminal region in dimerization is not conserved; instead, a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain is responsible for dimerization of Sec7. We find that the DCB/HUS domain amplifies the ability of Sec7 to activate Arf1 on the membrane surface by facilitating membrane insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix. This enhancing function of the Sec7 N-terminal domains is consistent with the high rate of Arf1-dependent trafficking to the plasma membrane necessary for maximal cell growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12411.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12411.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12411.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of plants, animals and other eukaryotes are subdivided into different membrane-bound compartments. One of these compartments – called the Golgi complex – has been likened to the 'Grand Central Station' of the eukaryotic cell, because it serves as the cell’s centralized sorting compartment. Small, spherical structures called vesicles arrive at the Golgi complex from other cellular compartments, and the material within these vesicles is then sorted, packaged into new vesicles, and sent out to different destinations.</p> <p>Regulatory proteins are responsible for making decisions about when to turn on different incoming and outgoing pathways to or from the Golgi complex. In particular, one regulatory protein named Sec7 controls many of the outgoing vesicles that leave the Golgi complex. Sec7 is a fairly large protein and has different parts, or domains, that regulate how the protein works. It was known that two of these regulatory domains (named 'DCB' and 'HUS') were required for Sec7 to work, but it was not known what these domains actually did.</p> <p>Richardson et al. have now used a technique called X-ray crystallography to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the regulatory DCB and HUS domains of Sec7 from a species of yeast. The Sec7 protein has been conserved throughout evolution with few changes, and so the structure of this yeast protein is expected to be the same as that of the corresponding protein in humans. Unexpectedly, Richardson et al. discovered that DCB and HUS are not structurally separate domains and actually form a single 'DCB/HUS' domain.</p> <p>Biochemical experiments then showed that the DCB/HUS domain helps Sec7 work on the surface of membranes. One of the jobs of Sec7 is to insert another regulatory protein (called Arf1) into the membranes of the Golgi complex, and these new findings reveal that the DCB/HUS domain helps Sec7 overcome the challenges associated with this task.</p> <p>Researchers have now uncovered structural information for approximately half of the Sec7 protein, and so an important future challenge will be to reveal the structure of the remaining regulatory domains of Sec7. This achievement will help researchers to figure out how all of the parts of Sec7 work together to control how this protein makes decisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12411.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12411.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd><kwd>vesicle traffic</kwd><kwd>T. terrestris</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name><name><surname>Halaby</surname><given-names>Steve L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gustafson</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fromme</surname><given-names>J Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halaby</surname><given-names>Steve L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gustafson</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new structure reveals two Arf-GEF regulatory domains form a single structural unit that stimulates Arf-GEF activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, trafficking of membranes and membrane proteins from their site of synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum through the secretory pathway proceeds via the Golgi apparatus. This trafficking, mediated by membrane vesicles and tubules, must achieve the specificity to ensure that proteins are targeted to the correct destinations and with the correct post-translational modifications while retaining the throughput required to provide the bulk of the lipid content of the plasma membrane’s growth over the course of cell division. Much of this process is controlled at the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network (TGN), where the final processed forms of proteins are recognized by cargo adaptors and packaged into vesicles for transport to endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In both humans and model organisms, Arf GTPases act as the central coordination point for vesicle formation at the TGN, directly regulating a cascade of cargo adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Arf activation is regulated in turn by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that exchange bound GDP for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casanova, 2007</xref>). The accompanying conformational change in the Arf GTPase rearranges ‘switch’ regions for recognition by effectors and exposes a myristoylated amphipathic N-terminal helix that inserts into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonny et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldberg, 1998</xref>). Arf-GEFs thereby stand upstream of Arf GTPases as the initiator of the cascade of events leading to vesiculation of TGN cisternae.</p><p>At the TGN, the Arf1-5 GTPases are activated by the BIG1/2 proteins in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mansour et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamaji et al., 2000</xref>) and the Arf1/2 GTPases are activated by Sec7 in the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achstetter et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peyroche et al., 1996</xref>). These TGN-localized Arf-GEFs are universally conserved in eukaryotes, and their importance is underscored by neurological disorders associated with mutations in the <italic>BIG2/ARFGEF2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The TGN-localized Arf-GEFs comprise roughly 1800 functional residues including a central catalytic domain of ~200 residues mediating nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chardin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morinaga et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peyroche et al., 1996</xref>). This catalytic domain, commonly called the Sec7 domain, will be referred to here as the GEF domain for clarity. Conserved domains C-terminal to the GEF domain, termed HDS1-4 (homology downstream of Sec7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mouratou et al., 2005</xref>), act to integrate the signals from several small GTPases, including Arf1 itself, to switch Sec7 from a strongly autoinhibited to a strongly autoactivated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson and Fromme, 2012</xref>). The N-terminal DCB (dimerization and cyclophilin binding) and HUS (homology upstream of Sec7) domains, though conserved in all Golgi Arf-GEFs and essential for Golgi function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>), remain more of an enigma. Numerous functions have been proposed, including cyclophilin binding, regulated dimerization, Arl1 and Arf1 GTPase binding, and enhancement of GEF activity, but studies are frequently contradictory and fail to assemble into a unified understanding of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christis and Munro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grebe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lowery et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mouratou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the crystal structure of the regulatory DCB and HUS domains from <italic>Thielavia terrestris</italic> Sec7 and demonstrate that they form a single continuous structural domain. We find that dimerization of this N-terminal domain is not conserved and that Sec7 dimerization is primarily mediated by the C-terminal HDS4 domain. We describe a new function of the DCB/HUS regulatory domain: this domain enhances the activation of Arf1 in a manner dependent on both lipids and the N-terminal membrane insertion element of Arf1, implying a role in chaperoning the insertion of Arf1 into the Golgi membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The DCB and HUS regions form a unified structural domain</title><p>To gain structural insights into the function of the DCB and HUS domains, we purified and attempted to crystallize constructs from ten species, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the thermophiles <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum, Myceliophthora thermophila</italic>, and <italic>T. terrestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amlacher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berka et al., 2011</xref>). Following correction of the annotated intron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), a construct comprising residues 1–458 of <italic>T. terrestris</italic> produced crystals diffracting to 2.6 Å. Using experimental phase determination by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of selenomethionine-substituted protein, the structure of the DCB and HUS domains was determined with four copies in the asymmetric unit. The best resolved chains in the model lack only unresolved loops and the final ~35 conserved residues of the HUS domain absent from the crystallized construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Extensive crystal contacts between chains A and B stabilize them sufficiently to produce excellent electron density; the N-terminal portions of chains C and D, with fewer crystal contacts, were less well resolved and had only enough visible density to be modeled as copies of chains A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).</p><p>The DCB and HUS domains together form a single continuous armadillo repeat joined by a conserved ~1400 Å<sup>2</sup> hydrophobic interface, comprising helices 7 and 8 from the DCB domain and helices 10 and 11 from the HUS domain. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We therefore regard the N-terminal regulatory region of Sec7 as a single DCB/HUS structural domain. In most species, a poorly conserved ~100 amino acid linker connects the conserved DCB and HUS domains. In the <italic>T. terrestris</italic> DCB/HUS domain structure, residues 245–271 of this interdomain region (between helices 8 and 10, including helix 9) are resolved in their packing against the armadillo repeat, and the remaining 46 and 21 residue stretches are unresolved in the structure. Interestingly, the mutation E209K in human BIG2 associated with neuronal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheen et al., 2004</xref>) maps to this unresolved region. A striking conserved positively charged patch is seen at the interface of helices 7 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12411.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of <italic>T. terrestris</italic> Sec7 DCB/HUS domain (residues 1–458) </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chains A (green) and D (white) are shown; chain A is colored light to dark N to C, and helices are numbered N to C.

Many constructs failed to yield reliable SAXS data, so we turned to multi-angle light-scattering (MALS) to identify the oligomeric state of a series of truncation constructs. We found that full-length <italic>T. terrestris</italic> Sec7 and the corresponding <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec7<sub>f</sub> (residues 203–2009) construct were both dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Strikingly, removal of the C-terminal HDS4 domain resulted in a monomer for constructs from both species, whereas a construct corresponding to a predicted coiled-coil from the HDS4 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mariño-Ramírez and Hu, 2002</xref>) was itself dimeric. This indicates that the HDS4 domain mediates dimerization of the intact Sec7 proteins from both <italic>T. terrestris</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>To examine the role of the HDS4 domain in cells, we attempted to introduce a GFP-Sec7ΔHDS4 construct into cells lacking the essential <italic>SEC7</italic> gene.

To examine whether this effect was due to mis-localization of the construct, we imaged an otherwise wild-type strain harboring the GFP-Sec7ΔHDS4 construct. Although we detected a low level of cytoplasmic mislocalization, GFP-Sec7ΔHDS4 was largely localized correctly to the TGN, as observed by its colocalization with endogenous Sec7-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, localization of the shorter GFP-Sec7ΔC+HDS1 construct was more severely compromised, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the HDS4 domain is critically important for Sec7 function in cells but does not appear to play a major role in its localization.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12411.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The HDS4 domain of Sec7 is important for function but dispensable for TGN localization. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Centromeric plasmids encoding GFP-Sec7 constructs expressed from the <italic>SEC7</italic> promoter were introduced into a <italic>SEC7</italic> plasmid shuffling strain (CFY409).

Whereas a construct lacking the HDS4 domain is monomeric, a construct lacking the HDS2-4 domains was an equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Removal of additional domains, generating constructs lacking the HDS1-4 domains with or without the GEF domain, resulted in stable dimers. However, the corresponding constructs of <italic>T. terrestris</italic> Sec7 were monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The simplest model accounting for dimerization of the isolated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> N-terminus, dimerization via the HDS4 domain, and loss of dimerization when the HDS1 domain is present, invokes an interaction between the HDS1 and DCB/HUS domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When present, the HDS1 domain likely masks a site by which the DCB/HUS domain dimerizes in its absence, but Sec7 retains its dimerization via the HDS4 domain. Whether this masked dimerization is an artifact or serves a regulatory purpose remains unknown, but the presence of an exposed interaction domain in truncated constructs provides an attractive explanation for the complicated oligomerization results seen in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grebe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>), as well as for the seemingly absolute requirement of the DCB/HUS domain for soluble expression of most constructs containing HDS domains. Unfortunately, this latter phenomenon also precludes more thorough biochemical testing of this hypothesis, leaving this model partially speculative. It is also evident from the behavior of the <italic>T. terrestris</italic> constructs that dimerization of the DCB/HUS domain is not a conserved behavior. We note that this analysis does not exclude the possibility of membrane- or temperature-dependent effects on dimerization or possible influences on Sec7 dimerization by other proteins.</p><p>While reliable SAXS data could not be obtained from <italic>T. terrestris</italic> constructs including the GEF domain, modeling our N-terminal structure and a previously solved GEF domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Renault et al., 2002</xref>) to SAXS data collected on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec7(203–1017) (Sec7ΔC) suggests that the GEF domain is flexibly connected to the DCB/HUS domain rather than continuing the armadillo repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As such, it appears unlikely that the intact DCB/HUS construct (1–492) is prone to the same artifactual dimerization issues at its C-terminus as is the truncated Sec7(1–458) construct.</p><p>Given our finding that the HDS4 domain appears to be the primary mediator of Sec7 dimerization, we decided to investigate the multimerization state of the distantly related early-Golgi Arf-GEF Gea2 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which has evolved without an HDS4 domain. MALS analysis revealed that Gea2 full-length and C-terminal truncation constructs are dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that dimerization in some form is critical to the regulation of all the Golgi Arf-GEFs, and that in the absence of an HDS4 domain, N-terminal dimerization may have evolved to acquire additional importance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sec7 DCB/HUS domain activity is lipid-dependent</title><p>We previously observed that the DCB/HUS domain confers a significant enhancement of activity on the GEF domain, in the physiologically relevant context of a myristoylated Arf1 substrate in the presence of liposome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). We sought to investigate the mechanism for this enhancement on the basis of the DCB/HUS crystal structure.

The kinetics of Arf1 membrane insertion as measured in this assay directly correlated with the kinetics of Arf1 activation as measured by tryptophan fluorescence and further confirmed the role of the DCB/HUS domain in stimulating Arf1 activation at the membrane surface.</p><p>Similar results were also observed using equivalent <italic>T. terrestris</italic> constructs on the basis of tryptophan fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the stimulatory effect is observed in both dimeric (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and monomeric (<italic>T. terrestris</italic>) constructs, we infer that DCB/HUS domain stimulation of GEF activity occurs independently of dimerization. Two potential mechanisms of action thereby present themselves: either the DCB/HUS domain binds to the membrane surface to recruit the GEF domain to its site of action, or the DCB/HUS domain assists in membrane-insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic helix of Arf1.</p><p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we changed the lipids in the reaction mixture from physiologically relevant TGN-like liposome membranes to non-physiological DMPC/cholate micelles known to support nucleotide exchange of myristoylated Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kahn and Gilman, 1986</xref>). In the presence of these micelles, the activity of both constructs on myristoylated Arf1 was higher, indicating an increase in the intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, yet the Sec7ΔC construct was again more active than the isolated GEF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As this effect is not seen on ΔN17Arf1 in the presence of micelles, which displays a uniformly reduced rate of exchange, it cannot be attributed merely to the lipids themselves. In a separate experiment we introduced the L8K mutation into the membrane insertion helix of Arf1, which reduces its hydrophobicity and enables Arf1 activation in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon et al., 2004</xref>). We observed that the DCB/HUS domain did not stimulate activity of the GEF domain towards L8K-Arf1 in either the absence or presence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that GEF stimulation by the DCB/HUS domain involves insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix into a hydrophobic and presumably lipidic environment, yet this effect is indifferent to the precise nature of the lipids.</p><p>Our interpretation of these observations is that the DCB/HUS domain assists in overcoming a kinetic activation barrier associated with insertion of the myristoylated Arf1 N-terminal helix into membranes. An alternative possibility, that the DCB/HUS domain has indiscriminate affinity for lipid surfaces and therefore increases the rate of membrane-localized encounters between the GEF domain and its substrate, is addressed further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The surfaces of helices 4 and 6 mediate DCB/HUS activity</title><p>To pair these observations to the structure of the DCB/HUS domain, we performed a targeted functional screen by generating an extensive panel of mutants in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, selecting conserved residues found at the surface of the <italic>T. terrestris</italic> DCB/HUS domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The use of the Sec7ΔC truncation enabled us to directly monitor the role of the DCB/HUS domain without confounding affects from the C-terminal HDS1-4 domains. While several mutants could not be purified, including <italic>sec7-1</italic>, a sufficient number representing both conserved regions were purified to allow us to test the involvement of each region in the DCB/HUS stimulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). We found that mutations on the surfaces of helices 4 and 6 (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> residues 297–305 and 364–368) reduced both cell viability and membrane-dependent GEF activity of Sec7ΔC, whereas mutations in the positively charged patch (i.e., <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> residues Arg505 and Lys513) had little effect in vitro despite modestly affecting growth. None of the tested mutations reduced GEF activity in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the mutations that reduce membrane-proximal GEF activity do not simply cause misfolding of these contructs. Therefore, the surfaces of helices 4 and 6 are important for both GEF activity and cell viability.</p><p>A notable absence from both the structure presented here and the available structures of the GEF domain is the highly conserved ‘HUS-box’ located between helix 15 and the helix 16 truncated from our crystallized construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mouratou et al., 2005</xref>). A previous study reported that the HUS-box was required for a yeast 2-hybrid interaction between the DCB and HUS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>), but our structural data do not support such a role. To assess whether the HUS-box plays a role in GEF stimulation by the DCB/HUS domain, we generated single alanine mutants in the HUS-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6D—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). One mutation, N653A, was both inviable in the sensitized strain and compatible with purification. The N653A Sec7ΔC construct showed no difference in GEF activity compared to the wild-type allele in the presence of membranes, indicating that the HUS-box plays no role in the observed exchange rate enhancement by the DCB/HUS domain.</p><p>Another potential role of the DCB/HUS domain which would not have been uncovered in our in vitro assay is its interaction with Arl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christis and Munro, 2012</xref>). Despite extensive effort, we could not detect any stable interaction between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec7ΔC and Arl1 in the presence or absence of membranes, nor did preincubation of Sec7ΔC with membrane-bound Arl1 show any effect on catalytic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). As we previously reported an interaction between Arl1 and longer Sec7 constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>), this interaction appears to depend on one or more of the HDS domains in addition to the DCB/HUS domain in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The DCB/HUS domain facilitates lipid insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix</title><p>Finally, to distinguish between different models for lipid-dependent DCB/HUS function, we assayed the ability of the isolated DCB/HUS domain to compete with the Sec7ΔC construct in the GEF activity assay.

We considered the possibility that the excess competing DCB/HUS domain was simply saturating the membrane surface and therefore interfering with membrane-proximal Arf activation. Therefore, we tested whether addition of excess liposome membranes could relieve the competitive inhibition. Addition of a sixfold excess of membranes failed to relieve even partially the inhibitory effect of excess competing DCB/HUS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This indicates that inhibition of Sec7ΔC GEF activity by excess DCB/HUS domain does not occur through competition for binding to the membrane surface. Therefore, excess DCB/HUS domain likely competes with Sec7ΔC for binding to the substrate Arf1.</p><p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a direct, and likely transient, interaction of the DCB/HUS domain with the Arf1 substrate and imply that the GEF domain and DCB/HUS domain each make distinct contacts with Arf1 during the exchange reaction. Analysis of SAXS data collected on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sec7ΔC suggests flexible linkage between the DCB/HUS and GEF domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the possibility of simultaneous DCB/HUS and GEF domain binding to Arf1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we determined that the regulatory DCB and HUS domains of Sec7 form an unexpected single structural unit that plays a direct role in Arf1 activation at the membrane surface. Previous studies described roles of the DCB/HUS domain in regulation via oligomerization and Arl1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christis and Munro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>). The strength of the DCB/HUS Arl1 interaction appears to differ among Sec7 orthologs from different species; although Arl1 is clearly important for BIG1/2 localization in fly and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christis and Munro, 2012</xref>), it is dispensable for Sec7 localization in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Setty et al., 2004</xref>) and is not required for Sec7 function in all fly tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests eukaryotic cells have evolved multiple ways to regulate Arf activation at the TGN using the same Arf-GEF.</p><p>We have now described an additional and likely conserved function of the DCB/HUS domain: residues of helices 4 and 6 stimulate Arf1 nucleotide exchange activity dependent on the presence of lipids and the GEF domain. Based on the data we present here, a revised model for DCB/HUS function must account for the requirement of an intact Arf1 membrane insertion helix, for the requirement of lipids, and for a presumably transient interaction with Arf1. One speculative model consistent with all observations is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. A consequence of Arf1 acting to protect its own hydrophobic membrane insertion moiety tightly coupled with nucleotide state is that the nucleotide exchange transition state may briefly expose the Arf1 N-terminal myristoylated amphipathic helix to aqueous solution before its insertion into the membrane. Exchange of nucleotide by the Sec7 GEF domain may position the flexibly linked DCB/HUS domain appropriately for stabilization of this transition state, either via direct transient binding to the amphipathic helix or via positioning Arf1 optimally relative to the adjacent membrane surface.</p><p>The Golgi Arf-GEFs regulate the central membrane trafficking pathway involved in growth of eukaryotic cells by delivering the bulk of lipids to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drubin and Nelson, 1996</xref>). We have previously observed a maximum in vitro Sec7-mediated Arf1 exchange rate of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, requiring intact Sec7<sub>f</sub> and activating small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>). Using existing estimates of membrane flux and cellular and vesicular protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodonova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Layton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Presley et al., 2002</xref>), we estimate the rate of Arf1 nucleotide exchange required to support maximal cell growth to be approximately 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Sec7 must additionally process enough Arf1 to counterbalance endolysosomal trafficking, as well as ‘overhead’ for non-productive exchanges not leading to vesiculation. While these latter rates are much more difficult to estimate, it is entirely plausible that the four- to eightfold increase in activity provided by the DCB/HUS domain would prove essential to achieving the Arf1 activation throughput required to support maximal cell growth.</p><p>While multimerization via the DCB and HUS domains has been observed in several species and has been proposed to regulate Sec7 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grebe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>), the ability of the DCB/HUS domain to function as a monomer in the <italic>T. terrestris</italic> Sec7ΔC construct suggests that dimerization is not essential for DCB/HUS domain function. Sec7 is autoinhibited by both its HDS1 and HDS4 domains, and appears to adopt open and closed conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Interactions between the DCB/HUS and HDS domains may provide a mechanism for autoinhibition by occlusion of the GEF domain in a closed conformation. The absence of the HDS domains in a truncated construct would expose an unstable interaction region in the DCB/HUS domain that becomes stabilized by dimerization. Dimerization of the intact DCB/HUS domain may be an artifact of truncation, but perhaps also corresponds to a <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory conformation of the full-length protein induced through interactions with known regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>). Our observations that the HDS4 domain mediates both dimerization and autoinhibition imply that Sec7 dimerization is indeed a means of regulation. In the absence of separation of function mutants, it is currently not possible to determine whether dimerization or autoinhibition is the more important function of the HDS4 domain, or whether these two functions are intimately coupled and therefore inseparable. Interestingly, a recent study reported that dimerization of human GBF1, which lacks an HDS4 domain, is not required for its function in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that the DCB/HUS domain of Sec7 stimulates GEF activity by facilitating Arf1 amphipathic helix insertion into a lipid environment during nucleotide exchange. Further studies are now needed to elucidate the role of the HUS-box and how the DCB/HUS domain functions in concert with the HDS domains, as well as the basis for the apparent differences in regulation between the early-Golgi and late-Golgi Arf-GEFs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of constructs</title><p>Sec7 and Arf1 constructs were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson and Fromme, 2015</xref>), with no adjustments to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> construct protocols required for <italic>T. terrestris</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>A structure of the <italic>T. terrestris</italic> DCB/HUS domain of Sec7 is described and the role of these domains in GEF activity toward Arf1 has been investigated. The structure work is well done and is clearly presented. in vitro GEF activity assays show that nucleotide exchange on Arf1 by the Sec7 GEF domain is potentiated by the adjacent DCB/HUS domain in the presence of liposomes, and that this requires the N-terminal helix of Arf1. The authors conclude that the DCB/HUS domain facilitates lipid insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The reviewers agreed that the major conclusion of the paper, that the DCB/HUS domain facilitates lipid insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix, is not adequately supported by the data. While they consider the authors' interpretation of their data to be reasonable, it is not directly supported with experimental data; all that is shown is Trp fluorescence measurements as a proxy for nucleotide exchange. This is necessary to address, particularly since early work on Arf1 (see below) raises an alternative interpretation than the authors' whereby the DCB/HUS domain increase the specific activity of the GEF domain without directly promoting membrane binding by the N-terminal helix. Related, the reviewers are also concerned that the Trp fluorescence assay used to infer nucleotide exchange may be misleading when assayed in the presence of lipids due to the potential that these agents influence the local environment of the Trp residue that reports the occupancy state of the nucleotide binding site. In order to be further considered by <italic>eLife</italic>, the paper will need to provide direct evidence supporting the model that the DCB-HUS domain acts directly on the N-terminal helix of Arf to promote its insertion into the membrane. With regard to the effects of lipids on Arf Trp fluorescence, the reviewers noted that this latter concern might be adequately addressed by a more thorough description of the assay methods, including the strategy used to account for changes in fluorescence not due to nucleotide binding (i.e., in the text).</p> <p>Background: DPMC micelles stimulate the <italic>intrinsic</italic> rate of hydrolysis on Arf1 (Khan and Gilman 1986). This underscores a concern with the authors' models. Does the DCB-HUS domain promote Arf1 membrane insertion or, alternatively, does DCB-HUS increase the specific activity of the GEF domain when presented when the N-domain of Arf1 is – through whatever mechanism – already pried away from its pocket in Arf1:GDP. Indeed, that specific conformational change (characterized by NMR) has been suggested to be a prerequisite for GTP binding:</p> <p>&quot;The [yeast Myr-Arf1:GDP] structure clearly places the myristoyl chain in a hydrophobic groove between a C-terminal helix and a loop connecting b strands 3 and 4. The positioning suggests a clash with this loop would occur as it exists in the GTP-bound form, a fact that may require membrane association to accommodate an expelled myristoyl chain before GDP exchange can occur.&quot; (Liu, Khan, Prestegard PMID: 19141284). A possibility consistent with the authors' membrane-first model is that the DCB-HUS domain might actually allow Arf1-GDP to stably associate with the membrane (in the absence or presence of the GEF domain).

That might be a pretty straightforward floatation or pelleting experiment.</italic> </p> <p>Regarding possible artifacts arising from any affects of lipids on Arf Trp fluorescence, we can rule these out with certainty based on control experiments. To convince the reader of this, we now include additional descriptions in the Results and Methods sections. The most important thing to note is that we do directly monitor how the addition of each component changes the fluorescence of the reaction. Notably, exchange rates are extracted from time-course changes in kinetics that only occur subsequent to the addition of GTP, and we include a baseline control (i.e., no GEF construct) in each set of experiments to confirm that no change in fluorescence is seen over time in the absence of exchange (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, black trace). Any contributions to Trp fluorescence from lipids themselves will impact the magnitude of the fluorescence readings, but not the rate at which fluorescence changes over time. The rate of change in fluorescence over time is a direct read-out of Arf conformational change associated with binding to GTP.</p> <p>We now provide additional experimental evidence for the role of DCB/HUS in promoting Arf1 association with membranes (which occurs through insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic helix). In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, we show a membrane-association time-course, as assayed by liposome flotation, comparing the ability of Sec7 GEF constructs to stimulate stable Arf1 membrane binding (in the presence of GTP). The Sec7ΔC construct (containing the DCB/HUS domain) is much more active than the isolated GEF domain in this assay. The extent of the membrane- binding directly parallels the extent of Arf activation (as monitored by TRP fluorescence) for both GEF constructs, demonstrating that the DCB/HUS domain facilitates both Arf1 activation and stable membrane association (which requires insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic helix). We also performed the control experiments suggested by Reviewer 3 to provide additional evidence in support of the model (see below).</p> <p>We note that our experiments do directly address the possibility that the DCB/HUS domain might simply increase the specific activity of the GEF domain: The fact that the DCB/HUS domain does not stimulate the activity of the GEF domain towards the deltaN17-Arf1 or L8K-Arf1 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrates that the DCB-HUS domain is acting only when the N-terminus of Arf1 needs to be inserted into lipids. Furthermore, as the deltaN17-Arf1 substrate lacks the N-terminal helix of Arf1, this helix can be considered to be “pried away” from its binding pocket in this mutant substrate, yet the DCB/HUS domain has no effect on this substrate.</p> <p>Additionally, the competition experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> demonstrate that excess DCB/HUS domain inhibits the activity of the Sec7- deltaC construct, again arguing against a simple increase in the specific activity of the GEF domain.</p> <p>We agree that it is very likely that membrane association of Arf1- GDP occurs prior to the exchange reaction. However, this interaction is known to be very transient (Antonny et al., Biochemistry 1997). If the DCB/HUS domain stabilizes this transient intermediate state (which we think it does), this state is still likely to be quite transient compared to the time-scale of a pelleting or flotation experiment. We previously performed an experiment similar to that suggested above – as reported in our 2012 paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), Arf1-GDP does not bind stably to membranes in the presence of any Sec7 constructs, including Sec7-deltaC. Our GEF assays are perhaps more informative in this regard, as an increased rate of reaction is suggestive of the stabilization (lower energy) of a high-energy intermediate or transition state.</p> <p>We note that we propose two alternatives for how the DCB/HUS domain might facilitate Arf1 membrane-proximal activation and insertion of the amphipathic helix: either through direct transient interaction with the Arf1 N-terminus or by positioning Arf1 optimally for membrane insertion (either binding to a different region of Arf1 or otherwise constraining the orientation of the GEF domain in a manner that would position the Arf1 N- terminal helix close to the membrane when Arf1 is engaged by the GEF domain). We think that both of these possibilities are interesting, as either involves function of the DCB/HUS domain to overcome the activation barrier associated with membrane insertion.</p> <p>We expect that further determination of exactly how the DCB/HUS domain facilitates membrane insertion of the Arf1 N-terminus will await structures of longer constructs of Sec7 or its homologs “caught in the act” of activating Arf1.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
