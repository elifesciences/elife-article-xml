hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic dysfunction are characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identified Amphiphysin I mediates both tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction in AD. Amphiphysin I is cleaved by a cysteine proteinase asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) at N278 in the brains of AD patients. The amount of AEP-generated N-terminal fragment of Amphiphysin I (1-278) is increased with aging. Amphiphysin I (1-278) inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis and induces synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, Amphiphysin I (1-278) binds p35 and promotes its transition to p25, thus activates CDK5 and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation. Overexpression of Amphiphysin I (1-278) in the hippocampus of Tau P301S mice induces synaptic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cognitive deficits. However, overexpression of the N278A mutant Amphiphysin I, which resists the AEP-mediated cleavage, alleviates the pathological and behavioral defects. These findings suggest a mechanism of tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction in AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>amphiphysin Ⅰ</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>synaptic dysfunction</kwd><kwd>tau</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81822016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhentao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhentao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81571249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhentao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amphiphysin I is identified as a new substrate of AEP, and the resultant fragment induces synaptic dysfunction and promotes tau hyperphosphorylation via activating CDK5 kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by the deposition of extracellular senile plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Senile plaques are composed of amyloid-β (Aβ), while NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. The extent of tau deposition is closely related to the severity of cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arriagada et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brier et al., 2016</xref>). Tau is expressed in neurons and mainly distributed in axons. It acts as a microtubule-associated protein and regulates the dynamics of microtubules, mediating neuronal polarity, axonal outgrowth, and axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harada et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). During the onset of AD, tau loses its physiological conformation and aggregates into amyloid fibrils. Aggregated tau further recruits monomeric tau and propagates in a ‘prion-like’ manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clavaguera et al., 2009</xref>). In the brain of AD patients, tau undergoes several posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, truncation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pevalova et al., 2006</xref>). Hyperphosphorylation is widely considered to be the major trigger that mediates tau pathology. Hyperphosphorylated tau loses its ability to associate with microtubules and is more prone to form paired helical filaments (PHFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moszczynski et al., 2015</xref>). Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a major kinase involved in the abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engmann and Giese, 2009</xref>). The kinase activity of CDK5 is regulated by its regulatory subunit p35. P25, a truncated form of p35, is highly expressed in AD brains and constitutively activates CDK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patrick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seo et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the activation of the p25/CDK5 pathway leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2003</xref>). But the mechanisms that regulate the production of p25 and the activation of CDK5 in AD remain poorly understood.</p><p>In addition to the deposition of Aβ and tau, synaptic dysfunction is an early and invariant feature of AD, occurring long before the onset of cognitive symptoms. The severity of dementia is correlated with the extent of synaptic loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeKosky and Scheff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Terry et al., 1991</xref>). It has been demonstrated that both Aβ and tau contribute to synaptic dysfunction. Soluble Aβ oligomers induce synaptic dysfunction and block hippocampal long-term potentiation via binding to receptors on neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurén et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), while tau is required for Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ittner et al., 2010</xref>). Several synaptic proteins are decreased in the brain tissue of patients with AD, while the concentration of some synaptic proteins in the cerebral spinal fluids is increased, indicating synaptic degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bereczki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bereczki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kvartsberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Wilde et al., 2016</xref>). Amphiphysin I is a synaptic protein with an N-Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lichte et al., 1992</xref>). During the formation of newly retrieved presynaptic vesicles, Amphiphysin I senses and facilitates membrane curvature to mediate synaptic vesicles invagination and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takei et al., 1999</xref>). Amphiphysin I also acts as a linker protein binding with dynamin, clathrin, Amphiphysin II, and other dephosphins in the clathrin-coated complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMahon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wigge et al., 1997</xref>). Besides, Amphiphysin I also interacts with CDK5 activator p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floyd et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of Amphiphysin I is reduced in brain regions with aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Jesús-Cortés et al., 2012</xref>), indicating dysfunction of Amphiphysin I is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the relationship between Amphiphysin I dysregulation and tau phosphorylation during the development of AD is unknown.</p><p>Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves the peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of asparagine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dall and Brandstetter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, we showed that AEP is activated in the aging brain, cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, promoting the deposition of Aβ and tau in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In this report, we show that AEP cleaves the synaptic protein Amphiphysin I after N278, generating Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment. This fragment disrupts the normal endocytic function of Amphiphysin I, causing synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, the Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment promotes tau hyperphosphorylation through activating CDK5. Overexpression of Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment in Tau P301S mice induces synaptic dysfunction and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation. Hence, we suggest that Amphiphysin I undergoes a novel posttranslational modification mediated by AEP, and the generated fragment promotes the pathogenesis of AD. Preventing the cleavage of Amphiphysin I by AEP is a therapeutic target for treating AD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AEP cleaves amphiphysin I in vitro</title><p>To investigate whether AEP cleaves Amphiphysin I in vitro, we incubated active AEP enzyme with GST-Amphiphysin I for 5 and 10 min, respectively. Amphiphysin I was cleaved into two fragments in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To preclude the effect of other components in cell lysates, we purified the GST-Amphiphysin I and incubated it with AEP. Purified Amphiphysin I was also potently cleaved by active AEP enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Furthermore, we co-transfected GST-Amphiphysin I and myc-AEP into HEK293 cells. Wild-type AEP strongly induced Amphiphysin I fragmentation, while the AEP C189S mutant that abolishes its protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2003</xref>) was unable to induce the cleavage of Amphiphysin I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Moreover, the AEP inhibitor AENK suppressed the cleavage of Amphiphysin I, while its inactive analog AEQK did not affect this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The enzymatic activity of AEP was validated by fluorescent substrate cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>).

During the training phase, the latency to find the platform was progressively decreased in the Tau P301S transgenic mice expressing EGFP, demonstrating a learning effect. However, the learning ability was substantially impaired in mice expressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f,g</xref>). In the probe trial, the mice expressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) showed decreased time in the target quadrant, suggesting impaired memory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). All the mice showed comparable swim speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), suggesting that the overexpression of Amphiphysin I and its fragments does not affect motor function. Consistent with the water maze test results, the mice expressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragments spent less time in the new arm in the Y-maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>). These results indicate that the Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment induces learning and memory impairments. The long-term potentiation (LTP) of fEPSPs in the hippocampus is believed to be the basis of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fedulov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicoll, 2017</xref>). We found that LTP was diminished in mice overexpressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) and (279-596) fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>). The averaged slope of fEPSPs was smaller in mice expressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) and (279-596) fragments than in those expressing EGFP or full-length Amphiphysin I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>). Hence, the Amphiphysin I (1-278) and (279-596) fragments induce synaptic dysfunction in transgenic mouse models of AD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Overexpression of AEP-uncleavable mutant Amphiphysin I reverses synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments</title><p>To confirm the effects of AEP-generated Amphiphysin I fragments in AD pathology, we injected AAVs encoding wild-type Amphiphysin I or N278A mutant Amphiphysin I, which cannot be cleaved by AEP into the hippocampus of two-month-old Tau P301S transgenic mice. Two months later, we detected similar levels of EGFP-tagged wild-type and mutant Amphiphysin I in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).

AEP-generated Amphiphysin I fragments are found in the AD mouse model and human AD brain. The Amphiphysin I fragments disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytosis and induce synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment induces tau hyperphosphorylation through activating CDK5. Therefore, our results indicate that Amphiphysin I fragments generated by AEP induce synaptic dysfunction and tau hyperphosphorylation, which are two of the major pathological features in the AD brain.</p><p>Amphiphysin I plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by interacting with dephosphins such as clathrin, dynamin, and Amphiphysin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMahon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wigge et al., 1997</xref>). We found that Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment loses the function of binding to clathrin and dynamin, whereas the C-terminal (279-695) fragment loses the function of binding to Amphiphysin II and the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5e</xref>). During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, clathrin induces the deformation of the membrane into a budding vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robinson, 1994</xref>), whereas dynamin mediates the fission of the vesicle neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995</xref>). Once Amphiphysin I is cleaved, the resultant N-terminal fragment binds to the membrane and competes with full-length Amphiphysin I, which may interrupt the recruiting of clathrin and dynamin from cytosol to the endocytic site, resulting in disrupted clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Besides, the C-terminal fragment of Amphiphysin I (279-695) recruits dynamin and clathrin but cannot help them translocate to the membrane. This was proven by the inhibition of transferrin uptake and FM 4–64 dye assay in COS-7 cells or neurons expressing Amphiphysin I fragments. Additionally, overexpression of Amphiphysin I fragments in mice induces synaptic loss, synaptic dysfunction, and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>NFTs, which are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, are a major characteristic of AD. Here, we found significant tau hyperphosphorylation in mice overexpressing Amphiphysin I (1-278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Considering the interaction between Amphiphysin I and CDK5 activator p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floyd et al., 2001</xref>), we assumed that Amphiphysin I (1-278) may activate CDK5 through promoting the cleavage of p35 by calpain. Indeed, we found Amphiphysin I (1-278) binds to p35 with higher affinity than full-length Amphiphysin I. Moreover, Amphiphysin I (1-278) is mainly localized in cell membranes, where p35 tends to be cleaved by calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minegishi et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, more p35 is cleaved into p25 in the presence of Amphiphysin I (1-278). We also found increased CDK5 activity in neurons overexpression Amphiphysin I (1-278). Furthermore, inhibition of CDK5 reverses the phosphorylation of tau. Taken together, both the in vivo and in vitro evidence indicate that Amphiphysin I (1-278) promotes the hyperphosphorylation of tau by activating CDK5.</p><p>Here, we used the Tau P301S mice to explore the role of Amphiphysin I fragments on tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction. The Tau P301S mice overexpress a P301S mutant human tau that is indicated in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Since the mice develop tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and behavioral impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshiyama et al., 2007</xref>), it is widely used for the investigation of tauopathies. Thus, the results in the present study may reflect a common mechanism in tauopathies. Synaptic dysfunction and tau hyperphosphorylation are key pathological characteristics of AD. As discussed above, the Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment may induce synaptic dysfunction and tau phosphorylation through independent pathways. It causes synaptic dysfunction by interfering with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation through the p35/CDK5 pathway. However, it has been shown that tau hyperphosphorylation induces synaptic dysfunction. Thus, the hyperphosphorylated tau induced by Amphiphysin I (1-278) may also contribute to synaptic dysfunction.</p><p>Amphiphysin I is an endocytosis-related protein that plays an important role in the reuptake of neurotransmitters and the formation of synaptic vesicles. The dysfunction of synaptic vesicle recycling is found in early AD and is believed to contribute to cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt, 2009</xref>). The dysfunction of many endocytic proteins is involved in AD, such as Amphiphysin II, CD2AP, PICALM, RIN3, and so on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karch and Goate, 2015</xref>. Here, we show that Amphiphysin I fragments generated by AEP interrupt synaptic vesicle endocytosis and induce synaptic dysfunction, as indicated by impaired mEPSCs in cultured neurons and diminished LTP in brain slides expressing Amphiphysin I fragments. In the Tau P301S mouse, overexpression of the full-length Amphiphysin I exerted protective effects, which can be explained by the beneficial effect of Amphiphysin I on synaptic function. It is noteworthy that the overexpressed full-length Amphiphysin I could also be fragmented by endogenous AEP and generate toxic fragments. However, the protective effect of the full-length Amphiphysin I may exceed the toxic effect of the AEP-generated Amphiphysin I fragment in our experiments.</p><p>The activity of Amphiphysin I is also regulated by phosphorylation which inhibits its binding to AP-2 and clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slepnev et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, calpain has been reported to regulate the activity of Amphiphysin I. During neural hyperexcitation, calpain cleaves Amphiphysin I, thus inhibits synaptic vesicle recycling, which may play an auto-protective role against neural hyperexcitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we found a novel posttranslational regulation of Amphiphysin I, cleavage by AEP. Noticeably, AEP cleaves Amphiphysin I in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of AEP-derived Amphiphysin I fragments in the AD mouse model induces synaptic dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, overexpression of the Amphiphysin I mutation which is resistant to the cleavage by AEP partially reversed AD pathology. Overall, our results suggest that the AEP-mediated cleavage of Amphiphysin I may take part in the pathogenesis of AD. Blocking Amphiphysin I cleavage by AEP may be a novel therapeutic intervention for treating AD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GST</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">Cat #

Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with 5 μg mGST-Amphiphysin I plasmids. Cells were collected, washed, and lysed in AEP buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS and pH 5.5, 0.5% Triton X-100) 48 hr after transfection, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 g at 4 ℃. Supernatants were incubated with recombinant AEP (5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) at pH7.4 or pH6.0 at 37 ℃ for different time points. AENK was used to test the effect of AEP inhibitor on the cleavage of Amphiphysin I. To measure the cleavage of purified Amphiphysin I by AEP, GST-tagged Amphiphysin I was purified with glutathione beads and then incubated with recombinant AEP in AEP buffer. The samples were then boiled in a 1× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Tissue homogenates or cell lysates (10 μg) were incubated in 200 μl assay buffer (20 mM citric acid, 60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0) containing 20 μM AEP substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC (Bachem).

The samples were resuspended in loading buffer (0.1% formic acid, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1% acetonitrile) and loaded onto a 20 cm nano-high performance liquid chromatography column (internal diameter 100 mm) packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9 mm beads (Dr. Maisch) and eluted over a 2 hr 4–80% buffer B reverse phase gradient (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid and 1% acetonitrile in water; buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) generated by a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation). Samples were ionized on a hybrid LTQ XL Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo) using a 2.0 kV electrospray ionization voltage from a nano-ESI source (Thermo). After collision-induced dissociation (collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.25, activation time 30 ms) for the top 10 precursor ions, data-dependent acquisition of centroid MS spectra at 30,000 resolution and MS/MS spectra were obtained in the LTQ, and the charge determined by the acquisition software is z ≥ 2.

Only <italic>b</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-ions were considered for scoring (Xcorr) and Xcorr along with DCn were dynamically increased for groups of peptides organized by a combination of trypticity (fully or partial) and precursor ion charge state to remove false-positive hits along with decoys until achieving a false-discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;5% (&lt;0.25% for proteins identified by more than one peptide). The FDR was estimated by the number of decoy matches (nd) and the total number of assigned matches (nt). FDR = 2*nd/nt, assuming mismatches in the original database were the same as in the decoy database.

The expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested and lysed in PBS and by sonication. The cell lysates were incubated with glutathione sepharose 4B GST-tagged protein purification resin. For His pull-down, Flag-His-p35 plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer and incubated with Ni-NTA Agarose. After washing four times with lysis buffer, the beads were incubated with mice brain tissue lysates or with lysates of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with indicated plasmids overnight.

The study reveals a novel molecular mechanism that may contribute to the pathogenesis of tau pathology in AD and potentially in other tauopathies. The authors describe a novel cleavage site in Amphiphysin I, that can be processed by the protease asparagine endopeptidase (AEP). They demonstrate that the cleavage occurs at N278, and that the resulting fragments can lead to dysfunction in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, and impaired learning and memory. Overall, the data are compelling, although a few aspects of quantitative data analysis could be worked out better, and some of the narrative should be toned down to more accurately reflect what the data demonstrate.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The representative images of biochemical and IHC data are generally compelling. However, consistent inclusion of group data and quantification are necessary to support the conclusions of each experiment, particularly for Figure 2d, Figure 4d, 4e, Figure 5a, 5b, and Figure 7d.</p><p>2. In Figure 2, relevance of the Amph1 (1-278) fragment to aging/AD is provided by examination of brain samples of AD patients as well as a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S mice). Both western blots and immunohistochemistry are used, but not in parallel, across aging wildtype mice, P301S mice, and human patients. Western blot quantification of Amph1 (1-278) fragment in P301S mice and in AD brain samples, as well as co-immunostaining of anti-N278 with p-tau in AD brain sections, should be performed for better understanding the roles of AEP-cleaved Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment in AD-related tau pathology. In addition, because the immunostaining of both mouse and human brain sections with anti- N278 is fairly diffuse, it is unclear how single positive cells were counted. Better images are needed to enable visualization of stained cells. Please also include demographic and pathological/clinical data of the patients from whom samples were analyzed.</p><p>3. Throughout the manuscript, the narrative needs to be toned down, particularly regarding the major claims, to more accurately reflect what the data demonstrate:</p><p>a. The functional experiments are performed in overexpression paradigms, and thus investigate the function of the respective Amphiphysin fragments directly. While this strategy allows investigation of the effects of the fragments on cellular function, it does not permit conclusions about the role of endogenous Amph1 cleavage. Therefore, statements such as &quot;Amphiphysin 1 cleavage by AEP induces synaptic dysfunction&quot; are not fully supported by the data. The authors would have had to demonstrate that blocking endogenous cleavage of Amph1 prevents synaptic dysfunction, which was not done. &quot;Amphiphysin 1 (1-278) fragment induces synaptic dysfunction&quot; would be more appropriate here.</p><p>b. Similarly, statements throughout the manuscript related to Figure 7 such as &quot;Blockage of AmphI fragmentation by AEP ameliorates synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments in Tau P301S mice&quot; are not fully supported by the data, since the authors did not block endogenous AEP-mediated cleavage of Amph1, but rather overexpressed a non-cleavable form in P301S mice. Endogenous Amph1 is likely still there and still cleaved. Moreover, since there were no wild-type mice to compare the P301S mice to, the authors did not demonstrate that P301S mice had synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments that were improved by expression of the non-cleavable Amph1.</p><p>c. Although the results overall implicate a role for Amphiphysin 1 cleavage in AD, it was not directly demonstrated in the current study. Therefore, statements such as &quot;Cleavage of Amphiphysin 1 …. is required for the progression of AD…&quot; (Line 301-302, but also throughout the manuscript) should be appropriately altered.</p><p>Toning down these and other similar statements throughout the manuscript will allow the conclusions to more accurately reflect the data.</p><p>4. In Figure 2d, in addition to the blot with the N278 antibody against cleaved Amph1, a blot for total Amph1 should be shown. This would clarify any potential change in total protein levels that may occur with aging, and furthermore show whether the AEP-generated fragment is indeed a major cleavage fragment or one of many. There are three bands visible on the N278 blot. What is the expected molecular weight for the 1-278 Amph1 fragment?</p><p>5. In Figure 4d, the increase in tau phosphorylation for mice expressing Amph1 (1-278) is striking. Do total tau levels change under these conditions?</p><p>6. In Figures4f and 5b, The AT100 staining shows an unusual, nuclear pattern – Tau is not usually detected in the nucleus. Why would this be the case? Do the authors see Tau in the nucleus in their system? Is the AT100 signal abolished in a Tau knockout/knockdown system?</p><p>7. In Figure 5e, the purity of the fractions should be demonstrated using marker proteins. Additionally, there is no p25 band visible on the blot, therefore the conclusion that more cytoplasmic p25 is observed in the presence of the 1-278 fragment is not supported.</p><p>8. In Figure 6c, synapse numbers are unaltered in mice expressing the two Amphiphysin fragments, they are however increased in mice overexpressing full-length Amphiphysin. The corresponding text on lines 256-258 needs to be changed to accurately reflect the data. Also, some discussion is warranted regarding whether the overexpressed full-length Amphiphysin gets cleaved by endogenous AEP, and why there are no obvious detrimental effects of the resulting fragments.</p><p>9. The authors showed that the Amph I (1-278) fragment could cause both tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunctions in Tau P301S mice. It is not clear in terms of the relationship between these two phenotypes – does one lead to the other or are both in parallel downstream of Amph I fragment? The authors should at least discuss different possibilities in the Discussion.</p><p>10. Tau-P301S is associated with FTD, but not AD, although the Tau-P301S mouse model (PS19) is useful for tauopathy studies. The authors should discuss this clearly in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Amphiphysin I cleavage by asparagine endopeptidase leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor, with Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The Reviewing Editor has drafted these comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors have substantially revised the manuscript, including new data, images, and analyses that strengthen the conclusions. A few comments remain.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. In the Methods sections, a description of how the immunohistochemical images were quantified is still lacking. Please define &quot;Optical density score&quot;, and indicate whether this refers to areas of tissue or within individual cells.</p><p>2. In Figure 4D, AT8 and AT100 staining in the EGFP-Amph1 (279-695) group is markedly more intense than that of either EGFP-Vector or EGFP-Amph1 FL groups. However, the quantification graphs indicate that there is no difference between staining in these three groups. Why is this? Was the &quot;Optical Density Score&quot; calculated the same way as in Figure 2D and 2F?</p><p>3. In the legends for Figure 4 and 5, n's are listed as &quot;n = 4&quot; or n = 5&quot;. It seems that this should be corrected to &quot;n = 4 mice per group&quot; or &quot;n = 5 mice per group&quot;, etc.</p><p>4. The authors have added a western blot of ATP1A1 to illustrate the purity of their membrane preparations, in Figure 5. However, there is no description of this new data in the text or in the figure legend.</p><p>5. The authors have toned down a number of their statements to accurately reflect the data. However, the title for the legend for Figure 7 still needs to be revised. It reads &quot;Amph1 N278A mutation ameliorates synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Tau P301S mice. However, since no data from wildtype mice is included in this figure, it is not clear that the P301S mice exhibited synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. It would be more accurate to state something like &quot;Expression of Amph1 N278A enhances synaptic and cognitive function in Tau P301S mice.&quot;</p><p>6. A few typos still remain: Figure 6F X-axis label should read &quot;Trials&quot;, not &quot;Trails&quot;; in Line 167, &quot;loss&quot; should be &quot;lose&quot;. There are a number of minor grammatical errors throughout the text that could be easily corrected by a proof-reader.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Amphiphysin I cleavage by asparagine endopeptidase leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor. The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as described below (original comment and your response copied here for clarity):</p><p>Comment 2. In Figure 4D, AT8 and AT100 staining in the EGFP-Amph1 (279-695) group is markedly more intense than that of either EGFP-Vector or EGFP-Amph1 FL groups.

Was the &quot;Optical Density Score&quot; calculated the same way as in Figure 2D and 2F?&quot;</p><p>Your response: &quot;The &quot;Optical Density Score&quot; calculated the same way as in Figure 2D and 2F. However, we calculated the optical density score of the entire image. The positive area of EGFP-Amph1 (279-695) group only accounted for a small percentage of the total area, which may explain why the difference between these groups were small.&quot;</p><p>The images shown in Figure 4D show alterations in expression that are just as striking, or even more so, than those shown in Figure 2D and 2F. Yet, the accompanying graphs indicate that the expression levels between the groups in question in 4D are not different, whereas those in 2D and 2F are markedly and significantly different. There is an incongruency that needs to be resolved. This brings up important questions of how representative the images are, whether similar sized and similarly magnified images were quantified, and how robust your system of image selection and quantification is. Please either perform the quantification at the same magnifications, or provide images in Figure 4D that are more representative of the quantification results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65301.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

To figure out which band is the AMPH1(1-278) fragment, we used brain lysates from AEP knockout mice as the negative control, and wild-type brain lysates as the positive control. We found that the band with a molecular weight of about 55 kDa is the Amph1(1-278) fragment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We found that the total tau levels were similar in different groups (Figure 4d, lower panel). These results indicate that the AMPH1(1-278) fragment enhances the phosphorylation of tau, but does not increase the levels of total tau.

The AT100 antibody recognizes p-tau phosphorylated at Thr212/Ser214 residues, which has been reported to be located in the nucleus of human brain samples (Hernandez-Ortega, Brain Pathol, 2015, 26: 593-605) and mouse neurons (Gartner, Neurobiol Aging, 1998, 19: 535-543). Actually, it has been demonstrated that AT100-positive tau is localized in the nucleolus of pyramidal cells from the CA1 region, and the AT100-positive nuclear tau in the cell nuclei increases progressively during aging (Gil L, et al., Brain Res, 2017, 1677:129-137). We also reported the nuclear localization of AT100 signals in Tau P301S mice (Zhang Z, et al., Nat Commun, 2017, 8:14740). To confirm the specificity of this antibody, we performed immunofluorescence staining with AT100 antibody in Tau knockout mice brain, and found that the signals were completely abolished (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

We also discussed the issue that overexpressed Amphiphysin I can be cleaved by endogenous AEP, but no obvious detrimental effects were found (Page 18, lines 383-389). In the Tau P301S mouse, overexpression of the full-length Amphiphysin I exerted protective effects, which can be explained by the beneficial effect of Amphiphysin I on synaptic function. It is noteworthy that the overexpressed full-length Amphiphysin I could also be fragmented by endogenous AEP and generate toxic fragments. However, the protective effect of the full-length Amphiphysin I may exceed the toxic effect of the AEP-generated Amphiphysin I fragment in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Synaptic dysfunction and tau hyperphosphorylation are key pathological characteristics of AD. As discussed above, the Amphiphysin I (1-278) fragment may induce synaptic dysfunction and tau phosphorylation through independent pathways. It causes synaptic dysfunction by interfering with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, and enhances tau hyperphosphorylation through the p35/CDK5 pathway. However, it has been shown that tau hyperphosphorylation induces synaptic dysfunction. Thus, the hyperphosphorylated tau induced by Amphiphysin I (1-278) may also contribute to synaptic dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Tau-P301S is associated with FTD, but not AD, although the Tau-P301S mouse model (PS19) is useful for tauopathy studies. The authors should discuss this clearly in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. As suggested by the reviewer, we discussed this in the Discussion section (Page 17, Lines 360-365). Here we used the Tau P301S mice model to explore the role of Amphiphysin I fragments on tau phosphorylation and synaptic dysfunction. The Tau P301S mice overexpress a P301S mutant human tau that is indicated in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Thus, the Tau P301S mice are associated with FTD. Since the mice develop tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction and behavioral impairments (Yoshiyama et al., 2007, Neuron 53(3): 337-351), it is widely used for the investigation of tauopathies.

The images were analyzed by Image J, plus the IHC Profiler plugin. The program counts the pixels and evaluates the percentage contribution of high positive, positive, low positive, and negative.

In the legends for Figure 4 and 5, n's are listed as &quot;n = 4&quot; or n = 5&quot;.

The authors have toned down a number of their statements to accurately reflect the data. However, the title for the legend for Figure 7 still needs to be revised. It reads &quot;Amph1 N278A mutation ameliorates synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Tau P301S mice. However, since no data from wildtype mice is included in this figure, it is not clear that the P301S mice exhibited synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. It would be more accurate to state something like &quot;Expression of Amph1 N278A enhances synaptic and cognitive function in Tau P301S mice.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments.

A few typos still remain: Figure 6F X-axis label should read &quot;Trials&quot;, not &quot;Trails&quot;; in Line 167, &quot;loss&quot; should be &quot;lose&quot;.

Yet, the accompanying graphs indicate that the expression levels between the groups in question in 4D are not different, whereas those in 2D and 2F are markedly and significantly different. There is an incongruency that needs to be resolved. This brings up important questions of how representative the images are, whether similar sized and similarly magnified images were quantified, and how robust your system of image selection and quantification is. Please either perform the quantification at the same magnifications, or provide images in Figure 4D that are more representative of the quantification results.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the constructive comment from the reviewer.
