As a major type of glia in brain parenchyma, astrocytes are the dominant cell type expressing aquaporin water channel. How astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis in basal physiology remains to be understood. We report that astrocyte aquaporin 4 (AQP4) mediates a tonic water efflux in basal conditions. Acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation as optically resolved by fluorescence-translated imaging in acute brain slices, and in vivo by fiber photometry in mobile mice. We then show that aquaporin-mediated constant water efflux maintains astrocyte volume and osmotic equilibrium, astrocyte and neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and extracellular space remodeling during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), we observed that in vivo inhibition of AQP4 water efflux heterogeneously disturbs brain water homeostasis in a region-dependent manner. Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin, though bidirectional in nature, mediates a tonic water outflow to sustain cellular and environmental equilibrium in brain parenchyma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AQP4</kwd><kwd>swelling</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE37-0010-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cauli</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE14-0025-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dongdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory) in Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K19464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsurugizawa</surname><given-names>Tomokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Summer program 2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Cuong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019125</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>i-Bio</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cauli</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019125</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emergence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dongdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00135008 / WB-2022-4423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dongdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>France Alzheimer et maladies apparentées</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Cuong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021790</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche sur Alzheimer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Gac</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The water channel AQP4 contributes to a tonic water outflow from brain astrocytes, thereby modulating their volume dynamics and the ambient water homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Every aspect of brain function relies on the delicately maintained water environment. It supports brain structural stability and molecular diffusion, laying the ground for information processing, metabolite shuttling, and adaptation to living environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimelberg, 2004</xref>). Water is the fundamental constituent of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infiltrating into the central nervous system (CNS) and the interstitial fluid distributed in brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agnati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinker et al., 2014</xref>). Brain fluid transport is suggested to support the diffusion of energetic fuels like glucose and lactate to warrant the metabolic circumstances in the parenchyma, and is also implicated in the clearance of waste molecules from the brain as described in the glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mestre et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasmussen et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the restricted mobility of water molecules diffusion within intra- and extracellular space reflects the brain microstructure. The diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) detects the mobility of water proton for structural and functional neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Le Bihan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsurugizawa et al., 2013</xref>), being adopted for clinical diagnostics in neurological diseases such as ischemia, brain tumor, and edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaddamanugu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le Bihan and Iima, 2015</xref>) and recently leveraged for assessing brain glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannetto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomolka et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Water equilibrium in the brain is maintained by dynamic transport between different cell entities. Aquaporin is a family of transmembrane channels facilitating bidirectional water flow, with aquaporin 4 (AQP4) being the main subtype expressed in the CNS. In the brain, AQP4 is expressed in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Papadopoulos and Verkman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiao et al., 2023</xref>) that are a major type of glial cell in the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barres, 2008</xref>). This feature enables astrocytes to well balance osmotic oscillations imposed by the transmembrane transport of ions, metabolites, and signaling molecules, all mediated by water. AQP4 has been proposed to maintain the circulation of CSF, underlying the clearance efficacy of glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hablitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kress et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mestre et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Dysregulation in astrocyte aquaporin water transport is implicated in pathological scenarios such as cerebral edema and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verkman et al., 2011</xref>). Valuable insights have been obtained on the function of astrocyte aquaporin in specific physiopathological conditions including osmotically evoked volume responses, ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verkman et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, how astrocyte aquaporin contributes to brain water homeostasis in basal physiology has remained elusive. A better understanding will aid to discern astrocytic regulation of cerebral water states, thereby the potential maladaptations in neurological disorders.</p><p>Here, combining in vivo chemical targeting, optical and MRI imaging of water dynamics, we report that AQP4 sustains a tonic water efflux from brain astrocytes. This mechanism was found to be critical in maintaining astrocyte volume and signaling stability, as well as the extracellular space remodeling in mouse cortex during optogenetically induced cortical spreading depression (CSD). Using DW-MRI, we observed that acute inhibition of astrocyte water efflux in vivo heterogeneously alters water diffusion across brain regions. Our finding suggests that aquaporin acts as a water export route in astrocytes in physiological conditions, contributing to maintain cellular and parenchymal water equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Astrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux</title><p>To optically follow astrocyte water transport in situ, we performed real-time imaging of sulforhodamine B (SRB)-labeled astrocytes, whose fluorescence changes reflect real-time volume oscillation due to transmembrane water flux. We chemically labeled mouse brain astrocytes in vivo with the highly water-diffusible and astrocyte-specific red fluorescent dye SRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appaix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pham et al., 2020</xref>). About 1 hr after its intraperitoneal injection, astrocytic SRB labeling was widely distributed in the mouse cortex, as seen in living acute brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>) and validated by colocalization with EGFP-identified astrocytes in slices taken from GFAP-EGFP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Net water transport across the astrocyte membrane alters cytoplasmic SRB concentration and cellular volume, which can thus be followed by changes in fluorescence intensity when imaged in a fixed field of view. To validate this fluorescence intensity-translated (FIT) imaging of astrocyte water transport, we employed wide-field fluorescence microscopy for single-plane time-lapse imaging in acute brain slices in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex. This approach allowed us to collect fluorescence from both the focal plane and along the axial extension, thereby imprinting volumetric fluorescence into the single image plane. Indeed, water influx induced by the application of hypoosmotic solution over different period decreased astrocyte SRB fluorescence, concomitantly reflecting the cell swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>), whereas water export and astrocyte shrinking upon hyperosmotic manipulation increased astrocyte fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Hence, by following the fluorescence change of SRB-labeled astrocytes, the FIT imaging strategy allows to monitor the real-time changes in astrocyte water transport and volume change.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Astrocyte aquaporin mediates a tonic water efflux.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vivo chemical labeling of astrocytes.

However, we observed in cortical slices that while little impact was seen with vehicle (CTR) on the tendency of fluorescence time courses of SRB-labeled astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>left and middle</italic>), acute inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 by TGN-020 caused a gradual decline, suggesting a progressive intracellular water accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>left and middle</italic>). This observation implies that in basal condition, astrocyte aquaporin mediates a constant water efflux; its blocking causes intracellular water accumulation and swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><italic>, right</italic>). To corroborate this observation in vivo, we performed fiber photometry recording in moving mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). An optical fiber was implanted into the mouse S1 cortex to follow fluorescence signals of local astrocyte population post the intraperitoneal injection of SRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, left</italic>). After about 1 hr, when astrocytes were labeled, either saline or TGN-020 was injected intraperitoneally. Although no significant effect was observed with the saline control, TGN-020 induced a decrease in astrocyte SRB fluorescence and a reduction in its oscillation range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><italic>, right</italic>), mirroring an intracellular dilution of fluorescent molecules. Together, these observations suggest that acute inhibition of astrocyte aquaporin leads to intracellular water accumulation, thereby cell swelling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aquaporin inhibition perturbs astrocyte and neuron signaling</title><p>Astrocyte volume equilibrium not only determines brain structural stability, but also associates with dynamic cellular signals.

The spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in perivascular astrocyte end feet, which wrapped the blood vessels displaying as tube-like structures, showed relatively higher sensitivity to the acute application of TGN-020, consistent with the enrichment of AQP4 in the end feet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result confirms that inhibiting astrocyte tonic water efflux would have led to intracellular water accumulation and swelling, thus altering the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

As astrocyte AQP4 supports preferentially water efflux, its inhibition would attenuate hypertonicity-imposed water extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Supporting this, application of TGN-020 slowed down the hypertonicity-induced water efflux and shrinking, reflected by the longer time to peak in the SRB fluorescence time course as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), though the delay in the initial onset was not significantly prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).

This observation cross-validates the role of astrocyte aquaporin in supporting water efflux, whereby its blockade facilitates the initial accumulation of the evoked water influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

As TGN-020 was present prior to hypotonic challenge, it would have slightly swelled astrocytes due to the blockade of tonic water efflux, thereby constraining the range of further swelling induced by subsequent hypotonicity. In addition, while astrocyte AQP4 sustains a water outflow in basal physiology, in conditions when transmembrane water gradient is altered as occurred in hypotonic solutions, the net water flow through AQP4 should be finally dictated by the osmotic gradient due to its bidirectional nature. Therefore, along the imposed hypotonicity, AQP4 started to instruct a water influx; its constant blocking by TGN-020 would have reduced the total amount of water influx thereby the maximal extent of swelling.</p><p>Astrocytes are widely distributed throughout the brain parenchyma, orchestrating water transport and volume homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ochoa-de la Paz and Gulias-Cañizo, 2022</xref>). Water outflow via astrocyte AQP4 may play a role in the structural remodeling of parenchyma at the global level. We then induced general cell swelling and changes in extracellular spaces by triggering CSD, a widespread depolarization implicated in brain physiopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holthoff and Witte, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). To be orthogonal to the pharmacological control of astrocyte aquaporin, the CSD depolarization wave was initiated by optogenetically stimulating ChR2-expressing glutamatergic pyramidal cells in the cortical slices of Emx1-Cre::Ai32ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>), termed optogenetic cortical spreading depression (opto-CSD). As cell swelling increases the transmittance of infrared light, we imaged opto-CSD by the intrinsic optical signal (IOS) derived from infrared illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holthoff and Witte, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacVicar and Hochman, 1991</xref>), which was spectrally distinct from ChR2 photoactivation (detailed in Materials and methods). The IOS displayed transient increase across cortical layers during the opto-CSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), exhibiting propagating kinetics characteristic of spreading depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holthoff and Witte, 1996</xref>). The biphasic starting of IOS coincided with a sharp response in the extracellular potential indicating the CSD initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). IOS signal contains a first peak reflecting the rapid CSD response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, b</xref>) followed by a prolonged phase of general cellular swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, c</xref>). By combining fluorescence imaging of SRB-labeled astrocytes, whose spectrum is separated from the IOS infrared signal, we observed that astrocytes swelling (i.e. decrease in SRB fluorescence) paralleled CSD swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with our observation on astrocyte volume response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), when pre-incubating slices with TGN-020 to block AQP4 water outflow, the initiation of both the CSD and general swelling was accelerated while their maximum amplitude reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, TGN-020 also increased the speed and the duration of the swelling while prolonging the recovery time from the swelling, confirming acute inhibition of AQP4 water efflux facilitates astrocyte swelling while restrains shrinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Blocking action potentials with tetrodotoxin only reduced the amplitude of the initial CSD response while the effect on general swelling is insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). We further followed the swelling of individual SRB-labeled astrocytes during opto-CSD. In consistence with the result obtained from hypotonic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), the presence of TGN-020 reduced the peak amplitude of astrocyte swelling (i.e. the maximal SRB fluorescence decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As a post hoc adaptation to the transiently induced opto-CSD, astrocyte swelling was followed by a shrinking to recover cellular volume to the homeostatic level, which was recorded as a rebound in SRB fluorescence intensity. We noted that TGN-020 presence significantly restrained the recovery of SRB fluorescence back to the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>), showing that AQP4 inhibition hindered astrocyte water efflux, therefore the shrinking.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>AQP4-mediated tonic water outflow regulates global swelling in cortical parenchyma.</title><p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD)-associated general swelling was induced by photostimulating ChR2-expressing pyramidal cells in acute cortical slices, and recorded by imaging intrinsic optical signal (IOS) with infrared illumination.

For instance, they express Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporters to dynamically regulate intra- and extracellular ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacAulay, 2021</xref>). Standing as a major glial cell type controlling the neuropil environment, astrocytes take up synaptically released K<sup>+</sup> through inwardly rectified K<sup>+</sup> channels and neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate, GABA) via high-affinity transporters to safeguard synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallérac et al., 2018</xref>). The cotransport of water into the cells with ions or metabolites would lead to water buildup in astrocytes. Moreover, astrocytes juxtapose the cerebral vasculature, being a front relay station for brain metabolism. They express glucose transporters and lactate-permeable monocarboxylate transporters facilitating energy substrate uptake and transfer between blood vessels and neuron-glia networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cauli et al., 2023</xref>). As water is constantly produced during metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonvento and Bolaños, 2021</xref>), astrocyte metabolism would also contribute to the constitutive water accumulation in the cytoplasm. An efficient efflux pathway appears necessary to counterbalance the constitutive water buildup, thereby maintaining astrocyte and brain homeostasis. Our data suggest that astrocyte AQP4 may fulfill such a role by mediating a tonic water outflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), providing functional evidence to the previous suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amiry-Moghaddam et al., 2003</xref>). It has been observed that KO of AQP4 leads to water overaccumulation in the brain, likely due to the reduction in water exit from the pial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haj-Yasein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vindedal et al., 2016</xref>). Our result also echoes that in the principal cells of the kidney collecting duct, AQP4 is suggested to mainly mediate water exit to balance the AQP2-sustained water entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noda et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, we observed that inhibiting astrocyte basal water efflux alters Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in both astrocytes and neurons, reminiscent of the early finding that inhibition of AQP4 by TGN-020 enhances cerebral blood flow in mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Igarashi et al., 2013</xref>), which might be due to the enhanced neuron-astrocyte activity tone. As a pharmacological compound, TGN-020 exerts a partial blocking effect on AQP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huber et al., 2009</xref>), implying that the actual functional impact of AQP4 per se might be stronger than what we currently observed. Alternatively, the phenylbenzamide AER-270 and its water-soluble prodrug AER-271 have been reported as AQP4 blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2019</xref>) and impairs brain water diffusion and glymphatic fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannetto et al., 2024</xref>). AER270(271) has also been noted to be the inhibitor for κΒ nuclear factor whose inhibition could reduce CNS water content and influence brain fluid dynamics (e.g. the ADC of DW-MRI) in an AQP4-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannetto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salman et al., 2022</xref>). The inhibition efficiency of AER-270 seems also lower than that of TGN-020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannetto et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salman et al., 2022</xref>). Developing pharmacological compounds that can more specifically and efficiently target AQP4 will facilitate the functional and pre-clinical investigations.</p><p>This study also provides mechanistic hints to understand AQP4-relevant pathologies in specific contexts. For instance, astrocyte water accumulation and swelling are implicated in the development of brain edema. Different types of edema have been delineated depending on the pathological contexts, including cytotoxic, vasogenic, and hydrocephalic subtypes. The presence of AQP4 has been found to ameliorate vasogenic (vascular leak) and hydrocephalic edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tait et al., 2010</xref>), where the excessive water has been suggested to exit the brain via AQP4-dependent route. This goes with our observation that astrocyte AQP4 contributes to basal water extrusion. Hence, aquaporin facilitators may help to control vasogenic and hydrocephalic edema. Differently, inhibiting AQP4 has been observed to ameliorate cytotoxic edema encountered during cerebral ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verkman et al., 2011</xref>). Beneficial effects of TGN-020 on edema have been reported in spinal cord injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2019</xref>), in ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2022</xref>) and in retinal edema in diabetic animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oosuka et al., 2020</xref>). These observations suggest that the role of AQP4 in pathological conditions is context-dependent. Indeed, while our results suggest astrocyte AQP4 mediates a water outflow in basal states, the direction of water transport in specific contexts will be determined by the actual transmembrane water gradient. As the origin of edema is variable and water is among the many other ions involved in edema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stokum et al., 2016</xref>), astrocyte aquaporin may either be the primary cause for cytosolic water accumulation or secondarily sustain protective water extrusion. In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, an unusual nervous autoimmune disorder often featured with circulating IgG autoantibody against AQP4, the impairment in astrocyte water homeostasis has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucchinetti et al., 2014</xref>). The inhibition of astrocyte AQP4 by autoantibody may initially affect the basal water efflux. Yet chronic pathological evolution could convert astrocytes into reactive states, with either or both the aquaporin expression, intra- and extracellular environments being altered, the role of AQP4 in water transport might be accordingly shifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mireles-Ramírez et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during the immunological maladaptation could also contribute to shape astrocyte functions including aquaporin-mediated water transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucchinetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mireles-Ramírez et al., 2024</xref>). Recent data show that TGN-020 targeting of AQP4 mitigates the inflammation during ischemia-reperfusion injury, by enhancing glymphatic amyloid clearance and inhibiting the ERK 1/2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that in pathological conditions, multiple factors could be recruited by astrocyte aquaporin targeting.</p><p>We observed that acutely blocking aquaporin caused basal water accumulation leading to swelling in astrocytes, and facilitated the initial occurrence of the evoked swelling by hypoosmoticity and during CSD. This recalls early observation by electron microscopy that knocking out the anchoring protein alpha-syntrophin to disperse AQP4 clustering induces an enlargement of astrocyte end feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amiry-Moghaddam et al., 2003</xref>). It likely reflects astrocyte local swelling caused by the disruption of AQP4-mediated water efflux. Our observation also parallels the report that AQP4 KO facilitates astrocytes swelling induced by hypoosmotic solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, genetic inactivation of AQP4 also reveals inhibitory effects on astrocyte swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benfenati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Woo et al., 2018</xref>). Such discrepancy might be due to the variable compensations in brain water content and structure integrity during chronic genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haj-Yasein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacAulay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). Using the calcein quenching assay and AQP4 KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Solenov et al., 2004</xref>), it has been demonstrated in cultured astroctyes that AQP4 is a functional water channel. AQP4 deletion reduced both astrocyte water permeability and the absolute amplitude of swelling over comparable time, and also slowed down cell shrinking, which are overall confirmed by in our results from acute AQP4 blocking. Yet in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Solenov et al., 2004</xref>), the time to swelling plateau was prolonged in AQP4 KO astrocytes, which was observed to be accelerated in the present study. This difference may be due to compensatory mechanisms in chronic AQP4 KO, or reflect the different volume responses in cultured astrocytes from brain slices or in vivo contexts as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Risher et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, in the present study, astrocyte volume and water transport dynamics have been inferred from the real-time fluorescence change of SRB labeling. Rapid three-dimensional imaging of astrocyte volume dynamics in situ will provide further quantitative information on the role of AQP4 in volume regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacAulay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacAulay et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, though our data suggest that under basal condition astrocyte AQP4 sustains a tonic water outflow, in conditions when massive water influx persists as exemplified by the application of hypoosmotic solutions, the direction of water transport of AQP4 would follow the imposed water gradient. Regulatory volume decrease has been observed in cultured astrocyte volume responses behaving as a protective mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mola et al., 2016</xref>). In current condition in acute brain slices, when we applied hypotonic solution to induce astrocyte swelling, our protocol did not reveal rapid regulatory volume decrease. During opto-CSD, we observed astrocyte volume decrease following the transient swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), where both the peak amplitude and the degree of recovery were reduced by inhibiting AQP4 with TGN-020. These observations suggest astrocyte regulatory volume decrease is likely to be condition-dependent, while also recalling that the regulatory volume decrease is barely detectable in brain slices or in vivo during hypoosmotic challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Risher et al., 2009</xref>). Given the implication of CSD in brain migraine aura, ischemia, and seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2019</xref>), the current observation suggests a functional involvement of astrocyte AQP4 in the physiopathological adaptations.</p><p>Astrocyte aquaporin modulates brain water transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacAulay, 2021</xref>), though its role in the glymphatic system is under deliberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mestre et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasmussen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith and Verkman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggest that astrocyte aquaporin-mediated outflow helps to maintain local water environment in the brain parenchyma, facilitating the circulation of the interstitial fluid and CSF. Moreover, besides affecting water transport, targeting AQP4 also impacts astrocyte volume, therefore the size of extracellular space. These two factors would need to be considered when evaluating AQP4 involvement in brain fluid transport.</p><p>We show by DW-MRI that impairing astrocyte water transport induces the changes of ADC across the brain. When blocking AQP4 with TGN-020, therefore its basal water outflow, we observed spatially heterogeneous elevations in brain water diffusion rate. It has been reported that relative to wild-type mice, AQP4 KO mice show increased water diffusion along with the enlarged interstitial space, brain volume yet reduced CSF spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomolka et al., 2023</xref>). Notably in AQP4 KO mice, the influx of gadolinium CSF tracer was reduced as followed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomolka et al., 2023</xref>). As corroboration, the AQP4 blocker AER-271 also reduces glymphatic water influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannetto et al., 2024</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that AQP4 plays a critical role not only in modulating water diffusion in brain parenchyma but also in the CSF transport. Our current data are derived from 5 min apart acquisitions, providing information over the early phase of AQP4 inhibition, therefore extending our early report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debacker et al., 2020</xref>). The regional heterogeneity likely reflects the various levels of AQP4 expression; its relative enrichment in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomolka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubbard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mestre et al., 2018a</xref>) corresponds to the pronounced effect observed here by DW-MRI. An overall increase in brain water diffusion rate was observed when blocking AQP4 water efflux. This treatment causes water accumulation inside astrocytes and their swelling, which reduces the extracellular space but increases the intracellular space. Water diffusion would be enhanced inside astrocytes and decreased in extracellular space, respectively. DW-MRI maps global water diffusion of both intra- and extracellular space. Likely, a net increase in brain water diffusion may reflect its intracellular increase exceeding the extracellular decrease. In addition, convective brain fluid flow has been suggested to be present in the perivascular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith and Verkman, 2019</xref>), a scenario extended by the glymphatic system to the extracellular space of the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mestre et al., 2018b</xref>). In this sense, transiently squeezing extracellular space might increase the rate of the water flow. Additionally, a transient upregulation of other water-permeable pathways would increase the water diffusion in compensating the AQP4 blocking. It has been shown that TGN-020 increases regional cerebral blood flow in wild-type mice but not in AQP4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Igarashi et al., 2013</xref>). The current MRI data yet lack sufficient spatial resolution to delineate the spatial compartmentalization of brain fluid flow. We here used anisotropic resolution and minimum b-values to earn the temporal resolution. The phantom study supports the quality of DW-MRI data to calculate the time course of ADC. To further use isotropic resolution and more b-values will help to validate our current results.</p><p>This study sheds light on the mechanisms by which astrocyte aquaporin contributes to the water environment in brain parenchyma, and will help to understand the processes underlying brain homeostasis and adaptation to life conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and acute brain slice preparation</title><p>All procedures using animals were carried out in strict accordance with French regulations (Rural Code R214/87 to R214/130) and conformed to the ethical recommendations of the European Economic Community (Directive 86/609/EEC) and the National Charter French on ethics in animal experimentation.

We used water immersion imaging objectives (ZEISS): ×10 NA0.3 used to have a global view, ×20 NA0.5 used to perform light sheet imaging, and ×63 NA1.0 to image individual astrocytes under epifluorescence configuration so as to collect their whole-cell SRB fluorescence to follow astrocyte water transport and volume dynamics.

This optical module was orthogonal to the upright imaging pathway and coupled via a wavelength combiner (Thorlabs) to two continuous wave lasers 473 nm and 561 nm (CNI, China), for the excitation of GCaMP6 and SRB, respectively. The imaging chamber (20×30×46 mm<sup>3</sup> width, height, and length) was custom-designed using 3D modeling software (Trimble SketchUP), produced by a Mojo 3D printer (Stratasys) with the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene material, where the horizontal slice-supporting surface in the chamber was tilted by 8° along the laser entry direction. In this way, the brain slice could be laid on the slightly tilted surface while being stabilized with a conventional Harp slice anchor grid (Warner Instruments), whereby the laterally generated laser light sheet could reach local regions throughout the brain slices.

Signals were collected at a rate of 1 Hz for SRB and visualized using the open-source software Bonsai 2.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bonsai-rx.org">http://bonsai-rx.org</ext-link>) and analyzed in Igor software (WaveMetrics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo DW-MRI</title><p>To test the effect of astrocyte AQP4 acute inhibition on brain water homeostasis, we used DW-MRI to calculate the ADC of tissue water molecules in the brain. MRI experiment was performed with medetomidine anesthesia (0.6 mg/kg/hr, i.v.). Two groups of mice (seven for each) were injected with either the water-soluble TGN-020 sodium salt (Key Organics, LR-0041) or saline. For the crossover test, the order of injection of TGN-020 or saline was randomly determined. The experiment was performed 2 days, which separated 1 month for the recover. The respiration was monitored, and the body temperature was maintained at 36°C throughout the measurement.</p><p>The MRI experiments were conducted on a 7.0 T MRI system equipped with actively shielded gradients at a maximum strength of 700 mT/m (Biospec; 70/16 Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) and with a cryogenic quadrature radio frequency surface probe (Cryoprobe). We chose the cryoprobe because the signal-to-noise ratio appeared better than volume coil. We also confirmed to obtain good image quality in whole brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). After 10 min from the start of the scanning, either TGN-020 (200 mg/kg body weight) or saline was injected. Then, scanning was continued for 60 min. The respiration rate was monitored and was confirmed within the range of 80–150/min throughout the experiment. Mice were injected with 200 mg/kg of TGN-020. We used a standard diffusion-weighted spin echo EPI sequence, with the following parameters: spatial resolution = 175×175×500 μm<sup>3</sup>/voxel, three b-values (b=0, 250 and 1800 s/mm<sup>2</sup>), six directions, one segment, echo time = 37.1 ms/repetition time = 5769 ms, bandwidth = 300 kHz, δ=3 ms, Δ=24 ms, scan time = 5 min. The DWI scan was continued for 70 min (total 14 scans). We used minimum direction of motion probing gradient and anisotropic resolution to image the time course of ADC changes following the injection of the TGN-020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debacker et al., 2020</xref>). Previous study has used long diffusion time (&gt;20 ms) and long echo time (40 ms) to follow the mean diffusivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggarwal et al., 2020</xref>), supporting the suitability of our protocol to investigate the ADC. The stability of DW-MRI was evaluated through 70 min scans using three different phantoms: water, n-undecane (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and n-dodecane (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).</p><p>The motion correction of DWI data was performed using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM12, Welcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, UK). The template image and ROIs were then co-registered to the DWI data using SPM12. The ROIs of the cortex, the hippocampus, and the striatum were depicted with reference to Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA12">https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA12</ext-link>). The ADC at each time point was calculated from DWI data with all b-values (b=0, 250, and 1800 s/mm²) using DSI Studio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/">https://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/</ext-link>). The percentage change in ADC was then calculated according to the equation: ΔADC<sub>i</sub> = (ADC<sub>i</sub>/ADC<sub>2</sub> – 1)×100 (%). The ADC<sub>i</sub> is the ADC at the ith time point. We define the averaged ADC at first and second time point as the baseline because saline injection was performed after the second DWI scan. The averaged ADC changes within ROIs were calculated using a homemade program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Experimental data are expressed as mean ± standard error unless otherwise mentioned. The t-test was performed for two-group comparisons and significant difference was determined by p-values less than 0.05. Mann-Whitney U test was used when the data were non-parametric deviating from normal distributions. Bonferroni-Holm correction was used for multiple comparisons. Statistical tests were carried out with MATLAB (The MathWorks) and Statistica 6 (StatSoft).

Still a lingering question in the field is how AQP4 facilitates fluid circulation. This study represents an important step in our understanding of AQP4's function, as basal efflux of water via AQP4 might promote clearance of interstitial fluid to allow influx of cerebrospinal fluid into the brain.

The authors measure changes in astrocytic sulforhodamine B fluorescence as the proxy for cell volume dynamics. Using this approach, they have performed a technically elegant series of ex vivo and in vivo experiments exploring changes in astrocytic volume &quot;signal&quot; in response to the AQP4 inhibitor TGN-020 and/or neuronal stimulation. The key findings are that TGN-020 produces an apparent swelling of astrocytes and modifies astrocytic cell volume dynamics after spreading depolarizations. This study is perceived as potentially highly significant. However, several technical caveats could be considered better and perhaps addressed through additional experiments.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This is a technically sound study, in which the Authors employed a number of complementary ex vivo and in vivo techniques. The presented results are of interest to the field and potentially highly significant.</p><p>(2) The innovative use of sulforhodamine B for in situ measurements of astrocyte cell volume dynamics is thoroughly validated in brain slices by quantifying changes in sulforhodamine fluorescence in response to hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic media.</p><p>(3) The combination of cell volume measurements with registering functional outcomes in both astrocytes and neurons (cell-specific GCaMP6 signaling) is appropriate and adds to the significance of the work.</p><p>(4) The use of ChR2 optogenetics for producing spreading depolarization allows to avoid many complications of chemical manipulations and much appreciated.</p><p>Remaining limitations:</p><p>(1) In the opinion of this reviewer, the effects of TGN-020 are not entirely consistent with the current knowledge on water permeability in astrocytes and the relative contribution of AQP4 to this process.</p><p>Specifically, genetic deletion of AQP4 reduces plasmalemmal water permeability in astrocytes by ~two-three-fold (when measured at 37oC, E. Solenov et al., AJP-Cell, 2004). This difference is significant but thought to have limited impact on steady-state water distribution. To the best of this reviewer's knowledge, cultured AQP4-null astrocytes do not show changes in degree of hypoosmotic swelling or hyperosmotic shrinkage. Thus, the findings of Solenov et al. are not (entirely) congruent with the conclusions of the current manuscript.</p><p>Also, as noted by the Authors, the AQP4 knockout does not modify astrocytes swelling induced by hypoosmotic solution in brain slices (T.R. Murphy et al., Front Neurosci., 2017), further suggesting that AQP4 is not a significant rate-limiting factor for water movement across astrocyte membranes.</p><p>The Authors do discuss the above-mentioned discrepancies and explain them by the context-dependent changes in water fluxes. Nevertheless, with these caveats in mind, it would be highly desirable to utilize an independent method measuring astrocytic volume and extracellular volume fraction.</p><p>(2) As noted by this reviewer and now discussed by the Authors, changes in ADC signal (presented in in Fig. 5) may be confounded by the previously reported TGN-020-induced hyphemia (e.g., H. Igarashi et al., NeuroReport, 2013) and/or changes water fluxes across pia matter which is highly enriched in AQP4. If this is the case, the proposed brain water accumulation may be explained by factors other than astrocytic water homeostasis. This caveat certainly deserves further experimental exploration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95873.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Cuong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Komaki</surname><given-names>Yuji</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Deàs-Just</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Le Gac</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mouffle</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chaperon</surname><given-names>Agnès</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vialou</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tsurugizawa</surname><given-names>Tomokazu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cauli</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dongdong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>Many thanks to the editors for the reviewing of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We are very grateful to the Reviewers for their time and for the appreciation of the revision.</p><p>We thank the Reviewer 3 for acknowledging the use of sulforhodamine B (SRB) fluorescence as a real-time readout of astrocyte volume dynamics.

As shown now in Fig.S2, acute application of TGN020 induced Ca2+ oscillations in astrocyte end-feet regions where the GCaMP6 labeling lines the profile of the blood vessel.

Throughout various experiments including epifluorescence and light sheet microscopy in mouse brain slices, and fiber photometry or diffusion-weighted MRI in vivo, the researchers observe that acute inhibition of AQP4 leads to intracellular water accumulation and swelling in astrocytes. This swelling alters astrocyte calcium signaling and affects neighboring neuron populations. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that AQP4 regulates astrocyte volume, influencing mainly the dynamics of water efflux in response to osmotic challenges or associated with cortical spreading depolarization. The findings suggest that AQP4-mediated water efflux plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis, and indicates the main role of AQP4 in this mechanism. However authors highlight that the report sheds light on the mechanisms by which astrocyte aquaporin contributes to the water environment in the brain parenchyma, the mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear and not investigated.

The research is valuable, confirms previous findings, and provides novel insights into the effect of acute blockage of the AQP4 channel using TGN-020.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite the employed interdisciplinary approach, the quality of the manuscript provides doubts regarding the significance of the findings and hinders the novelty claimed by the authors. The paper lacks a comprehensive exploration or mention of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the observed effects of astrocytic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) channel inhibition on brain water transport and brain signaling dynamics. The scientific background is not very well prepared in the introduction and discussion sections. The important or latest reports from the field are missing or incompletely cited and missconcluded. There are several citations to original works missing, which would clarify certain conclusions. This especially refers to the basis of the glymphatic system concept and recently published reports of similar content. The usage of TGN-020, instead of i.e. available AER-270(271) AQP4 blocker, is not explained. While employing various experimental techniques adds depth to the findings, some reasoning behind the employed techniques - especially regarding MRI - is not clear or seemingly inaccurate. Most of the time the number of subjects examined is lacking or mentioned only roughly within the figure captions, and there are lacking or wrongly applied statistical tests, that limit assessment and reproducibility of the results. In some cases, it seems that two different statistical tests were used for the same or linked type of data, so the results are contradictory even though appear as not likely - based on the figures. Addressing these limitations could strengthen the paper's impact and utility within the field of neuroscience, however, it also seems that supplementary experiments are required to improve the report.</p></disp-quote><p>The current data hint at a tonic water efflux from astrocyte AQP4 in physiological condition, which helps to understand brain water homeostasis and the functional implication for the glymphatic system.

We agree that a comprehensive exploration will further advance our understanding.</p><p>The introduction and discussion are now strengthened by incorporating the important advances in glymphatic system while highlighting the relevant studies.</p><p>The use of TGN-020 was based on its validation by wide range of ex vivo and in vivo studies including the use of heterologous expression system and the AQP4 KO mice. The validation of AER-270(271, the water soluble prodrug) using AQP4 KO mice is reported recently (Giannetto et al., 2024). AER-271 was noted to impact brain water ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI) in AQP4 KO mice ~75 min after the drug application (Giannetto et al., 2024). This likely reflects that AER270(271) is also an inhibitor for κΒ nuclear factor (NF-κΒ) whose inhibition could reduce CNS water content independent of AQP4 targeting (Salman et al., 2022). In addition, the inhibition efficiency of AER-270(271) seems lower than TGN-020 (Farr et al., 2019; Giannetto et al., 2024; Huber et al., 2009; Salman et al., 2022). We have now supplemented this information in the manuscript (page 7, line 1-6 and page15, line 7-17).</p><p>The description on the DW-MRI is now updated (page 4, line 10-14).</p><p>We also performed new experiments and data analysis as described in a point-to-point manner below in the section ‘<italic>Recommendations For The Authors</italic>’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors propose that astrocytic water channel AQP4 represents the dominant pathway for tonic water efflux without which astrocytes undergo cell swelling.

This is a highly appropriate and much-appreciated approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the effort in evaluating our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The main weakness of this study is that all major conclusions are based on the use of one pharmacological compound. In the opinion of this reviewer, the effects of TGN-020 are not consistent with the current knowledge on water permeability in astrocytes and the relative contribution of AQP4 to this process.</p><p>Specifically: Genetic deletion of AQP4 in astrocytes reduces plasmalemmal water permeability by ~two-three-fold (when measured a 37oC, Solenov et al., AJP-Cell, 2004). This is a significant difference, but it is thought to have limited/no impact on water distribution. Astrocytic volume and the degree of anisosmotic swelling/shrinkage are unchanged because the water permeability of the AQP4null astrocytes remains high. This has been discussed at length in many publications (e.g., MacAulay et al., Neuroscience, 2004; MacAulay, Nat Rev Neurosci, 2021) and is acknowledged by Solenov and Verkman (2004).</p><p>Keeping this limitation in mind, it is important to validate astrocytic cell volume changes using an independent method of cell volume reconstruction (diameter of sulforhodamine-labeled cell bodies? 3D reconstruction of EGFP-tagged cells? Else?)</p></disp-quote><p>Solenov and coll. used the calcein quenching assay and KO mice demonstrating AQP4 as a functional water channel in cultured astrocytes (Solenov et al., 2004). AQP4 deletion reduced both astrocyte water permeability and the absolute amplitude of swelling over comparable time, and also slowed down cell shrinking, which overall parallels our results from acute AQP4 blocking. Yet in Solenovr’s study, the time to swelling plateau was prolonged in AQP4 KO astrocytes, differing from our data from the pharmacological acute blocking. This discrepancy may be due to compensatory mechanisms in chronic AQP4 KO, or reflect the different volume responses in cultured astrocytes from brain slices or in vivo results as suggested previously (Risher et al., 2009).</p><p>Soma diameter might be an indicator of cell volume change, yet it is challenging with our current fluorescence imaging method that is diffraction-limited and insufficient to clearly resolve the border of the soma in situ. In addition, the lateral diameter of cell bodies may not faithfully reflect the volume changes that can occur in all three dimensions. Rapid 3D imaging of astrocyte volume dynamics with sufficient high Z-axis resolution appears difficult with our present tools.</p><p>We have now accordingly updated the discussion with relevant literatures being cited (page 17 line 14 – page 18, line 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) TGN-020 produces many effects on the brain, with some but not all of the observed phenomena sensitive to the genetic deletion of AQP4. In the context of this work, it is important to note that TGN020 does not completely inhibit AQP4 (70% maximal inhibition in the original oocyte study by Huber et al., Bioorg Med Chem, 2009). Thus, besides not knowing TGN-020 levels inside the brain, even</p><p>&quot;maximal&quot; AQP4 inhibition would not be expected to dramatically affect water permeability in astrocytes.</p><p>This caveat may be addressed through experiments using local delivery of structurally unrelated AQP4 blockers, or, preferably, AQP4 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>It is an important point that TGN-020 partially blocks AQP4, implying the actual functional impact of AQP4 per se might be stronger than what we observed. TGN provides a means to acutely probe AQP4 function in situ, still we agree, its limitation needs be acknowledged. We mention this now on page 15, line 7-9 and 14-17.</p><p>We agree that local delivery of an alternative blocker will provide additional information. Meanwhile, local delivery requires the stereotaxic implantation of cannula, which would cause inflammations to surrounding astrocytes (and neurons). The recently introduced AQP4 blocker AER-270(271) has received attention that it influences brain water dynamics (ADC in DW-MRI) in AQP4 KO mice (Giannetto et al., 2024), recalling that AER-270(271) is also an inhibitor for κΒ nuclear factor (NF-κΒ). This pathway can potentially perturb CNS water content and influence brain fluid circulation, in an AQP4independent manner (Salman et al., 2022). The inhibition efficiency on mouse AQP4 of AER-270 (~20%, Farr et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2022) appears lower than TGN-020 (~70%, Huber et al., 2009).</p><p>We chose to use the pharmacological compound to achieve acute blocking of AQP4 thereby avoiding the chronic genetics-caused alterations in brain structural, functional and water homeostasis. Multiple lines of evidence including the recent study (Gomolka et al., 2023), have shown that AQP4 KO mice alters brain water content, extracellular space and cellular structures, which raises concerns to use the transgenic mouse to pinpoint the physiological functions of the AQP4 water channel.</p><p>We have now mentioned the concerns on AQP4 pharmacology by supplementing additional literatures in the field (page 15, line 8-18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This reviewer thinks that the ADC signal changes in Figure 5 may be unrelated to cellular swelling. Instead, they may be a result of the previously reported TGN-020-induced hyphemia (e.g., H. Igarashi et al., NeuroReport, 2013) and/or changes in water fluxes across pia matter which is highly enriched in AQP4. To amplify this concern, AQP4 KO brains have increased water mobility due to enlarged interstitial spaces, rather than swollen astrocytes (RS Gomolka, eLife, 2023). Overall, the caveats of interpreting DW-MRI signal deserve strong consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous observation show that TGN-020 increases regional cerebral blood flow in wild-type mice but not in AQP4 KO mice (Igarashi et al., 2013). Our current data provide a possible mechanism explanation that TGN-020 blocking of astrocyte AQP4 causes calcium rises that may lead to vasodilation as suggested previously (Cauli and Hamel, 2018). We now add updates to the discussion on page 15, line 3-7.</p><p>We are in line with the reviewer regarding the structural deviations observed with the AQP4 KO mice</p><p>(Gomolka et al., 2023), now mentioned on page 19, line 3-5. Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have also updated the interpretation of the DW-MRI signal and point that in addition to being related to the astrocyte swelling, the ADC signal changes may also be caused by indirect mechanisms, such as the transient upregulation of other water-permeable pathways in compensating AQP4 blocking.

Meanwhile, as a relatively big protein (MW, 26.9 kDa), the diffusion rate of EGFP is expected to be much less than SRB, a small chemical dye (MW, 558.7 Da). Also, the IP injection of SRB enables geneticsless labeling of brain astrocytes, so to avoid the influence of protein overexpression on astrocyte volume and water transport responses. We have now stated this point in the manuscript (page 13, line 21 – page 14, line 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 panel B should have clear labels on the figure and a description in the legend to delineate which part of the panel refers to hyper- or hypo-osmotic treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the figure and the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For Figure 2, what is the rationale for analyzing the calcium signaling data between the cell types differently?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed calcium micro-domains for astrocytes as their spontaneous signals occur mainly in discrete micro-domains (Shigetomi et al., 2013). While for neurons, we performed global analysis by calculating the mean fluorescence of imaging field of view, because calcium signal changes were only observed at global level rather than in micro-domains. This information is now included (page 24, line1820).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For Figure 3, the authors mention that TGN-020 likely caused swelling prior to the hypotonic solution administration. Do they have any measurements from these experiments prior to the TGN-020 application to use as a &quot;true baseline&quot; volume?</p></disp-quote><p>The current method detects the relative changes in astrocyte volume (i.e., transmembrane water transport), which nevertheless is blind to the absolute volume value. We have no readout on baseline volumes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For Figures 3 and 4, did the authors see any evidence for regulatory volume decrease? And is this impaired by TGN-020? It is a well-characterized phenomenon that astrocytes will open mechanosensitive channels to extrude ions during hypo-osmotic induced swelling. This process is dependent on AQP4 and calcium signaling [5]</p></disp-quote><p>Mola and coll. provided important results demonstrating the role of AQP4 in astrocyte volume regulation (Mola et al., 2016). In the present study in acute brain slices, when we applied hypotonic solution to induce astrocyte swelling, our protocol did not reveal rapid regulatory volume decrease (e.g., Fig. 3D). When we followed the volume changes of SRB-labeled astrocytes during optogenetically induced CSD, we observed the phase of volume decrease following the transient swelling (Fig. 4F), where the peak amplitude and the degree of recovery were both reduced by inhibiting AQP4 with TGN020. These data imply that regulatory astrocyte volume decrease may occur in specific conditions, which intriguingly has been suggested to be absent in brain slices and in vivo (e.g., Risher et al., 2009). We have not specifically investigated this phenomenon, and now briefly discuss this point on page18 line 6-14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 5 box plots do not show all data points, could the authors modify to make these plots show all the animals, or edit the legend to clarify what is plotted?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the plot and the legend.

However it seems right, the experiment does not comment on the cell swelling that may occur just due to or as a superposition of tissue deterioration and the effect of TGN-020. The AQP4 channel is blocked, and the influx of water into astrocytes should be also blocked. Thus, can swelling be also a part of another mechanism, as it was also observed in the control group? I suggest this should be addressed thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this experiment in acute brain slices to well control the pharmacological environment and gain spatial-temporal information. Post slicing, the brain slices recovered &gt; 1hr prior to recording, so that the slices were in a stable state before TGN-020 application as evidenced by the stable baseline. The constant decrease in the control trace is due to photobleaching which did not change its curve tendency in response to vehicle. TGN-020, in contrast, caused a down-ward change suggesting intracellular water accumulation and swelling.</p><p>The experiment was performed at basal condition without active water influx; a decrease in SRB fluorescence hints astrocyteintracellular water buildup. This result shows that in basal condition, astrocyte aquaporin mediates a constant (i.e., tonic) water efflux; its blocking causes intracellular water accumulation and swelling.</p><p>We have accordingly updated the description of this part (page 7, line 15-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- From the Figure 1 legend: Only 4 mice were subjected to the experiment, and only 1 mouse as a control.

As for the panel C, the number of mice is now indicated. Also, the downward change in the SRB fluorescence was now respectively calculated for the phases prior and post to TGN (and vehicle) application, and this panel is accordingly updated. TGN-020 induced a declining in astrocyte SRB fluorescence, which is validated by t-test performed in MATLAB. To clarify, we now add cross-link lines to indicate statistical significance between the corresponding groups (Fig 1C, middle). As for panel D, we calculated the SRB fluorescence change (decrease) relative to the photobleaching tendency illustrated by the dotted line. The significance was also validated by t-test performed in MATLAB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1: Please correct the figure - pictures in panel A are low quality and do not support the specificity of SRB for astrocytes. Panels B-D are easier to understand if plotted as normal X/Y charts with associated statistical findings. Some drawings are cut or not aligned.</p></disp-quote><p>In GFAP-EGFP transgenic, astrocytes are labeled by EGFP. SRB labeling (red fluorescence) shows colocalization with EGFP-positive astrocytes, meanwhile not all EGFP-positive astrocytes are labeled by SRB.

It is a major concern, especially when considering norepinephrine as a master driver of neuronal and vascular activity through the brain, and strong activation of the hypothalamic-adrenal axis in response to acute stress. It is well known, that the response of monoamines is reduced in animals subjected to chronic v.s acute stress, but still larger than that if the stressor is absent.</p><p>Major remark: The animals should, preferably, be imaged at least after 3 days of habituation based on existing knowledge.

This is especially doubtful if such a long echo-time was used alongside lower-thanpossible spatial resolution. Longer echo time would lower the SNR of the depicted signal but also would favor the depiction of signal from slow-moving protons and larger water pools. On the other hand, only 3 b-values were used, which is the minimum for ADC measurements, while a good research protocol could encompass at least 5 to increase the accuracy of ADC estimation and avoid undersampling between 250 and 1800 b-values. What was the reason for choosing this particular set of b-values and not 50, 600, and 2000? Besides, gradient duration time was optimally chosen, however, I have concerns about the decision for such a long gradient separation times.</p><p>If the protocol could have been better optimized, the assessment could have been also performed in respiratory-gated mode, allowing minimization of the effects of one of the glymphatic system driving forces.</p><p>Thus, I suggest commenting on these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the cryoprobe to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in DW-MRI with long echo-time and high b-value. The volume coil has a more homogeneous SNR in the whole brain rather than the cryoprobe, but SNR should be reduced compared with cryoprobe. We confirmed that, even at the ventral part of the brain, the image quality of DW-MRI images was enough to investigate the ADC with cryoprobe (Fig. 5B-C). This is mentioned now in Methods (page 27, line 17-21).</p><p>We performed DW-MRI scanning for 5 min at each time-point using the condition of anisotropic resolution and 3 b-values, to investigate the time-course of ADC change following the injection of TGN020. Because the effect of TGN-020 appears about dozen of minutes post the injection (Igarashi et al., 2011), fast DW-MRI scanning is required. If isotropic DW-MRI with lower echo-time and more direction is used, longer scan time at each time point is required, maybe more than 1h. We agree that three bvalues is minimum to calculate the ADC and more b-values help to increase the accuracy. However, to achieve the temporal resolution so as to better catch the change of water diffusion, we have decided to use the minimum b-values. The previous study also validates the enough accuracy of DW-MRI with three b-values (Ashoor et al., 2019). Furthermore, previous study that used long diffusion time (&gt; 20 ms) and long echo time (40 ms) shows the good mean diffusivity (Aggarwal et al., 2020), supporting that our protocol is enough to investigate the ADC. We have now updated the description (page 28 line 5-9). The reason why we choose the b = 250 and 1800 s/mm² is that 2000 s/mm² seems too high to get the good quality of image. In the previous study, we have optimized that ADC is measurable with b = 0, 250, and 1800 s/mm² (Debacker et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Page 24, line 7: What was the post-processing applied for images acquired over 70 minutes?

We have updated the description on Method part (page 28, line 9-11) and on the Results (page 13, line 6-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 13: were the ROI defined manually or just depicted from previously co-registered Allen Brain atlas?</p></disp-quote><p>The ROIs of the cortex, the hippocampus, and the striatum were depicted with reference to Allen mouse brain atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA12">https://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/mouse/ABA12</ext-link>). This is explained in Methods (page 28, line 14-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 10: why the average from 1st and 2nd ADC was not considered, since it would reduce the influence of noise on the estimation of baseline ADC?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that it was a typo. The baseline was the average between 1st and 2nd ADC. We corrected the description (page 28, line 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>STATISTIC:</p><p>Which type of t-test - paired/unpaired/two samples was used and why? Mann-Whitney U-tets are used as a substitution for parametric t-tests when the data are either non-parametric or assuming normal distribution is not possible. In which case Bonferroni's-Holm correction was used? - I couldn't find any mention of any multiple-group analysis followed by multiple comparisons. Each section of the manuscript should have a description of how the quantitative data were treated and in which aim. I suggest carefully correcting all figures accordingly, and following the remarks given to the Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We used unpaired t-test for data obtained from samples of different conditions. Indeed, MannWhitney U-test is used when the data are non-parametric deviating from normal distributions. Bonferroni-Holm correction was used for multiple comparisons (e.g., Fig. 4D-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I think that the following statement is insufficient: &quot;The authors commit to share data, documentation, and code used in analysis&quot;.
