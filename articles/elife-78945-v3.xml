To define these mechanisms, we developed a species-hybrid model in which human mesenchymal progenitor cells were used to develop white or thermogenic/beige adipose tissue in mice. The hybrid adipose tissue developed distinctive features of human adipose tissue, such as larger adipocyte size, despite its neurovascular architecture being entirely of murine origin. Thermogenic adipose tissue recruited a denser, qualitatively distinct vascular network, differing in genes mapping to circadian rhythm pathways, and denser sympathetic innervation. The enhanced thermogenic neurovascular network was associated with human adipocyte expression of THBS<italic>4</italic>, <italic>TNC</italic>, <italic>NTRK3,</italic> and <italic>SPARCL1</italic>, which enhance neurogenesis, and decreased expression of <italic>MAOA</italic> and <italic>ACHE</italic>, which control neurotransmitter tone. Systemic inhibition of MAOA, which is present in human but absent in mouse adipocytes, induced browning of human but not mouse adipose tissue, revealing the physiological relevance of this pathway. Our results reveal species-specific cell type dependencies controlling the development of thermogenic adipose tissue and point to human adipocyte MAOA as a potential target for metabolic disease therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK089101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corvera</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK123028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corvera</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM135751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solivan-Rivera</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A hybrid mouse/human model using mesenchymal progenitor cells reveals dynamics of human adipose tissue development and mechanisms that may enhance human adipose thermogenic capacity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A positive association between thermogenic ‘beige/brite’ adipose tissue and metabolic health in humans has been repeatedly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enerbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>), and multiple studies have shown that human thermogenic adipocytes transplanted into mice affect whole-body metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Min et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsagkaraki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These studies provide evidence for a cause- effect relationship and a rationale for enhancing the activity and/or abundance of thermogenic adipose tissue as a therapeutic approach to metabolic disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which human thermogenic adipose tissue develops and is maintained are largely unknown.</p><p>In adults, thermogenic adipose tissue develops in response to chronic cold exposure, extensive skin burns, and catecholamine producing tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cypess et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cypess et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sidossis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Lans et al., 2013</xref>). Formation of new thermogenic adipose tissue involves the generation of new adipocytes expressing the characteristic mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) of new vasculature to facilitate oxygen consumption and heat dissipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">François et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sievers et al., 2020</xref>), and of new innervation to mediate sympathetic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Signaling between multiple cell types is likely to be involved in the process of tissue expansion; for example, adipocytes secrete factors that induce vascularization and innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), catecholamines can stimulate angiogenesis, and progenitor cells niched in the newly forming vasculature can differentiate into thermogenic adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). The concurrence of adipogenesis, angiogenesis and innervation make it difficult to determine cell-type-specific mechanisms and temporal interdependencies, and to identify those mechanisms that could be harnessed to enhance thermogenic adipose tissue mass or activity. Understanding mechanisms of human thermogenic adipose tissue expansion is particularly difficult due to limited models available to study human tissue development. Our laboratory has developed methods to obtain large numbers of mesenchymal progenitor cells from human adipose tissue and shown that these can give rise to multiple adipocyte subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, these cells can be implanted into immunocompromised mice, where they develop metabolically integrated adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rojas-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that this cell implantation model, by clearly separating the adipocyte component (human), from vascular and neuronal components (mouse), could help deconvolve mechanisms of development and maintenance of human thermogenic adipose tissue.</p><p>Here, we report that human adipose tissue generated in mice maintains species-specific features, including human adipocyte cell size, thermogenic gene expression, and the capacity to recruit a mature neurovascular network. Thermogenic adipocytes recruit a denser neurovascular network with distinct transcriptomic characteristics, suggesting features of the adipose tissue vasculature that may be important for thermogenic adipose tissue formation and function. Our studies also suggest mechanisms by which thermogenic adipocytes can recruit a distinct neuro-vasculature, as we find they differentially express genes involved in paracrine signaling of neurogenesis, and in modulation of neurotransmitter tone. Notably, <italic>THBS4</italic> and <italic>SPARCL1</italic>, which directly stimulate synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan and Südhof, 2019</xref>), are the most highly differentially expressed genes distinguishing thermogenic from non-thermogenic adipocytes in the hybrid tissue. In addition, we find that MAOA, which catalyzes the oxidative deamination and inactivation of multiple neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tipton, 2018</xref>), is robustly expressed in human adipocytes and in adipocytes within hybrid tissue, but is suppressed during the formation of thermogenic adipose tissue. Functionally, systemic inhibition of MAOA with the irreversible inhibitor clorgyline results in enhanced expression of <italic>UCP1</italic> in adipocytes within the hybrid human adipose tissue, but not in endogenous mouse adipose tissue. These data reveal important species-distinct mechanisms controlling the establishment and maintenance of human adipocyte thermogenic phenotype in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of functional hybrid adipose depots from human cells</title><p>To generate cells for implantation we derived mesenchymal progenitor cells from human subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rojas-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>) as detailed in Materials and methods, and injected cell suspensions subcutaneously into each flank of nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Discernible adipose tissue pads, and circulating human adiponectin, were detected in all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), demonstrating that human adipocytes were able to develop into hybrid tissue and secrete characteristic adipokines for an extended period after implantation. To monitor adipocyte development, we performed immunohistochemistry of the excised tissue with an antibody to Perilipin 1 (PLIN1), which delineates lipid droplets. This analysis revealed a progressive increase in cell size over a period of 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, human adipocytes developed from implanted cells exceeded the size of mouse endogenous subcutaneous white adipocytes as early as week 4 after implantation and continued to enlarge to match the mean size of adipocytes in the human tissue from which progenitor cells were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The change in mean adipocyte size was mostly attributable to a shift from multilocular to unilocular adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that as lipid droplets enlarge during development they also coalesce. Expression of human <italic>PLIN1</italic> was relatively stable from weeks 4 to 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panels), but <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> expression decreased as adipocyte size increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lower panels), mimicking the known inverse correlation between ADIPOQ production and adipocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, there was no detectable expression of mouse <italic>Plin1</italic> or <italic>Adipoq</italic>, in the hybrid tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right top and lower panels), indicating that adipocytes in the developed depots are exclusively of human origin. These results indicate that adipocytes continue to develop in the mouse while retaining fundamental features of human adipose tissue, such as large adipocyte size and adiponectin expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of adipocytes during development of WIM and TIM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of PLIN1 (green) and DAPI (blue) staining of WIM at the indicated weeks after implantation, and of inguinal mouse and subcutaneous human adipose tissue, scale bar = 50 µm.

Mice were implanted with cells that were treated with vehicle (White IMplanted = WIM) or forskolin (Thermogenic IMplanted = TIM), and developed depots analyzed after 8 weeks of implantation. The macroscopic features and weight of TIM and WIM were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), as was the average concentration of circulating human adiponectin in mice harboring TIM compared to WIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, multilocular adipocytes could be detected in wholemount staining of TIM, by either PLIN1 immunostaining of whole mounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, top panels, white arrows) or by H&amp;E staining of tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, lower panels, black arrows). Image quantification revealed a significant decrease in mean droplet size in TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), resulting from a higher density of small droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), which are typically seen in thermogenic adipocytes.

These results indicate that thermogenic features of implanted cells are maintained for a minimum of 8 weeks in vivo during which adipose tissue continues to develop from implanted cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Beige adipocytes develop into adipose tissue with a denser neurovascular architecture</title><p>Thermogenic adipose tissue in mice is characterized by higher vascular and innervation density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2021</xref>). To determine whether WIM and TIM development was accompanied by differences in vascularization we stained whole-mounts and thin sections from excised implants with endothelial cell stain isolectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first analyzed the dynamics of vascular development in WIM over time after implantation. We detected dispersed endothelial cells as early as week 2 in whole-mount specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top panels), and between weeks 4 and 8, a well-developed vascular network, closely resembling that seen in human adipose tissue, was observed. Vessels formed in apposition to enlarging adipocytes, as seen in sections co-stained with isolectin and antibodies to PLIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panels). The total intensity of isolectin staining, relative to PLIN1 staining to account for adipocyte mass, did not differ over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the mean size of vascular structures significantly increased between weeks 4 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), corresponding with the appearance of discernible vessels.

Removal of Fsk from chronically stimulated adipocytes resulted in a rapid increase in droplet size, which reached the size seen in cells that were never exposed to Fsk within days of removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).

In contrast, both tissues were clearly stained for the lipid droplet protein PLIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At higher resolution, MAOA could be seen localized between the lipid droplet, marked by perilipin staining, and the periphery of the cell, where it co-localized with mitochondrial HSP70, consistent with its reported localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Imaging of implants confirmed that MAOA protein is detected in human adipocytes within the implant, but not in vicinal endogenous mouse adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), despite being detectable in some sections in mouse immune cells infiltrating the implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To assess whether the lower expression of MAOA in TIM, detected by bulk RNA sequencing, was observable at the protein level, we stained thin sections of excised implants with antibodies to PLIN1 and MAOA, as well as DAPI to control for cellularity of the sections. MAOA staining was lower on average in sections from TIM compared to WIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, left panel), while PLIN staining was not different between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Monoamine oxidases are major mechanisms by which norepinephrine, epinephrin and serotonin are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tipton, 2018</xref>), and clorgyline, a specific, irreversible inhibitor of MAOA have been used in the treatment of depression for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipper et al., 1979</xref>). To determine whether expression of MAOA in human adipocytes might be functionally relevant, we treated mice harboring WIM with a low dose of the clorgyline for 2 weeks. A low dose was used to minimize its effects on endogenous brain and peripheral mouse Maoa. A separate cohort of mice was gradually acclimated to low ambient temperature as an alternative method to enhance adrenergic tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Neither treatment resulted in significant changes in body weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), nor in weights of most tissues except for a decrease in inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue weight in cold-acclimated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), which was expected given the reliance of BAT on peripheral lipolysis to sustain thermogenesis. However, implants from clorgyline-treated mice expressed significantly elevated <italic>UCP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), with no change in <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Effects on other genes associated with thermogenesis did not achieve statistical significance, potentially due to the low doses of clorgyline and mild cold exposure conditions employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Ucp1</italic> in mouse subcutaneous adipose tissue was not affected by clorgyline, despite it being responsive to cold stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>), demonstrating that the effect of clorgyline was specific for human adipocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Efforts to understand mechanisms of human thermogenic adipose tissue development are limited by the difficulty of accessing adipose tissue from human subjects over time, and from paucity of models to study human tissue development. Here, we leverage a species-hybrid model in which adipose tissue is formed after implantation of developing human adipocytes into mice. This model is enabled by methods to generate multipotent human progenitor cells that can be driven towards differentiation into multiple adipocyte subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2019</xref>). Adipocytes complete maturation in vivo, developing key species-specific features, such as larger cell size compared to mouse adipocytes, and maintaining the thermogenic phenotype induced in-vitro. Developing adipocytes recruit host cellular components, including vascular endothelial cells, adipose stem/progenitor cells, immune cells, and neuronal components to make functional adipose tissue.</p><p>An important question addressed by this work is whether supporting structures such as the vasculature of thermogenic adipose tissue differ qualitatively from that of non-thermogenic tissue. By distinguishing adipocytes from other cellular components at the transcriptional level and complementing these data with single cell atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamalice et al., 2007</xref>), we find that vascular endothelial and other non-adipocyte cells of thermogenic adipose tissue, are qualitatively different. Vascularization of the developing tissue involves infiltration of mouse endothelial cells, followed by formation of mature blood vessels, as seen in other developing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamalice et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, after 8 weeks infiltrating mouse cells in thermogenic tissue form a denser vascular network, and display a significant increase in extracellular matrix elements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) including <italic>Eln</italic>, <italic>Fmod</italic>, <italic>Col5a3</italic>, <italic>Col8a2,</italic> and <italic>Col4a2</italic>, the later which is associated with small vessel stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunda et al., 2014</xref>). The composition of the extracellular matrix, and its resulting mechanical properties have been found to directly influence adipocyte development and thermogenic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takata et al., 2020</xref>). Our results enable further experiments to explore the role of these specific extracellular matrix elements on human thermogenic adipocyte differentiation and function. Endothelial cells of the thermogenic tissue also express lower levels of circadian clock genes <italic>Dbp</italic>, <italic>Per2,</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic>, which are known to oscillate in adipose tissues of mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dankel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lekkas and Paschos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otway et al., 2011</xref>), and have been associated with the activity of thermogenic adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adlanmerini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Froy and Garaulet, 2018</xref>). Our finding that these genes are expressed in the vasculature may explain the parallel oscillations of these genes in other peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soták et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a qualitative and quantitative different vasculature, thermogenic adipocytes also recruit a denser neuronal sympathetic network. The ability of implanted thermogenic adipocytes to recruit this neurovascular network is critical, as in the absence of external stimuli adipocytes lose their thermogenic phenotype within days. At 8 weeks of development thermogenic adipocytes express increased levels of genes associated with neurogenesis (<italic>THBS4</italic>, <italic>TNC</italic>, <italic>NTRK3,</italic> and <italic>SPARCL1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gan and Südhof, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Girard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tucić et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, two of these factors, Thbs4 and Sparcl1, have been identified as factors in blood from young mice that can directly stimulate synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gan and Südhof, 2020</xref>). Beige adipocytes have been found to be neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2021</xref>), raising the possibility that these neurogenic factors produced by thermogenic adipocytes might not only enhance local innervation but might contribute to neuroprotection.</p><p>In addition to enhanced levels of neurogenic factors, we found that thermogenic adipocytes display decreased expression of neurotransmitter clearance enzymes MAOA and ACHE. MAOA catalyzes the oxidative deamination of norepinephrine and would be expected to affect thermogenesis by dampening adrenergic tone. ACHE is responsible for the catabolism of acetylcholine, which has been found to activate thermogenic adipocytes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jun et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly Maoa has been implicated in the control of adipose tissue thermogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pirzgalska et al., 2017</xref>), through its expression in a specific subset of macrophages. Our studies indicate that in contrast to mice, human <italic>MAOA</italic> is strongly expressed in adipocytes, which also express the non-neuronal transporter <italic>SLC22A3</italic>, allowing for transport and degradation of catecholamines. These findings, which are consistent with those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bour et al., 2007</xref>) suggest that adipocytes themselves play a major role in establishing adrenergic tone and controlling thermogenic activity in humans.</p><p>Correlations between human adipocyte MAOA and thermogenesis can be inferred from findings reporting that MAOA activity is increased in visceral adipose tissue of obese compared to non-obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sturza et al., 2019</xref>), which have also been reported to display decreased expression of UCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Alonso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). While more studies will clarify these associations, our studies directly demonstrate that inhibition of MAOA with low doses of clorgyline enhances expression of UCP1 in human but not mouse adipocytes, highlighting the functional relevance of the human adipocyte-expressed enzyme. It is notable that clorgiline induced UCP1 expression in the human tissue, while this was not seen in response to mild cold exposure. This could be attributable to the lower innervation density of WIM, and to a generally lower sympathetic innervation in the flank of the mouse compared to inguinal and interscapular regions. Further studies will help determine whether the site of implantation affects responsiveness of hybrid tissue to cold exposure, and whether inhibition of MAOA has a synergistic effect. The finding that inhibition of MAOA can induce human adipocyte beiging in vivo suggests brain impenetrable, adipocyte favoring formulations of MAOA inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents in metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adipose tissue progenitor cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Corvera Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mesenchymal progenitor cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cells used in this paper are generated from small fragments of surgically excised male or female human adipose tissue cultured in MatriGel, in the presence of normocin, penicillin and streptomycin.

Tissue sections (8 µm) were mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For whole-mount staining, tissue fragments (~1 mm<sup>3</sup>) were stained and mounted between 1.5 mm coverslips sealed with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies). Mouse vasculature was detected using isolectin GS-IB4 AlexaFluor-647 conjugate (Invitrogen I32450) and human vasculature using Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA I), DyLight 594 (Vector Laboratories DL-1067–1). Nuclei were stained using DAPI (Life Sciences 62249). Perilipin-1 was detected with an antibody that recognizes both human and mouse protein (CellSignaling #9349). MAOA was detected using CellSignaling #73030 (human) or CellSignaling #75330 (human and mouse). To identify sympathetic nerves an antibody for Tyrosine Hydroxylase was used (Millipore Sigma - AB152). Macrophages were identified by co-staining using antibodies for CD45 (Abcam – ab282747) and F4/80 (Abcam – ab6640). Mitochondrial HSP70 was detected using Invitrogen MA3-028. Tissue sections were imaged using ZEISS Axio Scan Z1. Whole-mount images were acquired using an Olympus IX81 microscope (Center Valley, PA) with dual Andor Zyla sCMOS 4.2 cameras (Belfast, UK) mounted on an Andor TuCam two camera adapter (Belfast, UK). To prevent visual biases, entire sections were imaged using a scanning microscope.</p><p>Image analysis was performed using the open software platform FIJI. A single montage containing all images was generated for all channels analyzed, thereby subjecting all images to the same filtering and quantification processes. To measure adipocyte sizes, images were converted to 8-bit grayscale, binarized using the default Threshold function, eroded twice, and object number and size measured through particle analysis (size = 350–2900 µm, circularity = 0.25–1). Density distributions (scaled) were generated using R-studio through the density distribution function in ggplot2. To measure vascular density and size, isolectin stained images were background subtracted (rolling radius = 1), binarized, and subjected to particle analysis. The total vascular area of each section was the sum of the individual particles. The average vascular size was the mean of the individual particles. For macrophage quantification, CD45, F4/80 and DAPI images were background subtracted (rolling radius = 1) and binarized. To isolate macrophages that were both CD45 and F4/80 positive, we used the image calculator function (image calculator &gt;operation: AND). Particle analysis was performed, and the number of particles were normalized to the number of nuclei present in the whole section to account for differences in section sizes. Sympathetic density was calculated using TH and isolectin stained images after background subtraction (rolling radius = 1) and binarization. Total sympathetic area in the section was the sum of all particles normalized to the number of nuclei present in the whole section to account for differences in section sizes. Images were analyzed by two investigators independently of each other, blinded to the nature of the samples.</p><p>To quantify MAOA levels between WIM and TIM, thin sections from n=4 each explant were stained for PLIN1, MAOA and DAPI. Whole sections were imaged using a TissueFAX SL tissue cytometer using ×20 magnification. Images were collated using the TissueFAXS 7 viewer and imported into FIJO for further analysis. Thresholds were applied to all sections in each channel equally, and MAOA and PLIN1 intensities were divided by the DAPI intensity in each region to account for cellularity. To account for differences in section sizes, 5 equally sized subsections of each image were analyzed and used to determine differences between WIM and TIM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Thermogenic withdrawal of cultured adipocytes</title><p>Cells (~6.0 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were thawed and seeded on 6-well plates, differentiated into white adipocytes, and stimulated with forskolin as described above. After chronic forskolin stimulation, a subset of cells was removed from daily stimulation for 10 days. Images were taken and samples were placed on TRIzol (Invitrogen) at days 0, 2, 5, 7, and 10 of withdrawal. Samples were homogenized using the Tissuelyser (QIAGEN), and total RNA was then isolated for analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Materials availability</title><p>The count data and processed data for bulk RNASeq has been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE200141.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample sizes ranged from five to seven biological replicates for each experiment and were based on variance associated with each parameter tested as assessed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Min et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rojas-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rojas-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>) Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ma-Li Wong as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The description of Figure 1E-L (e.g., WIM and TIM) was missing in the main text. This is also the case in Figure 2E-J: the description was not seen in the main text. Thus, this reviewer could not appreciate the full context of the work.</p><p>2. The staining of MAOA is not clear (Figure 6E). MAOA is located at the out membrane of mitochondria while the data looks that MAOA is located at the plasma membrane. MAOA western blots should also be shown in WIM and TIM.</p><p>3. The paper only provides data on UCP1 mRNA to demonstrate that inhibition of MAOA induces browning of human white adipose tissue. Other thermogenic genes Cidea, COX8b, Ppargc1b, FABP3, et al., should be shown along with UCP1 and Cidea protein levels by Western blot.</p><p>4. In Figure 4, the authors define cell types by comparing the expression of target genes based upon previously published single-cell data. However, single-cell data is quite shallow and only reflects a fraction of gene expression biased to highly expressed genes whereas deep sequencing can determine even low expression levels. This makes these analyses somewhat problematic as the authors are using different biological samples.</p><p>5. In the paragraph “The neurovascular network differentially responds to implanted adipocytes and supports TIM thermogenic phenotype”, the data shown do not support this statement. No data of the neurovascular network of mouse adipose tissue transplanted with WIM or TIM are shown, instead showing whiter (less UCP1 level) subcutaneous adipose tissue in mouse implanted with TIM than WIM.

Interestingly, human adipose tissue is fully able to recruit mouse vascular networks and sympathetic innervation during human adipocyte development. Compared to human white adipose tissue, human thermogenic adipose tissue recruited a denser mouse vascular network and denser sympathetic neuron innervation. The thermogenic adipose tissue was found to express higher neurogenesis genes but fewer neurotransmitter clearance genes, for example, MAOA (Monoamine oxidase A gene). Moreover, inhibition of MAOA with inhibitor-induced browning of human white adipose tissue. Although these findings provide novel and valuable information about the development of human thermogenic adipose tissue, there are a variety of issues that need to be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78945.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We do not have sufficient material to enable quantitative western blotting from excised implants.

We now clarify this in the text, and have changed the title of the sections to conform better to the results shown (“Development and maintenance of TIM thermogenic phenotype is not cell autonomous”). We refer to other findings reporting conditions in which the total content of thermogenic tissue in the organism appears to be sensed and balanced (“Schulz, T.J., et al., Brown-fat paucity due to impaired BMP signalling induces compensatory browning of white fat. Nature, 2013. 495(7441): p. 379-83.). However, elucidating these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

However, we feel that the inhibitor used is highly specific and has been used clinically for many years, and the finding of a specific effect of the inhibitor on adipose tissue formed from human cells, but not in the endogenous mouse adipose tissue, argues strongly for a functional role for human adipocyte MAOA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Nat Metab, 2020. 2(5): p. 397-412) as being highly correlated with human thermogenic fat abundance, and we have used it as a marker of thermogenic adipocytes. The reference to this was missing from the manuscript due to formatting issues, but has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In Figure 6J, it is a little puzzling that the authors failed to find an increase in UCP1 expression in transplanted adipose tissue after cold exposure. The authors wish to provide explanations for the observation.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several potential reasons for the lack of effect. The major one we feel is the localization of the developed tissue to the flank of the mouse. It is possible that this region is less well innervated compared to the inguinal subcutaneous region or the interscapular region where mouse thermogenic fat is localized. Colds exposure would activate through sympathetic innervation, which may not be sufficient in WIM. We have now addressed this point in the last paragraph of the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
