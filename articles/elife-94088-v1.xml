Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation, and proportion analysis, signifies ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high systolic blood pressure in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population-specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic-specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic-specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population- and comorbidity-specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population-specific prevention strategies for stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>comorbidity</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006144</institution-id><institution>Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sukumaran</surname><given-names>Rashmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Moinak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genomic differences in stroke and its comorbid conditions can aid in refining the socio-economic interpretation of risk among different ethnicities and can assist in distinguishing their phenotypic variation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke affects over 101 million people worldwide and is ranked the second most fatal disease in the world, with 6.5 million deaths in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GBD 2019 Stroke Collaborators, 2021</xref>). Comorbid conditions of stroke are critical contributors to burden of stroke and the duration of the comorbid conditions can further determine the severity of stroke risk or mortality. Prevalence for comorbid conditions range from 43% to 94% and estimates can go as high as 99% above 66 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallacher et al., 2019</xref>). Prevalence and mortality risk in stroke have often been evaluated from socio-economic viewpoint, but it is also critical to understand the differences in drivers such as comorbid conditions. It is the accumulated risk of comorbid conditions that enhance the risk of stroke further. Are these comorbid conditions differentially impacted by socio-economic factors and ethnogeographic factors. This was clearly evident in COVID era, when COVID-19 differentially impacted the risk of stroke, possibly due to its differential influence on the comorbidities of stroke.</p><p>Mortality in stroke, its subtypes, and their comorbid conditions have a strong ethnic bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tarko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardener et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mkoma et al., 2020</xref>). Genetics act as surrogate markers for ethnogeographic indices. It is important to understand which comorbid conditions are influenced by socio-economic indices, and how they impact the risk of stroke and their underlying genetic basis. A Danish study reported the effect sizes of association with comorbid conditions for stroke to have 15% higher mortality risk in presence of diabetes mellitus with end-organ damage, 20% for peripheral vascular disease, 25% for chronic pulmonary disease, 35% for congestive heart failure and atrial flutter, 45% for moderate to severe renal disease, and 1.8- to 2.4-fold for mild-to-severe liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). A UK Biobank study on stroke multimorbidity reported 1.5× higher risk of mortality in those with two additional comorbidities and a ≈2.5× higher risk of mortality in those with ≥5 comorbidities over 7 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallacher et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the differential impact of comorbid or multimorbid conditions contributing to the additive effect of illness burden needs to be addressed from an ethnogenetic perspective. Devising an appropriate strategy for prevention of stroke burden, needs a careful evaluation of the underlying genetic signature for each of these comorbid conditions and distinguishing their ethnic bias.</p><p>The objective of the study was to understand what determines the differences in stroke burden around the globe. Variations in burden of stroke could be influenced by comorbid conditions, and incidentally both stroke and its comorbid conditions can be influenced by ethnogeographic factors and genetics can act as a stable proxy marker for all. To resolve this, we considered the prevalence and mortality of a total of 11 disease conditions, consisting of stroke and its comorbid conditions, across different continents and ethnicities from 2009 to 2019. The disease conditions were further stratified as per their ethnogeographic locations and their genetic risk variants extrapolated from GWAS data. This study would provide insights on the regional patterns of the burden of stroke and its comorbid conditions, and help in resolving it from an ethnic and genetic viewpoint. These insights would further aid in developing and strategizing regional- and ethnic-specific needs for prevention of the risk of comorbid conditions and stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global mortality, incidence and prevalence rates of stroke and its comorbid conditions</title><p>Globally, stroke ranks as the second most fatal disease in 2019 (84.2/100,000, 95%UI 76.8–90.2) among the eight diseases analyzed, preceded by ischemic heart disease (IHD; 117.9/100,000, 95%UI 107.8–125.9) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. High systolic blood pressure (high SBP) ranks as the most fatal comorbid disease condition with an age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of 138.9/100,000 [95%UI 121.3–155.7] among all conditions. Within stroke subtypes, ischemic stroke ranks highest globally with ASMR of 43.5/100,000 [95%UI 39.08–46.8], followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at 36.0/100,000 [95%UI 32.9–38.7] and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at 4.7/100,000 [95%UI 4.1–5.2]. The ranking of the ASMRs of the diseases follows the same trend throughout the last decade with minor exceptions, where high body mass index (high BMI) improved its rank in 2014 by swapping with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (high LDL), and type 1 diabetes (T1D) dethroned chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 2019.</p><p>Global trends in crude and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) show that stroke incidence ranks fourth, while IHD is on top followed by type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Crude incidence rates of stroke and its subtypes increased in the last decade but ASIRs decreased, with exception of ischemic stroke, where an increase in ASIR was observed. Among other diseases, IHD, T2D, and T1D show a continuous increase in the last decade, with T2D (280.1/100,000, 95%UI 258.8–303.9) surpassing IHD (274.0/100,000, 95%UI 242.9–306.4) in 2019 in crude rates.</p><p>The global trend between crude and age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPRs) revealed that the ranking of stroke remains at sixth position throughout the years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among stroke subtypes, ischemic stroke ranks highest. The comorbid conditions, high SBP and high BMI, ranks first and second followed by CKD and T2D, and interestingly all rank above stroke. We also observe that though there is a continuous increase in prevalence rates in the last decade, the ranking of stroke or its comorbid conditions does not change over the years, with the exception of T1D ASPRs overtaking ICH. We were keen to understand if these global trends of ASMR and ASPR are influenced by region and ethnicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ethno-regional differences in mortality and prevalence of stroke and its major comorbid conditions</title><p>We observed interesting patterns of ASMRs of stroke, its subtypes, and its major comorbidities across different regions over the years as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. When assessed in terms of ranks, high SBP is the most fatal condition followed by IHD in all regions, except Oceania where IHD and high SBP swap ranks. Africa (206.2/100,000, 95%UI 177.4–234.2) and Middle East (198.6/100,000, 95%UI 162.8–234.4) have the highest ASMR for high SBP, even though they rank as only the third and sixth most populous continents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), respectively. Both high SBP (−0.64% to −2.25% estimated annual percentage change [EAPC]) and IHD (−0.45% to −1.17% EAPC) show a decreasing trend for ASMRs in all regions. However, only Europe shows a significant decrease for high SBP (−2.26%; p = 0.009) and IHD (−2.37%; p = 0.006) in the decade. Stroke has a decreasing trend for ASMRs with East Asia and Europe showing a significant decrease of −2.2% (p = 0.021) and −2.6% (p = 0.03), respectively. Stroke has the highest mortality in East Asia (127.1/100,000, 95%UI 104.9–150.5 in 2019), and is the only region that ranks stroke higher than IHD. Though Europe, Middle East, and Central and South Asia have ASMRs similar to global rates for stroke, Central and South Asia ranks stroke as the third most fatal factor, while America, Europe, and Middle East ranks it fifth.

ranking (4th to 9th) in 2019. While ICH shows a significant decrease in ASMR in East Asia (–3.53%, p = 0.009), ischemic stroke shows a significant decrease in Europe (–2.37%, p = 0.06). High BMI and high LDL rank in the top 5 but their mortality rates differed across all regions, with the highest rates for both in the Middle East. Only Europe shows a significant decrease in high LDL (–2.53%, p = 0.03) over the decade. The Middle East has the highest ASMRs due to IHD and high SBP, followed by Africa, Central and South Asia, East Asia, and Europe, all having rates higher than global. All continents have similar mortality rates for T2D and CKD across the years, except Oceania, where the T2D rate is nearly three times CKD rate. Africa has the highest mortality rate for T1D (1.59/100,000, 95%UI 1.2–1.9).</p><p>ASPRs also showed an interesting pattern of distribution, and, in contrast to mortality, showed an increase over the decade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Highest ASPRs were observed for high SBP across all regions, except America, Middle East, and Oceania, where high BMI has most prevalence. While EAPC of prevalence of high SBP showed significant decrease in all regions (−0.38% to −1.77%), except Central and South Asia, high BMI showed a significant increase (1.77–5.6%) in all (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The ASPR ranking of CKD and T2D rose to top 5, in sharp contrast to their ASMR rankings. Prevalence of CKD (EAPC 0.24– 0.7%) and T2D (EAPC 0.6–2.18%) is significantly increasing in all regions. For all other diseases, the pattern of ranking and rates across regions were stable with minor exceptions. Stroke ranks sixth for ASPRs in all regions, and it is interesting to note that ASPRs of all the comorbid conditions, except T1D, rank above stroke. While Europe shows a significant decline in ASPRs of stroke (–0.9%, p = 0.008) and ischemic stroke (–0.85%, p = 0.03) across the years, East Asia shows a significant increase for stroke (0.7%, p = 0.02) and ischemic stroke (1.09%, p = &lt;0.001). Globally, T1D swapped its prevalence ranking with ICH in 2014, largely influenced by the significant increase in prevalence in Middle East (2.83%, p = &lt;0.001). However, the highest prevalence of T1D is in Europe and Oceania. The prevalence of IHD has remained nearly constant in all continents in the last decade, except Oceania (–0.43%), America (–0.49%), and Middle East (–0.27%) which shows a significant decrease. In 2019, Middle East has the highest prevalence for IHD (4843.02/100,000, 95%UI 4243.02–5442.58), while America (1695.6/100,000, 95%UI 1530.8–1871.9) has the lowest ASPR, less than half the rate of the Middle East. We were further keen to understand if these regional differences in mortality and prevalence rates also reflect a socio-economic bias and if so, does it reflect in a category of comorbid conditions.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) from 2009 to 2019 of age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPRs)

This was in sharp contrast to the prevalence proportion of strokes (4.6–9.1%), which was the least among the three groups, with the highest proportional prevalence for strokes being 8.9–9.1% in Central and South Asia. The proportional mortality for high SBP (22.0–30.5%) is very similar across the regions.

From the GWAS loci, we observed a distinct population structure that distinguished ethnogeographic populations based on their genetic signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For all diseases, except high BMI, the individuals clustered into five groups, each corresponding with the five super-populations from 1000 Genome project namely, African, East Asian, South Asian, European, and American. For high BMI, the individuals clustered into three groups corresponding to African, East Asian, and European. Though broad clustering of ancestral populations among the diseases looks similar, the proportions of ancestral populations in certain diseases vary greatly. Among stroke, IHD, and T2D risk variants, the populations structured in a similar way, while for T1D, CKD, and LDL the patterns were slightly different in European and South Asian ancestry. Whereas for high SBP the major fluctuations were observed in South Asian and East Asian populations. This stratification was further explored using population-based clustering, where a similar pattern was observed in the principal component analysis (PCA) plots for stroke and its comorbid conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Can the linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns of rare allele and common allele help in distinguishing the ethnogeographic distinction in phenotype variation. While comparing, the LD pattern of low-frequency variants and common variants across ethnicities, we observe contrasting patterns.

The dynamics of different rates of stroke, its subtypes, and comorbid factors do reflect ethnogeographic differences. Globally, the prevalence and incidence rates of stroke have increased, while mortality rates decreased with minor shifts in ranking in the last decade. Interestingly, the incidence and prevalence rank of stroke rates remain the same globally, but for mortality it ranks third, preceded only by IHD and high SBP. While the global stroke prevalence is nearly 15 times its mortality rate, prevalence of comorbid conditions such as high SBP, high BMI, CKD, and T2D are alarmingly 150- to 500-fold higher than their mortality rates. These comorbid conditions can drastically affect the outcome of stroke. Interestingly, these disparities in rates get further widened when evaluated from an ethnogeographic perspective. The age-standardized prevalence of stroke in 2019 ranges from lowest in Central and South Asia (858.5/100,000, 95%UI 737.6–979.4) to highest in East Asia (1513.1/100,000, 95%UI 1390.7–1635.5), in contrast to mortality rates, lowest in America (40.3/100,000, 95%UI 36.2–43.1) and highest in East Asia (127.7/100,000, 95%UI 104.9–150.5).</p><p>The rates of stroke, its subtypes, and comorbid conditions do correlate to some extent but their ranking varies significantly. In terms of ranking, stroke ranks sixth in prevalence across all ethnogeographic locations, but ranks second in mortality in East Asia and third in Central and South Asia and Africa. We find that among the considered comorbid conditions, some rank above stroke in both incidence and prevalence, however in terms of mortality, stroke ranks highest with exception to high SBP. Similarly, the ranking of the comorbid conditions also varies when the global population is stratified based on ethnogeographic locations. In the last decade, there has been tremendous development in the healthcare industry globally, but this is not reflected in the mortality or prevalence data from 2009 to 2019. Ranking of comorbid conditions by the rates is very crucial to identify ethnic-specific comorbid risk that can be helpful in guiding and managing stroke risk.</p><p>The changing dynamics of stroke or its comorbid conditions can be attributed to a multitude of factors. Often the global burden of stroke has been discussed from the point of view of socio-economic parameters. Studies indicate that half of the stroke-related deaths are attributable to poor management of modifiable risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baatiema et al., 2020</xref>). However, we observe that different socio-economic regions are driven by different risk factors. Considering that Europe, America, Oceania, and the Middle East represent high socio-economic regions, the comorbid conditions that drive prevalence and mortality rates here seem to be more of metabolic in nature, while for South Asians, high SBP is the prominent factor. It is evident from the correlation between prevalence and mortality for stroke, its subtypes, and comorbid conditions that there is an ethnic- and comorbid-specific correlation, which possibly does not reflect a clear socio-economic distinction. The comorbid conditions for stroke subtypes also differ to a large extent. Diabetes is a comorbid condition for stroke but not for SAH, and this risk is ethnic-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindgren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koshy et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is very pertinent to understand the stroke risk from an ethnic view point, beyond the boundaries of socio-economic criteria, as the drivers of comorbid risk and ethnicity rely on genetic and epigenetic components. Studies reported reduction in life expectancy in 31 of 37 high-income countries, deduced to be due to COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Islam et al., 2021</xref>). However, it would be unfair to ignore the comorbid conditions which could also be the critical determinants for reduced life expectancy in these countries.</p><p>Stroke has a complex etiology, which is further influenced by its comorbid conditions and this impacts its phenotypic variability. A strong genetic risk drives both stroke and its comorbid conditions. Genetic risk variants for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathies and nephropathies, hypertension, inflammation, and kidney diseases have been reportedly shown to have strong ethnogenetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shoily et al., 2021</xref>). Implications of ethnogenetic differences were evident when GWAS genes for stroke and all studies of comorbid conditions were used to stratify the 1000 genome super-populations. We observed that the GWAS risk loci for stroke and its comorbid conditions like high BMI, high LDL, high SBP, T2D, T1D, and CKD could stratify the super-populations based on its ethnogenetic considerations. Fluctuations in genetic structure of stroke and its comorbid conditions signify the impact of ethnic variations on mortality and prevalence rates. Stroke accounts for approximately 20% of deaths in diabetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehme et al., 2017</xref>). Diabetics and pre-diabetics, and the duration of diabetes have been reported to have increased risk of stroke, which gets aggravated in African-Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehme et al., 2017</xref>). As stroke and its comorbid conditions are heavily influenced by lifestyle, high-income countries showed evidence of metabolic disorders being the major cause of concern for both prevalence and mortality. Similar observation in a UK biobank cohort study on stroke suggests that genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with incident stroke, which emphasizes the benefit of entire populations adhering to a healthy lifestyle, independent of genetic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rutten-Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic risk variations could also be a reflection of their underlying genetic differences. Significant differences among ethnicities in metabolism of various macromolecules have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vasishta et al., 2022</xref>). Genetic variations demonstrate inter-ethnic differences in LDL levels resulting in differential impact on dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klarin et al., 2018</xref>). A meta-analysis on European, East Asian, and African-American ethnicities revealed that common variants of <italic>CDH13</italic> and <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> regulate adiponectin levels, an important component of BMI indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dastani et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>ALDH2*504Lys</italic> allele has been reported to be associated with high BMI, increased tolerance of alcohol, high SBP, and decreased high-density lipoprotein in East Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takeuchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). MEGASTROKE consortium on stroke and its comorbid factors reported five variants associated with blood pressure, two with LDL cholesterol and reported that all stroke subtypes were associated with a Genetic Risk Score for high SBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malik et al., 2018</xref>). A study on IHD, T2D in European populations with different healthcare systems, and local population substructures reported Polygenic risk score with similar accuracy across Europeans, to a lesser extent to South and East Asian populations, and very poor transferability for Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mars et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Even stroke subtypes show a strong ethnic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). While <italic>COL4A1</italic> and <italic>COL4A2</italic> were common denominators for most of the stroke subtypes, high-density lipoprotein was inversely associated with small vessel stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meschia, 2020</xref>). The INTERSTROKE study on stroke subtypes reported that among comorbid factors, high SBP was significantly associated with ICH and diabetes, cardiac issues, and apolipoproteins with ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Donnell et al., 2016</xref>). Ischemic stroke associated with ApoB/ApoA1 ratio had higher (67.6%) population attributable fraction (PAF) in Southeast Asia compared to Western Europe, North America, and Australia (24.8%), while ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation had lower PAF in South Asia (3.1%) compared to the rest (17.1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Donnell et al., 2016</xref>). Emerging studies like novel ethnic-specific genetic variants, such as SUMOylation pathway in Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>SFXN4</italic> and <italic>TMEM108</italic> in Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keene et al., 2020</xref>) indicate the involvement of different pathways among different ethnicities in stroke. The A allele of c.*84G&gt;A loci in <italic>CETP</italic> gene was found to be a risk factor for IHD in South Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>). High SBP was found to be a risk factor in all major stroke subtypes except lobar ICH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georgakis et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, identifying differential risk in different ethnicities for stroke and its subtypes, and its impact on comorbid conditions might also indicate different treatment modalities which can minimize adverse metabolic side effects.</p><p>Identifying the pattern of genetic variation is critical in distinguishing stroke and its endophenotypic variations. The risk variants rs528002287 (locus 15q26.3) in <italic>PCSK6</italic> and rs148010464 (locus 1q31.1) an intergenic variant in <italic>PLA2G4A/LINC01036</italic> for stroke were unique to South Asia, and were found to be associated with cardioembolic stroke and small vessel stroke in South Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). A recent INTERSTROKE study reported the association of short sleep duration with increased risk for stroke to be highest in the South Asian ethnicity (Odds Ratio 9.13, 95% Confidence Interval 5.86–14.66) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mc Carthy et al., 2023</xref>). Decreased sleep quantity and quality have been reported to increase blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabanayagam and Shankar, 2010</xref>), prevalence for which was found to be highest for South Asians in our study. These observations are interesting as <italic>PCSK6</italic> is known to regulate sodium homeostasis and thereby maintain diastolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Reports also indicate 2.34-fold difference in the expression of <italic>PCSK6</italic> during maintenance phase of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marques et al., 2010</xref>). PCSK6 has also been reported to be involved in processing of precursors of Melanin Concentrating hormone (MCH) under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viale et al., 1999</xref>). MCH is known to play a central role in promoting and stabilizing sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jego et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konadhode et al., 2013</xref>). In insomnia patients, <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> was reported to be upregulated by 1.88-fold after improvement in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Livingston et al., 2015</xref>). In sleep deprived mice, glycolytic pathway and lipid metabolism were upregulated and expression of <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> was downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinard et al., 2012</xref>). These observations are interesting as <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> is known to play a role in the metabolism of phospholipids, production of lipid mediators, and the release of arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Dennis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimizu et al., 2006</xref>). Arachidonic acid is involved in signaling pathways of metabolic processes like release of insulin and glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nugent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolford et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> also plays a role in the production of pro-thrombotic TXA2 and thus, inhibition of <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> can reduce platelet aggregation and thromboembolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakami et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the risk of unique genetic variants in <italic>PCSK6</italic> and <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> in South Asian ancestry may indicate a unique endophenotype for stroke, which might also indicate the influence of underlying risk variants for comorbid conditions, for example <italic>PLA2G4A</italic> in metabolic processes.</p><p>GWAS has yielded numerous common risk alleles that are associated with various human phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manolio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCarthy and Hirschhorn, 2008</xref>). Since the rationale for GWAS is the ‘common disease, common variant’ hypothesis, it has been able to identify only those common variants with a moderate effect on the associated trait and thus, these identified variants only explain a small proportion of the heritability of the trait. One of the major conclusions from the 1000 Genomes Project was that most variations in the human genome are rare and unique to specific subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecasis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abecasis et al., 2012</xref>). From an evolutionary point of view, alleles with strong effects that are detrimental will be controlled by purifying selection keeping its frequency low. Hence, rare and low-frequency variants might be variants with large effects on traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodmer and Bonilla, 2008</xref>). Examples of genes like <italic>ABCA1</italic>, <italic>PCSK9</italic>, and <italic>LDLR (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kathiresan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lusis and Pajukanta, 2008</xref>), which carries both common variants with moderate effects as well as rare variants with large effect for lipid levels indicate that genes can contain both types of variants associated with a complex trait. Using this logic, we were keen to identify the influence of common and rare variants in stroke and its comorbid conditions and their pattern of LD in distinguishing ethnic-specific risk.</p><p>While we observe the majority of the GWAS variants associated with stroke are common variants, a minority of these are low-frequency variants with below 10% frequency. The alternate alleles of these variants were found to be present only in specific super-populations of 1000 Genomes, while the variants are monoallelic in the other super-populations. This difference among populations gets further enhanced when we look at the LD patterns of these low-frequency variants with other low-frequency variants which are in proxy. Distinct LD blocks with these unique rare variants present in one super-population were seen to be absent in other populations. On the other hand, LD patterns of common variants (frequency greater than 10%) in the same regions show similar LD patterns for all populations. Thus, the rare variant hypothesis could explain a significant proportion of the differences in burden of stroke seen across populations. Such genes identified could be possible candidate genes for identifying rare and low-frequency variants that could play a role in the heritability of stroke and its comorbid factors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The dynamics of incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of stroke and its subtypes along with its comorbid risk factors reflect strong ethnogeographic differences. Our work highlights that these ethnogeographic differences for stroke and its comorbid conditions need to be evaluated and stratified based on their ethnogenetic background. Genetic variables should be considered as primary evidence as they define the threshold for biochemical, metabolomic, or epigenetic variables. The different socio-economic regions are driven by different risk factors of stroke and low-frequency variants could be playing a role in the differences in burden of stroke seen in the different regions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Identifying population-specific unique variants for stroke and its comorbid conditions might refine the drivers for endophenotypic variations for stroke risk. We would like to suggest that integrating public health genomics and articulating it with comorbid conditions for stroke should be considered crucial irrespective of the economic status, as both lower and higher socio-economic regions have different drivers of stroke risk.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of the work highlighting that the burden of stroke is driven by different risk factors in different regions.</title><p>The different socio-economic regions are driven by different risk factors of stroke and low-frequency genetic variants could be playing a role in the differences in burden of stroke seen in the different regions.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94088-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources</title><p>We obtained ASIRs, ASPRs, and ASMRs for a total of eight diseases and three disease conditions in 204 countries, for the years 2009–2019 using the GBD Results Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/">vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2020</xref>) and from NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ncdrisc.org/">ncdrisc.org/</ext-link>) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration NCD-RisC, 2017</xref>) in November 2021.

These differences have often been interpreted from socio-economic point of view, while our manuscript presents the reasons for differences for main condition (Stroke) and its comorbid condition among different ethnicities from a genetic perspective. This genetic perspective was further explored to identify unique ethnic specific variants and their patterns of linkage disequilibrium in distinguishing the phenotypic variations. Considering the quantum and diversity of data, both for public health and GWAS data, there can be several directions but for presentation we focused only on the most distinguishing and established phenotypic differences. I am sure this will open up avenues for several future investigations including COVID, as has been highlighted by the reviewers too. All observations were presented with robust and established norms of statistical analysis.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Thanks for the constructive observations on strengths and weaknesses of our manuscript. Interestingly, some of the weaknesses mentioned here also turns out to be the strength of the article. For example COVID19 has been mentioned by the reviewer as a driver to increase the mortality in some comorbid conditions and stroke. Firstly, I must clarify that, our data is from PreCOVID era and we indeed mention that in COVID era, COVID-19 might differentially impact the risk of stroke. Possibly this differential influence on the comorbidities of stroke, is likely to be influenced by its underlying genetics of stroke and its comorbidities.</p><p>I have tried to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, which ideally doesn’t impact the original manuscript. Statistical limitation has been commented pertaining to P-values, which has been clarified here. However, certain minor concerns such as abbreviations have been resolved in the revised manuscript. My response to weakness and reviewer’s comments are mentioned below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data provided here will provide a foundation for a lot of future research into the causes of the observed correlations as well as whether the observed differences in comorbidities across regions have clinically relevant effects on risk management.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As with any cross-national analysis of rates, the data is vulnerable to differences in classification and reporting across jurisdictions.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>GBD data is the most robust and most comprehensive data resource which has been used and accepted globally in predicting the health metrics statistics.</p><p>GBD data indeed considers normalisations, regarding classification and reporting.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the best available resource to consider all health metrics analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Furthermore, given the increased death rate from COVID-19 associated with many of these comorbid conditions and the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection on vascular health, it is expected that many of the correlations observed in this dataset will shift along with the shifting health of the underlying populations.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>I must clarify that we have used data prior to COVID-19.</p><p>But yes the patterns after COVID19 will shift due to the impact of covid.

When assessed in terms of ranks, high SBP is the most fatal condition followed by IHD in all regions, except Oceania (OCE) where IHD and high SBP swap ranks. Africa (AFR; 206.2/100000, 95%UI 177.4-234.2) and Middle East (MDE; 198.6/100000, 95%UI 162.8-234.4) have the highest ASMR for high SBP, even though they rank as only the third and sixth most populous continents (fig.

Often one has to go back to decipher what the acronym stands for. It is fine to have acronyms in figure legends, if necessary. However, at least for regions, please do not use acronyms.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version we have tried to minimise the Acronyms.</p><p>Removed the acronyms for regions and other places wherever possible however, the diseases acronyms have been maintained as per the GBD terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please focus the presentation on the main results. Currently, the presentation wanders and repeats itself a lot.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the manuscript tries to address the global and regional rates of prevalence, mortality and its relationship to genetic correlates, it is difficult not to repeat the same to stress the significant observations coming out of different analysis methods. This might reflect on some amount of repetitiveness but the intention was to stress the significant observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also recommend acknowledging and discussing socioeconomic factors earlier in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Current mention happens in 3rd para of Discussion</p><p>“The changing dynamics of stroke or its comorbid conditions can be attributed to multitude of factors. Often global burden of stroke has been discussed from the point of view of socio-economic parameters. Studies indicate that half of the stroke-related deaths are attributable to poor management of modifiable risk factors 8,9. However, we observe that different socio-economic regions are driven by different risk factors.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
