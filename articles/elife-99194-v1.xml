Historically, persister formation in biofilms has been linked to constraints imposed by their dense structures. However, we observed an elevated persister frequency accompanying the stage of cell adhesion, marking the onset of biofilm development. Subsequent mechanistic studies uncovered a comparable type of toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (TA-like system) triggered by cell adhesion, which is responsible for this elevation. In this module, the toxin HipH acts as a genotoxic deoxyribonuclease, inducing DNA double strand breaks and genome instability. While the second messenger c-di-GMP functions as the antitoxin, exerting control over HipH expression and activity. The dynamic interplay between c-di-GMP and HipH levels emerges as a crucial determinant governing genome stability and persister generation within biofilms. These findings unveil a unique TA system, where small molecules act as the antitoxin, outlining a biofilm-specific molecular mechanism influencing genome stability and antibiotic persistence, with potential implications for treating biofilm infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>c-di-GMP</kwd><kwd>HipH</kwd><kwd>persister</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>toxin-antitoxin system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2701602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019537</institution-id><institution>Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022CFA077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Major project of Guangzhou national Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GZNL2024A01023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2042022dx0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014219</institution-id><institution>National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82025011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005273</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202001BB050005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Chunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>c-di-GMP and HipH function as a toxin-antitoxin-like module to regulate persister cell formation in bacterial biofilms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of chronic and recurrent microbial infections has been significantly attributed to the formation of biofilms - complex, surface-attached bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costerton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis, 2005</xref>). In biofilms, bacteria exhibit reduced antibiotic sensitivities, a phenomenon occurring independently of the presence of resistance determinants on genetic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceri et al., 1999</xref>). This antibiotic insensitivity is linked to the elevated prevalence of persister cells in biofilms, with rates ranging from 10 to 1000 times higher compared to their planktonic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan and Bassler, 2019</xref>). Persister cells, recognized as phenotypic variants in an isogenic population, demonstrate a remarkable ability to withstand antibiotic treatment and, intriguingly, can resuscitate once the antibiotic pressure is alleviated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigger, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). These characteristics collectively position persister cells as key contributors to the perpetuation of persistent infections of biofilms.</p><p>Despite the high frequency in biofilms and critical roles in both clinical context and evolution processes, the mechanisms underlying persister formation in biofilms are the subject of intense debate. The effects induced by high density, including nutrient and oxygen deficiency, and quorum sensing within dense structure of developed biofilms, have long been considered as primary factors leading to persister formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan and Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). This association originally stems from the hypothesis of limitations in nutrient, oxygen, or antibiotic penetration into the dense structures. Nevertheless, recent challenges to this hypothesis have arisen from studies indicating that the matrix mesh size of biofilms is significantly larger than the size of molecules such as nutrients, oxygen, and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan and Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, most antibiotics do not strongly interact with biofilm matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spoering and Lewis, 2001</xref>). An alternative perspective emerges from observations that cells in mature biofilms exhibit metabolic activity similar to cells in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waters et al., 2016</xref>), during which the rate of persister cell formation significantly surpasses that of cells in the exponential phase. This phenomenon is likely attributed to nutrient exhaustion in the local environment surrounding mature biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waters et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, some findings propose the involvement of specific genes in persister cell formation in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), many of these observations are derived from research conducted under planktonic (free-swimming) conditions with bulk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan and Bassler, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent research has shed light on the critical role of small metabolic molecules in regulating the formation and resuscitation of persister cells, including persister cells in biofilms, providing valuable insights into the complex mechanisms of bacterial persistence. Guanosine pentaphosphate and tetraphosphate ((p)ppGpp), key alarmones in the bacterial stringent response, have been shown to mediate ribosome dimerization, leading to persistence, while their degradation triggers resuscitation. This dual function of (p)ppGpp underscores its significance in both initiating and terminating the persister state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song and Wood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wood and Song, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wood et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the interaction between cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) has been identified as a crucial regulator of bacterial persistence. The cAMP-CRP complex acts as a global regulator, influencing persistence through modulation of cellular metabolism and regulation of stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niu et al., 2024</xref>). These molecular mechanisms offer a more nuanced understanding of persister cell dynamics.</p><p>Studying a biofilm during its early developmental stage offers a unique vantage point, minimizing the impact of dense structure or nutrient exhaustion, thus allowing for a controlled exploration of intrinsic factors influencing persister cell formation. Cell-surface adhesion is the critical initiation step in the early stage of biofilm development, encompassing both reversible and irreversible processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tolker-Nielsen, 2015</xref>). During reversible adhesion, planktonic bacteria utilize surface appendages such as flagella and pili, fostering a weak attachment through van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequently, these reversible adhered cells sense environmental cues linked to the surface, activating signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of 3’,5’-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP). Elevated c-di-GMP levels function as a secondary messenger, orchestrating a shift in bacterial behavior by influencing the expression of genes crucial to biofilm development. This signaling cascade propels the transition from reversible to irreversible adhesion, wherein bacteria establish microcolonies on the surface, solidifying a more stable and irreversible connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valentini and Filloux, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To explore the intrinsic factors influencing persister cell formation during the early stages of biofilm development, we employed a static biofilm system for our investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This system is widely employed in research to scrutinize the pivotal processes of initial adherence during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biswas and Mettlach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merritt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seviour et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sung et al., 2022</xref>). In our initial study, we noted an increased persister frequency coinciding with the step of cell adhesion. This observation prompted the hypothesis that elevated c-di-GMP levels in individual cells potentially facilitate the formation of persister cells within biofilms. Further investigation substantiated this hypothesis, demonstrating that the elevation in c-di-GMP indeed promotes the formation of persister cells. Our detailed analysis uncovered the role of c-di-GMP as an antitoxin, exerting control over both the expression and genotoxicity of HipH, thereby regulating genome stability and persister cell formation. These findings propose a biofilm-specific mechanism for antibiotic persistence. Notably, targeting this toxin-antitoxin system effectively inhibited drug tolerance in Uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) infections, presenting promising therapeutic strategies against chronic and relapsing infections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell adhesion promotes elevation of c-di-GMP levels and persister formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the static biofilm system designed to investigate intrinsic factors influencing persister cell formation during the early stages of biofilm development.

UPEC has a notable ability to form biofilms on various surfaces, including catheter materials, bladder epithelial cell walls, and within bladder cells (Supplementary Information). In our investigation, we selected the clinical isolate UPEC16. This strain demonstrates a significant phylogenetic similarity to established UPEC reference strains such as CFT073 and UTI89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, it displays sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics and possesses the capability for surface adhesion. To culture UPEC16 cells in the static biofilm system, exponential phase cells with an optical density (OD600) of 0.3 were diluted in 10-fold in fresh media, followed by static incubation in microtiter dishes for varying time intervals. Planktonic bacteria were then gently washed away, leaving adhered cells for further investigation. In the persister counting assay, both the remaining adhered cells and the removed planktonic cells were exposed to bactericidal antibiotics (ampicillin, 150 μg/ml, 10-fold of MIC) for varying durations. Subsequently, persister counting was conducted through plating.</p><p>Biphasic killing curves revealed distinct patterns. When cells were subjected to the same duration of static culture, the persister rate within the adhered population notably surpassed that observed in the planktonic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Additionally, the persister rate within adhered populations exhibited a positive correlation with the prolonged duration of static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In contrast, the persister rate within planktonic populations displayed little variation with an extended duration of static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). These observations underscore the crucial role of cell adhesion in promoting persister cell formation during the early stages of biofilm development. This raises questions about established ideas linking persister formation mainly with the dense structure of biofilms, suggesting a need to reconsider the factors that influence persister dynamics during biofilm initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The correlation between heightened c-di-GMP levels and increased persister frequency</title><p>The increase in c-di-GMP levels is a distinctive feature of cell-surface adhesion, marking the transition of cells from a planktonic lifestyle to a sessile one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valentini and Filloux, 2016</xref>). Building on our observations of increased persister rates upon cell adhesion, we assumed that elevated c-di-GMP levels might play a role in promoting persister cell formation. To investigate this hypothesis and discern the relationship between c-di-GMP levels and persister rates, we introduced a ratiometric fluorescent c-di-GMP sensing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vrabioiu and Berg, 2022</xref>) into the UPEC16 strain. MrkH is a transcription factor derived from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The system utilizes the conformational changes that occur in MrkH upon binding to c-di-GMP by strategically inserting it into mVenus<sup>NB</sup> between residues Y145 and N146, resulting in the creation of the biosensor referred to as mVenus<sup>NB</sup>-MrkH. This strategic integration results in a ratiometrically reduced fluorescence signal when the biosensor is bound to varying levels of c-di-GMP. Furthermore, a red fluorescent protein mScarlet-I is co-expressed under the regulation of the <italic>proC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2011</xref>), enabling the normalization of the system’s expression level. Consequently, the inverse of the ratio between mVenus<sup>NB</sup>-MrkH and mScarlet-I (R<sup>–1</sup>) exhibits a direct correlation with the intracellular level of c-di-GMP, establishing a reliable indicator for monitoring c-di-GMP dynamics in UPEC16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>By monitoring the fluorescent intensity of the system at the single-cell level under a time-lapse microscope, we observed the dynamic activation of c-di-GMP during the process of cell adhesion. We imaged subpopulations on the surface at varied intervals. In the initial 30 min following static incubation in microtiter dishes, the adhered subpopulation displayed a sharply peaked R<sup>–1</sup> distribution with a low median of 0.64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As the attachment duration increased to 2 hr, the R<sup>–1</sup> distribution broadened, accompanied by a higher median of 0.93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further extension to 3.5 hr resulted in a continued broadening of the R<sup>–1</sup> distribution, accompanied by an even higher median of 1.18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Meanwhile, the R<sup>–1</sup> distribution of the planktonic subpopulation from the same culture system and time points remained low, with a median of 0.31–0.35, repectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). These findings replicate the observed positive correlation between c-di-GMP production and attachment duration. Moreover, the results suggest a positive association between c-di-GMP levels and the persister rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>Microcolonies emerged on the surface of microtiter dishes when the duration of static culture extended to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We employed confocal laser scanning microscopy to monitor spatial distribution of c-di-GMP signals within these microcolonies. This investigation revealed a stratified pattern of c-di-GMP levels across the cross-section of the static biofilms (R<sup>–1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), highlighting the intricate regulatory role of this signaling molecule in shaping bacterial behavior and biofilm structure. Notably, cells with the highest c-di-GMP levels were surface attached, predominantly situated at the bottom layers of the biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further investigate this observation, we isolated the surface attached cells and unattached cells in the biofilms for persister counting assay. The results demonstrate that this spatial distribution aligned with a subpopulation that exhibited the highest persister rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we resuspended the cells within the static biofilms and used FACS to isolate subpopulations with varying levels of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). An antibiotic killing assay revealed that subpopulations with higher concentrations of c-di-GMP had a higher frequency of persister cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Time-lapse imaging also revealed that cells with high intracellular c-di-GMP levels survived antibiotic treatment and resuscitated to form microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that increased levels of cellular c-di-GMP play a crucial role in promoting persister formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Heightened c-di-GMP levels promotes persister formation</title><p>To investigate the involvement of c-di-GMP in promoting the transition of persister phenotype in biofilms, we first constructed a UPEC16 strain with the ability to degrade c-di-GMP in a controlled manner.

These results reinforce that elevated levels of c-di-GMP play a key role in promoting persister cell transition. To explore the mechanisms by which elevated c-di-GMP levels promote bacterial persister formation, we employed a systematic screening approach using the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio Knockout Collection (KEIO collection; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2006</xref>). Given that the K-12 strain, the background strain of the KEIO collection, might not be ideal for cell adhesion and biofilm formation, we initially introduced the pBAD::<italic>dgcZ</italic> construct into individual mutant strains. This allowed us to establish a background characterized by increased c-di-GMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Subsequently, persister counting assays were performed by exposing exponentially growing transformed strains to the antibiotic ampicillin at a concentration of 150 μg/ml for a duration of 3 hr, followed by plating. This experimental design allowed us to assess the impact of upregulated c-di-GMP on persister cell formation within specific genetic backgrounds. Results show that knocking out the toxin gene <italic>hipH</italic> significantly reduces the frequency of persister formation in the presence of high levels of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, the knockout of <italic>hipH</italic> alone does not lead to a significant alteration in persister frequency during the exponentially growing phase.

This manipulation resulted in a 2.72-fold and 4.22-fold increase in the mean of c-di-GMP R<sup>–1</sup> score, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Comparing to the strain overexpressing HipH alone, those strains co-overexpressing HipH and c-di-GMP exhibited a significantly recovered growth potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Specifically, 36 ± 6.7% of cells retained growth potential in the strain expressing HipH and DosC, while approximately 85 ± 18% retained growth potential in the strain expressing HipH and DgcZ. Further analyzing the portion of growth-inhibited cells revealed that the strain overexpressing HipH and DosC exhibited a decreased rate of VBNC cells (62 ± 6% of the total cell population) and dead cells (2.1 ± 0.2% of the total cell population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). The strain overexpressing HipH and DgcZ showed an even lower rate of VBNCs (14 ± 17% of the total cell population) and dead cells (1.5 ± 0.4% of the total cell population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). These results support the assumption that c-di-GMP acts as an effective antitoxin, enabling HipH-toxified cells to recover their growth potential. Consistently, increased rates of persister cells were observed, with 10^–2.8±0.19 in the strain overexpressing HipH and DosC, and 10^–2.5±0.34 in the strain overexpressing HipH and DgcZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). These results collectively indicate that c-di-GMP functions as an antitoxin in alleviating HipH’s harmful effects, steering cells from deep dormancy depth to a shallower dormancy state with enhanced resuscitation capabilities, thereby promoting persister cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hiph Is a Deoxyribonuclease Inducing Genome Instability</title><p><italic>hipH</italic> stands out as an atypical toxin gene due to its lack of a genetically linked antitoxin cognate, existing as a solitary gene unlike the typical toxin-antitoxin gene pairs found within the same operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jurėnas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>).

This concept introduces a layer of complexity that reshapes our understanding of drug tolerance in biofilms.

Past studies have predominantly focused on the general characteristics of persister cells and their role in biofilm resilience and antibiotic tolerance without specifically addressing the mechanistic link between adhesion and persister formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, previous work has shown that surface attachment leads to changes in metabolic activity and signaling pathways within bacterial cells, which could promote persistence, but it has not definitively established a causal relationship between adhesion and increased persister formation. Our study highlights that the elevation of c-di-GMP levels after surface adhesion triggers a cascade of physiological changes that significantly enhance the formation of persister cells. In particular, we report that adhesion-induced signaling pathways promote dormancy and tolerance to antibiotics, marking an important advancement from the previous understanding that treated persister cells might arise from random phenotypic variation during biofilm development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Noncanonical toxin-antitoxin systems involving with small metabolic molecules?</title><p>c-di-GMP emerges as a pivotal secondary messenger in the intricate orchestration of bacterial lifestyles, playing a key role in mediating cell-surface adhesion and exerting influence over the transition from planktonic to sessile existence. Our comprehensive exploration, employing a spectrum of techniques, brings to light a significant revelation: heightened levels of c-di-GMP in cells drive the formation of persisters. Notably, c-di-GMP functions as a noncanonical antitoxin, regulating both the expression and genotoxicity of the toxin protein HipH. This small molecule, composed of just two guanine bases, counteracts the toxin’s effects.</p><p>Another intriguing parallel to our findings can be drawn from the ppGpp-SpoT system, which exemplifies how small metabolic molecules can function in a manner reminiscent of traditional toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amato et al., 2013</xref>). At the core of this system is the synthesis and hydrolysis of ppGpp (guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate), modulating gene expression for stress adaptation. In this TA-like paradigm, ppGpp assumes the role of the ‘toxin’, while SpoT functions as the ‘antitoxin’. SpoT exhibits dual functionality, both synthesizing and degrading ppGpp in response to various stresses, thereby regulating the levels of this potent signaling molecule.</p><p>Both systems play crucial roles in bacterial stress adaptation and persistence regulation. The ppGpp-SpoT system employs ppGpp as a toxin-like molecule coordinating various physiological processes. In contrast, the HipH-c-di-GMP interaction involves c-di-GMP as an antitoxin-like molecule influencing persister cell formation by regulating HipH, a genome instability-inducing toxin. These systems expand the conceptual framework of TA systems. While traditional TA systems consist of genetically linked gene pairs encoding a toxin and its neutralizing antitoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jurėnas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srivastava et al., 2021</xref>), these new systems introduce additional complexities and nuances to our understanding of bacterial regulatory mechanisms. The involvement of metabolites like ppGpp and c-di-GMP in TA-like systems demonstrates the intricate interplay between cellular metabolism and stress response pathways. This integration allows bacteria to fine-tune their responses to environmental challenges with remarkable precision. Moreover, these systems underscore the evolutionary adaptability of bacteria, showcasing how they have co-opted metabolic molecules into sophisticated regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Novel functions of toxin protein HipH</title><p>HipH emerges as an intriguing toxin within the bacterial realm, standing apart due to its solitary existence without a genetically linked antitoxin cognate—an uncommon trait in known toxin-antitoxin systems. Previous studies have identified HipH as a Ser/Thr protein kinase, sharing homology with the well-characterized toxin HipA. These studies demonstrated its primary protein substrates to be the ribosomal protein RpmE (L31) and the carbon storage regulator CsrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gratani et al., 2023</xref>). While the overproduction of HipH was observed to impact bacterial DNA segregation and cell division, the underlying mechanism remained unexplained. In this study, we have uncovered that HipH primarily functions as a potent DNase, providing an explanation for the observed phenomenon. Our findings further reveal that that HipH, as a potent DNase, induces a deep cell dormancy depth and elevated rates of VBNC cells and dead cells, rather than persister cells with the capacity of resuscitation. Significantly, our investigation further sheds light on the regulation of HipH genotoxicity by c-di-GMP in a dual manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Firstly, high intracellular levels of c-di-GMP induce HipH expression. Subsequently, c-di-GMP acts as an antitoxin, mitigating the potent toxicity of HipH. This, in turn, maintains cells with an adequate dormancy depth, facilitating the formation of persister cells and conferring antibiotic tolerance. It is intriguing to delve deeper into research exploring the domain-function relationship in HipH. However, our efforts have often encountered challenges, as mutations can readily induce protein aggregates, impeding thorough analysis. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of this domain-function relationship necessitates the development of innovative methodologies and approaches.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the mechanism underlying c-di-GMP induced persister formation in biofilms.</title><p>In biofilms, cell-surface adhesion triggers an increase of intracellular c-di-GMP levels.

The resulting fusion fragments were then transformed into electrocompetent cells along with a recombineering helper plasmid, pSim6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2006</xref>). After a recovery period of 3–5 hr, the transformed cells were plated on selection plates containing the corresponding antibiotics. the antibiotic-selected recombinant colonies were subsequently validated through PCR analysis and sequencing.

Bacterial strains of interest were initially inoculated in a 3-to-5-ml culture in tubes and allowed to grow overnight. Subsequently, the stationary cultures were diluted 1:100 in the desired media and cultured until reaching the exponential phase with an OD600 of 0.3. Next, 2 ml of each diluted culture was transferred into a fresh microtiter dish (Biosharp, Cat#BS-20-GJM), which has not been undergo tissue culture treatment. In cases where the subsequent experiment involves imaging, it is necessary to ensure that the microtiter dish has a glass bottom. The plate was covered and incubated at optimal growth temperature for the desired amount of time. While the lids for the microtiter dishes are reusable, it is important to clean them with 70% (v/v) ethanol and allow them to air-dry prior to each experiment.</p><p>For cultures involving PdeH or DgcZ induction, it is important to statically incubate cells in microtiter dish for 2 hr at 37 °C first.

The cells were then plated for colony-forming unit (CFU) counting on LB plates before and after arabinose induction. The cells with growth potential were determined as the ratio of CFUs after arabinose induction to CFUs before arabinose induction. The dead cells ratio was assessed by staining with PI dye.

First, they set up a model to identify the increased persisters in the biofilm status.

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This preprint explores the involvement of cyclic di-GMP in genome stability and antibiotic persistence regulation in bacterial biofilms. The authors proposed a novel mechanism that, due to bacterial adhesion, increases c-di-GMP levels and influences persister formation through interaction with HipH. While the work may provide useful insights that could attract researchers in biofilm studies and persistence mechanisms, the main findings are inadequately supported and require further validation and refinement in experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank eLife for the through assessment of our manuscript. We appreciate the constructive criticism and see it as an opportunity to strengthen our research. In response to the reviewers' comments and suggestions, we have made significant improvements to our study. We have refined our experimental design and conducted additional experiments to provide more robust evidence supporting our findings. We believe that with these additional experiments and refinements, our study provides robust evidence for this novel mechanism, contributing significantly to the fields of biofilm research and bacterial persistence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors propose a UPEC TA system in which a metabolite, c-di-GMP, acts as the AT with the toxin HipH. The idea is novel, but several key ideas are missing in regard to the relevant literature, and the experimental design is flawed. Moreover, they are absolutely not studying persister cells as Figure 1b clearly shows they are merely studying dying cells since no plateau in killing (or anything close to a plateau) was reached. So in no way has persistence been linked to c-di-GMP. Moreover, I do not think the authors have shown how the c-di-GMP sensor works. Also, there is no evidence that c-di-GMP is an antitoxin as no binding to HipH has been shown. So at best, this is an indirect effect, not a new toxin/antitoxin system as for all 7 TAs, a direct link to the toxin has been demonstrated for antitoxins.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive comments on our manuscript. Your insights have prompted us to revisit our data and experimental design, leading to significant improvements in our study.</p><p>(1) Clarification on Persister Cell Detection: We sincerely appreciate your astute observation regarding the interpretation of our killing curve in Figure 1B. Upon careful re-examination, we concur that our initial methodology had limitations in revealing the characteristic biphasic pattern associated with persister cells. To address these limitations, we have implemented two key modifications: shortening the sampling interval and extending the antibiotic treatment duration. These adjustments have resulted in an updated killing curve that now exhibits a more pronounced biphasic pattern and a prominent plateau in the late stage of killing, as illustrated in Response Figure 1. This refined pattern aligns with established characteristics of persister cell behavior in antibiotic tolerance studies, providing a more accurate representation of the persister population dynamics in our experimental system. We believe these methodological enhancements significantly improve the reliability and interpretability of our results, offering a clearer insight into the persister cell phenomenon under investigation.</p><p>(2) Validation of c-di-GMP Sensor: We appreciate your point about the c-di-GMP sensor. The c-di-GMP sensor, developed by Howard C. Berg's team, is specifically designed to detect relative intracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP in <italic>Escherichia coli cells</italic>. This capability is crucial for understanding the dynamic regulation of c-di-GMP during bacterial responses to environmental stimuli. We have expanded our explanation of the sensor's detection mechanism in lines 138-146 of the manuscript, detailing how it functions to reflect changes in c-di-GMP levels within the cells accurately. The mechanism operates through a series of signaling events that are initiated when c-di-GMP binds to the sensor, leading to measurable outputs that correlate with intracellular concentrations. Additionally, we have provided a schematic chart in Figure S1B to visually support our description regarding the sensor. This figure demonstrates the sensor's responsiveness and specificity in detecting fluctuations in c-di-GMP levels, effectively linking the signaling molecule to cellular behavior. We hope these additions clarify the role of the c-di-GMP sensor in our research and address your concerns regarding its functionality.</p><p>(3) HipH and c-di-GMP Interaction: Our pull-down experiments presented in Figure 5A-E provide robust and compelling evidence for a direct physical interaction between HipH and c-di-GMP, and the effects of their interaction reminiscent of toxin-antitoxin systems. Yet we acknowledge c-di-GMP is not a traditional antitoxin since it is not genetically linked to HipH. We have revised our terminology to &quot;TA-like system&quot; to reflect this difference more accurately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) L 53: biofilm persisters are no different than any other persisters (there is no credible evidence of any different persister cells) so this reviewer suggests changing 'biofilm persisters' to 'persisters' throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful consideration. Upon careful consideration of the current scientific literature, we agree that there is no substantial evidence supporting a distinct category of persister cells specific to biofilms. We have systematically replaced 'biofilm persisters' with 'persisters' throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) L 51: persister cells do not mutate and, once resuscitated, mutate like any other growing cell so this sentence should be deleted as it promotes an unnecessary myth about persistence.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your astute observation regarding the inaccuracy in line 51. We have removed the sentence in question from line 51. And we also have thoroughly reviewed the entire manuscript to ensure no similar misconceptions are present elsewhere in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) L 69: please include the only metabolic model for persister cell formation and resuscitation here based on single cells (e.g., doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.102 , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.100792); otherwise, you write as if there are no molecular mechanisms for persistence/resuscitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We appreciate the opportunity to enhance the scientific context of our manuscript. We have added a brief explanation of how ppGpp mediates ribosome dimerization, leading to persistence, and how its degradation triggers resuscitation [1-3] (lines 68-74). We have described the role of cAMP-CRP in regulating persistence through its effects on metabolism and stress responses [4, 5] (lines 74-78). We also explore potential interactions or synergies between our proposed mechanisms and these established metabolic models [6] (lines 383-409). We believe this revision significantly enhances our manuscript by providing a more accurate representation of the current state of knowledge in the field and demonstrating how our work builds upon and contributes to existing models of bacterial persistence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should cite in the Intro or Discussion that others have proposed similar novel TAs including a ppGpp metabolic toxin paired with an enzymatic antitoxin SpoT that hydrolyzes the toxin (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.002).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for your expertise in pointing out this crucial reference. We sincerely appreciate your suggestion to include the reference to previously proposed novel toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, particularly the ppGpp-SpoT system [6]. In light of this reference, we have expanded our discussion to include: (1) A brief overview of the ppGpp-SpoT system as a novel TA-like mechanism. (2) Comparisons between the ppGpp-SpoT system and our findings on the HipH-c-di-GMP interaction. (3) Reflections on how these systems challenge and expand traditional definitions of TA systems (lines 383-409). We believe this addition significantly enhances the context and strengthens the rationale for considering the HipH-c-di-GMP interaction as a TA-like system. Thank you for your valuable input in helping us situate our research within the broader landscape of TA system biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 1b: there are no results in this paper related to persister cells. Figure 1b simply shows dying cells were enumerated. Hence, the population of stressed cells increased, not 'persister cells' (Figure 1f), in the course of these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your astute observation regarding the interpretation of our killing curve in Figure 1B. Upon careful re-examination, we concur that our initial methodology had limitations in revealing the characteristic biphasic pattern associated with persister cells. To address these limitations, we have implemented (1) Shortened sampling interval: We have reduced the interval between measurements to one hour. (2) Extended sampling duration: The total duration of sampling has been increased to 6 hours (Response Figure 1). The updated killing curve now exhibits a more pronounced biphasic pattern and a prominent plateau in the late stage of killing: (1) Initial rapid decline: From 0-1hours, we observe a steep decrease in bacterial survival (slope ≈ -3~-1.8); (2) Slower decline phase: From 4.5-6 hours, the rate of decline is markedly reduced (slope ≈ -0.17~-0.06). This pattern aligns more closely with established characteristics of persister cell behavior in antibiotic tolerance studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure S1: I see no evidence that the authors have shown this c-di-GMP detects different c-di-GMP levels since there appears to be no data related to varying c-di-GMP concentrations with a consistent decrease. Instead, there is a maximum. What are the concentration of c-di-GMP on the X-axis for panels C, D, and E? How were c-di-GMP levels varied such that you know the c-di-GMP concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your point about the c-di-GMP sensor. To address this, we have included additional data on the sensor's mechanism and validation. The sensor, developed by Howard C. Berg's team, is designed for detecting intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations in <italic>E. coli</italic> [7].</p><p>Sensor Design and Mechanism：The sensor developed for detecting c-di-GMP levels in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells is based on a single fluorescent protein biosensor. The protein includes a Fluorescent Protein Base and a c-di-GMP Binding Domain. The fluorescent protein base is mVenusNB, which is the fastest-folding yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The c-di-GMP binding domain is the MrkH protein is inserted between Y145 and N146 of mVenusNB. MrkH is a transcription factor with a high affinity for c-di-GMP. When MrkH binds to c-di-GMP, it undergoes a significant conformational change. The amino-terminal domain of MrkH rotates 138° relative to its carboxyl-terminal domain upon c-di-GMP binding.This rotation disrupts the mVenusNB chromophore environment, resulting in reduced fluorescence. The sensor system co-expresses mScarletI, a bright, rapidly folding red fluorescent protein. mScarletI serves as a reference for ratiometric measurements. Such design allows for ratiometric measurement of real-time monitoring of c-di-GMP levels in individual cells and control of variations in protein expression levels between cells. This enables the observation of dynamic changes in c-di-GMP concentration, such as the increase seen after <italic>E. coli</italic> surface attachment.</p><p>Functioning and Accuracy: The sensor is designed to detect c-di-GMP in the 100 to 700 nM range, which is the physiological range in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The use of a low copy plasmid for expression ensures detection at low concentrations. The ratio (R) of mVenusNB to mScarletI fluorescence emission is measured for individual cells. The sensor shows at least a twofold dynamic range between low and high c-di-GMP conditions. Cells with low c-di-GMP (expressing phosphodiesterase PdeH) show higher R values compared to cells with high c-di-GMP (expressing constitutively active diguanylate cyclase WspR:D70E). A mutant biosensor (Sensor*) with the R113A mutation in MrkH is used as a control. This mutation eliminates c-di-GMP binding ability, allowing differentiation between specific c-di-GMP effects and other cellular changes.</p><p>This biosensor system provides a sophisticated tool for visualizing and quantifying c-di-GMP levels in individual bacterial cells with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. By combining a c-di-GMP-sensitive fluorescent protein with a reference fluorescent protein and utilizing ratiometric analysis, the system can accurately reflect changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels while controlling for other cellular variables.</p><p>We have expanded our explanation of its detection mechanism in lines 138-146 and Figure S1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The viable portion of the VBNC population are persister cells so there is no reason to use VBNC as a separate term. Please see the reported errors often made with nucleic acid staining dyes in regard to VBNCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the distinction between VBNC cells and persister cells in our manuscript. It is essential to recognize that VBNC cells and persister cells represent two fundamentally different states of bacterial dormancy. While both may exhibit viability under certain conditions, persister cells are characterized by their ability to resuscitate and grow when environmental conditions become favorable [8]. In contrast, VBNC cells are in a deep dormant state where they cannot be revived through normal culture conditions [9, 10]. This distinction is critical for accurately representing bacterial survival strategies and population dynamics, which is why we maintain the use of the term VBNC separately from persister cells. We have added related references in lines 259.</p><p>Regarding the reported errors associated with nucleic acid staining dyes for identifying VBNC cells, we acknowledge that these methods can exhibit limitations. Specifically, nucleic acid stains may fail to reliably differentiate between metabolically active and inactive cells, leading to inaccuracies in quantifying the true VBNC population [11]. In our study, we have opted to utilize propidium iodide (PI) staining to assess cell viability more accurately, as it effectively distinguishes dead cells from viable cells based on membrane integrity [12]. By employing this methodology, we ensure a more precise estimation of the VBNC proportion without conflating it with persister cell dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hebin et al reported a fascinating story about antibiotic persistence in the biofilms.

We did not screen the entire <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio Knockout Collection. Our approach was more targeted, focusing on mutants relevant to enzyme activity regulation. We selected specific mutants based on their potential involvement in c-di-GMP-mediated regulatory pathways. This focused approach allowed us to efficiently identify candidates likely to be involved in persister formation. Among the screened mutants, HipH emerged as a significant hit. Its identification was particularly noteworthy due to its known role in persister formation and its potential as a regulatory target of c-di-GMP. We acknowledge that our targeted approach may have overlooked other potential candidates. We are considering a more comprehensive screening approach in future studies to identify additional targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Since the story is complicated, a diagrammatic picture might be needed to illustrate the whole story.

In response to your suggestion, we have added Response Figure 2 (Fig. 6 in revised manuscript, lines 976-981) to our manuscript. This new figure provides a comprehensive visual summary of the key processes and mechanisms uncovered in our study. This graphic summary provides a clear overview of the interconnected nature of surface adhesion, c-di-GMP signaling, and HipH regulation. It also highlights the complex role of c-di-GMP in persister formation and offers readers a visual aid to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying our findings.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your thoughtful comment regarding the title and its reflection of the study's novelty.

We acknowledge the importance of proper citation to support our conclusions and provide context for our work. In response to your comment, we have conducted a comprehensive review of our manuscript and have significantly enhanced our referencing throughout. We have added appropriate citations to support each key statement and conclusion presented in our study. These additional references provide a robust foundation for our findings and place our work within the broader context of the field. The complete list of all references, including the newly added ones, can be found at the end of this response letter as well as in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The novelty of this study should be clearly written and compared with previous references. For example, is it the first study to report the mechanism that the adhesion of bacteria to the surface leads to increased persister formation?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the opportunity to highlight and elaborate the novelty of our research. This study provides novel insights into the relationship between bacterial adhesion to surfaces and the subsequent increase in persister cell formation, which has not been explicitly detailed in previous literature. While existing research has established that biofilms typically harbor higher numbers of persister cells, this investigation not only corroborates that finding but also elucidates the mechanisms through which surface adhesion contributes to this phenomenon.</p><p>Past studies have predominantly focused on the general characteristics of persister cells and their role in biofilm resilience and antibiotic tolerance without specifically addressing the mechanistic link between adhesion and persister formation [13, 14]. For instance, previous work has shown that surface attachment leads to changes in metabolic activity and signaling pathways within bacterial cells, which could promote persistence, but it has not definitively established a causal relationship between adhesion and increased persister formation. Our study highlights that the elevation of cyclic di-GMP levels after surface adhesion triggers a cascade of physiological changes that significantly enhance the formation of persister cells. In particular, we report that adhesion-induced signaling pathways promote dormancy and tolerance to antibiotics, marking an important advancement from the previous understanding that treated persister cells might arise from random phenotypic variation during biofilm development. we have expanded our discussion in lines 366-381.</p><p>In summary, we believe this study stands as one of the first to clearly delineate the mechanism by which bacterial adhesion leads to increased persister formation, providing a valuable contribution to the current understanding of bacterial persistence and biofilm ecology. Thus, we can assert that our findings are not only novel but also essential for informing future research and therapeutic strategies aimed at managing bacterial infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) in vitro DNA cleavage assay. Why not use bacterial genomic DNA to test the cleaving of HipH on the bacterial genome?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback regarding our experimental approach. The decision of not directly using genomic DNA in our experiments was made after careful consideration. The high molecular weight of genomic DNA, which presents significant challenges in handling and analysis. The difficulty in extracting intact genomic DNA, which could potentially compromise the integrity of our results. The challenges associated with electrophoretic separation of such large DNA molecules, which could limit our ability to accurately interpret the data.</p><p>Instead, following established practices in molecular biology research and drawing from similar studies in the field [15-17], we opted to use plasmids as model DNA for our experiments. This approach offers several advantages: Plasmids are smaller and more manageable, making them easier to manipulate in laboratory conditions; They can be more readily extracted in intact form, ensuring the quality of our experimental material; Plasmid DNA is more amenable to electrophoretic separation, allowing for clearer and more precise analysis. Despite their smaller size, plasmids retain many of the key characteristics of genomic DNA that are relevant to our study. We believe this approach provides a robust and reliable model for our research while overcoming the practical limitations associated with genomic DNA. It allows us to investigate the fundamental principles we're interested in, while maintaining experimental feasibility and data integrity. We have added related references in lines 314 and 599.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) C-di-GMP -HipH is not a TA, it does not fit in the definition of the TA systems.

We have revised the formatting throughout the main text by using a single blank line to separate paragraphs, without indentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) L 77: need to define 'c-di-GMP' without using another abbreviation; please write '3,5-cyclic diguanylic acid', etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the proper introduction of abbreviations in our manuscript. We have revised line 86 to introduce the full name of c-di-GMP as &quot;3,5-cyclic diguanylic acid&quot;. Following this initial introduction, we consistently use the abbreviation &quot;c-di-GMP&quot; throughout the rest of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a fascinating story, but the title and the manuscript need careful revision to make it more clear.
