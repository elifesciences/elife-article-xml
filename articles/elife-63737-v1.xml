dendrites of the principal glutamatergic mitral cells (MCs) form reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with large spines on GABAergic granule cells (GC), where unitary release of glutamate can trigger postsynaptic local activation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>-channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s), that is a spine spike. Can such single MC input evoke reciprocal release? We find that unitary-like activation via two-photon uncaging of glutamate causes GC spines to release GABA both synchronously and asynchronously onto MC dendrites. This release indeed requires activation of Na<sub>v</sub>s and high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (HVACCs), but also of NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Simulations show temporally overlapping HVACC- and NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents during the spine spike, and ultrastructural data prove NMDAR presence within the GABAergic presynapse. This cooperative action of presynaptic NMDARs allows to implement synapse-specific, activity-dependent lateral inhibition, and thus could provide an efficient solution to combinatorial percept synthesis in a sensory system with many receptor channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>reciprocal synapse</kwd><kwd>presynaptic NMDA receptor</kwd><kwd>mitral cell</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ1104/01GQ1502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egger</surname><given-names>Veronica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1479-418.13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egger</surname><given-names>Veronica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Graduate School of Systemic Neurosciences GSN-LMU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG SFB 870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egger</surname><given-names>Veronica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>682426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rózsa</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP_2.1.1-15-2016-00979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rózsa</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VKSZ_14-1-2015-0155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rózsa</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>712821-NEURAM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rózsa</surname><given-names>Balázs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The essential role of presynaptic NMDA receptors for granule cell GABAergic output elucidates the function of reciprocal spines in recurrent and possibly lateral inhibition of mitral cells during olfactory processsing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reciprocal dendrodendritic microcircuits can be found in several parts of the nervous system and are especially abundant in the vertebrate olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crespo et al., 2013</xref>), where the dendrites of the principal mitral and tufted cells (MTCs) engage in such interactions with several major subtypes of local GABAergic neurons. In the glomerular layer, the MTC apical tuft is reciprocally connected to mostly periglomerular cell dendrites. In the external plexiform layer, the long MC lateral dendrites are densely covered with GABAergic synapses that mostly originate from reciprocal arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sailor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuno et al., 2017</xref>). While proximal circuits are thought to be mostly formed by granule cell (GC) spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyamichi et al., 2013</xref>), there are also reciprocal dendrodendritic interactions with other GABAergic cell types such as SOM+ neurons, CRH+ neurons and most prominently parvalbumin/PV+ neurons that all feature aspiny, smooth dendrites (partially overlapping populations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lepousez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyamichi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the MC-GC synapse differs from the other bulbar reciprocal arrangements by its location within a large spine on the GC side. These spines feature particularly long necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woolf et al., 1991</xref>), which might serve to electrically isolate the synapse and boost local processing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spruston, 2008</xref>). Indeed, we have gathered evidence that unitary postsynaptic potentials in GC spines are electrically compartmentalized and thus can locally activate voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>-channels (Na<sub>v</sub>s), which in turn activate classic presynaptic high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels (HVACCs) within the spine (‘spine spike’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the reciprocal spine might operate as a mini-neuron that can generate synaptic output upon local activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Egger and Urban, 2006</xref>).</p><p>While there have been many earlier studies of recurrent dendrodendritic inhibition at the MTC-GC synapse, it is so far unknown whether a unitary, purely local activation of the spine’s microcircuit can indeed trigger release of GABA back onto the exciting MTC. The issue is still unresolved for two reasons:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Most earlier studies used a strong stimulation of voltage-clamped MCs, namely a depolarization to 0 mV for 20–50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halabisky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). This protocol will cause massive release of glutamate from the lateral MC dendrites, invoking glutamate spillover between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Isaacson, 1999</xref>) and resulting in long-lasting recurrent inhibition of MCs with both synchronous and asynchronous components, the latter with a time constant of ∼ 500 ms. Under these circumstances and zero extracellular [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> GC NMDA receptors (NMDAR) were shown to provide postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sufficient to trigger release of GABA from the GC spine (also in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoppa et al., 1998</xref>). However, in normal [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> GABA release was mostly abolished by HVACC blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>; see Discussion).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In spite of these functional demonstrations of recurrent inhibition and of substantial ultrastructural evidence that GC spines onto MCs are usually reciprocal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Price and Powell, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackowski et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woolf et al., 1991</xref>), functional connectivity between individual GCs and MCs has remained elusive: no reciprocal connectivity was reported from paired recordings of MCs coupled to GCs so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pressler and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>) and others including our group have been unable to find connected GC → MC pairs in the first place (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schoppa, 2006</xref>). This puzzling observation indicates that paired recordings are not a suitable tool to investigate reciprocal release of GABA.</p></list-item></list><p>Here, we aim to determine whether – and possibly how - single inputs from MC lateral dendrites to single GC spines can also trigger recurrent release of GABA from the reciprocal synapse, using recordings from fluorescently labeled MCs and two-photon uncaging (TPU) of glutamate along their lateral dendrite near Venus-tagged GC spines. TPU of glutamate allows to study the operational mechanisms of the reciprocal microcircuit in single GC spines without causing broader GC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this study, we use TPU at GC spines to investigate the reciprocal output by the GABAergic release machinery via recording of IPSCs in mitral cells (MCs). Thus, processing within a single spine can be disentangled in space and time from extended activation, in order to test the main predictions from our previous study: The mini-neuron hypothesis along with the GC spine spike phenomenon suggest that, just like in conventional axons, Na<sub>v</sub> and ensuing HVACC activation are required to cause release, and that unitary activation of the spine is sufficient for triggering release.</p><p>While this concept is validated here, our study also reveals that presynaptic NMDARs gate reciprocal output at the single-spine level. What is the advantage of such an arrangement compared to classical neuronal processing? In olfactory coding, a large number of input channels needs to be combined to synthesize an olfactory percept (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mori et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy, 2011</xref>). We propose that the mechanisms revealed here can explain the conspicuous apparent lack of functional reciprocal connectivity mentioned above and, more importantly, might allow reciprocal GC spines to play a central role in the efficient binding of changing sets of activated input channels and their glomerular columns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental configuration</title><p>To enable pharmacological interference with components of the reciprocal microcircuit such as Na<sub>v</sub>s and HVACCs, we bypassed release from the MC presynapse via TPU of DNI-caged glutamate (DNI, see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiovini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pálfi et al., 2018</xref>) in acute juvenile rat olfactory bulb slices, while recording from MCs in somatic whole-cell voltage-clamp.

We used this paradigm to test whether NMDAR blockade alone could interfere with recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

This finding implies that on both sides of the dendrodendritic synaptic arrangement the postsynaptic specialization very often merges with presynaptic release sites without interposition of non-synaptic membrane domains, and that therefore on the GC side postsynaptic NMDARs can be located very closely to the GABAergic presynapse.</p><p>Immunogold labeling for NMDARs was also frequently observed in symmetric contacts, albeit at a lesser density compared to asymmetric contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To establish whether there is an increased likelihood for the presence of NMDARs at symmetric contacts vs extrasynaptic profiles, we compared the densities of labeling in non-synaptic membrane segments of GC spines with those in symmetric synapses, and as a control in asymmetric synapses. GC spines establishing synapses with MC dendrites were selected as described (see Materials and methods) and all discernible membrane segments within a spine were analyzed. For GluN1, there were 50 particles along 84.5 µm of 138 non-synaptic spine membrane segments (mean 0.6 particles/µm), 70 particles along 32.7 µm of 120 symmetric profiles (mean 2.1 particles/µm) and 394 particles along 28.6 µm of 111 asymmetric profiles (mean 13.8 particles/µm). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the density distributions across the three types of membrane segments. The distribution of the density of gold particles at symmetric synapses was significantly higher than the one in non-synaptic membrane (p=0.000029, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). For GluN2A/B, the sample size was smaller, with 5 particles along 10.0 µm of 24 non-synaptic spine membrane segments (mean 0.5 particles/µm), 89 particles along 14.0 µm of 46 symmetric profiles (mean 6.4 particles/µm) and 96 particles along 6.1 µm of 25 asymmetric profiles (mean 15.7 particles/µm). Still, the density distribution at symmetric synapses was significantly higher than the distribution at the non-synaptic membrane (p=0.000048).</p><p>Interestingly, while the labeling densities for GluN1 and GluN2A/B were similar across non-synaptic membranes and asymmetric synapses each (p=0.99 and p=0.81, respectively), labeling of symmetric synapses was considerably stronger for GluN2A/B vs GluN1 (p=0.00042). This difference might be due to a distinct receptor configuration and/or a better accessibility of the GluN2 epitopes in the presynaptic symmetric membrane.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the radial distribution of particles across synaptic profiles for both antibodies to establish whether labeling was predominantly associated with either the GC or the MC membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; see Materials and methods). The distribution of both GluN1 and GluN2A/B label at asymmetric synapses was similar, with a main peak just inside the postsynaptic GC membrane and another peak within the synaptic cleft. Only a few gold particles were localized beyond 20 nm on the MC side, suggesting that NMDARs are not expressed at significant levels at the glutamate release sites on the MC membrane. Notably, the distribution of gold particles at symmetric synapses mirrored the one at asymmetric synapses, implying that labeling for NMDARs is predominantly associated with both the presynaptic GABAergic and the postsynaptic glutamatergic membrane of GCs.</p><p>In summary, we conclude from the combined physiological, computational and ultrastructural evidence that NMDARs do play a direct presynaptic role for GABA release from the reciprocal spine, albeit in cooperation with the spine spike, and propose that this cooperation could be mediated by overlapping NMDAR- and HVACC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A direct consequence of this conclusion is that any inhibitory output from a GC spine will require the presence of glutamate and thus synaptic input to the respective spine (except perhaps for GC action potential bursts), with far-ranging implications for the role of GC-mediated lateral inhibition in early olfactory processing (see Discussion).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cooperative release of GABA from the granule cell reciprocal spine.</title><p>Depolarizing currents are indicated by black solid arrows and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by green solid arrows. Upon release of glutamate from the mitral cell dendrite, AMPARs get activated, leading to depolarization of the spine, then activation of both post- and presynaptic NMDARs and Na<sub>v</sub>s.

As in classical axonal release, sequential Na<sub>v</sub> channel and HVACC activation triggers output, which occurs on both fast and slow time scales. Strikingly, however, presynaptic NMDA receptors are also found to play a role for GABA release.

The rather low P<sub>r_GABA</sub> observed here also implies that GC spines are likely to release with higher probabilities upon coincident non-local GC signaling (i.e. regional or global Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> spikes), due to substantially increased ∆Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the spine as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aghvami et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mueller and Egger, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we predict such coincident non-local activity to boost both recurrent and lateral inhibition.</p><p>As to the minimal latency for recurrent GABA release, the temporal resolution of our experiments is limited by the uncaging laser pulse duration (1 ms) and by the unknown exact time course V<sub>m</sub>(t)<sub>SPINE</sub> of the spine spike. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows that the fastest urIPSCs were detected within 2 ms from TPU onset, implying that there is a fast mechanism coupling Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to release - in line with earlier findings of tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and GABA release (using EGTA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>), and of a crucial role for Na<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunes and Kuner, 2018</xref>) – as also indicated by our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>While ~30% of urIPSCs occurred within 10 ms post TPU onset, there was a substantial fraction with longer latencies in the range of 10–30 ms and a few with even larger delays (which might also correspond to false positives of our detection method). Again, since V<sub>m</sub>(t)<sub>SPINE</sub> is unknown, we cannot determine to what extent these urIPSCs were actually asynchronous (if defined as release events that happen later than the fast coupling of HVA presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents to the release machinery, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>). In any case, substantial asynchronous release from the GC spine on yet longer time scales (detected at up to 500 ms post TPU) was frequently observed, in line with earlier studies on recurrent inhibition that localized the origin of asynchronous signaling within GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoppa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>). This time course of asynchronous release also matches with the duration of physiological postsynaptic GC spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ona Jodar et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the microcircuit can operate across a wide range of latencies, which might contribute to glomerulus-specific GC global AP firing latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapoor and Urban, 2006</xref>), and also can generate combined synchronous and asynchronous output.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Na<sub>v</sub>-mediated and NMDAR-mediated contributions to release</title><p>How is postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry coupled to release of GABA within the GC spine? Previously we had shown via occlusion experiments that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via NMDARs occurs independently from Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by the Na<sub>v</sub>-HVACC pathway, since AMPAR-mediated depolarization on its own is strong enough to lift the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block, probably due to boosting by the high GC spine neck resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we initially hypothesized that the Na<sub>v</sub>-HVACC pathway would provide the sole trigger for fast release of GABA, as in classical release from axons (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunes and Kuner, 2018</xref>), validating the notion of the GC spine as an independent mini-neuron that can generate output via its own local AP. Indeed, blockade of either Na<sub>v</sub> or HVACCs strongly reduced or abolished urIPSCs. However, in subsequent experiments probing NMDAR contribution we observed that urIPSCs were also massively reduced by blockade of NMDARs.</p><p>As a note of caution, activation of single GC spines via TPU might involve spurious activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs. We had observed that TPU resulted in a slightly larger NMDA-receptor-mediated component of the postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal than true synaptic activation via glomerular stimulation (~65% vs ~50% of ∆F/F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egger et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, at least part of the strong impact of NMDARs observed here might have been rooted in their over-activation. Therefore, we investigated recurrent inhibition elicited by single MC APs, and could demonstrate that NMDAR blockade alone (which does not prevent GC spine spike generation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>) also reduces recurrent inhibition. This effect was found to be mutually occlusive with the effect of GABA<sub>A</sub>R blockade, arguing again in favor of an essential role of NMDARs for GABA release and against systematic overstimulation in the TPU experiments (see also Results, Materials and methods).</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the strong influence of NMDARs on GC output is that this property might serve to differentiate the MC↔GC microcircuit from the MC↔PV+ cell microcircuit, since PV+ cells feature Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs and a probably absent NMDAR component in response to MTC input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kato et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the urIPSC blockade by APV observed here further argues in favor of a preferential activation of the MC↔GC circuit by our experimental method.</p><p>In our earlier study of TPU-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in GC spines there was no obvious influence of Na<sub>v</sub> activation on NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bywalez et al., 2015</xref>). At first, this finding might seem at variance with the simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that demonstrate a boosting of early NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents by the spine spike. However, the simulations also indicate that this extra contribution is not substantial in terms of added ∆F/F under our experimental conditions and therefore could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In line with the fast NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikelet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kampa et al., 2004</xref> have shown that the earlier the postsynaptic membrane is depolarized after glutamate release, the more efficiently NMDARs will be activated. These observations are of general importance in the context of spike-timing dependent plasticity and electrical compartmentalization of spines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grunditz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tønnesen and Nägerl, 2016</xref>).</p><p>How exactly do NMDARs now effect release? The Na<sub>v</sub>/NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikelet results in substantial and fast coincident activation of NMDARs and HVACCs, and our ultrastructural evidence for presynaptic NMDARs implies that indeed these currents can feed into the same presynaptic microdomain (see Results). This overlap bonus at the presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (as predicted by the simulations) could thus explain the observed cooperative signaling of HVACCs and NMDARs; further investigations are required to consolidate or replace this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Direct involvement of presynaptic NMDARs in GABA release</title><p>Presynaptic actions of NMDARs at specific subsets of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses have recently received attention (reviewed <italic>in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>). Presynaptic NMDARs have been shown to play a role in plasticity induction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duguid and Smart, 2004</xref>) or in modulation of basal synaptic transmission, where effects are mostly observed upon repetitive transmitter release (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>). In the cerebellum, presynaptic NMDARs are also involved in enhancing spontaneous release of GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glitsch and Marty, 1999</xref>), with similar observations for extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on retinal A17 amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Veruki et al., 2019</xref>). However, to our knowledge direct triggering of release via presynaptic NMDARs during unitary transmission has not been observed so far, adding another pathway to the already highly diverse signaling downstream of NMDARs.</p><p>The observed cooperation between Na<sub>v</sub>/HVACCs and NMDARs relates our study back to the initial studies on dendrodendritic recurrent inhibition (DDI), when it was concluded by several groups that NMDARs can contribute directly to release from the reciprocal spine upon extended release of glutamate from the MC dendrite (see Introduction), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoppa et al., 1998</xref> already speculated that this presynaptic function might be related to either Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry or depolarization. However, the relative contribution of NMDARs has been under debate and it was demonstrated that under physiological conditions HVACC activation would be the dominant release trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isaacson, 2001</xref>). While the standard DDI protocol, using 20–50 ms long depolarizations, would evoke recurrent inhibition also in the presence of TTX (possibly even enhanced, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halabisky et al., 2000</xref>), it was reported that recurrent inhibition in response to shorter steps (&lt;5 ms) is substantially smaller than for the long step and reduced in TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoppa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halabisky et al., 2000</xref>). In view of our above results, the standard DDI protocol is likely to recruit NMDAR-dependent pathways for triggering GABA release via prolonged release of glutamate and subsequent summation of EPSPs in GC spines, whereas short steps are more likely to trigger release via the GC spine spike. Thus, the cooperation of NMDARs and HVACCs reconciles these earlier findings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reciprocal inhibition and spontaneous inhibitory activity</title><p>Spontaneous IPSCs are likely to predominantly originate from the more proximal lateral MC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnson and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>).

All three antagonists of urIPSC generation (TTX, CTX, APV) were found to also substantially reduce sIPSC frequency, which might imply that their effects on urIPSCs were due to a general reduction in excitability or network effects. However, none of the antagonists affected sIPSC amplitude or reduced sIPSC frequency in a manner correlated with their effects on the evoked urIPSCs, and similar effects on spontaneous activity were also reported elsewhere. Na<sub>v</sub> blockade was already shown to strongly reduce MC sIPSC frequencies but not amplitude (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saghatelyan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnson and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>), which is to be expected because of the blockade of both spontaneous MC firing and the GC spine spike.

Several factors might contribute: (1) the long-lasting depolarizations in MCs that are enhanced by NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al., 2000</xref>), (2) the presence of MC NMDA autoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Isaacson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sassoè-Pognetto et al., 2003</xref>), (3) the crucial role of NMDARs for reciprocal release from the GC spine reported here, thus any spontaneous release of glutamate from MCs is unlikely to trigger recurrent IPSCs in the presence of APV.

Therefore, any type of non-local GC AP is rather unlikely to cause release of GABA by itself. This consequence explains the lack of functional evidence for GC → MC transmission in coupled MC → GC pairs, because APs elicited in the GC will not result in GABA release and thus no inhibition will be exerted on the coupled MC (see Introduction).It should be noted that extracellular stimulation of the GC layer can elicit MC inhibition, even in the presence of APV (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egger et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arevian et al., 2008</xref>). Possible explanations might involve either a small remaining probability for GABA release from spiking GCs in the absence of glutamate or that this type of stimulation activates some as of yet unknown inhibitory input to MCs, for example via deep short-axon cells or axons of EPL interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nagayama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton, 2017</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Role of GC-mediated lateral inhibition between MCs.It is known by now that broad, far-range lateral inhibition between MCs within the EPL is mediated by other interneurons than GCs (see Introduction).

What then is the function of GC-mediated lateral inhibition?As a consequence of the requirement of presynaptic NMDAR activation, we predict that there will be no or at best very little GC-mediated lateral inhibition upon activation of a single glomerular column, even if some columnar GCs fire APs or dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (which is fairly likely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mueller and Egger, 2020</xref>). We propose that GC-mediated lateral inhibition happens predominantly across coactive columns. Thus the discovered mechanism would allow GCs to perform lateral inhibition ‘on demand’, selectively on co-active MCs, providing directed, dynamically switched lateral inhibition in a sensory system with large numbers of receptor channels. GC-mediated lateral inhibition might therefore participate in synthesizing the olfactory percept at the level of the bulb from the individual active olfactory receptor channels, most likely via MC synchronization in the gamma band (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laurent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kashiwadani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schoppa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peace et al., 2017</xref>), while at the same time preventing unnecessary energy expenditure (i.e. if GABA release would happen from all reciprocal spines of an activated GC). More importantly, inactive columns will remain sensitive for new stimuli or changing components because they are not inhibited by active columns.</p></list-item></list><p>There is substantial prior evidence in the literature for both the activity-dependence and NMDAR-dependence of GC-mediated lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arevian et al., 2008</xref>). NMDAR blockade is routinely used to dissect lateral inhibition in the glomerular layer from GC-mediated lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Najac et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geramita and Urban, 2017</xref>). Yet more importantly, in in vivo MC recordings there was a subset of MCs that responded exclusively with inhibition to odor activation, mediated via glomerular layer neurons but not via GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>, their Figures 4 and 7). Since there was no odor-evoked activity in these MCs, our results imply that the presynaptic GC NMDARs could not be activated, preventing GABA release from GCs.</p><p>As to behavioral evidence for our hypothesis, both GC NMDARs and Na<sub>v</sub>s are known to play a role specifically in discriminations between binary odorant mixtures in mice, since in the same behavioral paradigm GC-specific knock-down (in about ~50% of GCs) of the NMDAR-subunit GluN1 resulted in an increase in discrimination time of on average ~60 ms, and knock-down of Na<sub>v</sub>s of ~85 ms vs control, while discriminations between pure odors were not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunes and Kuner, 2018</xref>). These similar effects are in line with our findings, since both modifications should prevent both recurrent and lateral inhibition. However, the relative impact of recurrent inhibition vs lateral inhibition is not known.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion: Hypothesis on the purpose of the reciprocal spine</title><p>In summary, our findings suggest that reciprocal spines allow the GC to selectively interact with coactive glomerular columns. Thus, the reciprocal spine might be a circuit motif that specifically enables efficient binding of dispersed olfactory representations, a coding task that this sensory modality needs to perform due to its large number of receptors. In other words, reciprocal spines with their unique synaptic arrangement and functionality, including spine spikes and presynaptic NMDARs, are likely to represent a special adaptation to the demands of sensory processing in the bulb. Of course, at this point this is a hypothesis that awaits further exploration via network simulations and in vivo approaches. Another intriguing yet more speculative potential function of target-activity-dependent output is that concurrent preactivation from glutamatergic cortical inputs onto reciprocal spines (ultrastructure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Price and Powell, 1970</xref>) can also enhance lateral inhibition in addition to providing feed-forward inhibition, potentially allowing for a top-down projection of olfactory templates as has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zelano et al., 2011</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling, slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Animals used in our experiments were juvenile Wistar or VGAT-Venus transgenic rats (VGAT-Venus/w-Tg(SLc32a1-YFP*)1Yyan) of either sex (P11 – P19).

The first laser was set either to 900 nm for simultaneous excitation of YFP and Alexa 594 in one channel for visualization of spines and the MC for urIPSC recordings (or the GC for uEPSP recordings), and the second laser was set to 750 nm for uncaging of caged glutamate.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Specifically, the authors examined the mechanism underlying reciprocal dendro-dendritic interactions between mitral cells and granule cells of the olfactory bulb in rats. Minimal stimulation with two-photon glutamate uncaging was used to stimulate a single spine of a granule cell while inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were monitored using whole-cell, voltage-clamp recording from a mitral cell. The authors show that recurrent IPSCs were greatly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of voltage-gated Na channels, high-voltage-activated Ca channels or NMDA receptors. The authors also provide electron microscopic (EM) data that shows that NMDA receptors are indeed located close to the release sites in granule cell spines. The authors proposed that NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx facilitates synapse-specific lateral inhibition, and speculate its role in sensory processing.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the high quality of the experiments and the data. Both reviewers found the proposed ideas very interesting. The EM data are also very intriguing. However, the reviewers had substantive concerns on the validity of the authors' interpretations of the experiment and the data. First, they were concerned that the manuscript does not provide compelling evidence that only a single spine in a granule cell was activated by glutamate uncaging even though many of the authors' conclusions depend on it. Second, all of the pharmacological manipulations caused a significant decrease in evoked as well as spontaneous IPSCs. It is therefore unclear whether the observed pharmacological effects were as interpreted or due to a mechanism that does not require an evoked event (e.g. a general reduction in excitability). Both reviewers also pointed out that the Discussion section includes speculative ideas that are not directly related to experimental results.</p><p>During discussion, one reviewer was more positive than another reviewer regarding the overall impact of the study. In any case, both reviewers agreed that the first two concerns mentioned above are substantive, and fully addressing these concerns likely requires additional experiments that will take more than 2-3 months (e.g. measuring the spread of excitation resulting from the authors' uncaging protocol). Based on these considerations, we have decided that we cannot proceed further with the current manuscript. If the authors can fully address these major concerns, however, we would be willing to reconsider a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Lage-Rupprecht and colleagues describe biophysical mechanisms of MC-GC recurrent inhibition using minimal stimulation of GC spines. They use a local two-photon uncaging of glutamate to evoke IPSCs that are smaller than spontaneous events. Surprisingly for a minimal stimulation of this magnitude, they observe that voltage gated Na channels, high voltage activated Ca channels as well as NMDA receptors are all necessary to evoke a recurrent IPSC. It should be noted that unlike previous studies in the field, the authors demonstrate the NMDA requirement under a physiological condition. Using an ultrastructural evidence, they demonstrate that NMDA receptors are strategically located i.e., in proximity to the release sites on the GC spine, well within the 100 nm boundary that theoretical studies suggest is crucial if the calcium influx lead directly to vesicle release. Compartmentalised Ca influx via a local NMDA activation would be an intriguing and ideal mechanism to implement specific yet flexible connectivity between MCs and GCs.</p><p>The data are of high quality, and the insights on the NMDA receptor involvement is new and very important. There is some confusion as to whether or not this is a study about a single-spine stimulation, while the majority of the discussion is spent on co-operative activation by several MCs. While it is not necessary that the data deals with a single-spine stimulation strictly, a manuscript may improve by clarifying this point. These are elaborated below in interrelated points.</p><p>1) Regarding the minimal stimulation used, the intention and interpretation seems to be that the two-photon uncasing leads to a single-spine stimulation. It is not clear that this is demonstrated. For example, in Figure 1X, the amplitude of IPSC shows some fluctuations. Does a histogram show a quantal nature or at least is the fluctuation consistent with a single contact?</p><p>2) According to a recent BioRxiv preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.901397 ), where some of the current authors describe Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in GC dendrites following a simultaneous uncaging of glutamate with incremental number of stimulated sites, demonstrating that Nav, HVACC, and NMDA receptors are recruited when several GC spines are stimulated, but not 1 spine. This may suggest the conditions used in the current manuscript may activate several spines. This may occur, for example, if more than 1 dendro-dendritic contacts exist between each GC-recorded MC pair, and clamping the recorded MC voltage at +10 mV (lower than the reversal potential of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and high enough to activate the channel) could lead to some glutamate release on other parts of the GC dendrite. Have the authors tried to record at a more hyperpolarized voltage (maybe with a different internal solution to enhance the GABAergic conductance)?</p><p>3) Alternatively, it is possible that the apparent discrepancy above (between this and the previous studies) simply reflects a difference in the anatomical scale of analysis. That is, it is possible that the active conductance was already present with 1 stimulation site in the GC study, but highly localized within the spine head volume. So, an analysis of the spatial distribution of evoked calcium signal in GC spines may resolve this issue (if the data in the BioRxiv paper can be analyzed this way).</p><p>4) If indeed it turns out that the minimal stimulation involved a recruitment of several spines, it would be interesting to see if, in the Ca signals in the GC dendrite, the NMDA-receptor mediated calcium entry is confined to the activated spine (e.g., analysis of calcium signals in stimulated spine vs. non-stimulated spine next to it). This may support their idea of localized release during a more global event, such as during the co-operative activation by multiple MCs, as depicted in the schematics and elaborated in the Discussion.</p><p>5) Overall, the Discussion is quite lengthy and somewhat removed from the data currently presented. Please edit accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript uses glutamate uncaging, whole cell recordings, and pharmacology to dissect the role of different currents in reciprocal inhibition at dendro-dendritic MC-GC synapses. Specifically, the authors record whole cell currents from MCs while performing glutamate uncaging onto nearby GCs and observe both spontaneous and evoked IPSCs in MC held at a depolarized potential. They then apply antagonists of GABA receptors, Nav channels, HVACCs, and NMDARs and show that in all cases both spontaneous IPSCs and evoked IPSCs are reduced. The results are interpreted as support for the &quot;mini-neuron&quot; hypothesis, in which single GC spines act as neurons with spike generation leading to HVACC activation and release. Further, the contribution of NMDARs to this process is interpreted as evidence for &quot;on-demand&quot; lateral inhibition between co-active columns.</p><p>The experiments shown appear to have been done carefully and the ideas proposed are interesting. However, I do think some of the results are over-interpreted here, given the strong suppression of spontaneous IPSCs observed with all pharmacological manipulations.

References to &quot;the previous manuscript&quot; are made frequently in the text without an exposition of what is shown there. The manuscript should be written as a stand-alone document that provides the necessary background for a reader to understand and interpret the findings as is.</p><p>2) All of the pharmacological manipulations shown decrease spontaneous IPSCs as well as IPSCs evoked by uncaging. Therefore, it is not clear of the mechanisms are specific to spine-evoked release or simply represent an overall decrease in excitability of the GC or network.

While this excitation is assumed to be confined to a single spine this is never shown and seems to be critical to the interpretation. Voltage or Ca imaging from GCs during uncaging would be important to show this.</p><p>4) The Discussion is very long and puts forward a number of hypotheses that are significant extrapolations from the presented data. The ideas put forward here are quite interesting but I think would be more compelling if supported by a computational model and could easily constitute a manuscript of their own coupled with the extensive literature review that supports the model proposed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Presynaptic NMDARs cooperate with local spikes toward GABA release from the reciprocal olfactory bulb granule cell spine&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A local activation of NMDA would be an intriguing and ideal mechanism to implement specific yet flexible connectivity between MCs and GCs. Their sophisticated experimental approach allowed a demonstration of such specific connectivity, involving a single GC spine.</p><p>In this revised version, the authors provide an experimental evidence (in Figure 2—figure supplement 1) that the calcium influx in the GC spine is local. Upon minimal two-photon stimulations, calcium signals are observed only in the stimulated spines, but not in neighboring spines or nearby dendritic segments. This strongly supports their model that a GABA-release from a GC spine relies on a glutamatergic input to that very spine, which leads to the NMDA-mediated Ca influx, thus demonstrating that GC-mediated inhibition can be synapse-specific. Their observation here also explains a variety of phenomena previously reported, such as an apparent lack of functional reciprocal connectivity when a GC depolarization on its own is used to probe GC-&gt;MC connectivity.</p><p>The discussion is now appropriate for the results presented.</p><p>I therefore conclude that the authors have addressed all of my previous concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors performed a series of high-quality experiments that make a strong argument for the mini-neuron model, with an interesting interpretation of these data that suggests that granule-cell-mediated lateral inhibition is specific to coactive glomerular columns.</p><p>Regarding the first major concern that they may be activating multiple spines, they now provide additional data that show only a small fraction of responses with blind uncaging, which is nice. However, more compellingly, when they do calcium imaging on two neighboring spines, they only see transients in the stimulated spine and not in its neighbor. Together, these data strengthen their argument that they are activating a single synapse; or, given the relatively sparse distribution of granule cell spines, that at least they're activating a single synapse onto a given granule cell.</p><p>I am still not clear why all the pharmacological manipulations decreased sIPSC amplitude, but the authors have done the rather simple control experiment suggested by reviewer 2, and I am not sure that this point invalidates their results or their interpretation. I suggest the authors note this issue explicitly in the Discussion and that we give them the benefit of the doubt.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63737.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Does a histogram show a quantal nature or at least is the fluctuation consistent with a single contact?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an intriguing point, also since I have some prior experience in studying the properties of unitary synaptic transmission (Feldmeyer, Egger, Sakmann 1999). Unfortunately, because of the high spontaneous activity background and the low apparent release probability, in most experiments the number of reliable measurements of single responses is too low to allow to compute such histograms. For our main analyses of pharmacological effects we always used amplitudes measured from averaged responses. However, I have rechecked our set of stability experiments where 10 trials were followed by an interval of 10 minutes and then another 10 trials (to mimick the time course of pharmacological manipulations). Although the number of averaged responses per interval were low (average n = 2.8 ± 1.1, now included in the manuscript), the amplitudes of the averaged were very similar for the two intervals as can be seen from Figure 1F. While this observation is not a firm proof of quantal release, I would argue that it is at least in line with it, since a connection with two or three release sites instead of one would show a considerably higher CV and thus fluctuations between the average amplitudes are more likely to occur, since these are based on a low sampling number. On the other hand, the low Pr will render it fairly unlikely to observe double release events.</p><p>We also conducted additional experiments to further ensure single-spine activation, at least with regard to the same GC – see response to point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to a recent BioRxiv preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.901397 ), where some of the current authors describe Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in GC dendrites following a simultaneous uncaging of glutamate with incremental number of stimulated sites, demonstrating that Nav, HVACC, and NMDA receptors are recruited when several GC spines are stimulated, but not 1 spine.

We wish to clarify that the mentioned recruitment of active conductances in this study is referring to additional recruitment during activation of more than one spine, as also discussed by the reviewer in the next point. All these conductances are also already recruited for single spine activation within the activated spine, as described in Bywalez et al., 2015 and stated in the manuscript, both in the Introduction for Nav and HVACC and also in the Discussion.</p><p>The current manuscript also contains a set of experiments conducted with a different internal at – 70 mV, which was our initial recording configuration (Materials and methods). We switched to +10 mV in the interest of further noise reduction. There was no difference between the two conditions with respect to the effect of TTX. As to the concern that glutamate release from MCs held at + 10 mV might have confounded the results, we wish to point out that the clamp to +10 mV was performed at least 10 minutes before the beginning of uncaging, as also indicated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Alternatively, it is possible that the apparent discrepancy above (between this and the previous studies) simply reflects a difference in the anatomical scale of analysis. That is, it is possible that the active conductance was already present with 1 stimulation site in the GC study, but highly localized within the spine head volume. So, an analysis of the spatial distribution of evoked calcium signal in GC spines may resolve this issue (if the data in the BioRxiv paper can be analyzed this way).</p></disp-quote><p>This is in line with our understanding, and as outlined above we have further clarified the manuscript in this respect. As to the spatial distribution, we have now conducted extra experiments showing not only that Ca<sup>2+</sup>signals do not spread into the dendrite but that neighboring spines also do not sense the uncaged glutamate (at least within our detection thresholds). See response to 4.</p><p>The experiments in the PLoS Biology paper show the very same result, however we did not wish to use this result here since in that study uncaging spots were generated via a spatial light modulator, which might cause a larger uncaging volume in the z-dimension than the conventional uncaging used here, thus glutamate could be more likely to spread to adjacent spines (even though this is not backed by our observations).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If indeed it turns out that the minimal stimulation involved a recruitment of several spines, it would be interesting to see if, in the Ca signals in the GC dendrite, the NMDA-receptor mediated calcium entry is confined to the activated spine (e.g., analysis of calcium signals in stimulated spine vs. non-stimulated spine next to it). This may support their idea of localized release during a more global event, such as during the co-operative activation by multiple MCs, as depicted in the schematics and elaborated in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed this experiment in a set of 11 spine pairs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D,E). Due to the low spine density of GCs (approx 2 per 10 µm) and the long spine necks, it was not easy to find two nearby spine heads in the same focal plane. We could not find any evidence for a spillover of glutamate to non-stimulated spines on the same cell. Even though it is deemed unlikely that a given MC is contacted by more than one spine from the same GC (Woolf et al., 1994).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall, the Discussion is quite lengthy and somewhat removed from the data currently presented.

For none of the three drugs (TTX, CTX, APV) there was a systematic reduction of sIPSC amplitude, rendering a postsynaptic effect rather unlikely. Even though sIPSC amplitudes were never reduced on average, we also now checked whether there might be a correlation between the strengths of the drug effects on urIPSC amplitudes and on sIPSC frequencies. No such positive correlation was observed for any of the drugs (S2C, S3C, S4C), arguing against network effects interfering with urIPSCs. All these data are now included also in the manuscript (Results, Discussion). We have added supplementary figures to all three pharmacological manipulation figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1) that provide the mentioned observations on spontaneous activity; the panels on sIPSC frequencies have been moved into these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The spatial extent of excitation produced by glutamate uncaging on GCs is not measured experimentally.

We are already engaged in the first steps of such a modelling study and are planning to outline the hypotheses in a conceptual review format, hoping to elicit interest in these ideas in the community.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors performed a series of high-quality experiments that make a strong argument for the mini-neuron model, with an interesting interpretation of these data that suggests that granule-cell-mediated lateral inhibition is specific to coactive glomerular columns.</p><p>Regarding the first major concern that they may be activating multiple spines, they now provide additional data that show only a small fraction of responses with blind uncaging, which is nice. However, more compellingly, when they do calcium imaging on two neighboring spines, they only see transients in the stimulated spine and not in its neighbor. Together, these data strengthen their argument that they are activating a single synapse; or, given the relatively sparse distribution of granule cell spines, that at least they're activating a single synapse onto a given granule cell.</p><p>I am still not clear why all the pharmacological manipulations decreased sIPSC amplitude, but the authors have done the rather simple control experiment suggested by reviewer 2, and I am not sure that this point invalidates their results or their interpretation. I suggest the authors note this issue explicitly in the Discussion and that we give them the benefit of the doubt.</p></disp-quote><p>This seems to be a partial mixup since all the manipulations did NOT decrease sIPSC amplitudes (although all of them decreased sIPSC frequencies). While this finding was not mentioned in the very first version of the manuscript, the amplitude data have been included in the revision, along with proof that there is no correlation between the frequency effects and the effect on urIPSCs. We also discuss possible reasons and findings from other labs with regard to the decrease in frequency in greater detail, which are actually in support of our observation. In any case, we now have included an explicit statement of the potentially problematic observation that both evoked and spontaneous activity were reduced by the pharmacological manipulations in the Discussion:</p><p>“All three antagonists of urIPSC generation (TTX, CTX, APV) were found to also substantially reduce sIPSC frequency, which might imply that the reductions of urISPCs are due to a general reduction in excitability or network effects. However, none of the antagonists affected sIPSC amplitude or reduced sIPSC frequency in a manner correlated with their effect on evoked urISPCs, and similar effects on spontaneous activity were also reported elsewhere.”</p><p>In the meantime, I consider it also likely based on unpublished observations that the effect of APV on spontaneous activity could have been further enhanced by the presence of DNI, which enhances spontaneous activity in itself (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and thus might increase the amount of ambient glutamate. This possibility has now been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“(4) Finally, it is conceivable that the enhancement of spontaneous activity by the caged compound (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) results in slightly elevated levels of ambient glutamate and thereby further augments the contribution of NMDARs to spontaneous activity by the three aforementioned mechanisms.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
