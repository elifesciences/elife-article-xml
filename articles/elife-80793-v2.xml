Here, we link CRMP1 to a neurodevelopmental disorder. We report heterozygous de novo variants in the <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene in three unrelated individuals with muscular hypotonia, intellectual disability, and/or autism spectrum disorder. Based on in silico analysis these variants are predicted to affect the CRMP1 structure. We further analyzed the effect of the variants on the protein structure/levels and cellular processes. We showed that the human <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants impact the oligomerization of CRMP1 proteins. Moreover, overexpression of the <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants affect neurite outgrowth of murine cortical neurons. While altered CRMP1 levels have been reported in psychiatric diseases, genetic variants in <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene have never been linked to human disease. We report for the first-time variants in the <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene and emphasize its key role in brain development and function by linking directly to a human neurodevelopmental disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorder</kwd><kwd>CRMP1</kwd><kwd>autism spectrum disorder</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charité -

At delivery a singular umbilical artery was noted. The global development was delayed from infancy on: with sitting at 18 months, standing with support at 14 months, walking at 26 months, first words at 24 months. She had slurred speech. Standardized cognitive tests performed at 5 and 10 years revealed a moderate intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 55 at last assessment using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC). Behavioral problems included a lack of distance to men and a sexualized behavior. At last assessment at 16 years-of-age, the girl had generalized muscular hypotonia with normal reflexes, but fine motor problems with a broad-based gait but no ataxia. When climbing stairs, she showed clear instability. The results of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 and 4 years as well as that of further work-up (including metabolic tests, electroencephalogram [EEG], ophthalmological assessment, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and abdominal sonography) were normal. Since preliminary genetic tests including chromosome analysis and array-CGH were normal in the index patient (P1), we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the underlying genetic cause. WES followed by bioinformatic analysis and confirmation with Sanger sequencing revealed the heterozygous de novo variant in the <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene c.1766C&gt;T (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5830253G&gt;A) in the affected child P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the protein level, this variant leads to an amino acid change at position 589 from proline to leucine: P589L in long isoform, CRMP1A (NP_001014809.1), and P475L in short form, CRMP1B (NP_001304.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian descent after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Routine echographia during pregnancy did not show of any concern. The boy was macrosomic at birth but had no congenital microcephaly. His motor development was delayed (unsupported walking at 24 months-of-age) due to congenital mild muscular hypotonia with normal deep tendon reflexes, but no coordination problems. He had bilateral pes planus. A speech delay and language impairment with first words spoken at 36 months were diagnosed. He was also diagnosed with an ASD and normal cognitive abilities (IQ 95). At last assessment at 10 years-of-age, an obesity associated with hyperphagia was of raising concern, and he had secondary enuresis nocturna. The body mass index (BMI) at last evaluation was 26.1. The results of a cranial MRI and EEG were normal. Routine metabolic screening showed no abnormal results. Similarly, through WES followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified a heterozygous de novo variant c.1280C&gt;T in the <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841279G&gt;A) in proband (P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This variant leads to an exchange of threonine to methionine at position 427 in the long form, CRMP1A (p.T427M, NP_001014809.1) and at position 313 in the short form, CRMP1B (p.T313M, NP_001304.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The variant affects a highly conserved region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The CADD phred score and REVEL score were 27.7 and 0.819, respectively. PhyloP (5.093), PhastCons (1) score, and multispecies sequence alignment show that the variant is in a highly conserved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Proband 3 (P3) is the first child of three of a non-consanguineous family of European descent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). She was born at gestation week 40 after an uneventful pregnancy, with normal birth parameters (weight: 3.610 kg, height: 50 cm, head circumference: 32.5 cm, Apgar score: 10/10). She had developmental delay with not being able to sit alone at 11 months and walked without support at 24 months. Her speech development was delayed with few words spoken at 30 months. She began to gain weight from 18 months, and overgrowth was noticed since the age of 2 years. At the age of 6 years, cell blood count, ionogram, lipid profile, endocrinological screening, and leptin blood level were normal with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: 3.16 mmol/l (2.60–4.00), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio: 3.16 mmol/l (2.60–4.00), serum triglycerides: 0.47 mmol/l (0.42–1.40), HbA1C: 5.4% (4.0–6.0), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): 3.27 µUI/ml (0.15–3.70), FT4: 10.25 ng/l (6.10–11.20), Cortisolemia: 92 µg/l (7.87–14.45), and Leptinemia: 131 ng/ml (19–251). There is familial history of obesity on both parental sides, and the father is macrocephalic (head circumference: 60.5 cm). She developed severe behavioral issues with temper tantrums, stubbornness, hyperphagia, obsessive–compulsive characteristics and ASD. She was attending special educational school at the age of 8. At the last assessment of 13 years-of-age, she had moderate intellectual disability and persistent severe behavioral disorders. Distinctive facial features were low forehead hair insertion, anteverted and large earlobes, broad nasal tip, short philtrum, and full lower lips. Genu valgum and hyperlordosis as well as abdominal and dorsal stretch marks were noted. Enuresis was noted. Cerebral MRI and abdomino-renal ultrasound were normal. Metabolic disorder screening and storage disease screening were negative, serum insulinemia was elevated: 32 mUI/ml (&lt;25) with normal glycemia (0.9 g/l). Array analysis revealed two maternally inherited deletions: a 668 kb deletion at 3q26.31 and a 371 kb at 5q23.1, confirmed by genome sequencing and considered as variant of unknown significance. Further analysis through trio-based whole-genome sequencing identified a de novo variant in the <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene c.1052T&gt;C (NM_001014809.2; Chr4 (GRCh37):g.5841409A&gt;G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The identified variant leads to an exchange of phenyl alanine to serine at position 351 of long form of CRMP1 (CRMP1A (p.(F351S), NP_001014809.1)) and at position 237 in short form (CRMP1B (p.(F237S), NP_001304.1)) and it is located in the highly conserved region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This variant is not found in gnomAD database. In silico pathogenicity prediction tools predict the identified variants to be deleterious (CADD phred: 23.60; REVEL 0.577), and the variant is located in the highly conserved region (PhyloP (2.826), PhastCons (1)). No additional pathogenic variants have been identified by trio genome sequencing, including all known genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effect of identified <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants on protein structure</title><p>Since CRMP1 is known to oligomerize to form homotetramers and heterotetramers along with other CRMPs to regulate cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang and Strittmatter, 1997</xref>), we determined the effect of the identified human variants on its protein structure using known structures and protein structure prediction tools. The structure of CRMP1 short form, CRMP1B, has been determined at 3.05 A resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) lacking the N-terminal 14 residues and residues 491–572 in their C-terminal region. A CRMP1 monomer consists of three structural parts, N-terminal β-strands followed by a linker β-strand connected to the central α/β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Several residues contribute to the oligomerization interface of CRMP1 and the quaternary structure of CRMP1 tetramer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. The amino acids (P475, T313, and F237) are located in the highly conserved region of CRMP1. The P475 is the last residue before the start of the C-terminal helix and the exchange of proline to leucine (p.(P475L)) is predicted to lead to serious clashes with the neighboring residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Such spatial constraints may alter the dipole moment of the helix and lead to long-range allosteric effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The T313 lies within the region of the α/β-barrel and oriented toward the inside of the protein and located close to one of the two cavities (highlighted in yellow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These two cavities are located in between two pockets (highlighted in magenta). Conformational changes within these pockets upon function or interaction with other molecules could shuffle these cavities to form a channel required for function. The exchange of threonine to methionine (p.(T313M)) is predicted to prevent the conformational changes which might affect the interaction of CRMP1 with other molecules and/or oligomerization. The F237 is localized directly in the center of interface 1 so the exchange of a heavy hydrophobic sidechain by a hydrophilic short sidechain (p.(F237S)) most likely interferes with the stability of the dimer interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Based on structural simulations, all three variants are predicted to affect the ternary structure of CRMP1 and impact on its oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>P475L and T313M variants affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B</title><p>To analyze the effect of <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants on its protein levels and cellular function, two variants (CRMP1B-P475L (P1) or -T313M (P2)) were chosen for further functional analysis. The alternate splicing of exons 1a and 1b of <italic>CRMP1</italic> gene brings two splicing variants CRMP1A (686 aa, long form) and CRMP1B (572 aa short form) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). CRMP1B is the major isoform expressed in the nervous system and most of CRMP1 studies including X-ray structural analysis have been performed with CRMP1B and therefore we used CRMP1B isoform for the experiments.</p><p>We purified the recombinant human CRMP1B-wildtype, -P475L (P1), or -T313M (P2) proteins using the <italic>E. coli</italic> GST-tag expression system. CRMP1B-wildtype showed two major 64 and 60 kDa bands on SDS-denatured gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left lane). The 64 and 60 kDa correspond to full-length CRMP1B and to a truncated, C-terminal region cleaved form, respectively. The yield of purified T313M (TM) or P475L (PL) was less than that of wildtype in the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle and right lanes). This finding may be due to lower expression and/or aggregation of the variant proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. As T313M and P475L mutated residues are positioned close to the dimer/tetramer interface of CRMP1B, these variants may affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1. We therefore examined the oligomerization of recombinant CRMP1 preparation with gel-filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Truncated CRMP1B-wildtype (lower band) was present in the high molecular weight region (200–500 kDa) and full-length CRMP1B (higher band) was present between 400 and 100 kDa. The high molecular weight signal probably represents the homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B-wildtype under the native condition. In contrast, CRMP1B-T313M and -P475L were detected at the lower molecular weight region (40–200 kDa). The molecular size (120 kDa) of peak fractions of T313M and P475L may indicate the dimerization of these variant proteins.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Attenuated oligomer formation of CRMP1-P475L and CRMP1B-T313M variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Purified CRMP1B-wildtype, -T313M, and -P475L recombinant proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) stained with CBB.

All the patients have a neurodevelopmental disorder with motor delay and muscular hypotonia. While patient P1 has moderate intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities, P2 was diagnosed with an ASD but a normal cognitive profile, and P3 presented with moderate intellectual disability and ASD.</p><p>We showed that those human <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants impact the oligomerization of CRMP1 proteins. CRMP1 exists as homo- or hetero-tetramers to interact with various signaling molecules and to link microtubules to subcellular structures and regulate cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang and Strittmatter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, CRMP1 colocalizes to the mitotic spindles and centrosomes, indicating of playing a key role in regulating mitosis and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shih et al., 2003</xref>). Defective cell cycle, abnormal mitotic spindle and centrosomes are the common key pathomechanisms underlying several neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zaqout and Kaindl, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of other CRMPs that have been linked to human disease has been shown to affect specific cellular processes associated with the clinical phenotype. For example, missense variants of CRMP5 impede the ternary complex formation with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and beta-III-tubulin, thereby causing a defective inhibitory regulation on neurite outgrowth and dendritic development and thereby contribute to the brain malformation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeanne et al., 2021</xref>). MAP2 has been already reported to play a key role in neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity through its role in microtubule stabilization and cytoskeletal association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaech et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sánchez et al., 2000</xref>). Also, variant CRMP4 was shown to affect axonal growth and survival of motor neurons and thereby contribute to the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasco et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we showed that the identified <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants affect neurite outgrowth, which is a characteristic phenotype associated with many neurodevelopmental/psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Prem et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding is in line with the reduced neurite outgrowth phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation in the <italic>Crmp1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Su et al., 2007</xref>). Mechanistically, these cellular processes are regulated in a spatiotemporal manner through CRMP1 phosphorylation by several kinases such as Cdk5, Rho/ROCK, or GSK3, and any disturbances in these kinases or mutation of specific residues culminates in the abnormal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamashita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Su et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charrier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Makihara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Uchida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamashita and Goshima, 2012</xref>). In the case of <italic>Cdk5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, abnormal dendritic spine morphology was shown in cortical neurons as it was in <italic>Crmp1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Intriguingly, both mouse models show schizophrenia-like behavior, indicating the commonly shared cellular mechanism for dendritic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Su et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>) In the hippocampal slices of both <italic>Crmp1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Crmp1<sup>−/−</sup> mice</italic>, LTP induction was impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Su et al., 2007</xref>). This highlights the importance of normal expression of <italic>Crmp1</italic> for learning and memory in mice. In the context of neuronal development, defective phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CRMP1 by Fyn-mediated Reelin signaling impairs cortical neuron migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yamashita et al., 2006</xref>). Over the last two decades, new phosphorylation-specific sites in CRMP1 are being reported and recently, phosphorylation of Tyr504 residue by Fyn has been shown to play an important step in Sema3A-regulated dendritic development of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawashima et al., 2021</xref>) Recently, phosphorylation of Crmp1 at Ser522 has been reported to play role in the ALS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kawamoto et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we showed that the reported <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants lead to lost-of-function and overexpression of wildtype <italic>CRMP1</italic> might be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to rescue the phenotype.</p><p>In conclusion, we report for the first-time human <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants, link them to a human neurodevelopmental disease and highlight underlying pathomechanisms. Our report adds <italic>CRMP1</italic> to list of other <italic>CRMP</italic> genes linked to neurological disorders and underlines the important role of CRMP1 in the nervous system development and function. As a future perspective, it will be interesting to find other <italic>CRMP1</italic> variants and elucidate the role of specific residues in various neuronal process and associate with the phenotypic spectrum of neurological diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRMP1B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genbank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_001313 transcript variant 2, mRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Short isoform of human CRMP1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21 (DE3) pLysS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioDynamics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# DS260<break/>Lot 0Q041</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ICR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nihon SLC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_TAC:icr">IMSR_TAC:icr</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Authenticated by STR analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pc3.1beta2-human CRMP1B-V5<break/>wildtype</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pc3.1b2-hCRMP1B-V5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR-amplified from Invitrogen human brain cDNA library<break/>Available from F.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ahmet Okay Caglayan (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that the policy at <italic>eLife</italic> is that invitations for revised manuscripts typically include only requests for essential revisions for requested experiments that can be performed in a relatively short timeframe, i.e. within 6 weeks or so (see below). Other improvements suggested by the reviewers should be carefully considered, and attempts to address these will benefit the manuscript. Additionally, <italic>eLife</italic> provides full reviews including major weaknesses, which should be addressed in a point-by-point rebuttal. If you do not feel that you can address these issues within this timeframe, please let us know.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should include details on the population allele frequency cut-off they have used to filter the WES data. Regarding variant classification, appropriate ACMG rules should be applied to identified variants and implemented into the text.</p><p>2) Figure 2 Panel A does not show loading control. Panel B at 720 kDa band is not convincing. Results should be repeated with size exclusion chromatography and/or another method to determine molecular weight and should be quantified from triplicate experiments. Panel C is also not convincing and should be repeated to more carefully show results, and quantified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript examining mutations in CRMP1 and their linkage to a rare syndrome in humans first time in the literature. Overall, the authors achieved their aim of demonstrating the existence of a novel neurodevelopmental disease-gene association and implicating CRMP1 as an important player in human neurodevelopment. This is of significant importance to the medical field, human geneticists, and neuroscientists. Further clarification of the disease mechanism is needed for therapeutic considerations, i.e. whether gene augmentation therapies might rescue the phenotype (loss-of-function/haploinsufficiency) or if allele-specific knockdown or gene editing is necessary (dominant negative).</p><p>However, there are some other issues to be addressed:</p><p>1) Please include primers for Sanger sequencing for P1 and P3. Adding representative chromatograms of Sanger sequencing is encouraged.</p><p>2) Since a gain-of-function mechanism is provided and often gain-of-function mutants are generated by expressing a gene at a much higher level than normal in cells, it is recommended to analyze gene expression abundance of CRMP1 in heterozygous variant carriers and non-carriers if tissue/cell samples are available.</p><p>3) Pathogenic mechanism of CRMP1 variants for all symptoms is not well documented.</p><p>4) Laboratory data are not sufficient. The second and third patients show obesity. Metabolic and endocrinological surveys should be included if possible.</p><p>5) Details on CNV analysis (SNP-array, WES-based CNV analysis, other? or not performed) should be given for patient 2.</p><p>6) Since WES was performed, more details on the QC values of WES (percent of exome captured, percent of exome analyzed, depth of coverage, etc.) should be included. This information is especially important for patient 1 where the WES coverage is lower than usual. There is one line about this as part of the study design of the manuscript for patient 3, but that does not provide sufficient information.</p><p>7) The authors should include details on the population allele frequency cut-off they have used to filter the WES data.</p><p>8) Regarding variant classification, appropriate ACMG rules should be applied to identified variants and implemented into the text.</p><p>9) Interpreted variants may be deposited in ClinVar.</p><p>10) P475L and T313M mutations selected for functional studies: why were short isoforms of the CRMP1 gene chosen instead of canonical ones?</p><p>11) For example, on Page 8 Line 142 &quot;…CRMP1B-V5&quot; and on Page 15 Line 311 &quot;…P475L and T313M mutations affect homo-oligomerization of CRMP1B&quot; How is CRMP1B different than CRMP1?

Is the truncated form naturally occurring, some self-truncation due to bacteria expression and processing via protease? When expressed in HEK293, the lower, monomeric band is unique, there are not two different bands.</p><p>13) The manuscript needs to be carefully edited and corrected before publication to improve the clarity and quality of the paper. Editing by an author who is fluent in English might be of great benefit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Another experiment that might strengthen the dominant-negative interpretation is co-localization studies, e.g. if variant CRMP1 disrupts the localization of wild-type CRMP1. Has this been done?</p><p>Do heterozygous knockout mice have any phenotype?</p><p>There should be more details about the cases identified. Genematcher? Other matchmaking platforms? Personal communications?</p><p>While the numbers are likely insufficient to show a statistically significant excess of de novo variants in CRMP1, ideally there would be details regarding the number of trio exomes/genomes performed to date at each site and the total number of de novo CRMP1 variants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80793.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should include details on the population allele frequency cut-off they have used to filter the WES data.

CRMP1 (collapsin response mediator protein 1) was originally identified as 572AA protein. Long form CRMP1 (686AA), a splicing variant at N-terminal region, was subsequently identified. These splicing variants have been designated as CRMP1B and CRMP1A, respectively. CRMP1B is the major isoform expressed in the nervous system. Most of CRMP1 studies including X-ray structural analysis have been performed with CRMP1B, short isoform of CRMP1. Therefore, we examined this analysis with CRMP1B isoform.

However, no specific CRMP1A antibody is commercially available yet, so no experiments have been carried out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do heterozygous knockout mice have any phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Crmp1<sup>+/-</sup> mice, LTP induction was impaired as observed in the Crmp<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

We performed a re-check in a cohort of over 20,000 exomes in which NO de novo CRMP1 variants are present, indicating that it is very rare. In addition, we searched in the denovo-db (https://denovo-db.gs.washington.edu/denovo-db/) and the Gene4Denovo database (http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/search?inputValue=CRMP1&amp;searchType=geneSymbol). We found 6 DNM in the denovo-db but all were in intronic regions. We found 31 DNM in the Gene4Denovo database, among which there were 5 missense mutations identified in patients of ASD or DD.</p></body></sub-article></article>
