PCNA onto primed sites for replicative DNA polymerases δ and ε. The RFC pentamer forms a central chamber that binds 3′ ss/ds DNA junctions to load PCNA onto DNA during replication. We show here five structures that identify a second DNA binding site in RFC that binds a 5′ duplex. This 5′ DNA site is located between the N-terminal BRCT domain and AAA+ module of the large Rfc1 subunit. Our structures reveal ideal binding to a 7-nt gap, which includes 2 bp unwound by the clamp loader. Biochemical studies show enhanced binding to 5 and 10 nt gaps, consistent with the structural results. Because both 3′ and 5′ ends are present at a ssDNA gap, we propose that the 5′ site facilitates RFC’s PCNA loading activity at a DNA damage-induced gap to recruit gap-filling polymerases. These findings are consistent with genetic studies showing that base excision repair of gaps greater than 1 base requires PCNA and involves the 5′ DNA binding domain of Rfc1. We further observe that a 5′ end facilitates PCNA loading at an RPA coated 30-nt gap, suggesting a potential role of the RFC 5′-DNA site in lagging strand DNA synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RFC</kwd><kwd>PCNA</kwd><kwd>sliding clamp</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Huilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM shows a 5’ DNA site on the RFC clamp loader, in addition to the 3’ site, and biochemical study shows the 5’ site facilitates PCNA loading onto gaps, consistent with genetics indicating the 5’ DNA site facilitates gap repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All three domains of life possess a DNA clamp and clamp loader that are essential for cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yao and O’Donnell, 2016</xref>).

PCNA needs to be cracked open by a clamp loader to encircle the genomic DNA because it is a topologically closed ring. The eukaryotic clamp loader is Replication Factor C (RFC), composed of Rfc1-5, belonging to a large family of proteins involved in diverse cellular activities, referred to as the AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPases <underline>A</underline>ssociated with various cellular <underline>A</underline>ctivities) family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cullmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Enemark, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Snider et al., 2008</xref>).

The upper tier is a sealed ring consisting of five collar domains - one from each subunit, whereas the lower tier is composed of five AAA+ modules and is an open spiral with a gate between the first and the fifth subunits. However, the first subunit of the eukaryotic and T4 phage clamp loaders contain an additional A’ domain at their respective C termini that contacts the fifth subunit and closes the spiral gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelch et al., 2012b</xref>). The five ATP binding sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits, with one subunit contributing the Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B (DExx box, where the x can be any residue) motifs, and the other contributing the SRC motif that harbors an essential ‘arginine finger’ residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). All studies thus far have revealed that primer/template (P/T) DNA with a 3′-recessed end binds inside the chamber of the ATP-bound clamp loader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, clamp loaders of bacterial and eukaryotic systems only need ATP binding to crack open the clamp ring; neither ATP hydrolysis nor DNA is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hingorani and O’Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelch et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kelch et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Turner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhuang et al., 2006</xref>). DNA binding appears to properly engage the ATPase sites for hydrolysis, leading to closure of the clamp around the duplex and dissociation of the clamp loader from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelch et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marzahn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sakato et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trakselis et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The replication clamps are ring-shaped complexes that encircle dsDNA and slide freely on the duplex, conferring processivity to their respective replicative DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kunkel and Burgers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kunkel and Burgers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nick McElhinny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">ODonnell and Kurth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pursell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao and O’Donnell, 2021</xref>).

Structural studies showed that, the <italic>E. coli</italic> β-clamp is a homodimer, while the T4 phage clamp and archaeal and eukaryotic PCNA clamps are homotrimers, all of which display six domains having similar chain folds and remarkable pseudo sixfold symmetric architecture with an obvious ancestor in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gulbis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kong et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matsumiya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yao and O’Donnell, 2016</xref>). The monomers are arranged in head-to-tail manner, with 12 α-helices that line the inner cavity and a continuous layer of antiparallel β-sheet forming the outside perimeter, even at the protomer interfaces. In each case, the domains within each monomer are linked by an interdomain connecting loop (IDCL). The diameter of the PCNA inner lumen is about 38 Å, and the inner surface is also basic, thus suitable to encircle a 20 Å wide dsDNA and is shown to slide on DNA freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2021</xref>).

All replication clamps characterized so far mainly interact with their partners by their respective carboxy-terminal ‘front’ faces.

This conformation was not observed in the crystallographic study of the T4 phage clamp−loader−DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>). The new structure confirms that clamp opening does not need ATP hydrolysis. However, PCNA closure around dsDNA induced conformation changes that tighten up the RFC ATP binding sites at subunit interfaces and likely stimulate the ATPase. ATP hydrolysis presumably releases RFC from PCNA, making PCNA available to bind its functional partners, such as Pols δ and ε for DNA synthesis, and FEN1 and ligase for Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yao and O’Donnell, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Rad24-RFC is an alternative clamp loader in which Rad24 replaces Rfc1 of the RFC clamp loader and loads the DNA damage signaling 9-1-1 clamp onto a 5′-recessed DNA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Majka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Majka and Burgers, 2003</xref>).

We observe two structures in which the 9-1-1 clamp is either closed or had a 27 Å opening. These structures revealed that the 5′-junction DNA is held specifically by the Rad24 subunit in a long basic groove between the AAA+ module and collar domain, and that the 3′ ssDNA overhang enters the inner chamber of the alternative loader. This DNA interaction mode is unexpected, as it is entirely different from the DNA binding pattern of RFC which binds the 3′-recessed dsDNA inside the central chamber, while the 5′ ss/ds DNA is not observed to bind the clamp loader as reported in the T4 phage and yeast structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The surprising location of the 5′-ss/ds DNA binding site on the Rad24 subunit, but outside the central chamber of Rad24-RFC, led us to ask if RFC also contains a second DNA binding site that binds 5′ ss/ds DNA above the clamp ring. If true, the 5′ ss/ds DNA binding site may explain the previously reported 5′-ss/ds DNA junction binding by the human RFC1 BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, dual binding of 3′ and 5′ recessed DNA ends by RFC suggests that RFC may bind both ends of a DNA gap, congruent with genetic studies demonstrating that mutants in the N-terminal region of Rfc1 are defective in excision gap repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboussekhra et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McAlear et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shivji et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>These clues to dual DNA binding sites in RFC have inspired us to examine the structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RFC in the presence of a double-tailed DNA in which both the 3′-recessed and 5′-recessed ends are present on the same molecule. We used this strategy in our previous Rad24-RFC study that revealed 5′ ss/ds end binding to Rad24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, we found that RFC can bind up to two DNA molecules at the same time, one being the well-established site wherein a recessed 3′ ss/ds DNA binds inside the pentamer central chamber, and a second site that binds a recessed 5′ ss/ds DNA at the Rfc1 “shoulder” region outside the central chamber. This surprising dual DNA site binding mode of RFC described here resembles the DNA binding by Rad24-RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). We also examine the affinity and PCNA clamp loading efficiency of RFC at different sized DNA gaps. The results reveal enhanced RFC binding at 5–50 nt gaps, and 5′ end stimulation in loading of PCNA at a 10-nt gap and 30-nt gap, consistent with a role of RFC 5′ end binding in gap repair. The results also show a measurable enhancement in RFC loading of PCNA at an RPA-coated 30-nt gap, suggesting that RFC may act in longer excision tracks, and possibly binds both 3′ and 5′ ends of an Okazaki fragment fill-in site, perhaps to protect the 5′ end at Okazaki fragments and prevent the DNA damage repair pathway triggered by it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RFC can engage a 3′-DNA in the central chamber simultaneously with a 5′-DNA located on the Rfc1 ‘shoulder’</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PCNA clamp and RFC clamp loader were separately expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> (see Materials and Methods).

Use of DNA having both 3′ and 5′ ssDNA ends strategically enables the unbiased binding of either end to sites on RFC and 2D classification of cryo-EM images demonstrated the assembly of a variety of loading intermediates, including RFC bound to either one or two DNA molecules, and with the loader either engaged or not with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In all five structures, the Rfc1 AAA+ module sits above the PCNA protomer (when PCNA is present) at the right side of the DNA entry gate (viewing down from the C-terminal collar), while the Rfc5 AAA+ module is above the PCNA protomer at the left side of the DNA entry gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These structural features are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>). The closed-ring PCNA structure of RFC−3′-DNA1−PCNA is comparable with the RFC−PCNA structures determined in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, DNA makes the structure significantly more compact, as PCNA tilts up by 10° toward RFC, forming a tighter interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In the open PCNA structure, Rfc1 and Rfc5 each bind one different PCNA protomer, holding the two protomers 14 Å apart in-plane and 13 Å apart out-of-plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, middle panel). Because the 14 Å gap in PCNA is narrower than the 20 Å width of a dsDNA, and 3′-DNA1 is already inside the RFC central chamber, this is likely a post-entry intermediate in which the DNA gate has partially closed. These open and closed PCNA states resemble the open and closed clamp states observed in the T4 phage clamp-clamp loader complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>) and the recent RFC−PCNA−DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video1" xlink:href="elife-77469-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A side-by-side comparison of the five structures obtained in this study.</title><p>The five atomic models are rotated around the Y axis by 360° followed by another 360° rotation around the X axis.

ADP is possibly an ATPγS hydrolysis product by Rfc5. The Rfc5 subunit contains a ‘β-hairpin plug’ element that protrudes into the central chamber.

Furthermore, the AAA-ATP domains of Rfc3, 2 and 5 undergo a large rotation of 63° to open a gate, referred to as the A-gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>), between the AAA+ module and the A’ domain of Rfc1 and to tighten up the gapped ATP-binding interface between Rfc4 and Rfc3, perhaps stimulating the ATPase activity at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, the Rfc1 A’ domain becomes largely flexible upon 3′-DNA1 binding, and only the bridge helix – the α-helix connecting the collar and A’ domains (aa 669–689) – remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>).</p><p>The 3′-DNA1 binding site in the chamber is largely pre-formed in RFC, but the 5′-DNA2 site, located between the collar domain and the AAA+ module of Rfc1, is not formed in the absence of 3′-DNA1 binding, but it is formed upon binding 3′ DNA. Specifically, the Rfc1 collar region is very close to its AAA+ module with only a single residue (Leu-549) linking these two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Our structures reveal that, concomitant to the large-scale rotation of the Rfc3-2-5 half ring upon binding 3′-DNA1, as described above, 3′-DNA1 binding also causes conformation changes in the last α-helix (Asn-535 to Ala-548) of the Rfc1 AAA+ module and the first helix of the collar domain. Specifically, in Rfc1, the second half of the last AAA+ helix (Trp-543 to Ala-548) and the first residue of the collar helix (Lys-550) unwind and they, together with Leu-549, become an extended loop. This loop allowed the counter-clockwise movement of the Rfc1 collar and A’ domains, leading to the formation of the 5′-DNA2-binding cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

However, we did not observe an RFC−5′-DNA2 structure in which the 5′-DNA2 site is occupied, and the 3′-DNA1 site is empty.

Therefore, 5′-DNA2 is primarily bound by the first clamp loader subunit, Rfc1, in a manner similar to Rad24 DNA binding in Rad24-RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c, d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). However, the specific contacts are distinct. Four basic residues on the top of the Rfc1 AAA-ATP interact with the double strand region of 5′-DNA2: Lys-314 and Asn-459 H-bond with the phosphate backbone of the primer and template respectively, and Arg-476 and Arg-477 sandwich the template strand, with Arg-476 inserted in the minor groove. The back surface of the 5′-DNA2-binding groove is basic, lined by a series of alkaline residues including Lys-190 and Lys-195 of the BRCT domain. The 5′-DNA2 interaction with Rfc1 BRCT in the full RFC complex as observed in our structure is very different from the previous prediction based on the NMR structure of the truncated human RFC1 BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). It is currently unclear if the predicted binding mode is an in vitro artifact of using an isolated domain or might be an intermediate preceding the stable binding observed in our structure. The 5′-recessed end of the 5′-DNA2 is blocked by an α-helix (harboring two aromatic residues Phe-552 and His-556) of the collar domain, Phe-666 is precisely located at the 5′-junction, perhaps functioning as the ‘separation pin’ for 5′-DNA2; and Arg-663 in the minor groove appears to stabilize the 5′-junction. The recessed 5′ end is in a cavity lined by three basic residues, Lys-208 of the BRCT domain and His-556 and His-659 of the Rfc1 collar domain. The cavity is larger than necessary for accommodating the 5′-OH used in this study but fits the 5′-phosphate snuggly with two potential H-bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref><bold>-b</bold>).

Surprisingly, we found that the two identical DNA molecules, when bound to RFC, resemble a single gapped DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). As we described above, RFC stabilizes 2 unpaired and unwound 2 additional bases in the 3′-DNA1, and Rfc1 stabilized 1 unpaired base in the 5′-DNA2. Furthermore, the 11 Å space between the 5′ end of the 3′-DNA1 template strand and the 3′-end of the 5′-DNA2 template strand can accommodate 2 additional bases. Therefore, DNA1 and DNA2 are held by RFC like a gapped DNA with a gap size of about 7 bases. We suggest that the use of two DNAs has provided an unbiased view that RFC will most easily bind a gapped DNA with a minimal gap size of 5 bases, which will need an additional two 3′ base pairs unwound to form an ideal 7-base gapped DNA substrate. Longer gaps could likely be easily accommodated as the ssDNA region could simply loop outside of RFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Biochemical analysis of RFC−PCNA binding different sized gaps</title><p>To examine the gapped DNA binding of RFC−PCNA, we first measured binding affinities of RFC alone to gel-purified DNAs with various gap sizes in the presence of ATPγS. One may anticipate that the smallest gap that gives the tightest affinity may reflect the optimal gap size. Gapped DNAs that have a smaller ssDNA gap (i.e. &lt;5 nucleotides) than needed to fit within the DNA sites of RFC require some DNA melting to increase their ssDNA gap size. The binding energy likely drives the ‘melting’ of the edges of small gaps to form a 5–6 nucleotide ssDNA gap. This expenditure of binding energy to melt DNA implies that the observed affinity to suboptimal gap sized DNAs is weaker than the actual value to an optimal gap size.</p><p>For binding experiments, we used a 3′ oligo having a fluorophore, as in our earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>).

The fluorescence intensity change during titration of RFC into the DNA was measured to determine the apparent K<sub>D</sub> of RFC binding to primed DNA, as well as DNAs containing either a nick or gaps of 1, 2, 5, 10, or 50 nt. We found that RFC binds all of the DNAs but exhibits an approximately two-fold tighter affinity (i.e. lower apparent K<sub>D</sub>) for DNAs having a gap of five bases or greater compared to singly primed DNA and DNA with a nick or 1 or 2 base gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The cryo-EM structure predicted an optimal gap of 7 bases, but when one takes into account that RFC melts 2 bp at the 3′ end, the optimal binding to a 5-nucleotide gap is consistent with the cryo-EM data. RFC binds gaps larger than five nucleotides with comparable affinity, likely due to simply looping out the extra single-strand DNA. The same binding experiments in the presence of PCNA showed a similar outcome, except the affinities were all tighter (lower apparent K<sub>D</sub>), likely due to the assistance of PCNA that binds RFC and holds it to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

While we observed binding of 3′-DNA1 before 5′-DNA2, this may be due to use of a linear DNA that could enter the 3′-DNA1 site either from the bottom (N-terminal) surface of RFC, or through the side of RFC via the A-gap. In the cell, primed 3′ DNA can only enter RFC via the side A-gap. Thus, analysis of DNA binding site order may require use of longer, or otherwise modified DNAs that cannot enter RFC through the ‘bottom’ N-face and must enter through the A gate.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of RFC using both 3′ and 5′ DNA sites to load PCNA at a gap.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) The ATPγS bound RFC opens PCNA and causes a conformation change that opens the A gate and PCNA, as well as exposing the shoulder 5′-DNA2 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gaubitz et al., 2022</xref>).

Consistent with this speculation, we see very little difference (i.e. about two-fold) in binding to DNA of RFC and RFC lacking the N-terminal BRCT region. Indeed, a conformation change that favors a lower affinity of RFC to DNA may facilitate the ejection of RFC from PCNA−DNA that is needed for PCNA to bind other factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is the 5′-DNA2 site a general feature of all DNA clamp loaders?</title><p>Given that both RFC and Rad24-RFC have a shoulder 5′ DNA binding site located in subunit A (i.e. Rfc1 or Rad24), the subunit that binds 5′ DNA in their respective clamp loaders, is it possible that other alternative clamp loaders, such as.

Both Ctf18 and Elg1, in the subunit A position of RFC, likely contain an intact AAA+ module and a similar collar domain that resemble Rfc1 and Rad24, based on AlphaFold structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e, f</xref>). The subunit in the analogous position to Rfc1 and Rad24 in the bacterial β-clamp loader is the δ subunit. The δ subunit maintains an intact AAA+ module and collar domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>), and may contain a 5′ DNA binding site. Therefore, the eukaryotic alternative loaders Ctf18-RFC and Elg1 likely possess the shoulder 5′ DNA binding site, and the bacterial loader might contain a 5′ DNA site. However, the subunit A (gp62) of the T4 phage clamp loader has lost much of the typical AAA+ module, retaining only three α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>), and is less likely to contain the shoulder DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>).

Our biochemical data indicate RFC clamp loading activity is stimulated by a 5′ end at a 30-nt gap in the presence of RPA. Therefore, binding to both 3′ and 5′ DNA sites is not confined to an optimal 5–7 nt gap size determined by structural analysis alone. This opens the possibility that RFC maintains some level of contact with the 5′ end at gaps of larger sizes that can be bound by RPA, such as 150–200 bp Okazaki fragment gaps. One may speculate that an RFC−5′-DNA interaction could protect and prevent premature 5′ exonuclease excision at the 5′ end of Okazaki fragments. The two-site interaction of RFC, with the 3′ and 5′ ends of DNA, might also aid RFC processivity on the lagging strand in which RFC might transfer among multiple Okazaki fragments by walking from one to another during replication. It is also possible that there is some function of RFC in 5′-DNA end binding in DNA replication and/or DNA repair that is currently unknown. These possibilities will be a subject of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-2"><title>Might RFC regulate the 9-1-1 response?</title><p>The reported cellular number of Rad24 is five-fold less than that of Rfc1, in which the shared Rfc2-5 subunits are far more abundant according to the proteomics in the S.c. database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org">https://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link> as of Jan 20, 2022). It seems possible that RFC/PCNA represses the ability of Rad24-RFC to function in the 5′ loading of the 9-1-1 clamp at Okazaki fragments, and even at DNA repair gaps. In this speculation, and given the reported 5-fold higher concentration of Rfc1 over Rad24 protein in the cell, the ATR checkpoint kinase may not be stimulated by the 9-1-1 clamp until significant DNA damage has occurred, overwhelming RFC protection of 5′ ends and PCNA loading for DNA damage gap fill-in. Specifically, at low DNA damage, RFC may load PCNA for gap fill in, but when DNA damage is severe, the RFC might be insufficient to act at all the gaps - at which time the Rad24-RFC may have access to recessed 5′ ends and load 9-1-1 to turn on the DNA damage checkpoint. Thus, while quite speculative, RFC might act as a buffer against the loading of 9-1-1 for checkpoint activation. At some critical point, RFC will be overwhelmed by the number of repair gaps, and then Rad24-RFC will load the 9-1-1 clamp to upregulate the ATR kinase and induce a cell cycle checkpoint, enabling DNA repair until the genome is safe to continue being duplicated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5-3"><title>What role does the unique subunit in alternative clamp loaders play?</title><p>Eukaryotes have four different clamp loaders, RFC, Rad24-RFC, Ctf18-RFC and Elg1-RFC, each of which contain Rfc2-5 subunits, but utilize a different large subunit that associates with RFC2-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Park, 2020</xref>).

The cleaned-up particles were combined, and duplicate particles with 40% overlapping (52 Å) or larger than the particle diameter (~130 Å) were removed. The final dataset contained ~2.9 million particles that was used for 3D reconstruction. We first calculated four starting 3D models and obtained two major 3D classes. In the first 3D class, RFC is clearly bound to DNA but not to PCNA. In the second 3D class, RFC is seen bound to both DNA and PCNA. We subjected both classes to non-uniform 3D refinement and 3D viability analysis (3DVA), resulting in eight 3D subclasses for each of the two starting 3D classes.</p><p>Among the eight 3DVA-derived subclasses of the RFC–DNA complexes in the absence of PCNA, we found two subclasses bound to one DNA (RFC–DNA1) and two subclasses bound to two DNA molecules (RFC–3′-DNA1–5′-DNA2). The remaining four subclasses contained 3′-DNA1 with partially occupied 5′-DNA2, and they were discarded without further processing. Particles in the two subclasses bound to 3′-DNA1 only were combined into a dataset with 334,876 particles, and they were refined to a 3D map of 3.33 Å average resolution. Particles in the two subclasses bound to 3′-DNA1 and 5′-DNA2 were also combined to a dataset of 315,619 particles, and they were refined to a 3D map at 3.25 Å average resolution.</p><p>Among the eight 3DVA-derived subclasses of the RFC–DNA–PCNA complex, 1 subclass bound to 3′-DNA1 only and the bound PCNA was in an open spiral conformation. This subclass contained 118,384 particles and was further refined to a 3D map at 3.41 Å average resolution (RFC–3′-DNA1–open ring PCNA). Two subclasses bound to 3′-DNA1 only with the PCNA in a closed ring conformation. Particles in these two subclasses were combined to a dataset of 166,348 particles, and they were refined to a 3D map at 3.30 Å average resolution (RFC–3′-DNA1–closed ring PCNA). We found 4 subclasses contained 2 DNA molecules, in which, 3 subclasses were combined into a dataset of 432,904 particles and refined to a 3D map (RFC–3′-DNA1–5′-DNA2–PCNA) at 3.09 Å average resolution. The two remaining subclasses only had partial PCNA density, were discarded without further processing. In the 4 subclasses bound to PCNA and 3′-DNA1 and 5′-DNA2, two subclasses did not contain density, one had weak density, and one had strong density for the Rfc1 BRCT domain. We performed focused refinement on 85,932 particles in the subclass with strong density for Rfc1 BRCT. We used a 3D mask that included the Rfc1 NTD (BRCT and AAA+ module) and 5′-DNA2 region for particle subtraction and refined a local 3D map at 3.90 Å average resolution. This local 3D map was aligned to the 3.09 Å 3D map of the full complex and combined in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) to obtain the final composite map of the RFC–3′-DNA1–5′-DNA2–PCNA complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building, refinement, and validation</title><p>We used the crystal structure of the yeast RFC–PCNA complex (PDB entry 1SXJ) as the initial model for atomic model building of the above described five 3D EM maps. The EM map of the Rfc1 BRCT domain was at a low resolution of 3.90 Å, and there was no available high-resolution structure for the yeast domain. We referenced the crystal structure of the human RFC1 BRCT (PDB entry 2K6G) and the AlphaFold predicted yeast Rfc1 model (AF-P35251-F1) to build the atomic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). The DNA from the T4 phage clamp–loader–DNA crystal structure (PDB entry 3U5Z) and the DNA from yeast Rad24-RFC–9-1-1 clamp–DNA complex structure (PDB entry 7SGZ) were adopted as the initial models for chamber (3′-DNA1) and shoulder DNA (5′-DNA2) building, respectively. We also used the de novo modeling program Map-to-Model wrapped in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and the module ‘Automated Nucleic Acid building’ function integrated in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) to help modeling the two DNA molecules. These initial models are fitted into the composite 3D map of RFC–3′-DNA1–5′-DNA2–PCNA and merged into one single coordinate file in the UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) to serve as the starting model for the entire complex. The starting model was refined iteratively between the real space computational refinement in PHENIX and the manual adjustment in COOT. The atomic model of the RFC–3′-DNA1–5′-DNA2–PCNA complex was finally refined to 3.1 Å and went through a comprehensive validation by the MolProbity program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) embedded in PHENIX. This model then served as the initial model of the other four 3D maps. The model for each 3D map was subjected to iteratively real space refinement and manually adjustment as described above. The two PCNA subunits at the gate had weaker EM densities in the spirally open PCNA EM map, and they were modelled by rigid body docking with a PCNA monomer structure. Structure figures were prepared using ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>) and organized in Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Inc, San Jose, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescent DNA binding assays</title><p>The oligonucleotides used to make the DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) were synthesized and PAGE or HPLC-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). Gapped DNA templates used in the fluorescent binding assays were obtained by annealing the Primer1-Cy3, Primer 2 (or Primer2 5′-P-DNA) with their corresponding complementary DNA template oligos (Tmpl01_40, Tmpl02_41, etc.). The annealed templates were purified from a 10% native PAGE in 0.5 x TBE; gel bands were cut out from the gel, extracted in TE buffer and further concentrated and buffer exchanged into standard TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA).</p><p>RFC binding to DNA was measured using each 3′ Cy3-labeled gel purified DNA template (singly primed, nicked, 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, or 50-dT gaps) at constant 10 nM DNA concentration. RFC complex was titrated from 0 to 240 nM into reactions of 50 μL final volume containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM Mg-Acetate, 4 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 100 μM ATPγS. When present, the PCNA trimer was at a concentration ratio of 1:1 with RFC. The reaction mixtures were assembled in a 384-well plate format, then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The plates were centrifuged for 20 s to eliminate any bubbles and to assure that the liquid mix is evenly distributed on the well-bottom; the fluorescence signal was recorded using the Synergy Neo2 plate reader fluorimeter (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) by exciting the Cy3 fluorophore at 535 nm and read out of the integrated fluorescence signal between 560 and 580 nm. The fluorescence recording routine involved a reading every 3 min preceded by an elliptical motion plate stirring for 20 s. The recording was performed for 45 min at constant temperature of 23.8 °C, for a total 16 readings averaged for each concentration point. Because the averages of the first four recordings and the last four readings are same in this 45 min regimen, the reactions are expected to be at equilibrium conditions. Three independent experiments were performed for each titration. Relative intensity (I/I<sub>0</sub>) was plotted versus RFC concentration. Apparent <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> measurements were determined using the quadratic model of a single-site interaction that more accurately accounts for bound protein (equation 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarmoskaite et al., 2020</xref>) corrected with a nonspecific binding parameter, using the OriginPro software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title><sup>32</sup>P-PCNA clamp loading on gapped DNAs</title><p>For magnetic beads assays the template strand comtained a 5’-Digitoxin and a 3’-Biotin. The Dig/Bio template and the primer #1 and, when present, primer #2, were mixed with their respective template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) in a 1:2 ratio of template to each primer in 50 μl of 5 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate (final pH 8.5), then was incubated in a 95 °C water bath that was allowed to cool to room temperature over a 30 min interval. Streptavidin-coated Dynabead M-280 magnetic beads were purchased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and anti-Digoxigenin, the anti-Dig Fab (Millipore-Sigma (Burlington, MA)). Each primed biotinylated DNA template (200 pmol) was incubated with 1 mg Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin in 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 M NaCl. An average yield of 130–200 pmol DNA/mg of Dynabeads, was determined by releasing DNA from beads by 1% SDS, removing beads, then measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 260 nm using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. To block non-specific protein binding the DNA-bead conjugates were pre-incubated with 5 mg/ml BSA in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl at room temperature for 30 minutes and washed in the same buffer until no BSA remained in the supernatant as detected by Bradford reagent.</p><p>The kinase tag on PCNA was used to label it with <sup>32</sup>P to a specific activity of 40 cpm/fmol with [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP using the recombinant catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> (a gift from Dr. Susan Taylor, University of California at San Diego) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelman et al., 1995</xref>). Before the start of the PCNA-loading assay, either no RPA, or a 2.5-fold molar excess RPA over DNA was added and the 5′ Dig of the DNA-bead conjugate was blocked with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment in a ratio of 1:2 respectively in clamp loading buffer (30 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) for 10 minutes at room temperature (23 °C). The clamp loading assays were then performed at 23 °C. Each reaction contained 167 nM antibody-blocked DNA-bead conjugate, 376 nM <sup>32</sup>P-PCNA in 30 μl of clamp loading buffer, 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM ATP and was initiated with 167 nM RFC for 30 seconds before being quenched with 37 mM EDTA. The beads were then collected in a magnetic separator and washed 2 X with 200 μl clamp loading buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. The DNA-bound <sup>32</sup>P-PCNA was stripped from the beads with 0.5% SDS and 5 minutes of boiling, then counted by liquid scintillation. The singly-primed template (ie. with only Primer #1 annealed) had a 5’ 30-nt extension of ssDNA that could bind RPA since this DNA substrate shared the same template as the 10-nt gap DNA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare no competing interests</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77469-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The 3D cryo-EM maps of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RFC−DNA and RFC−PCNA−DNA complexes have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank with accession codes EMD-25872 (RFC−PCNA−DNA1−DNA2), EMD-25873 (RFC−open PCNA−DNA1), EMD-25874 (RFC−closed PCNA−DNA1), EMD-25875 (RFC−DNA1−DNA2), and EMD-25876 (RFC−DNA1).

RFC/PCNA binds to a double strand-single strand DNA junction with a 3'-recessed end, with the DNA passing through a central chamber in the five-subunit protein. The current paper reports structures of RFC/PCNA with two separate DNA molecules, one containing the well characterized 3'-recessed DNA and surprisingly, a second 5'-recessed DNA outside the central chamber. The paper is an important addition to understanding RFC function, particularly in DNA repair.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77469.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qz8b764</institution-id><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qz8b764</institution-id><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Burgers</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University, St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Jeruzalmi</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00wmhkr98</institution-id><institution>City College of New York</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.04.479194">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.04.479194v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Burgers (Reviewer #2); David Jeruzalmi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The studies in Figure 5 report the affinity of gapped DNA with either a 10 base gap or a 50 base gap, the latter with RPA loaded. Since RPA has two DNA biding modes, binding to an 8 base ssDNA and a 30 base ssDNA, the experiments in Figure 5 should be repeated: in panel (b) adding RPA to the 10 base gap DNA and in panel (c) performing a reaction with no added RPA. The reason is that RPA could stimulate the loading of PCNA onto the 10 base gap DNA and it could stimulate the binding of RFC/PCNA specifically to the 3'-recessed ssDNA/dsDNA junction, as shown previously (Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991, J. Biol Chem. 266: 1950-1960).</p><p>2. The use of the word &quot;novel&quot; in the title is not appropriate since the amino-terminus of RFC1 has been shown to bind DNA previously. This paper only clarifies how it binds and provides function. Words such as novel should be reserved for truly unique findings.</p><p>3. The observation of the ring closed form of RFC-ATPgammaS-DNA-PCNA is unexpected because it shows that closure can occur before hydrolysis and the main function of hydrolysis is the release of RFC. However, kinetic studies (e.g. a 2012 Hingorani JMB paper) show that with ATP, hydrolysis precedes closure and this should be clarified in the paper.</p><p>4. Biochemical studies with the isolated BRCT domain show that it binds partial double-stranded DNA with a 5'-phosphorylated junction with much higher affinity than the same DNA lacking the 5'-phosphate. The 1998 NAR Hardy study and the 2010 Siegal paper describing these studies have been referenced, but they were not discussed. Why were the cryoEM studies carried out with DNAs lacking the 5'-phosphate?</p><p>5. Can the orientation of the 5'-DNA molecule be defined as unambiguous in these structures? If so, and the 5'-OH is not engaged in interactions, what sets the orientation as 5' at the BRCT domain?</p><p>6. In Figure 3D, it appears that the 5'-junction does not contact specific residues in the BRCT. We need to see better views of these interactions. And the same for the structure with the open PCNA. This is the major point in the paper and it is not well presented. Interestingly, the model structure 2K7F from Siegal shows that the 5'-phosphate is engaged in binding positive residues, as perhaps could be expected from imposing a high binding energy for such an interaction in the modeling program. Could the authors comment on whether the chain direction for the second DNA molecule could be ascertained directly from the EM maps? Still, this entire, critical point deserves more attention than it has been given.</p><p>7. Two experiments have been included in supplementary 9 and 10, which indicate that the presence of phosphate does not affect DNA binding. But in these studies, the bulk of binding energy comes from the ATPgammaS-clamploader-PCNA interactions with DNA. What about the binding of RFC to DNA in the absence of ATP or ATPgammaS?</p><p>8. Biochemical analysis RFC-PCNA on DNA with nicks and varying length gaps.</p><p>a. The authors conclude that RFC binds tightly to all the substrates tested but binds with a two-fold (~15 nM vs ~30 nM) higher affinity for DNA molecules with gaps that have five or more bases.</p><p>b. The 5 nucleotide or large gaps compares well with the structural finding.</p><p>c. The presence of PCNA in the measurement reveals tighter binding than in its absence, but with the same trend as seen when PCNA was omitted.</p><p>d. Analysis of an RFC ensemble whose RFC1 lacks the BRCT domain revealed 2-fold tighter binding (16 nM vs. 32 nM) when BRCT was present than when not.</p><p>In view of the extensive set of contacts to DNA mediated by the BRCT domain, it is surprising that there is not a greater difference in Kd between primer-template and gapped DNA structures. Likewise, why does deletion of BRCT hardly change the affinity for DNA?</p><p>9. The Kd values for RFC (-/+ PCNA) binding of various DNA structures (Figure 4, etc) were calculated from experiments where RFC was titrated against a DNA concentration held fixed at 10 nM. Given that the measured Kds values were in the ~15-40 nM range, might the fixed concentration of DNA be too high to reveal an accurate Kd? Might this explain why little or difference in Kd was found?</p><p>If maintaining the fixed concentration of DNA at 10 nM is required by the experiment, other approaches to extracting (perhaps) more accurate Kds might be found here:</p><p>Jarmoskaite, I., AlSadhan, I., Vaidyanathan, P.

We also cite the Tsurimoto and Stillman citation given above. As the reviewer’s anticipated, RPA stimulates PCNA loading at a 3’ terminus, and also at a 30 nt gap to which RPA can bind in a normal mode. At a 10 nt gap, the RPA gave did not appear to stimulate PCNA loading. Overall, the results of the figure demonstrate the functionality of the 5’ recessed end in clamp loading for both sized gaps compared to singly primed DNA (i.e. lacking a gap), which was the original intent of the earlier figure. The new data regarding + and – RPA is important to document and we thank the reviewers for this constructive comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, kinetic studies (e.g. a 2012 Hingorani JMB paper) show that with ATP, hydrolysis precedes closure and this should be clarified in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarify this in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Structural work of this study and others (Gaubitz et al., 2022) show that the clamp can close around dsDNA without ATP hydrolysis, while ensemble studies have indicated that stable clamp closure occurs after ATP hydrolysis (Anderson et al., 2009; Bowman et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2017; Marzahn et al., 2015; Sakato et al., 2012b; Trakselis et al., 2003). Both the structural and bulk results may be correct considering that “stable” closure of the clamp may require ATP dependent RFC dissociation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Biochemical studies with the isolated BRCT domain show that it binds partial double-stranded DNA with a 5’-phosphorylated junction with much higher affinity than the same DNA lacking the 5’-phosphate. The 1998 NAR Hardy study and the 2010 Siegal paper describing these studies have been referenced, but they were not discussed. Why were the cryoEM studies carried out with DNAs lacking the 5’-phosphate?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have a good point. The main reason that most of our work did not use 5’ P is because neither of the earlier papers in 2003 that documented 5’ 911 loading by Rad24-RFC and RAD17-RFC used a 5’-P (or if they did we did not see this in the methods). We therefore played it safe by using the same 5’ OH end as the early biochemical studies. For example, it was possible that phosphatase action might occur in the cell to produce a 5’ OH before the RAD-RFC clamp loaders functioned. On hindsight we would have used a 5’ P.</p><p>The early biochemical studies on the isolated BRCT domain of RFC1 binding to 5’-P-DNA mentions a Kd value of 10 nM, but it does not document this, and instead says: “data not shown”. Thus we are unsure if binding measurements were correctly evaluated. But assuming the Kd measurements were correct, and to inform readers, we have now added the following in the Discussion part 3:</p><p>“We note that early studies using the isolated BRCT domain of RFC1 indicate a very tight affinity (K of 10 nM) to recessed 5ʹ phosphate DNA (Kobayashi et al., 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2006). Combined with the very different structure predicted for the 5’—DNA bound BRCT domain from NMR studies (Kobayashi et al., 2010), it is possible that the free BRCT domain has a unique structure that binds 5ʹ–P DNA tightly, and then changes its conformation upon binding to the shoulder of Rfc1. Consistent with this speculation, we see very little difference (i.e. about 2-fold) in binding to DNA of RFC and RFC 86 lacking the N-terminal BRCT region. Indeed, a conformation change that favors a lower affinity of RFC to DNA may facilitate the ejection of RFC from PCNA-DNA that is needed for PCNA to bind other factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the orientation of the 5’-DNA molecule be defined as unambiguous in these structures? If so, and the 5’-OH is not engaged in interactions, what sets the orientation as 5’ at the BRCT domain?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the 5’ DNA orientation is unambiguous from the CryoEM resolution and bp identification as mentioned in the text.</p><p>As shown in the new Supplementary Figure 7, the 5’ OH is located inside the 5’-P binding pocket. The 5’-DNA2 orientation is not determined by the specific interaction between the 5’-P and the binding cavity of the Rfc1. It is instead determined by the exact location of the 5’-end (OH or P), which in turn specifies the exact locations of the major and minor grooves to which the Rfc1 binds. In other words, the whole extended binding groove for the 5’-DNA2, in particular the cavity location for the 5-end, sets the orientation of the shoulder DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3D, it appears that the 5’-junction does not contact specific residues in the BRCT. We need to see better views of these interactions. And the same for the structure with the open PCNA. This is the major point in the paper and it is not well presented. Interestingly, the model structure 2K7F from Siegal shows that the 5’-phosphate is engaged in binding positive residues, as perhaps could be expected from imposing a high binding energy for such an interaction in the odelling program. Could the authors comment on whether the chain direction for the second DNA molecule could be ascertained directly from the EM maps? Still, this entire, critical point deserves more attention than it has been given.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and have added a new figure (Supplemental Figure 7) to illustrate the BRCT interaction with the 5’ end and more specifically, the cavity surrounding the 5’ end of DNA2 and in comparison, with the 5’ end cavity in Rad24. This new description is added in the revised text as follows:</p><p>“The recessed 5ʹ end is in a cavity lined by three basic residues, Lys-208 of the BRCT domain and His-556 and His-659 of the Rfc1 collar domain. The cavity is larger than necessary for accommodating the 5ʹ-OH used in this study but fits the 5ʹphosphate snuggly with two potential H-bonds (Supplementary Figure 7a-b). The cavity for the 5ʹ-recessed end in the alternative clamp loader Rad24-RFC is very similar and is also lined by one Lys residue and two His residues (Supplementary Figure 7c).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Two experiments have been included in supplementary 9 and 10, which indicate that the presence of phosphate does not affect DNA binding. But in these studies, the bulk of binding energy comes from the ATPgammaS-clamploader-PCNA interactions with DNA. What about the binding of RFC to DNA in the absence of ATP or ATPgammaS?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have now examined RFC binding to a 10 mer gap DNA plus and minus nucleotide. The results are given in the new Supplementary Figure 10 and shows that ATPgS is required for RFC to bind to DNA. This conclusion is also consistent with our earlier published work (Johnson et al., J Biol Chem <italic>281</italic>, 35531-35543), showing that ADP does not support DNA binding by RFC, and this earlier work is now cited in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have included a Supplementary figure showing the data of the comparison of RFC binding to DNA in the presence or absence of ATPgS using a 10mer gapped DNA. (i.e. Supplemental Figure 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Biochemical analysis RFC-PCNA on DNA with nicks and varying length gaps.</p><p>a. The authors conclude that RFC binds tightly to all the substrates tested but binds with a two-fold (~15 nM vs ~30 nM) higher affinity for DNA molecules with gaps that have five or more bases.</p><p>b. The 5 nucleotide or large gaps compares well with the structural finding.</p><p>c. The presence of PCNA in the measurement reveals tighter binding than in its absence, but with the same trend as seen when PCNA was omitted.</p><p>d. Analysis of an RFC ensemble whose RFC1 lacks the BRCT domain revealed 2-fold tighter binding (16 nM vs. 32 nM) when BRCT was present than when not.</p><p>In view of the extensive set of contacts to DNA mediated by the BRCT domain, it is surprising that there is not a greater difference in Kd between primer-template and gapped DNA structures. Likewise, why does deletion of BRCT hardly change the affinity for DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question: “Why does deletion of the BRCT domain only change the affinity of RFC for DNA by 2-fold?” One possibility is the BRCT domain does not contribute very much to the binding affinity of RFC-5’ DNA. But prior literature (Kobayashi et al., 2006) reports that the BRCT domain binds 5’ DNA at around 10 nM, although this was reported as “data not shown” in the original report, so it is difficult to evaluate it. However, one can propose the following. In a later report (Kobayashi et al., 2010), the same group predicted a preliminary structure of the isolated BRCT domain using NMR data, and their proposed structure is very different from the BRCT domain in our cryoEM derived structure of RFC-DNA-PCNA in which the BRCT domain is not free, but is instead on the shoulder of Rfc1 with 5’ DNA bound. Thus, perhaps the isolated BRCT domain has a unique structure in solution, before it binds the shoulder, and this alternative BRCT structure might bind DNA tight (e.g. maybe to recruit it to RFC), followed by a conformation change and lower affinity upon binding the shoulder of RFC. In this connection, it is important RFC does not bind too tight to 5’ DNA, or else it would not easily eject from PCNA-DNA, required for other proteins to function with PCNA.</p><p>The modifications to the manuscript that address this are those described above in point #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The Kd values for RFC (-/+ PCNA) binding of various DNA structures (Figure 4, etc) were calculated from experiments where RFC was titrated against a DNA concentration held fixed at 10 nM. Given that the measured Kds values were in the ~15-40 nM range, might the fixed concentration of DNA be too high to reveal an accurate Kd? Might this explain why little or difference in Kd was found?</p><p>If maintaining the fixed concentration of DNA at 10 nM is required by the experiment, other approaches to extracting (perhaps) more accurate Kds might be found here:</p><p>Jarmoskaite, I., AlSadhan, I., Vaidyanathan, P. P. and Herschlag, D. How to measure and evaluate binding affinities. eLife 9, e57264 (2020).</p></disp-quote><p>As anticipated by the reviewers, we performed the work at the lowest DNA concentration (10 nM) at which we could obtain confident fluorescent readings, while we maintained the ability to cover an extensive range of concentration points (from 1/20 x to 24 x). We appreciate the Herschlag reference, and have typically used the alternative quadratic equation described in Herschlag (equation 5 in his paper), in our past studies. The instrument we used for fluorescence measurements of this report had the GraphPad single site equation, which is actually a quite high end analysis, but in response to the reviewer’s comments we purchased a software package OriginPro software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA), and re-analyzed all our titration data using the single site quadratic equation as described in equation 5 of Hershlag’s paper (Jarmoskaite et al., eLife 2020) as is now described in the revised methods section of the revised paper. We have input all the binding data and have performed the alterative curve fitting and replaced the main text Figure 4, and the all the detailed titration plots in the Supp Figs, with the new curve fitting of the data. The results are not very different from our earlier submission, and do not change the conclusions, but perhaps the apparent KD values might be more accurate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
