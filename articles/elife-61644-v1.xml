microbial communities to make leavened bread for thousands of years, but only a small fraction of global sourdough biodiversity has been characterized. Working with a community-scientist network of bread bakers, we determined the microbial diversity of 500 sourdough starters from four continents. In sharp contrast with widespread assumptions, we found little evidence for biogeographic patterns in starter communities. Strong co-occurrence patterns observed in situ and recreated in vitro demonstrate that microbial interactions shape sourdough community structure. Variation in dough rise rates and aromas were largely explained by acetic acid bacteria, a mostly overlooked group of sourdough microbes. Our study reveals the extent of microbial diversity in an ancient fermented food across diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sourdough bread is an ancient fermented food that has sustained humans around the world for thousands of years. It is made from a sourdough ‘starter culture’ which is maintained, portioned, and shared among bread bakers around the world. The starter culture contains a community of microbes made up of yeasts and bacteria, which ferment the carbohydrates in flour and produce the carbon dioxide gas that makes the bread dough rise before baking.</p><p>The different acids and enzymes produced by the microbial culture affect the bread’s flavor, texture and shelf life. However, for such a dependable staple, sourdough bread cultures and the mixture of microbes they contain have scarcely been characterized. Previous studies have looked at the composition of starter cultures from regions within Europe. But there has never been a comprehensive study of how the microbial diversity of sourdough starters varies across and between continents.</p><p>To investigate this, Landis, Oliverio et al. used genetic sequencing to characterize the microbial communities of sourdough starters from the homes of 500 bread bakers in North America, Europe and Australasia. Bread makers often think their bread’s unique qualities are due to the local environment of where the sourdough starter was made. However, Landis, Oliverio et al. found that geographical location did not correlate with the diversity of the starter cultures studied. The data revealed that a group of microbes called acetic acid bacteria, which had been overlooked in past research, were relatively common in starter cultures. Moreover, starters with a greater abundance of this group of bacteria produced bread with a strong vinegar aroma and caused dough to rise at a slower rate.</p><p>This research demonstrates which species of bacteria and yeast are most commonly found in sourdough starters, and suggests geographical location has little influence on the microbial diversity of these cultures. Instead, the diversity of microbes likely depends more on how the starter culture was made and how it is maintained over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sourdough</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>microbial community</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1715553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landis</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kfoury</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Biango-Daniels</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakunala</surname><given-names>Shravya</given-names></name><name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>Kinsey</given-names></name><name><surname>Robbat</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolfe</surname><given-names>Benjamin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1319293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKenney</surname><given-names>Erin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>Lauren M</given-names></name><name><surname>Madden</surname><given-names>Anne A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Robert R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landis</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliverio</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliverio</surname><given-names>Angela M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the most comprehensive survey of sourdough starter biodiversity, this work identifies processes that control the diversity and function of sourdough microbiomes at a continental scale.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sourdough bread is a globally distributed fermented food that is made using a microbial community of yeasts and bacteria. The sourdough microbiome is maintained in a starter that is used to inoculate dough for bread production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) in the starter produce CO<sub>2</sub> that leavens the bread. Microbial activities including the production of organic acids and extracellular enzymes also impact bread flavor, texture, shelf-stability, and nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Vuyst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gobbetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen and Schieberle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salim-ur-Rehman et al., 2006</xref>). Starters can be generated de novo by fermenting flour and water or acquired as established starters from community members or commercial sources. Home-scale fermentation of sourdough is an ancient and historically important practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cappelle et al., 2013</xref>) that experienced a cultural resurgence during the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Easterbrook-Smith, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The distribution of sourdough starters sampled in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the process of serial transfer of a sourdough starter.

Previous studies have primarily focused on starters from regions within Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vuyst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gänzle and Ripari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minervini et al., 2014</xref>) and the diversity of sourdough starters in North America is poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kline and Sugihara, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sugihara et al., 1971</xref>). Most previous studies have applied a range of culture-based techniques to characterize sourdough microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vuyst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gänzle and Ripari, 2016</xref>) making it difficult to understand distributions of sourdough bacterial and fungal taxa due to the variability and biases in these approaches. Sourdough starters are maintained in many households, but these starters have generally been overlooked in previous studies which have focused on large bakeries and industrial settings. Household starters are likely distinct from those found in bakeries due to a greater heterogeneity in environments, production practices, and ingredients.</p><p>Two major factors, geographic location and maintenance practices, are often invoked as major drivers of sourdough biodiversity. Sourdough communities in the same region may be similar in composition due to restricted dispersal of microbes or in response to regional microclimates. Producers often tout their breads’ distinct regional properties, crediting the environment for unique bread characteristics. There is some evidence of local geographic structure of sourdough microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheirlinck et al., 2007b</xref>), but biogeographic patterns of sourdough diversity have not been quantified at a continental-scale. Likewise, experimental evidence from individual sourdoughs suggests that abiotic conditions (process parameters including differences in starter maintenance techniques, ingredients, and environmental conditions) and microbial interactions can impact starter community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vuyst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gänzle and Ripari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minervini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ripari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Kerrebroeck et al., 2017</xref>), but the relative importance of these processes across diverse starters is unknown.</p><p>Through the collaborative power of a global network of community scientists, we collected 500 sourdough starters from across the world with dense sampling of the United States (United States = 429; Canada = 29; Europe n = 24; Australia and New Zealand = 17; and Thailand = 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to comprehensively characterize the microbial diversity of household sourdough starters. These starters varied greatly in their reported ages and maintenance histories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>). Through both cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods, we revealed the ecological distributions of widespread sourdough yeasts and bacteria. By analyzing a broad suite of starter metadata, our intensive sampling identified the roles of geography and process parameters in shaping starter diversity.</p><p>Using synthetic sourdough communities, we identified a dynamic network of species interactions within sourdough microbiomes that helps explain the distributions of major yeasts and bacteria. We also determined linkages between sourdough starter microbial diversity and baking-relevant functions including the rate of dough rise and volatile organic compound (VOC) production. This study is the first to combine a large-scale survey of sourdough starter microbial diversity with quantitative analysis of the factors that shape the composition and function of starter microbiomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diversity of sourdough starters</title><p>We first identified the microbial communities of sourdough starters by 16S and ITS rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of samples that were shipped to us and frozen upon arrival. When considering both fermentation-relevant microbes (yeasts, LAB, and AAB) as well as other microbial taxa, each starter sample contained a median of seven bacterial and 35 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). LAB (order: Lactobacillales) and AAB (order: Rhodospirillales) together comprised over 97% of bacterial reads (per sample mean), with yeasts (order: Saccharomycetales) comprising over 70% of fungal reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">2</xref>). The other fungi and bacteria detected were common indoor and outdoor molds, plant pathogens, and plant endophytes as well as microbes associated with human skin, drinking water, and soil. Unless otherwise indicated, we did not include these environmental microbes in our further analyses because of their limited roles in sourdough fermentation.</p><p>Sourdough communities exhibited consistent patterns of strong species dominance or co-occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Many communities were dominated by a single yeast and/or bacterial species with a median of three LAB/AAB and one yeast per starter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Our unprecedented scale of sampling demonstrates how sourdough maintenance and acquisition practices as well as microbial interactions can impact the biodiversity of starters. We also reveal novel structure-function linkages in this ancient fermented food. In combination with thousands of years of traditional knowledge about how to make good bread, these results provide possible management strategies for manipulating starter diversity.</p><p>Contradicting widespread beliefs about the regionality of sourdough microbiomes (e.g. the famous ‘San Francisco sourdough’), our comprehensive sampling demonstrates that geographic location does not determine sourdough microbial composition. Previous studies using limited sampling have suggested that sourdough starters can vary across geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheirlinck et al., 2007b</xref>), but we are unaware of other studies that have rigorously explored sourdough microbiome biogeographic patterns in a distance-decay framework. The limited role of geography in explaining sourdough diversity may be driven by the widespread movement of starters across large geographic distances through starter sharing or commercial distribution. Flour, a major potential source of microbes in de novo starters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minervini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reese et al., 2020</xref>), is also moved across large spatial scales. This geographic homogenization of starter and flour microbes likely swamps out any regional differences in potential yeasts or bacteria that can disperse into starters.</p><p>Biogeographic patterns of sourdough microbes may exist at finer-scale resolutions than those used in the current study. We used amplicon sequencing to assess taxonomic diversity of sourdough because we were interested in species-level distributions of sourdough microbes. We acknowledge that intraspecific strain diversity plays important roles in many fermented foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Khoury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niccum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walsh et al., 2017</xref>), that microbial strains may have unique biogeographic patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gayevskiy and Goddard, 2012</xref>), and that amplicon sequencing does not typically have the resolution to fully capture strain-level diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turaev and Rattei, 2016</xref>). However, previous studies of other ecosystem types using similar amplicon sequencing approaches and at similar spatial scales have found strong distance-decay relationships of both fungal and bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finkel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talbot et al., 2014</xref>). Future work using shotgun metagenomic sequencing or whole-genome sequencing of widespread sourdough microbes may reveal more nuanced biogeographic patterns in sourdough biodiversity.</p><p>Relative to bakeries, home producers likely follow less strict and sustained regimens for starter maintenance; they may vary techniques over time or keep imperfect records in regard to reported metadata. Still, process parameters explained some of the variation we detected through amplicon sequencing, with individual taxa being significantly associated with certain parameters. For example, <italic>L. sanfranciscensis</italic> was prevalent in older starters and starters purchased by participants from a business, which supports the hypothesis that it is selected for by bakers over generations of sourdough production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gänzle and Ripari, 2016</xref>). Future studies that explicitly test how starter composition changes over time and across geographies in home fermentations are needed to better understand selection and stability in these ecosystems.</p><p>The concordance between our amplicon sequencing and competition experiment suggest that commonly or uncommonly observed species pairs may be due to complementary or competitive inter-species interactions. An important caveat is that the single representative isolates used in these experiments do not capture strain-level genomic and metabolic diversity, which has been shown to produce different competitive outcomes among and between strains of these sourdough taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogalski et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the pairwise interaction assay that we used does not capture the potential for interactions between three or more species. Though pairwise competitions have been shown to be predictive of higher-order interactions in simple microbial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>), outcomes of interactions in more complex synthetic sourdough communities with three or more species may differ from what we observed here. Future studies that use ‘leave-one-out’ approaches can identify potential roles of multidimensional microbial interactions in sourdough microbiomes.</p><p>We observed many striking microbial interactions in our synthetic system that were not predicted by sequencing. For example, <italic>W. anomalus</italic> was a strong competitor in vitro in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vrancken et al., 2010</xref>), but it is not frequently found across the starters we sampled and co-occurred with other yeast species in the sourdoughs that were sequenced. This work adds to an existing body of evidence suggesting that <italic>W. anomalus</italic> is strongly competitive in sourdough, but may be dispersal limited, and/or that environmental conditions or multispecies interactions in home sourdough starters mitigate its competitive performance in situ.</p><p>Our integrative functional analysis of starter microbiomes highlights the disproportionate effects of AAB in shaping the sensory and leavening properties of sourdough. These bacteria have been historically underappreciated in most studies of sourdough microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vuyst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gänzle and Ripari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Kerrebroeck et al., 2017</xref>). The limited use of media that can selectively grow AAB and the lack of metagenomic approaches in previous studies are two potential explanations for the underestimation of AAB abundances in the literature. Based on our findings, we argue that the relative abundance of this group should be considered a key factor in predicting the functional attributes of sourdough. However, the influence of AAB on sensory properties and dough rise is not straightforward and the correlation between percentage of AAB and vinegar sensory properties as well as slower dough rise rates was not seen in all samples. Further studies are needed to understand how VOCs produced by AAB contribute to the quality of baked sourdough bread.</p><p>Sourdough starters exemplify a unique type of microbial community: a top-down engineered microbiome that is stably maintained for many years. As our co-occurrence analysis and synthetic community validation revealed, these simple countertop microbial ecosystems provide ample opportunities to identify processes that structure microbiomes. Further experimental approaches that manipulate other dimensions of sourdough, including phages, genomic heterogeneity, and evolutionary dynamics, will continue to uncover mechanisms of microbiome assembly in this ancient fermented food.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

xlink:href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/sourdough/">http://robdunnlab.com/projects/sourdough/</ext-link>). Community scientists were recruited through web sites, social media, and email campaigns worldwide January-March 2017. They were directed to an online Informed Consent form approved by the North Carolina State University’s Human Research Committee (IRB Approval Reference #10590). Each participant first answered an extensive online questionnaire consisting of 40 questions related to the source, history, maintenance, and use of their sourdough starter. Upon completion, participants were assigned a unique ID. Participants were instructed to triple-bag ~4 oz of their freshly fed sourdough starter in a new resealable plastic bag, label the bag with their participant ID, and then ship it to Tufts University. In order to preserve participant confidentiality, samples were reassigned a new Sample ID number upon arrival. Each starter sample was subdivided into two subsamples: (1) 1 mL was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and stored at −80°C until samples could be processed for DNA sequencing, (2) glycerol stocks (15% glycerol) were made of each sample by combining equal parts sample and 30% glycerol and stored at −80°C for competition and VOC analyses. In total, we received, processed, and sequenced 560 sourdough starter samples with completed surveys from participants. After quality filtering and rarefying amplicon datasets (see below), 500 were retained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Amplicon 16S and ITS rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing</title><p>To characterize the bacterial and fungal communities of sourdough starters, we followed previously described molecular marker gene sequencing protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramirez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oliverio et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, we extracted DNA from 2 mL sub-samples using a Qiagen PowerSoil DNA extraction kit, and then amplified extracted DNA with barcoded primers to enable multiplexed sequencing in duplicate, using the 515 f/806 r for bacteria and ITS1f/ITS2 for fungi. Amplicon concentrations were normalized and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform at the University of Colorado Next Generation Sequencing Facility with 2 × 150 and 2 × 250 bp paired-end chemistry for bacterial and fungal sequencing, respectively. We sequenced multiple DNA extractions and PCR negative controls to check for contamination.</p><p>Raw sequences were processed with the DADA2 pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callahan et al., 2016</xref>). The DADA2 pipeline detects ASVs as opposed to clustering sequences by percent sequence similarity. Briefly, sequences with N’s were removed prior to primer removal with Cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin, 2011</xref>). Then sequences were quality filtered. For the bacterial sequence data, we used the following parameters: truncLen = 150 for forward reads and 140 for reverse reads, maxEE = 1, and truncQ = 11 and for the fungal data we used the following parameters: minLen = 50, maxEE = 2, truncQ = 2 and maxN = 0. The parameters are different for 16S and ITS due to the variable nature of the ITS region. After quality filtering, sequence variants were inferred with the DADA2 algorithm, and then we merged paired-end reads. We removed chimeras and taxonomy was determined using the Silva database for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quast et al., 2013</xref>) and the UNITE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nilsson et al., 2019</xref>) for fungi. We then filtered out reads assigned to either chloroplasts or mitochondria from the bacterial taxa table, along with reads that were unassigned at the phylum level. Likewise, we filtered out fungal reads unassigned at the phylum or class levels. We then rarefied the ASV tables to 1260 bacterial reads per sample and 4000 fungal reads per sample and converted to percent relative abundances for downstream analyses. We retained 500 sourdough samples for analyses (e.g. those samples for which we obtained both bacterial and fungal amplicon data).</p><p>To obtain high-quality taxonomic species assignments for LAB and AAB and to facilitate comparisons to longer 16S rRNA sequences of isolates, we built phylogenetic trees for both bacterial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We included high-quality (≥1200 bp) isolate sequences for both groups from the ribosomal database project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2014</xref>). In order to preserve continuity between our analysis and previously published studies of sourdough ecology, we refer to the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species by their traditional names rather than recently proposed taxonomic reassignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). To obtain assignments, we created alignments with MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar, 2004</xref>) and then built phylogenetic trees with raxml-HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>) with the GTR-GAMMA model.

This mixture was immediately centrifuged (Beckman GS-6 Series) at x3000 rpm for 30 min (24°C) and the pellet was discarded. The CBFM was then filtered to exclude microbial cells through Falcon disposable filter funnels (0.20 µm pore size).</p><p>To quantify growth of each yeast and LAB alone, we standardized input inocula to 2,000 CFUs per 10 µL. Inocula were standardized by diluting 15% glycerol stocks (stored at −80°C) that had a known concentration of CFUs with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We inoculated 10 µL of each species into 190 µL of CBFM in individual wells of a 96-well plate (n = 5). After cultures grew statically for 48 hr, cultures were homogenized and then transferred 10 µL of the culture into 190 µL of fresh CBFM. We repeated these transfers a total of six times.

These 40 starters spanned the diversity we encountered in sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); we limited our functional analysis to 40 starters due to practical constraints in annotating VOC data. Rather than directly using frozen starters which were shipped to us from community scientists, we first grew up samples in a ‘pre-inoculum’ that was used to inoculate doughs for functional analysis. We did this to ensure that all cultures were at comparable growth stages prior to inoculation. The flour used was the same mixture used for CBFM (100% whole wheat and all-purpose flour combined in equal proportion 1:1 by mass), but it was prepared differently in order to approximate the moisture content of dough. Flour was autoclaved on a gravity cycle for 20 min to reduce microbial load. Glycerol-stocked communities (200 µL) were added to 1.8 mL sterile distilled water and 2 g autoclaved flour in three replicate communities for each starter pre-inoculum (n = 3 captured the variability we encountered in pilot experiments). Pre-inoculum was mixed with flour and sterile water using a sterile wooden dowel until no dry flour was visible. The mixture was briefly centrifuged in a 15 mL culture tube (to remove dough stuck to the side of the tube walls) and then incubated for 72 hr at room temperature. Inoculum was created by mixing sterile water (4 mL) and pre-inoculum (~4 g) and was vortexed to homogenize. Autoclaved flour (2 g), water (1600 µL), and inoculum (400 µL) were added to 15 mL falcon tubes and mixed using sterile wooden dowels and then briefly centrifuged to remove from the sides of tubes.</p><p>To confirm that the microbial community that formed in these experimental sourdoughs (grown from the 40 starters selected for functional analyses) resembled the sourdough starters from which they originated, we compared microbial community composition between shotgun metagenomic data collected from experimental sourdoughs and the corresponding amplicon sequence data from the original sourdoughs. We calculated Bray-Curtis dissimilarities for the 40 samples from: (1) the initial amplicon data and (2) 16S taxonomic annotations from the shotgun metagenomic data from the experimental samples. We then compared the two dissimilarity matrices with a Mantel test (based on Spearman rank correlation and 999 permutations). We also correlated relative abundances of some of the most dominant taxa including <italic>L. sanfranciscensis</italic>, <italic>L. brevis</italic>, <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, <italic>P. damnosus</italic>, and also the total percent of AAB detected in each sample. Initial and experimental communities were similar in terms of their overall bacterial composition (Mantel ρ = 0.55, p≤0.001) and abundances of common taxa (<italic>L. sanfranciscensis</italic> ρ = 0.64, p≤0.001; <italic>L. brevis</italic> ρ = 0.50, p≤0.001; <italic>L. plantarum</italic> ρ = 0.70, p≤0.001; <italic>P. damnosus</italic> ρ = 0.47,≤0.001; and % total AAB ρ = 0.75, p≤0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Measuring rates of dough rise</title><p>Dough rise was recorded with a Canon EOS 70D DSLR camera set to image every two minutes for 36 hr. The camera was centered at the vertical and horizontal midpoint of each dough batch. Timelapse photos were compiled, cropped, and enhanced for contrast using Adobe AfterEffects. The top of every dough was tracked through each frame in the MatLab-based digitizing program DLTdv5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hedrick, 2008</xref>). The height of each culture tube (T<sub>h</sub>) was measured in pixels in Adobe Photoshop. Changes in dough height (∆X) were normalized to account for distance from the camera and differences in starting height using the following formula: ∆X = (X-X<sub>º</sub>)/T<sub>h</sub>. Distances relative to tube length were converted to absolute distance (mm/hr) by multiplying values by the dimensions of culture tubes (103 mm). Before fitting curves, data was truncated to cut instances where dough fell by more than 5 percent of its maximum height. For each replicate, a logistic growth curve was fitted, and growth rate (r) was calculated with the R package Growthcurver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sprouffske and Wagner, 2016</xref>), with a goodness of fit cutoff for r values of p≤0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>VOC collection and sensory panel</title><p>Sourdough starter volatiles were collected using headspace sorptive extraction, which is an equilibrium-driven sample enrichment technique employing a polydimethylsiloxane coated magnetic stir bar (commercially known as Twister, Gerstel). Stir bars (10 mm long x 0.5 mm thick) were suspended in the headspace of each sample using a magnet on the outside of the sample tube cap to suspend the stir bar above the sample. Three replicates of each community were sampled for 24 hr (beginning 12 hr after inoculation). After collection, the stir bars were removed and spiked with 1 μL of 10 ppm ethylbenzene-d10, which was used as an internal standard (Restek). Relative peak areas (analyte/internal standard) served to measure relative concentrations of each compound in the sample. Sterile deionized water and autoclaved flour were analyzed to measure chemical interferences from background samples. Compounds in the starters measured at concentrations less than or equal to concentrations in the water/flour samples were eliminated from the data.</p><p>Stir bars were thermally desorbed into the GC column in the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Agilent models 7890A/5975C). The instrument was equipped with an automated multi-purpose sampler (Gerstel) that transferred stir bars to the thermal desorber (TDU)/programmable temperature vaporization inlet (CIS). The TDU (Gerstel) provided transfer of the VOCs from the stir bar to the CIS by heating it from 40°C (0.70 min) to 275°C (3 min) at 600 °C/min, using 50 mL/min of helium. After 0.1 min the CIS, operating in solvent vent mode, was heated from −100°C to 275°C (5 min) at 12 °C/s. The GC column (30 m x 250 μm x 0.25 μm HP5-MS, Agilent) was heated from 40°C (1 min) to 280°C at 5 °C/min with 1.2 mL/min of constant helium flow. MS operating conditions were: 40 to 350 <italic>m/z</italic> at 10 scans/s, 70 eV electron impact source energy, with ion source and quadrupole temperatures of 230°C and 150°C, respectively.</p><p>The retention index (RI) for each compound in the sample was calculated based on a standard mixture of C<sub>7</sub> to C<sub>30</sub> n-alkanes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Approximately 300 reference standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific, Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA), TCI (Tokyo, Japan), Acros Organics (Pittsburgh, PA) and MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA) to confirm compound identity.</p><p>Detailed descriptions of data analysis procedures have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kfoury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robbat et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, Ion Analytics (Gerstel) data analysis software was used to analyze the data. Peak identification was based on the match between sample and reference compound RI and mass spectrum (positive identification) and between sample and compounds found in NIST05/17, Adams Essential Oil Library, and the literature (tentative identification). In instances where no identification was possible, a numerical identifier was assigned such that the data can be used in other metabolomic studies and to capture knowledge of elution and mass spectral profiles should these compounds become important enough to warrant independent collection and analysis. Compound identity is assigned as follows. First, peak scans were required to be constant for five or more consecutive scans (≤20% difference). Second, the level of scan-to-scan variance (SSV) had to be ≤5. The SSV represents the relative error of each scan compared to all other mass spectrum scans in the peak. The smaller the difference, i.e., the closer the SSV is to zero, the better the MS agreement. Third, the Q-value was set to ≥93. The Q-value is an integer between 1 and 100; it measures the total ratio deviation of the absolute value calculated by dividing the difference between the expected and observed ion ratios by the expected ion ratio, then multiplied by 100 for each ion across the peak. The closer the value is to 100, the higher the certainty of accuracy between sample and reference compound spectrum (positive) or sample and database/library spectrum (tentative identification). Finally, the Q-ratio represents the ratio of the molecular ion intensity to confirmatory ion intensities across the peak; it also must be ≤20%. When all of the individual criteria are met, they form a single criterion of acceptance and the software assigns a compound name or numerical identifier.</p><p>There were two sets of sensory descriptors that were used in our study: those that were provided by individuals at the time of sample collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>), and those that a trained sensory panel used during the functional analysis of a subset of sourdough starters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). We used a simplified system with the larger set of study participants. Moreover, our trained sensory panel was able to distinguish additional sensory notes that we did not anticipate when we sent out the survey to participants. For the initial survey, the aroma characteristics were guided by a list of aroma characteristics commonly used when discussing aroma notes in maltose-based fermented products with consumers. The list was reduced and condensed for survey purposes. For example, ‘medicinal’ was used to combine the descriptors ‘phenolic antiseptic’ and ‘solvent nail polish,’ and the term ‘rose’ was translated to the more general ‘floral.’ The descriptor ‘musty’ was additionally included to account for the ‘farmyard’ aroma and the potential contribution of VOCs from filamentous fungal growth.</p><p>For our detailed functional analysis of the subset of 40 starter samples, sourdough starter aromas were assessed after 36 hr of incubation by a trained and certified descriptive sensory analysis panel from the Tufts University Sensory and Science Center. Samples were coded, randomized, and served blind to the panel one at a time. The panel used modified flavor profile analysis to measure the intensity and characteristics of the aroma in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hootman and Keane, 1992</xref>), resulting in primary (dominant) and secondary notes for each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment (‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">R Core Team, 2019</xref>,” 2012). To assess and visualize overall similarity in sample composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we hierarchically clustered samples based on pairwise distances in Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (method = ward.d2), as implemented in hclust. Bacteria including LAB and AAB were weighted equally to fungi (yeast only). To test whether geographic location explained any of the variation in observed microbial composition, we ran Mantel tests (method = Spearman with 999 permutations) comparing bacterial and fungal community dissimilarities (Bray-Curtis) to geographic distances (calculated with the Haversine distance from the R package geosphere). We evaluated this relationship for the whole dataset (n = 500) and using continental US samples only (n = 424). We also compared overall fungal to bacterial dissimilarities with Mantel tests for the global and US-only datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether abiotic factors including process parameters (data collected from participants in initial survey) and climatic variables (obtained from latitude/longitude of sample submission) were correlated with any of the observed patterns in microbial composition, we performed PERMANOVA tests on bacterial and fungal dissimilarities, including 33 potential predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>): grain base inputs, other process attributes (starter origin, starter input, storage location, number of feeds per month, frequency opened per week, container material, container lid); water source; sensory notes described by participant; pet presence; and location-based climatic variables obtained from latitude/longitude reported (mean annual temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity). We tested pairwise correlations between all continuous predictor variables. Absolute Pearson correlation values were &lt;0.6, except for the following pairs: maximum temperature and temperature (0.8), maximum temperature and seasonality (−0.9), filtered water and tap water (−0.7). Final PERMANOVA models only included significant predictors of community composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Some survey responses were not completed by all participants and we excluded those missing predictors from our models (thus, n = 426 samples for all models).</p><p>For those variables found to explain a significant portion of the variation in overall microbial community composition (for either fungal or bacterial communities), we tested whether particular taxa were enriched under specific conditions (e.g. ‘indicator taxa’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). To test this with continuous variables (for example, starter age or mean annual temperature of starter location) we used Spearman rank correlations to compare to the relative abundances of particular taxa (ASVs). For categorical variables (for example, whether the starter grain base included rye flour ‘grain base rye’ or the starter storage location) we used indicator correlation indices (r) values as implemented in the indicspecies package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Caceres et al., 2016</xref>). For all comparisons, we only included taxa that were detected in ≥10% of samples, and we considered taxa to be indicators if the false-discovery rate (fdr) corrected p-value was ≤0.05. To determine if there are sourdough microbial species that might be restricted to particular regions of the U.S. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), we used k-means clustering to group samples at two scales: k = 4 (larger regions) and k = 15 (smaller geographic regions) and identified indicator taxa that were significantly (&lt;0.05) enriched in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gebert et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Positive and negative co-occurrence interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) were detected using the R package Cooccur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffith et al., 2016</xref>), which uses a probabilistic approach to determine whether, given their abundance in data, species occur more or less often than is expected by chance. Data were transformed to presence-absence of assigned species taxonomy of LAB, AAB, and yeast above a one percent within-sample threshold. Additionally, only species interactions that were predicted to co-occur more than once were considered. To control for multiple comparisons and minimize false positives, Bonferroni-corrected p values are reported. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the likelihood that seven out of eight synthetic co-persistence tests would match our co-occurrence data. We constructed a matrix with the same distribution as that of our significant (p≤0.05) positive and negative co-occurrence interactions; of 16 significant interactions, eight were positive. We randomly drew from that matrix (n = 10,000) to determine the likelihood that the prediction from our synthetic system- that is, that at least seven of a series of eight interactions, would be correct (four negative and four positive interactions, representing the eight interactions observed in our experimental system).</p><p>For two functional outputs, dough rise rate and VOC profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), we first assessed how similar starters were from the same initial inoculum. For VOC profiles, we ran a PERMANOVA to assess how much variation in VOC profiles (represented as Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) was explained by initial starter inoculum. For dough rise, we ran an ANOVA to assess how differences in observed dough rise rates were predicted again, by initial starter inoculum. We then assessed whether overall community composition (of yeast, LAB, or AAB) predicted the composition of VOCs, using mean values within replicates from the same initial inoculum (thus, n = 40) for both VOC profiles and dough rise rates. We used Mantel tests to compare community dissimilarities in VOCs to LAB, AAB and yeast dissimilarities, and also to the Euclidean distances in total % AAB across samples. We also assessed whether any particular taxa were driving differences in the overall VOC composition with Spearman’s correlations between taxa relative abundances and the two non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) axes representing dissimilarities in VOC compositions. Likewise, for dough rise we assessed whether any particular taxa were driving differences in the observed rates via Spearman’s correlations. For both, taxa were considered significantly correlated if the p-value≤0.05 (fdr-corrected). Sensory analysis yielded 14 dominant notes across the 40 starters, including yeasty (n = 8), vinegar/acetic acid/acetic sour (n = 9), green apple (n = 6), fermented sour (n = 5), ethyl acetate/solventy (n = 3), and n = 1 sample for alcoholic sour, bready, cheesy, fermented apple, fruity sour, sweaty, toasted corn chips, veggie sulfide, and winey sour. To test whether the dominant sensory note observed from the Tufts Expert Sensory Panel was predicted by % total AAB, we ran a Kruskal-Wallis test with the dominant note as the predictor and used a Dunn test to assess significance of pairwise comparisons. For the sensory analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), we only tested notes that were dominant in ≥ . 5 samples, thus n = 26 samples rather than 40. We included only the first note reported by the expert sensory panel for our analyses, as this represented the most dominant note.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are incredibly grateful to the hundreds of community scientists that contributed samples for this project.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>There are many anecdotal reports that sourdough starters are strongly differentiated between geographic regions (an example being the sourdough claimed by some to only exist in San Francisco because of its foggy microclimate). This work carries out a detailed analysis of 500 sourdough starters, corroborating both previous findings such as the specific co-occurrence of certain microbes, but also repudiating much of the conventional wisdom about geographic variation in sourdough communities and putting forward new hypotheses, such as the important role of acetic acid bacteria. A result of practical value is that a specific group of bacteria is a good predictor of certain aromas. Finally, it is an excellent example of the value of community science.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The diversity and function of sourdough starter microbiomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Sara Mitri as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rachel Adams (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will possibly carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work carries out a detailed analysis of 500 sourdough starters from both professional and home bakers (with a focus on North America but some samples from other continents). The authors examine the factors that influence the yeast and bacterial communities in sourdough starters, then undertake experimental work to test hypotheses generated by co-occurrence patterns. It also explores correlations between microbial taxa, VOC profiles, aroma, and dough rise rates. The conclusions are a nice combination of corroborations of previous work (specific co-occurrence patterns), disputing of conventional knowledge that sourdough communities vary with geographic distance (the San Francisco sourdough), and new hypotheses to explore (important role of acetic acid bacteria). They also find that one group of bacteria is overrepresented compared to earlier studies, and that the presence or absence of this group is a good predictor of certain aromas. Interestingly, they also show that between-species interactions (succession) may be one of the best predictors of community composition.</p><p>The huge effort in data collection and analysis is admirable and therefore gives quite an informative picture on sourdough cultures, particularly in the US, where apparently studies have been somewhat lacking. The paper is well-written, the authors use extensive and robust analytical techniques. The paper was also fun to read and will be interesting to a wide audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One point that was unclear and may merit further experiments is why the authors did not measure the interactions with acetic acid bacteria (AAB) if they were so surprisingly abundant and had an effect on the aroma. We are guessing this is due to a lack of medium to isolate them on, but this was not very clear. If this is the case, please clarify this point in the text. However, if it is possible to isolate and grow AAB species, these experiments might still be worth doing.</p><p>In terms of the analysis:</p><p>1) It would be interesting to include a supplementary figure on how many strains of yeast versus bacteria a starter has.

We are guessing this is due to a lack of medium to isolate them on, but this was not very clear. If this is the case, please clarify this point in the text. However, if it is possible to isolate and grow AAB species, these experiments might still be worth doing.</p></disp-quote><p>While acetic acid bacteria (AAB) were detected across samples at a frequency higher than we expected (given lack of AAB discussions in literature), we did not include them in experimental work for several reasons:</p><p>1) We chose to investigate interactions between LAB and yeast given that they are core components of sourdough. AAB, while representing a large component of the bacterial diversity present in some sourdoughs, were not present in all starters (they occurred in 147 of 500 starters at &gt;1% abundance). This is in contrast to the yeast and LAB, which were present across all starters.</p><p>2) When we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of all fungal and bacterial taxa detected in the amplicon sequencing, AAB were not significantly associated (either positively or negatively) with other taxa. Of the 16 significant co-occurrence patterns we detected among taxa, none involved any AAB taxa. We only used microbial taxa for our interaction experiments that were significantly associated with other microbes and were among the most abundant taxa.</p><p>3) We agree that experimental studies of how AAB impact functional properties of sourdough starters are needed. We cannot complete this work right now due to COVID-19 staffing restrictions and changes in staffing in the lab of our chemistry collaborator. Our current work provides a comprehensive observational dataset that demonstrates how the abundance of AAB could impact sourdough starter communities. We look forward to conducting experiments in the near future where AAB are added to experimental sourdough starters to observe impacts on community composition and functional outputs (dough rise, aromas, etc.).</p><p>We have added a brief rationale statement for excluding AAB in our interaction experiments in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the analysis:</p><p>1) It would be interesting to include a supplementary figure on how many strains of yeast versus bacteria a starter has. Does the balance between yeast versus bacteria act as a predictor for other measured factors?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this analysis is an interesting and important element of our survey. We have now included the median number of yeasts and bacteria per starter within the text: “starters were composed of a median of three LAB/AAB and one yeast”. We included this supplementary figure as Figure 2—figure supplement 2, a panel which displays histograms of the total numbers of yeast, LAB/AAB, and total numbers of yeast plus LAB/AAB. This figure also includes a plot of yeast richness plotted against bacterial (LAB/AAB) richness. We found a non-significant relationship between LAB/AAB richness and yeast richness (Spearman’s rho P &gt; 0.05). We included this in the figure legend.</p><p>This insight from reviewers also spurred us to investigate whether there is a correlation between overall richness of yeasts and bacterial ASVs and richness in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To address this, we tested whether bacterial and yeast species richness correlates with VOC richness. Again, we found a non-significant relationship: (Spearman’s rho P &gt; 0.05). This suggests that a higher diversity of microbial taxa in a sourdough starter does not lead to higher diversity of VOCs. We added this to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second suggestion is to explore whether there is a pattern whereby negative interactions are more dominant within kingdom.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that we overlooked in our original presentation of the data.</p><p>– In our co-occurrence analysis of our amplicon sequencing data, we do find that negative interactions are more dominant within-kingdom. Indeed, all significant interactions (both positive and negative) occur more frequently within-kingdom. Of the 16 significant interactions we detected, only 2 are cross-kingdom interactions: a negative pattern of co-occurrence between <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</italic>, and a positive pattern of co-occurrence between <italic>Kazachstania servazzii</italic> and <italic>Pediococcus damnosus</italic>. This information was added to the subsection “Ecological distributions of sourdough microbes are structured by biotic interactions”.</p><p>– In our pairwise interaction experiments, yeast:bacteria species pairs (inter-kingdom interactions) co-persisted with each other in half of all pairings (8 of 16). Yeast:yeast or bacteria:bacteria (within-kingdom) species pairs co-persisted in 3 of 12 pairings (Figure 3B, E). This does demonstrate more positive inter-kingdom interactions than within-kingdom interactions, and we have acknowledged this interesting pattern in the aforementioned subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) You state that &quot;The related starters were statistically distinct from other communities, but percent variation explained was quite small.&quot; An interesting aspect is how related they were to each other. The fourth paragraph of the Discussion section discusses this, but it's not clear why you could not look at that with the data you have here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our analysis of de novo versus commercial starters was not clear in our original submission. We have revised that section of the manuscript to substantially improve clarity (subsection “Geography, process parameters, and abiotic factors are poor predictors of sourdough starter microbiome composition”). As we were re-writing this section, we decided that our analysis of a limited subset of starters (19) did not adequately address whether sourdough starters are stable over time. This should be addressed in another study through experimental approaches. We have much more statistical power with our dataset to address the broader question of whether participants that received their starter from a commercial source (73 participants) had specific microbial taxa compared to those that created their starter de novo or obtained their starter from another individual (417 participants). We therefore removed the analysis of 19 starters from one origin and references to stability in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could you use your data to look at similarity between commercial bakers versus home bakers to test the hypothesis in the Discussion? If this is not simple, feel free to leave it for future work.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting idea, but we only sampled from home bread bakers and not commercial bakers (those working at a bakery). There was some inconsistent use of terms in our first submission (“commercial”, “business”, “individual”) that may have caused confusion. We apologize for that and have made terminology more clear throughout the figures and manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Bray-Curtis was developed to study ecological communities, and was used here on chemicals (subsection “Statistical analyses”). Are the conclusions robust as to the distance metric used? Any support for why this metric is valid for VOC data?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric was developed for ecological communities of species, not chemical profiles. But we believe that it is a useful metric for our VOC chemical profile data. One of the main reasons we used the Bray-Curtis metric is that it does not weigh shared zeros in its calculation of similarity, which is important for both types of relative abundance composition data (VOC and relative abundance species composition). The VOC data meets the assumptions for Bray-Curtis, and this metric is commonly for VOC chemical profiles. Below is a sampling of many previously published papers that have used the Bray-Curtis metric for VOC data:</p><p>Junker, R.R., 2018.
