relationship between an antibody’s amino acid sequence and its antigen binding affinity. Here we describe a new experimental approach, called Tite-Seq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23156.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23156.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23156.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system to tag or neutralize potential threats to the body, such as foreign substances and disease-causing microbes. Antibodies do this by binding to target molecules called antigens. An antibody’s ability to bind to an antigen depends on the sequence of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – that make up the antibody. Through a process that randomizes this sequence of amino acids, the immune system generates a vast pool of antibodies that are able to target almost any foreign antigen that exists in nature.</p><p>Currently, little is understood about how the sequence of amino acids in an antibody determines how strongly that antibody binds to its antigen target – a property referred to as the antibody’s binding affinity. Answering this fundamental question requires techniques that can measure the affinities of many different antibodies at the same time. However, previous high-throughput methods have been unable to provide quantitative measurements of binding affinities. These kinds of measurements are difficult because an antibody’s amino acid sequence governs more than just binding affinity: it also affects how easy it is to produce that antibody, and what fraction of antibody molecules work properly.</p><p>Adams et al. now describe a new method, named “Tite-Seq”, that overcomes these issues. First, thousands of different antibodies are displayed on the surface of yeast cells, with each cell carrying a single kind of antibody. These cells are then incubated with fluorescently labeled antigen at a wide range of different concentrations. Next, the yeast cells are sorted based on how brightly they glow; brighter cells have more antigen bound to them, and so it is possible to calculate how much of the antigen is bound to each kind of antibody at each concentration. Plotting these data provides a “binding curve” for each antibody, which is then used to read off the antibody’s binding affinity in a way that is not affected by the factors that have plagued other high-throughput methods.</p><p>Tite-Seq is thus able to measure the binding affinities for thousands of different antibodies at the same time. This will potentially allow researchers to address many fundamental and yet unanswered questions about how the immune system works. Tite-Seq can also be used to measure how amino acid sequence affects the binding affinity of proteins other than antibodies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23156.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23156.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>affinity</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scan</kwd><kwd>titration curve</kwd><kwd>dissociation constant</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG n. 306312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>Rhys M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Walczak</surname><given-names>Aleksandra M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Simons Center for Quantitative Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kinney</surname><given-names>Justin B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The absolute affinities of thousands of variant antibodies are measured in parallel using a combination of cell sorting and high-throughput DNA sequencing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During an infection, the immune system must recognize and neutralize invading pathogens. B-cells contribute to immune defense by producing antibodies, proteins that bind specifically to foreign antigens. The astonishing capability of antibodies to recognize virtually any foreign molecule has been repurposed by scientists in a wide variety of experimental techniques (immunofluorescence, western blots, ELISA, ChIP-Seq, etc.). Antibody-based therapeutic drugs have also been developed for treating many different diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan and Carter, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Much is known about the qualitative mechanisms of antibody generation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>). The antigenic specificity of antibodies in humans, mice, and most jawed vertebrates is primarily governed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), each roughly 10 amino acids (aa) long. Three CDRs (denoted CDR1H, CDR2H, and CDR3H) are located on the antibody heavy chain, and three are on the light chain. During B-cell differentiation, these six sequences are randomized through V(D)J recombination, then selected for functionality as well as against the ability to recognize host antigens. Upon participation in an immune response, CDR regions can further undergo somatic hypermutation and selection, yielding higher-affinity antibodies for specific antigens. Among the CDRs, CDR3H is the most highly variable and typically contributes the most to antigen specificity; less clear are the functional roles of the other CDRs, which often do not interact with the target antigen directly.</p><p>Many high-throughput techniques, including phage display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vaughan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schirrmann et al., 2011</xref>), ribosome display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujino et al., 2012</xref>), yeast display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gai and Wittrup, 2007</xref>), and mammalian cell display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forsyth et al., 2013</xref>), have been developed for optimizing antibodies ex vivo. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have also made it possible to effectively monitor both antibody and T-cell receptor diversity within immune repertoires, e.g. in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weinstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robins et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mora et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Venturi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murugan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zvyagin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elhanati et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elhanati et al., 2015</xref>), in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madi et al., 2014</xref>), in individuals with diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parameswaran et al., 2013</xref>) or following vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vollmers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laserson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Yet many questions remain about basic aspects of the quantitative relationship between antibody sequence and antigen binding affinity. How many different antibodies will bind a given antigen with specified affinity? How large of a role do epistatic interactions between amino acid positions within the CDRs have on antigen binding affinity? How is this sequence-affinity landscape navigated by the V(D)J recombination process, or by somatic hypermutation? Answering these and related questions is likely to prove critical for developing a systems-level understanding of the adaptive immune system, as well as for using antibody repertoire sequencing to diagnose and monitor disease.</p><p>Recently developed ‘deep mutational scanning’ (DMS) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>) provide one potential method for measuring binding affinities with high enough throughput to effectively explore antibody sequence-affinity landscapes. In DMS experiments, one begins with a library of variants of a specific protein. Proteins that have high levels of a particular activity of interest are then enriched via one or more rounds of selection, which can be carried out in a variety of ways. The set of enriched sequences is then compared to the initial library, and protein sequences (or mutations within these sequences) are scored according to how much this enrichment procedure increases their prevalence.</p><p>Multiple DMS assays have been described for investigating protein-ligand binding affinity. But no DMS assay has yet been shown to provide absolute quantitative binding affinity measurements, i.e., dissociation constants in molar units. For example, one of the first DMS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>) used phage display technology to measure how mutations in a WW domain affect the affinity of this domain for its peptide ligand. These data were sufficient to compute enrichment ratios and corresponding sequence logos, but they did not yield quantitative affinities. Analogous experiments have since been performed on antibodies using yeast display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalsky et al., 2015</xref>) and mammalian cell display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forsyth et al., 2013</xref>). Yeast-display-based DMS assays have also proven particularly useful for mapping protein epitopes that are targeted by specific antibodies of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doolan and Colby, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Van Blarcom et al., 2015</xref>). Still, none of these approaches provides quantitative affinity values. SORTCERY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reich et al., 2015</xref>, ), a DMS assay that combines yeast display and quantitative modeling, has been shown to provide approximate rank-order values for the affinity of a specific protein for short unstructured peptides of varying sequence. Determining quantitative affinities from SORTCERY data, however, requires separate low-throughput calibration measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reich et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is unclear how well SORTCERY, if applied to a library of folded proteins rather than unstructured peptides, can distinguish sequence-dependence effects on affinity from sequence-dependent effects on protein expression and stability. Other recent work has described a DMS assay, again based on yeast display, for measuring fold-changes in affinity relative to a reference protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016</xref>). This method, however, does not provide absolute values for dissociation constants, is vulnerable to the confounding effects of sequence-dependent expression and protein stability, and was observed to have only a 10-fold dynamic range.</p><p>To enable massively parallel measurements of absolute binding affinities for antibodies and other structured proteins, we have developed an assay called ‘Tite-Seq.’ Tite-Seq, like SORTCERY, builds on the capabilities of Sort-Seq, an experimental strategy that was first developed for studying transcriptional regulatory sequences in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>). Sort-Seq combines fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with high-throughput sequencing to provide massively parallel measurements of cellular fluorescence. In the Tite-Seq assay, Sort-Seq is applied to antibodies displayed on the surface of yeast cells and incubated with antigen at a wide range of concentrations. From the resulting sequence data, thousands of antibody-antigen binding titration curves and their corresponding absolute dissociation constants (here denoted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) can be inferred. By assaying full binding curves, Tite-Seq is able to measure affinities over many orders of magnitude (We note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalsky et al. (2015</xref>) have described yeast display DMS experiments performed at multiple concentrations. These data, however, were not used to reconstruct titration curves or infer quantitative <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values). Moreover, the resulting affinity values provided by Tite-Seq are not confounded by the (rather substantial) effect that sequence variation can have on either (a) the amount of protein expressed on the surface of cells or (b) the specific activity of displayed proteins (i.e., the fraction of protein molecules that are functional).</p><p>We demonstrated Tite-Seq on a protein library derived from a well-studied single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific to the small molecule fluorescein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boder et al., 2000</xref>). Mutations were restricted to CDR1H and CDR3H regions, which are known to play an important role in the antigen recognition of this scFv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Midelfort et al., 2004</xref>). The resulting affinity measurements were validated with binding curves for a handful of clones measured using standard low-throughput flow cytometry. Our Tite-Seq measurements reveal both expected and unexpected differences between the effects of mutations in CDR1H and CDR3H. These data also shed light on structural aspects of antigen recognition that are independent of effects on antibody stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of Tite-Seq</title><p>Our general strategy is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. First, a library of variant antibodies is displayed on the surface of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The composition of this library is such that each cell displays a single antibody variant, and each variant is expressed on the surface of multiple cells. Cells are then incubated with the antigen of interest, bound antigen is fluorescently labeled, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is used to sort cells one-by-one into multiple ‘bins’ based on this fluorescent readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deep sequencing is then used to survey the antibody variants present in each bin. Because each variant antibody is sorted multiple times, it will be associated with a histogram of counts spread across one or more bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The spread in each histogram is due to cell-to-cell variability in antibody expression, and to the inherent noisiness of flow cytometry measurements. Finally, the histogram corresponding to each antibody variant is used to compute an ‘average bin number’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, dots), which serves as a proxy measurement for the average amount of bound antigen per cell.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23156.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of Tite-Seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A library of variant antibodies (various colors) are displayed on the surface of yeast cells (tan).

Because the relationship between binding and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is sigmoidal, the amount of bound antigen provides a quantitative readout of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> only when the concentration of antigen used in the labeling procedure is comparable in magnitude to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. However, single mutations within a protein binding domain often change <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> by multiple orders of magnitude. Sort-Seq experiments used to measure sequence-affinity landscapes must therefore be carried out over a range of concentrations large enough to encompass this variation.</p><p>Furthermore, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, different antibody variants often lead to different levels of functional antibody expression on the yeast cell surface. If one performs Sort-Seq at a single antigen concentration, high affinity (low <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) variants with low expression (blue variant) may bind less antigen than low affinity (high <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) variants with high expression (orange variant).

We know this to be true, of course; still, this result provides an important validation of our Tite-Seq measurements.</p><p>To further validate our Tite-Seq affinity measurements, we examined positions in the high affinity OPT scFv (from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boder et al., 2000</xref>]) that differ from WT and that lie within the 1H and 3H variable regions. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, five of the six OPT-specific mutations reduce <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf148"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> or are nearly neutral. Previous structural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Midelfort et al., 2004</xref>) has suggested that D106E, the only OPT mutation that we find significantly increases <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, may indeed disrupt antigen binding on its own while still increasing affinity in the presence of the S101A mutation.</p><p>Next, we used our measurements to build a ‘matrix model’ (also known as a ‘position-specific affinity matrix,’ or PSAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foat et al., 2006</xref>]) describing the sequence-affinity landscape of these two regions. Our model assumed that the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value for an arbitrary amino acid sequence could be computed from the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value of the WT scFv, plus the measured change in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf152"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> produced by each amino acid substitution away from WT. We evaluated our matrix models on the 1H and 3H variable regions of OPT, finding an affinity of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf153"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>9.16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> M. Our simple model for the sequence affinity landscape of this scFv therefore correctly predicts that OPT has higher affinity than WT. The quantitative affinity predicted by our model does not match the known affinity of the OPT scFv (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf154"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>12.6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> M), but this is unsurprising for three reasons. First the OPT scFv differs from WT in 14 residues, only 6 of which are inside the 1H and 3H variable regions assayed here. Second, one of the OPT mutations (W108L) reduces <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf155"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> below our detection threshold of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf156"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>9.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> M; in building our matrix model, we set this value equal to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>9.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>, knowing it would likely underestimate the affinity-increasing effect of the mutation. Third, our additive model ignores potential epistatic interactions. Still, we thought it worth asking how likely it it would be for six random mutations within the 1H and 3H variable regions to reduce affinity as much as our model predicts for OPT. We therefore simulated a large number (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf158"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) of variants having a total of 6 substitution mutations randomly scattered across the 1H and 3H variable regions. The fraction of these random sequences that had an affinity at or below our predicted affinity for OPT was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf159"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4.7</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This finding is fully consistent with the fact that the mutations in OPT relative to WT were selected for increased affinity, an additional confirmation of the validity of our Tite-Seq measurements.</p><p>The sequence-expression landscape measured in our separate Sort-Seq experiment yielded qualitatively different results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). We observed no significant difference in the median effect that mutations in the variable regions of 1H (median <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.826</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) versus 3H (median <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf161"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.822</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) have on expression (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf162"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.96</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, two-sided Mann-Whitney U test); see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The variance in these effects, however, was larger in 3H than in 1H (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf163"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>9.9</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, Levene’s test). These results suggest two things. First, the 3H variable region appears to have a larger effect on scFv expression than the 1H variable region has. At the same time, since we observe fewer beneficial mutations in 1H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) than in 3H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the WT sequence appears to be more highly optimized for expression in CDR1H than in CDR3H.

Tite-Seq therefore provides a potentially powerful method for mapping the sequence-affinity trajectories of antibodies during the affinity maturation process, as well as for studying other aspects of the adaptive immune response.</p><p>The details of our Tite-Seq experiments (e.g., 11 antigen concentrations, four sorting bins per concentration, etc.) were chosen largely for experimental convenience. The effects of varying these parameters have not been systematically explored, and a future investigation of these effects might be valuable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref> does illustrate, via simulation, the effect of read depth on the precision of measured <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf191"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values. These simulations, along with an analysis of synonymous variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggest that the primary source of noise in our experiments came not from a lack of sorted cells or Illumina reads, but rather from the inefficient post-sort recovery of antibody sequences. We therefore suggest that improvements to our post-sort DNA recovery protocol might substantially improve the resolution of Tite-Seq.</p><p>Tite-Seq fundamentally differs from prior DMS experiments in that full binding titration curves, not two-bin enrichment statistics, are used to determine binding affinities. The measurement of binding curves provides three major advantages. First, binding curves provide absolute <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf192"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values in molar units, not just rank-order affinities, like those provided by SORTCERY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reich et al., 2015</xref>), or relative affinity ratios, like those provided by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalsky and Whitehead (2016)</xref>. Second, because ligand binding is a sigmoidal function of affinity, DMS experiments performed at a single ligand concentration (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016</xref>]) are insensitive to receptor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf193"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>s that differ substantially from this ligand concentration. Binding curves, by contrast, integrate measurements over a wide range of concentrations and are therefore sensitive to a wide range of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf194"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>s.</p><p>The third advantage of measuring binding curves pertains to the fact that protein sequence determines not just ligand-binding affinity, but also the quantity and specific activity of surface-displayed proteins. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>) suggest that these confounding effects can be large and that they can distort yeast display affinity measurements computed from enrichment statistics gathered at a single antigen concentration. Strong sequence-dependent effects on both the expression and specific activity of yeast-displayed proteins has been reported by other groups as well (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns et al., 2014</xref>]), although the absence of such effects has also been reported (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016</xref>]). Ultimately, the magnitude of these effects is likely to vary substantially from protein to protein. It should also be noted that many DMS studies using yeast display (e.g., epitope mapping studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doolan and Colby, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Van Blarcom et al., 2015</xref>]) might not suffer from these potentially confounding effects, and in such cases it probably makes sense to employ a simpler experimental design than is required for Tite-Seq. Nevertheless, either Tite-Seq or other experimental methods that assay full binding curves are probably essential if one wants to quantitatively and reliably measure <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf195"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values in a massively parallel fashion.</p><p>We wish to emphasize, more generally, that changing a protein’s amino acid sequence can be expected to change multiple biochemical properties of that protein. Our work illustrates the importance of designing massively parallel assays that can disentangle these effects. Tite-Seq provides a general solution to this problem for massively parallel studies of protein-ligand binding. Indeed, the Tite-Seq procedure described here can be readily applied to any protein binding assay that is compatible with yeast display and FACS. Many such assays have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu, 2015</xref>). We expect that Tite-Seq can also be readily adapted for use with other expression platforms, such as mammalian cell display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forsyth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our Tite-Seq measurements reveal interesting distinctions between the effects of mutations in the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of the anti-fluorescein scFv antibody studied here. As expected, we found that variation in and around CDR3H had a larger effect on affinity than did variation in and around CDR1H. We also found that CDR1H is more optimized for protein expression than is CDR3H, an unexpected finding that appears to be novel. Yeast display expression levels are known to correlate with thermostability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shusta et al., 1999</xref>). Our data is limited in scope, and we remain cautious about generalizing our observations to arbitrary antibody-antigen interactions. Still, this finding suggests the possibility that secondary CDR regions (such as CDR1H) might be evolutionarily optimized to help ensure antibody stability, thereby freeing up CDR3H to encode antigen specificity. If this hypothesis holds, it could provide a biochemical rationale for why CDR3H is more likely than CDR1H to be mutated in functioning receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liberman et al., 2013</xref>) and why variation in CDR3H is often sufficient to establish antigen specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu and Davis, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Tite-Seq can also potentially shed light on the structural basis for antibody-antigen recognition. By comparing the effects of mutations with the known antibody-fluorescein co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whitlow et al., 1995</xref>), we identified a strong correlation between the effect that a position has on affinity and the number of molecular contacts that the residue at that position makes within the antibody. By contrast, no such correlation of expression with this number of contacts is observed. Again, we are cautious about generalizing from observations made on a single antibody. If our observation were to hold for other antibodies, however, it would suggest that the functional geometry of paratopes might be governed by networks of residues whose positions and orientations are strongly interdependent.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Tite-Seq was performed as follows.

To even out the distribution of reads across bins, we selected the 27 most poorly sampled bins, re-amplified the 1H-to-3H regions in these bins using primers with different barcodes than before, and submitted the resulting amplicons for a fourth round of Illumina NextSeq sequencing.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app5"><title>Appendix 5</title><boxed-text><sec id="s18" sec-type="appendix"><title>Inference of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf255"><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> from Tite-Seq data</title><p>We modeled the binding titration curve of each sequence – i.e., the curve describing how mean cellular fluorescence depends on antigen concentration – using a non-cooperative Hill function.

As far as I know, this is common practice when presenting a new approach like this, and it would (1) allow for a better idea of the error (which, in my opinion, is calculated in a highly optimistic way), and (2) allow for a much better quantification of the results. E.g., is the difference of 56% vs. 41% of mutations above the detection limit (in subsection “E. Differing effects of mutations in CDR1H and CDR3H”, first paragraph) a large one, or maybe not even distinguishable given the accuracy of the experiment? Even if the same library was used, a replicate of the subsequent steps would be highly informative, and, in my opinion, necessary for validation of the approach.</p><p>I do not see a striking biological result from the analysis. What occurs to me as the main result of the paper (the correlation between contacts of wt residue with sensitivity to mutations at that position) is not too surprising to me, given many studies that have shown protein stability to be an important determinant of its function (and, as I understand, the sensitivity is measured on an absolute scale). Other reported findings seem suspicious and vague, especially considering my main concern expressed above.</p><p>As I understand, 1850 mutations per region were surveyed. Such a high number introduces a lot of noise due to sampling by FACS and sequencing, even if the initial library is large and evenly distributed (and especially if the number of sequences is not large for some data points, cf. Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). I may have missed this, but is the distribution of the mutations in the initial library known, and what was the distribution of absolute reads per mutant at each data point?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors present Tite-Seq, a method that uses high-throughput DNA sequencing of yeast-displayed antibody libraries to assess mutant <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> and surface expression at a large scale. In general, the experiments and analysis are well executed, and the paper is mostly well written. My enthusiasm is restrained for two main reasons. First, the authors fail to cite and discuss substantially similar work. Their elucidation of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values for a large library of variants does represent an advance, but it's incremental. The work must be discussed in the context of what has come before. Second, several of the analyses are poorly described and, if I understood them correctly, will inflate the reader's confidence in the method. In particular, the method for estimating error for each <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> value is insufficient. Both of these points are particularly important because the manuscript is focused on the method itself rather than an important/exciting application. I therefore do not recommend publication of the manuscript in its current form.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Introduction – The authors should be more thorough in discussing the strengths and weaknesses of prior deep mutational scanning work. In particular, the fact that yeast display has been coupled to deep mutational scanning and that affinity ranking of variants has been achieved is something readers should know before they get to the end of the Discussion (PMID 25311858). Mammalian antibody display has also been coupled to deep mutationals canning (PMID 23765106). Ribosome antibody display and deep mutational scanning using varying ligand concentrations has also been done (PMID 23103372). Of course, the existence of a substantially similar paper (PMID 26296891) should also be acknowledged and the work discussed in that context.</p><p>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – The authors show low-throughput validation data for three clones and compare this data to Tite-Seq results. In the subsection “A. Overview of Tite-Seq”, the authors make the point that, if curve fitting is to be successful, the <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> value must fall within the range of ligand values used. However, for the validation data shown, the fit <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values are generally at the very low end of the ligand concentration range. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, most of the titration curves more closely resemble flat lines. This can be explained by the fact that the <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of the WT is 0.7e-9 M whereas the lowest concentration of ligand used was 1e-8.5 M. I am puzzled as to why the authors chose to employ a ligand concentration range that did not include the known <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of the WT sequence. In the Discussion they mention &quot;experimental details,&quot; that constrained them, but I'd suggest a fuller and earlier disclosure of these limitations. Given that most antibody-antigen interactions have <italic>K<sub>D</sub>s</italic> at least as low as the one studied, I wonder whether the method could really be generally applied.</p><p>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – Pursuant to the previous comment, the authors' simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are done using two hypothetical interactions whose <italic>K<sub>D</sub>s</italic> are substantially higher than the experimental case considered. They should do simulations using the actual <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> and ligand concentrations employed.</p><p>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – The low-throughput validation experiments do not themselves look particularly robust. The <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values inferred from these experiments range over two orders of magnitude. The authors state &quot;Although individual data points can be noisy, fitting curves to multiple data points nevertheless provide reasonably accurate measurements of affinity. The accuracy of these measurements is increase by averaging over replicates.&quot; This is a vague statement. How noisy? How much does replication help? A key problem, I think, is that the low throughput flow validation data looks as noisy as the Tite-Seq data. These experiments should be improved and repeated. Even better, an orthogonal method of validation should be employed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> – This panel and accompanying figure legend is vague. The text makes it clear that the numbers show the diversity of each library, but it would be helpful to clarify the legend.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>/subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – In the figure legend the authors state &quot;Error bars on flow <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values are the same for all data points; they show the average mean squared error computed computed using three replicate measurements for each clone.&quot; In the text, they state &quot;Error bars on flow cytometry <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values were computed using the average variance observed in replicate measurements.&quot; I have a few problems here. First, neither statement makes totally clear what the authors did/what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Furthermore, MSE usually used when the parametric value of an estimator is known. For the flow data, we don't have parametric values, just three replicates. So, a confidence interval would be more appropriate. Finally, and most troublingly, the authors have elected to present the mean variance/MSE of all three clones rather than the variance (or CI, or whatever) of each clone independently. I can't think of a good reason to do this. Because the WT replicates happened to look great while the two clones didn't, using the mean of all three is misleading. The authors should improve this analysis and then better explain it. Also, note the repeated &quot;computed.&quot;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>/Subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – The error estimation procedure for Tite-Seq, based on a single experiment, uses synonymous variants to estimate the standard deviation of each measurement. Variants are binned based on read depth and then a regression is performed to determine the error in each bin. If I understood the procedure, the error is assumed to be wholly dependent on read depth. The read depth vs. signal to noise/error plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is really noisy, which suggests that the read depth alone does not capture all of the error. Many factors are known to impact experiment-to-experiment variability (e.g. PCR bias, experimenter error, etc.) in these types of experiments. Replication would enable much more robust error estimation, and would considerably strengthen the work.</p><p>Subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – The authors state: &quot;We note that…measurements for the WT scFV are about a factor of 10 larger than the previously measured value of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>&quot;. I wonder if this is due to the lack of data points at lower concentrations rather than any differences in buffer/etc. Again, a gold-standard, non flow-based assay would help here.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> – Because of the two-dimensional heatmap it is somewhat difficult to appreciate the relationship between expression and binding. Two separate panels with individual color schemes might be easier to comprehend.</p><p>Appendix C – The authors say they used custom microarray nucleotides to generate the library, but the nature of the sequences on the array is unclear. A supplementary data file containing the sequences ordered should be included.</p><p>Appendix F – The authors used the 10% lowest fluorescence values to estimate autofluorescence/background. This is a curious choice, if the library contained mutations to stop codons (see comment above). Stop codons, particularly early ones, virtually guarantee loss of function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I could hardly evaluate the mathematical aspects of the work. However, it looks like the previous expertise of this team ensures the high mathematical quality.</p><p>Concerning the whole idea of the work – I believe it is brilliant.</p><p>The approach allows studying the aspects of dependence of antibody affinity and potentially cross-reactivity (with several antigens used) on the sequence landscape, which is beautiful.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your heavily revised manuscript &quot;Measuring the sequence-affinity landscape of antibodies with massively parallel titration curves&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript was evaluated by three reviewers who are experts in the field: two were also reviewers for the original submission, and one is a new reviewer. The evaluation has been overseen by Jesse Bloom as the Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy A Whitehead (Reviewer #1) and Claudia Bank (Reviewer #2).</p><p>We anticipate that we can accept your manuscript for publication provided that you make revisions that address the comments below.</p><p>First, we appreciate your careful attention to addressing the issues raised in the in the initial review, particularly adding replicates and extending the antigen range. We recognize that these were time-consuming changes, and the seriousness with which you took those critiques has greatly improved this paper. Your study now represents an impressive use of deep sequencing to obtain fairly rigorous <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Please make sure that your deep sequencing data is available on the SRA and relevant computer code is available as supporting file or on a publicly accessible repository. If this is already the case, please clearly indicate in the manuscript where these can be found.</p><p>2) There are a few additional papers that you should consider discussing in the context of prior work:</p><p>Doolan KM, Colby DW: Conformation-dependent epitopes recognized by prion protein antibodies probed using mutational scanning and deep sequencing. J. Mol. Biol. 2015, 427:328-340.</p><p>Van Blarcom T, Rossi A, Foletti D, Sundar P, Pitts S, Bee C, Melton Witt J, Melton Z, Hasa-Moreno A, Shaughnessy L, et al.: Precise and efficient antibody epitope determination through library design, yeast display and next-generation sequencing. J. Mol. Biol. 2015, 427:1513-1534.</p><p>3) Your approach estimates fairly accurate <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> at the cost of more experiments (multiple binds, multiple expression levels). For certain applications where precise <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values are overkill, it may be more efficacious to use the simpler designs like those used in some of the references that you cite – perhaps worth mentioning. Also, do you have any comments on the trade-off between sequencing depth and the accuracy of the inferred <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>? Similarly for the number of sorting bins? Right now it isn't clear how these were chosen. Clearly your choices worked fine, but it would be nice to explain if there was rigorous rationale for choosing these (alternatively, you could just say that exploring the effects of these parameters is interesting for future work).</p><p>4) The relatively large unsigned error on two variants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (approximately 2 orders of magnitude in <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>) should be commented on. Why is there such a discrepancy (Subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>)?</p><p>5) Are the mutations outside of the dynamic range (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> &gt; 10 μM) being used in determining correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>)?</p><p>6) Please quantify the error in precision and accuracy of the method. In particular, the poorer correspondence between replicates in the binding range between 10-1000 nM <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> should be mentioned.</p><p>7) Can you quantify error within replicates by inferring <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> for synonymous mutations?</p><p>8) How big is the benefit of controlling for active surface-displayed protein? While it is clear that yeast surface expression and folded surface displayed protein varies between variants (Burns et al., 2014), it has been shown (yet still surprising!) that surface expression (and proper folding) effects are modest for yeast surface display experiments, particularly for residues that are reasonably surface-exposed (Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016).</p><p>Burns, Michael L., et al.

Namely, our results suggest (a) that secondary CDRs many serve to stabilize antibodies against destabilizing variation in CDR3H, and (b) that binding affinity and specificity might be controlled by “sectors” within the antibody structure. Because our paper is primarily about a method, we do not follow up on these hypotheses, and so they remain preliminary. Still, this illustrates the kinds of questions that Tite-Seq can help address.</p><p><italic>As I understand, 1850 mutations per region were surveyed. Such a high number introduces a lot of noise due to sampling by FACS and sequencing, even if the initial library is large and evenly distributed (and especially if the number of sequences is not large for some data points, cf. Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). I may have missed this, but is the distribution of the mutations in the initial library known, and what was the distribution of absolute reads per mutant at each data point?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity on this issue. We did indeed sequence the unsorted library. Zipf plots illustrating the prevalence of each sequence in the library used for each replicate are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the number of cells sorted into each bin, as well as the number of reads obtained from each bin.</p><p>There is indeed a large variation in the number for reads from bin to bin, but our improved analysis method explicitly accounts for this variability. The variation in <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values measured by Tite-Seq that we expect to result from the finite sampling of each sequence was estimated using simulations. The results of these simulation tests are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: The authors present Tite-Seq, a method that uses high-throughput DNA sequencing of yeast-displayed antibody libraries to assess mutant KD and surface expression at a large scale. In general, the experiments and analysis are well executed, and the paper is mostly well written. My enthusiasm is restrained for two main reasons. First, the authors fail to cite and discuss substantially similar work. Their elucidation of KD values for a large library of variants does represent an advance, but it's incremental. The work must be discussed in the context of what has come before. Second, several of the analyses are poorly described and, if I understood them correctly, will inflate the reader's confidence in the method. In particular, the method for estimating error for each KD value is insufficient. Both of these points are particularly important because the manuscript is focused on the method itself rather than an important/exciting application. I therefore do not recommend publication of the manuscript in its current form.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this critique. We believe the revised manuscript addresses all of these concerns.</p><p>Our revised manuscript provides an expanded discussion of the importance of our work in the context of the prior literature, including the works cited by the referee. We argue that our work represents an important conceptual and technological advance over previously described DMS experiments.</p><p>Specifically, all DMS experiments face an important challenge: how to separate the effect that protein sequence has on one specific biochemical property of interest from the effect that it has on other biochemical properties of the protein that can affect measurements in a DMS assay. In our case, the challenge is to separate the effect that protein sequence has on ligand binding energy from the effect that protein sequence has on protein expression and on the fraction of this expressed protein that is properly folded. Our paper solves this problem in the context of antibody-antigen interactions, and appears to be the first in the literature to do so for any protein-ligand binding energy. More generally, we provide a template for how such distinctions between sequence-function relationships can be made. The Discussion has been revised to emphasize this important point.</p><p>We agree with the referee’s criticism regarding the error bars on the Tite-Seq <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> measurements. In response, we have performed the Tite-Seq experiment in triplicate, and now use these triplicate measurements to assess error bars. Our Tite- Seq measurements are also validated by an increased number of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> measurements on individual clones sampled from the library.</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Introduction – The authors should be more thorough in discussing the strengths and weaknesses of prior deep mutational scanning work. In particular, the fact that yeast display has been coupled to deep mutational scanning and that affinity ranking of variants has been achieved is something readers should know before they get to the end of the Discussion (PMID 25311858). Mammalian antibody display has also been coupled to deep mutationals canning (PMID 23765106). Ribosome antibody display and deep mutational scanning using varying ligand concentrations has also been done (PMID 23103372). Of course, the existence of a substantially similar paper (PMID 26296891) should also be acknowledged and the work discussed in that context.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the Introduction to provide a more detailed discussion of the prior literature, particularly regarding prior DMS experiments using yeast display, prior work on antibody sequence-affinity landscapes, and prior work at varying ligand concentrations. The revised text now explicitly explains how our work differs substantially from these previous papers, including the papers cited by the referee above. We believe this more detailed discussion greatly clarifies why our work provides a major advance over the prior literature.</p><p>We have moved our discussion of Reich et al., 2015 (PMID 25311858), which describes the yeast-display DMS method SORTCERY, to the Introduction. We have also revised the Introduction to emphasize that both yeast display (Reich et al., 2015, PMID 25311858; Kowalsky et al., 2015, PMID 26296891) and the conceptually similar method of mammalian cell display (Forsyth et al., 2013, PMID 23765106) have indeed already been used to perform DMS experiments. We emphasize that our key advance in this regard is not the use of a cellular display system to do DMS experiments, but rather the ability to measure binding titration curves. None of these works measures binding titration curves. Therefore, all of the DMS-measured affinities reported in these three works are vulnerable to being convolved with sequence-dependent effects on expression or protein stability. Our paper shows how to overcome this common problem.</p><p>The referee is correct that Fujino et al., 2012, PMID 23103372 performed Ribosome-display-based DMS experiments at multiple concentrations. The revised text points this out. The multiple concentration measurements used by Fujino et al., however, were not used to infer binding titration curves nor to make estimates of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>; they were used only to identify codons to randomize in a combinatorial library. The only <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values reported in this paper were measured in a low-throughput manner, either by SPR or KinExA.</p><p><italic>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – The authors show low-throughput validation data for three clones and compare this data to Tite-Seq results. In the subsection “A. Overview of Tite-Seq”, the authors make the point that, if curve fitting is to be successful, the K<sub>D</sub> value must fall within the range of ligand values used. However, for the validation data shown, the fit K<sub>D</sub> values are generally at the very low end of the ligand concentration range. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, most of the titration curves more closely resemble flat lines. This can be explained by the fact that the K<sub>D</sub> of the WT is 0.7e-9 M whereas the lowest concentration of ligand used was 1e-8.5 M. I am puzzled as to why the authors chose to employ a ligand concentration range that did not include the known K<sub>D</sub> of the WT sequence. In the Discussion they mention &quot;experimental details,&quot; that constrained them, but I'd suggest a fuller and earlier disclosure of these limitations. Given that most antibody-antigen interactions have K<sub>D</sub>s at least as low as the one studied, I wonder whether the method could really be generally applied.</italic> </p><p>We chose our initial range of concentrations to target the <italic>K<sub>D</sub>s</italic> of the bulk of sequences in our library. It does make sense, however, to include the WT <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>. The triplicate experiments reported in our revised manuscript have therefore been performed with a range of antigen concentrations (10<sup>-9.5</sup> M to 10<sup>-5</sup> M) that is one decade lower than the range used for the previous manuscript (10<sup>-8.5</sup> M to 10<sup>-4</sup> M). We also modified the yeast display protocol to improve the fraction of yeast that express antibody on their surface, and this has further improved the precision of both Tite-Seq and our low-throughput flow cytometry measurements.</p><p>From our new experiments we find a WT <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>of 1.9 nM using Tite-Seq and 2.4 nM using low-throughput flow cytometry. This is now consistent with the measurements from Dane Wittrup’s laboratory. We note that, although Boder et al. (2000, PMID 10984501) report a WT <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>of 0.4-0.7 nM, later work (Gai and Wittrup, 2007, PMID 17870469) revised this <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>upwards to 1.2 nM, which is within a factor of 2 of both our low-throughput and high-throughput measurements. The difference in salt concentration used in our experiments may account for some of the remaining discrepancy.</p><p><italic>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – Pursuant to the previous comment, the authors' simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are done using two hypothetical interactions whose K<sub>D</sub>s are substantially higher than the experimental case considered. They should do simulations using the actual K<sub>D</sub> and ligand concentrations employed.</italic> </p><p>The revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> now shows results simulated using <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>values that were measured. We emphasize in the revised caption that this figure is only meant to provide a schematic illustration of the inference method, and that the method for inferring <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>values from real read counts is substantially more involved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 6</xref> and 7 illustrate more realistic simulations as well as the results that our real analysis pipeline produces from these data.</p><p><italic>Subsection “C. Low-throughput validation experiments” – The low-throughput validation experiments do not themselves look particularly robust. The K<sub>D</sub> values inferred from these experiments range over two orders of magnitude. The authors state &quot;Although individual data points can be noisy, fitting curves to multiple data points nevertheless provide reasonably accurate measurements of affinity. The accuracy of these measurements is increase by averaging over replicates.&quot; This is a vague statement. How noisy? How much does replication help? A key problem, I think, is that the low throughput flow validation data looks as noisy as the Tite-Seq data. These experiments should be improved and repeated. Even better, an orthogonal method of validation should be employed.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the yeast display protocol, substantially increasing the fraction of yeast cells that display antibody. This, in turn, has substantially increased the precision of our low-throughput measurements. The low-throughput titration curves measured using this modified protocol are described in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have also quantified the uncertainty in all high-throughput and low-throughput <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>measurements. High-throughput measurements, in triplicate, with estimated error bars, are provided as the supplemental data files. A new Supplementary file I shows both high-throughput and low-throughput <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>measurements for each of the clones plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> – This panel and accompanying figure legend is vague. The text makes it clear that the numbers show the diversity of each library, but it would be helpful to clarify the legend.</italic> </p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend has been revised to clarify the meaning of panel 2D.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>/subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – In the figure legend the authors state &quot;Error bars on flow K<sub>D</sub> values are the same for all data points; they show the average mean squared error computed computed using three replicate measurements for each clone.&quot; In the text, they state &quot;Error bars on flow cytometry K<sub>D</sub> values were computed using the average variance observed in replicate measurements.&quot; I have a few problems here. First, neither statement makes totally clear what the authors did/what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Furthermore, MSE usually used when the parametric value of an estimator is known. For the flow data, we don't have parametric values, just three replicates. So, a confidence interval would be more appropriate. Finally, and most troublingly, the authors have elected to present the mean variance/MSE of all three clones rather than the variance (or CI, or whatever) of each clone independently. I can't think of a good reason to do this. Because the WT replicates happened to look great while the two clones didn't, using the mean of all three is misleading. The authors should improve this analysis and then better explain it. Also, note the repeated &quot;computed.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The revised text now provides clone-by-clone estimates of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>values and their associated uncertainties.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>/Subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – The error estimation procedure for Tite-Seq, based on a single experiment, uses synonymous variants to estimate the standard deviation of each measurement. Variants are binned based on read depth and then a regression is performed to determine the error in each bin. If I understood the procedure, the error is assumed to be wholly dependent on read depth. The read depth vs. signal to noise/error plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is really noisy, which suggests that the read depth alone does not capture all of the error. Many factors are known to impact experiment-to-experiment variability (e.g. PCR bias, experimenter error, etc.) in these types of experiments. Replication would enable much more robust error estimation, and would considerably strengthen the work.</italic> </p><p>The revised text reports the uncertainty of each Tite-Seq-measured <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>value using results from three replicate Tite-Seq experiments.</p><p><italic>Subsection “D. Tite-Seq can measure dissociation constants” – The authors state: &quot;We note that…measurements for the WT scFV are about a factor of 10 larger than the previously measured value of K<sub>D</sub>&quot;. I wonder if this is due to the lack of data points at lower concentrations rather than any differences in buffer/etc. Again, a gold-standard, non flow-based assay would help here.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer’s intuition seems to have been correct. The improvements to our yeast display assay, as well as a shift downward in the antigen concentration range used, have substantially reduced the discrepancy between our measured WT <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>values (1.9 nM from Tite-Seq and 2.4 nM from flow cytometry) and the previous results reported by Dane Wittrup’s group (1.2 nM, as reported by Gai and Wittrup, 2010).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> – Because of the two-dimensional heatmap it is somewhat difficult to appreciate the relationship between expression and binding.

We believe that this more clearly illustrates the typical effect that mutations in these two regions have on affinity and expression.</p><p><italic>Appendix C – The authors say they used custom microarray nucleotides to generate the library, but the nature of the sequences on the array is unclear.

This is a curious choice, if the library contained mutations to stop codons (see comment above). Stop codons, particularly early ones, virtually guarantee loss of function.</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript uses a more principled analysis approach, which is detailed in Appendix F. In particular, the mean fluorescence of cells at 0M antigen is used to estimate autofluorescence.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Specific points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please make sure that your deep sequencing data is available on the SRA and relevant computer code is available as supporting file or on a publicly accessible repository.

J. Mol. Biol. 2015, 427:1513-1534.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for this suggestion. These two papers, along with Kowalsky et al. JBC (2015) are now cited in the Introduction as showing how yeast-display-based DMS experiments can be used for mapping the antibody binding epitopes of proteins. We have also cited these papers in the Discussion as examples of the type of experiment that probably does not require full titration curves.</p><p><italic>3) Your approach estimates fairly accurate K<sub>D</sub> at the cost of more experiments (multiple binds, multiple expression levels). For certain applications where precise K<sub>D</sub> values are overkill, it may be more efficacious to use the simpler designs like those used in some of the references that you cite – perhaps worth mentioning.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. The revised Discussion section addresses this matter, i.e., that many experiments (such as the epitope mapping studies discussed above) do not require quantitative <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>measurements and that, in such cases, it will often make sense to use a simpler experimental design.</p><p><italic>Also, do you have any comments on the trade-off between sequencing depth and the accuracy of the inferred K<sub>D</sub>? Similarly for the number of sorting bins? Right now it isn't clear how these were chosen. Clearly your choices worked fine, but it would be nice to explain if there was rigorous rationale for choosing these (alternatively, you could just say that exploring the effects of these parameters is interesting for future work).</italic> </p><p>We have performed simulations that explore the effect of sequencing depth on the precision of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). We have not, however, experimentally tested variations in sequencing depth, the number of sorting bins, or the number of different antigen concentrations. The number of bins we used for sorting, as well as the number of antigen concentrations, was chosen in large part for experimental convenience (e.g., the FACS instrument can sort into 4 bins simultaneously, and the number of sorted cells was chosen to enable a full sort to be completed in about 5 hours). These matters are mentioned in the revised Discussion. We also discuss the fact that the precision of our measured <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>values appears to have been limited by the efficiency with which antibody sequences were recovered from sorted cells, and that improvements in the post-sort recovery of such sequences would probably improve the accuracy of Tite-Seq.</p><p><italic>4) The relatively large unsigned error on two variants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (approximately 2 orders of magnitude in K<sub>D</sub>) should be commented on.

The revised text, along with the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> (see below) notes that the analysis of uncertainty using synonymous mutants reveals a high-variability region of affinity (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>~1E-7 M) that coincides with these outliers.</p><p><italic>5) Are the mutations outside of the dynamic range (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 10 μM) being used in determining correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>Yes.

While it is clear that yeast surface expression and folded surface displayed protein varies between variants (Burns et al., 2014), it has been shown (yet still surprising!) that surface expression (and proper folding) effects are modest for yeast surface display experiments, particularly for residues that are reasonably surface-exposed (Kowalsky and Whitehead, 2016).</italic> </p><p><italic>Burns, Michael L., et al.

While there has been work (e.g. Kowalsky, 2016) suggesting that the effect of mutations on the expression and specific activity of displayed proteins is modest, other work (Burns et al., 2014) finds that these effects can be quite large. In fact, the magnitude of these effects is likely to vary substantially from protein to protein in a largely unpredictable manner. Our main point, which is now clarified, is that one does not know a priori if these contaminating effects will be present, and that one can guard against them only by assaying full binding curves.</p></body></sub-article></article>
