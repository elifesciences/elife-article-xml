Here, we test how neuronal selectivity for visual features is transformed into decision-related signals in posterior parietal cortex (area LIP). Monkeys performed a visual matching task that required them to detect target stimuli composed of conjunctions of color and motion-direction. Neuronal recordings from area LIP revealed two main findings. First, the sequential processing of visual features and the selection of target-stimuli suggest that LIP is involved in transforming sensory information into decision-related signals. Second, the patterns of color and motion selectivity and their impact on decision-related encoding suggest that LIP plays a role in detecting target stimuli by comparing bottom-up sensory inputs (what the monkeys were looking at) and top-down cognitive encoding inputs (what the monkeys were looking for).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23743.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23743.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>visual perception</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>Parietal Cortex</kwd><kwd>Prefrontal Cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY019041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0955640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparison of feature encoding and top-down cognitive signals gives insight into the role of parietal cortex in mediating decision making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Detecting behaviorally important stimuli in a visually cluttered environment (such as a predator in a field of high grass) is a difficult, yet vital ability. Solving such tasks relies on our ability to voluntarily select and enhance the representation of behaviorally relevant spatial and non-spatial features. A large corpus of studies has shown that both space-based attention (SBA) and feature-based attention (FBA) increase the activity of cortical visual neurons selective to the relevant features and positions (e.g. from V4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reynolds et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McAdams and Maunsell, 2000</xref>] or MT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seidemann and Newsome, 1999</xref>]). Recently, we proposed that these attention-dependent gain modulations strengthen the bottom-up flow of relevant information and facilitate their integration and representation by downstream areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>). Specifically, we showed that both SBA and FBA modulations of lateral intraparietal area (LIP) neurons were consistent with LIP linearly integrating inputs from attention-modulated activity in upstream visual cortical areas.</p><p>Our previous studies and the model framework which accompanied them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>) can potentially account for the encoding of individual spatial and non-spatial features in LIP. However, it did not address the role of LIP in solving tasks in which decisions rely on grouping different sensory feature representations and comparing them to an internal cognitive model of task-relevant information. Why does LIP integrate the flow of bottom-up sensory information? Why does LIP represent sensory information that is already reliably encoded in upstream areas? In the past 15 years, a large number of hypotheses about the role of LIP have emerged in the literature. LIP has been proposed to encode stimuli behavioral salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ipata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisley and Goldberg, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcizet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gottlieb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leathers and Olson, 2012</xref>), to transform sensory evidence into decisions about the target of saccadic eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leon and Shadlen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>) or to encode cognitive signals such as rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoet and Snyder, 2004</xref>) or abstract categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sarma et al., 2016</xref>) independently of LIP’s role in spatial processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rishel et al., 2013</xref>). The present study focuses on understanding how LIP jointly encodes sensory, cognitive and decision-related information during a complex memory-based visual-discrimination task in which decisions rely on comparing the identity of observed stimuli to the identity of a remembered stimulus.</p><p>We trained two monkeys to perform a delayed-conjunction matching (DCM) task. At the beginning of each trial, monkeys were cued by one of two sample stimuli about the identity (conjunctions of color and motion-direction features) and position of the upcoming target stimulus. After a delay, successive visual test stimuli were presented simultaneously at two positions. Monkeys were required to identify test stimuli matching the position, color and motion-direction of the sample by releasing a manual lever to receive a reward. This task design allowed us to compare how LIP neurons encode the identity of the test stimuli as well as their match status.</p><p>We show that LIP neurons jointly encode the identity and match/non-match status of test stimuli. Specifically, LIP contains a continuum of mixed selectivity from purely identity-selective neurons to purely match-selective neurons. Interestingly, the identity of the stimuli was encoded prior to their match-status. Moreover, the dynamics of identity-selective signals were not predictive of monkeys’ behavioral reaction times (RT, i.e. timing between test stimulus onset and manual response), while match-selective signals and RT were correlated. Furthermore, this relationship appeared to be independent of motor-preparation signals, suggesting that match-selectivity reflected decision-related process. Finally, we tested how neurons combine independent signals relative to the color and the direction of test stimuli in order to encode their conjunction. We show that identity-selective neurons combine color and direction signals linearly. However, the representation of relevant conjunctions by match-selective neurons was super-additive. Together, these results suggest that, along its visuo-decision continuum, LIP integrates, combines and transforms sensory information into decisions about the relevance of the test stimuli. Such a signal could alert monkeys about the presence of behaviorally relevant stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The goal of this study was to characterize how LIP encodes both the visual features and behavioral significance of visual stimuli. These data have been partially presented in two previous reports in which we studied the effects of SBA and FBA on LIP spatial and non-spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task and behavior</title><p>We trained two macaque monkeys to perform two versions of the DCM task (two-location DCM <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and one-location DCM <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) presented in two previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>). Trials were initiated when monkeys held a manual lever and fixated a central fixation point. In the two-location DCM task, a sample stimulus then appeared either inside or outside the receptive field (RF) of the neuron being recorded (450 ms). After a delay (450 ms), a succession of one to four test stimuli (450 ms each) was presented at the location of the sample stimulus. In the one-location DCM, the sample (550 ms), always presented inside LIP neurons’ RFs, was followed by a delay (550 ms) and a succession of one to three test stimuli (550 ms each). In the two-location DCM task only, distractor stimuli were simultaneously presented at the opposite location (180° in the opposite hemifield). In both versions of the DCM task, test and distractor stimuli were conjunctions of one of eight motion-directions and one of eight colors along a continuum from yellow to red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The sample stimulus was either composed of yellow dots moving in a downward direction (sample A) or of red dots moving in an upward direction (sample B). The monkeys’ task was to release the lever when any of the test stimuli matched the position, color and motion-direction of the sample stimulus. On 20% of trials (25% in the one-location DCM task), no target stimulus was presented (catch trials) and monkeys had to withhold their response until the end of the last test stimulus to get a reward. In the two-location DCM task, test stimuli (presented at the sample location) were randomly picked among three types of stimuli: (1) target stimuli, matching the sample, (2) opposite-target stimuli (i.e. the sample stimulus which was not presented during that trial, e.g. test stimulus A during sample B trials), (3) any of the remaining conjunctions of color and motion-direction. Distractor stimuli (presented at the location opposite the sample) were pseudo-randomly picked among the entire set of 64 stimuli. Correct behavioral responses were rewarded with a drop of juice. Distractor stimuli were always behaviorally irrelevant and had to be ignored. In these tasks, the behavioral relevance of test stimuli A and B changed according to the identity of sample stimulus.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task: (<bold>A</bold>) Two-locations delayed conjunction matching task.</title><p>One of two sample stimuli was presented for 450 ms.

We will also briefly describe the influence of sample identity on the LIP neuronal response. In addition, results will be presented separately for each monkey in each figure but grouped together for statistical tests. However, unless mentioned otherwise, analyzing data separately for each monkey did not affect the outcomes of the following analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Typical LIP neuronal response</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the activity of four different neurons with different patterns of selectivity for the identity, match status, and manual response evoked by test stimuli. Selectivity to the identity of stimuli is exemplified by neuron #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). This neuron responded preferentially to test stimulus B independently (at least in the initial phase of the response) of its match status. Interestingly, the relative strength of identity and match selectivity evolved in time. This neuron was identity-selective from 86 ms to 299 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, black horizontal line in the ROC panel, Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni corrected, p&lt;0.01) and became selective to the match status of the stimuli 209 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, grey horizontal line in the ROC panel, Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni corrected, p&lt;0.01), shortly before this monkey’s average RT. Example neuron #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) illustrates selectivity to the match status of the stimuli (starting 53 ms after stimulus onset), independent of their identity (left panel). The absence of selectivity to target stimuli located outside this neuron’s RF (right panel) suggests that such selectivity cannot be attributed to a motor-preparation signal. However, this pattern of selectivity could also reflect motor-preparation signals modulated by cognitive factors such as the position of attention.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Examples of individual LIP neurons.</title><p>For each example, we show the time course of response to test stimulus A (in blue) and test stimulus B (in red) for both target stimuli (full lines) and opposite-target stimuli (dashed lines). Vertical black dashed lines represent averaged monkey’s reaction times, surrounding grey histograms represent RT’s distributions. We also show the time course of identity selectivity (black lines, ROC comparison stimulus A vs stimulus B) and of match selectivity (grey lines, ROC comparison target vs opposite-target).

Neuron #3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) responded preferentially to test stimulus A compared to test stimulus B (starting from 86 ms after stimulus onset) but also to target stimuli compared to opposite-target stimuli (starting from 124 ms after stimulus onset). We also observed neurons which showed bilateral selectivity to match stimuli, meaning that they responded more strongly to target stimuli (which required a manual response) in either the ipsilateral or contralateral visual field. For example, neuron #4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) responded preferentially to target compared to opposite-target stimuli (starting 103 ms and 171 ms after stimulus onset during attention IN and attention OUT respectively), consistent with several processes such as spatially independent match/non-match decisions, preparation of the manual movement used to report the presence of match stimuli, or reward expectation. Although we treated bilateral and unilateral match selectivity similarly in our analyses, we conducted a series of control analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, Figure 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) which show that removing bilateral selectivity from the two-location DCM dataset yielded qualitatively similar findings.</p><p>In the following, we will characterize these two types of selectivity (identity and match status) at the population level along with the influence of sample identity on LIP neuronal responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stimulus identity and match selectivity</title><p>We characterized stimulus identity and match selectivity using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We compared each neuron’s responses either to test stimuli A and B (identity selectivity), or to target stimuli and opposite-target stimuli (match selectivity)—in both cases for stimuli located inside neurons’ RF. But, as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>), LIP neuronal activity was strongly influenced by the identity of the sample stimulus (Figure 7C) during sample presentation but also during the delay period and prior/during the presentation of each test stimulus. Sample encoding during the delay and test periods is consistent with a role for LIP in encoding task-relevant information in short-term memory. This characteristic of the neuronal response in LIP interfered with our analysis of the dynamics of sensory selectivity as it was responsible for larger response during either sample A or sample B trials, mimicking the effect of identity selectivity on the ROC analysis prior stimulus onset in several neurons (N = 24/74, Wilcoxon test, p&lt;0.05). Therefore, prior to analyzing data, we equated each neuron’s response during either sample A or B trials (depending on each neuron’s preference) using a randomized decimation approach (an approach more conservative of spike train dynamics than standard normalization methods) based on the ratio of firing rates between sample A and sample B trials prior to test stimulus onset (see Materials and methods). After this correction, we observed that a large fraction of LIP neurons (N = 147/201; sliding Wilcoxon test (200 ms window), Bonferroni corrected, p&lt;0.01) showed selectivity for the identity (N = 92; 51/67 for monkey N, 41/70 for monkey M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and/or the match status of the stimuli (N = 103; 34/67 for monkey N, 69/80 for monkey M). In addition, 48/147 neurons (18/67 for monkey N, 30/80 for monkey M) showed significant selectivity for both types of information. This shows that both types of information (identity and match selectivity) are encoded by LIP neurons from both monkeys. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows each neuron’s (N = 147) time-course of both identity (left panel) and match selectivity (middle panel). Neurons are sorted according to the averaged value (100 to 350 ms after stimulus onset) of a visuo-decision index comparing outcomes of the aforementioned ROC analyses (VDI, identity selectivity – match selectivity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). The VDI indicates that the population of LIP neurons selective to either the identity of test stimuli and/or their match-status (N = 147) forms a continuum from purely identity-selective neurons (VDI = 1) to mixed identity and match/non-match selectivity (VDI~ = 0) to purely match-selective neurons (VDI=−1). Neurons from both monkey M and N showed identity and match selectivity. However, the respective strength of selectivity differed between the monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>): distribution of VDI from monkey M are shifted toward negative values (match selectivity) and toward positive values for monkey N (identity selectivity).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of identity and match selectivity in LIP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each line of each of these panels correspond to the time course of identity selectivity (left panel) and match selectivity (middle panel), defined as corrected ROC values.

Three complementary methods revealed that LIP neurons encoded the identity of test stimuli before their match/non-match status. First, a direct comparison of each signal’s latency (black vertical ticks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> left and middle panel, see Materials and methods) revealed that identity-selectivity (N = 92, mean latency = 101.0 ms ± 72 ms) rose significantly earlier than match-selectivity (N = 103, mean latency = 187.3 ms ± 67 ms; t test, p=2*10<sup>−15</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel). This is not due to higher firing rates of identity-selective neurons (N = 92) compared to match-selective neurons (N = 103) since paired comparisons of latencies for neurons selective for both signals (N = 48) revealed a similar dynamic (mean latency: stimulus identity: 107.8 ms ± 68 ms; match selectivity: 191.6 ms ± 65 ms; paired t test, p=1×10<sup>−7</sup>). We confirmed this observation by using a population decoding approach in which we trained SVM classifiers to decode independently the identity or the match status of the stimuli based on the activity of the entire population of LIP neurons (N = 201, see Materials and methods). We found that linear classifiers could decode, above the level expected by chance (50%), the identity of test stimuli (0 ms after stimulus onset) prior to their match status (93 ms after stimulus onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This serial representation of identity and target status in LIP population suggests a role in transforming sensory information into a decision about the match status of test stimuli.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether the time course of each neuron’s activity was correlated to the monkeys’ RTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For each neuron, we paired the time course of each trial’s z-scored firing rate (convolved with a Gaussian function, σ = 15 ms) with that trial’s RT. Importantly, for this analysis, we only used trials in which the sample stimulus was each neuron’s preferred stimulus (e.g. sample A trials for neurons preferring test stimulus A). Artefactual correlation in this kind of analyses can emerge when monkeys’ detection rates fluctuate with the timing at which the stimuli were presented during each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang and Maunsell, 2012</xref>), leading to more presentations of the target stimulus at a certain trial epoch (e.g. a larger number of targets detected during the presentation of the first test stimulus). In this situation, an important control is needed to ensure that the results of this analysis (correlation between firing rates and behavioral reaction times) do not follow a similar pattern. To do so, we first measured whether the number of presentation of the target stimulus depended on its position in the sequence of test stimuli. We observed an over-presentation of target during the first test period compared to the three successive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ANOVA, p=2×10<sup>−7</sup>). Therefore, we removed data acquired during presentation of target stimuli during the first test period from our analysis, using only test stimulus presentations 2, 3 and 4 (2 and 3 for the one-location DCM task). At the population level (N = 147), the magnitude of this correlation (r) covaried with each neuron’s VDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, correlation coefficient = 0.32, p=7×10<sup>−5</sup>). The stronger the influence of match-selectivity compared to identity selectivity, the larger the negative correlation, suggesting that match-selectivity, but not identity-selectivity, reflects a process which covaries with monkeys’ decisions about the relevance of the stimuli.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of neuronal response and monkeys’ reaction times.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: time course of visuo-decision index (similar as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, N = 147).

To address the potential confound between unilateral and bilateral match selectivity, we compared the degree of selectivity to target stimuli located inside and outside neurons’ RFs in the two-location protocol only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, as shown in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibos and Freedman, 2016</xref>), SBA strongly influenced the activity of LIP neurons, with larger activity when monkeys attended inside LIP neurons’ RFs. We sought to remove the influence of SBA on match-selectivity by equating the level of average neuronal activity between attention IN and attention OUT condition. To do so, we used a decimation approach based on the firing rate ratio (Attention IN/Attention OUT) during pre-test stimuli activity (200 ms prior to test stimulus onset, see Materials and methods). A laterality index (target/opposite-target IN minus target/opposite-target OUT), showed that non-spatial processes likely influenced the response of a sub-population of LIP neurons. Laterality index values close to 0 reveal selectivity for target stimuli located inside and outside each neuron’s RF, while positive or negative values indicate match-selectivity limited to stimuli located inside or outside RFs. A permutation test (see Materials and methods) revealed that bilateral match selectivity signals could account for the match selectivity of 20/41 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, permutation test, p&lt;0.05) as they were selective independently of the spatial location of match stimuli. Removing these 20 bilaterally match selective neurons from the pool of 60 neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> did not change the finding of an inverse correlation between choice probability (r-values, linking each neuron’s dynamics and behavioral reaction times) and VDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, p=0.01). Note that when separating monkey M and N, this effect is significant for monkey M (N = 15, p=0.049) but not for monkey N (N = 25, p=0.9). However, our task was not specifically designed to characterize the exact nature of non-spatial match-selectivity signals, which could reflect different processes (e.g. non-spatial decisions, motor-preparation, motor-execution or even reward expectancy). Nevertheless, we were able to identify a population of LIP neurons showing match-selectivity that was independent of non-spatial processes (including motor-preparation), suggesting a role in decision-related computation independent of motor-related processing.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spatial selectivity of decision-related signals (two-location DCM only).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each line in both the left and middle panels correspond to the time course, for one LIP neuron, of match selectivity when relevant stimuli were located inside (left panel) or outside its RF (middle panel).

We also showed in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>) that the same LIP neurons independently encode the color and motion-direction of these stimuli in a manner consistent with a bottom-up integration model. But this model does not account for how LIP neurons combine signals related to color and motion-direction to encode either the identity or the match status of test stimuli. We focus on how LIP neurons encode target stimuli (e.g. test A for stimulus A selective neurons) compared to color-match stimuli (conjunction of the relevant color with any of the seven irrelevant directions), to direction-match stimuli (conjunction of the relevant direction with any of the seven irrelevant colors) and to opposite-target stimuli (e.g. test-stimulus A during sample B trials for A selective cells). The averaged normalized firing rate (N = 147/201, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, top left panel) to each of these stimuli reveals a gradient of responses: target and opposite-target stimuli triggered the largest and smallest responses, respectively, while color and direction-match stimuli triggered intermediate responses. In the framework of our task, responses to non-match stimuli represent the encoding of irrelevant information (e.g. irrelevant features). Therefore, in order to test how LIP neurons combine relevant information, we removed signals related to irrelevant information by subtracting, for each neuron, the response to opposite-target stimuli from the responses to target, color-match and direction-match stimuli (see <italic>methods</italic> for details). Then, we calculated each neuron’s <italic>additivity-index</italic> (<italic>Additivity-index=</italic>target – (color + direction)). Despite its name, this index does not reflect purely linear processes since it results from subtractive normalization (a non-linear computation) in order to take into account relevant information only. This method assumes that irrelevant information contained in target, color-match and direction-match stimuli are equivalent to opposite-target stimuli. An <italic>additivity-index</italic> of 0 corresponds to a pseudo-linear model in which neurons encode conjunctions of features by summing feature-specific sensory inputs. Positive and negative <italic>additivity-indices</italic> represent super-additive and sub-additive mechanisms, respectively. This <italic>additivity-index</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right panel) was significantly negatively correlated with each neuron’s VDI (correlation coefficient = −0.26, p=0.001). This relationship was impacted by separating data from each monkey only when we also removed bilaterally match selective neurons (monkey M, N = 15: correlation coefficient = −0.37, p=0.18; monkey N, N = 25, correlation coefficient = −0.22, p=0.28), likely due to the decrease in sample size. Visual (positive VDI) neurons’ additivity-indices were centered on 0, reflecting additive encoding of conjunction of features, suggesting that identity-selective neurons express their selectivity by linearly pooling bottom-up color and direction encoding. On the contrary, decision-related neurons (negative VDI) showed apparent super-additive (positive additivity-index) encoding of conjunction of features. This was expected given that the information encoded by these neurons is not exclusively related to sensory information, but it is not clear whether and how match-selective neurons integrate and pool bottom-up sensory information in order to generate their selectivity.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Encoding of visual features along the visuo-decision continuum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: averaged normalized response of neurons from the visuo-decision continuum (N = 147) to target, color-match, direction-match and opposite target stimuli.

We previously showed that FBA shifts LIP’s representation of individual features toward the relevant direction and color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>) in a manner consistent with bottom-up integration of sensory information. Moreover, we showed that the amplitude of these feature-tuning shifts depended on the strength of each LIP neuron’s feature-selectivity, which presumably reflects the connectivity between individual LIP neurons and upstream cortical visual neurons. We posited that visually selective LIP neurons (tuned to visual features) are less likely to be modulated by attention than decision-related neurons. To examine this, we compared each neuron’s amplitude of feature-tuning shifts (see Materials and methods) with its respective VDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As predicted, we found a significant correlation between each neuron’s VDI and the amplitude of feature-tuning shifts (for color: correlation coefficient = 0.63, p=1×10<sup>−17</sup>; for direction: correlation coefficient = −0.26, p=0.001), showing that FBA had a larger impact on neurons involved in encoding decision-related signals than on visually selective neurons. Difference in the sign of these correlations results from the respective methods used to describe color and direction tuning shifts (see Materials and methods). For this analysis, separating data from each monkey affected the results when considering the relationship between the effects of FBA on direction selectivity and VDI. This was true for monkey N only when considering both datasets (correlation coefficient = 0.08, p=0.53) and for both monkeys when removing neurons showing bilateral match selectivity (p&gt;0.05 for both monkeys). This was not surprising given the subtle effects of FBA on LIP direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>) described previously. This relationship suggests that match-selectivity in LIP is a composite signal resulting from the pooling of bottom-up sensory information with additional extraretinal signals. Whether it reflects local computation or integration of top-down signal originating in downstream cortical areas is an important question to be considered in future work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recorded the activity of LIP neurons from two monkeys performing a DCM task. Monkeys released a touch bar when test stimuli matched the position, color and motion-direction of a previously presented sample stimulus. On each trial, sample stimulus was randomly picked among two different stimuli and two different positions. Therefore, depending on the identity of the sample, these conjunctions could either be target or opposite-target stimuli. This task design allowed us to characterize the relative importance of sensory and cognitive information in the response of LIP neurons to test stimuli. This revealed that LIP neurons multiplexed both the identity and the match status of stimuli. Interestingly, sensory information (whose time course was weakly correlated with monkeys’ RTs) was encoded prior to decision-related signals (whose timing was predictive of monkeys’ RTs). Finally, we studied how LIP neurons combine color and motion-direction signals in order to encode their conjunction. We found that, along the visuo-decision continuum, the encoding of the relevant conjunctions switched from additive to super-additive. It suggests that (1) identity-selective neurons primarily integrate only bottom-up sensory information, and (2) match-selective neurons integrate additional sources of information. Several previous studies described aspects of LIP activity which could relate to the selectivity described here. For example, LIP identity selectivity relates to selectivity to the category membership of test stimuli described in some previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>). Similarly, selectivity to behaviorally relevant stimuli has been shown in LIP by different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisley and Goldberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leathers and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swaminathan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ibos et al., 2013</xref>). However, the current study is the first to directly characterize and compare each of these types of selectivity in LIP and to integrate them in a coherent theoretical framework. We propose that LIP is composed of a visuo-decision continuum of neurons involved to different degrees in (1) the integration of bottom-up sensory inputs, (2) the linear grouping of these disparate sensory signals and (3) their transformation into a signal related to monkeys’ decisions about the relevance of the visual stimuli. This transformation could result from either local computation, or from the integration of additional top-down signals, but the nature of such computations is still unknown (see below).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Previous model of decision-making in LIP</title><p>In the past decades, posterior parietal cortex has been associated with certain aspects of decision-making by a large corpus of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leon and Shadlen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>). These studies employed similar paradigms in which monkeys discriminated the direction of movement of noisy stimuli and reported their decisions with a saccadic eye movement. During presentation of the noisy-stimuli, if the target of the upcoming saccade was positioned in neurons’ RFs, average responses in LIP monotonically increased (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>]) until they reached a threshold, which corresponded to the execution of the eye-movement. It was posited that the ramping activity reflects accumulation of sensory evidence leading to the decision about the direction of the saccade. This interpretation is at least semantically similar to our observations that LIP, at the population level, appears to integrate, combine and transform sensory information into decision-related signals.</p><p>However, despite these similarities, our approach and model differ in fundamental ways in terms of mechanisms underlying the transformation of decisions into task-appropriate actions. As noted by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filimon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freedman and Assad, 2016</xref>), the stereotypical ramping activity preceding the execution of saccadic eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leon and Shadlen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>) is likely to be driven to a large degree by processes related to preparing the upcoming saccade—which have been extensively shown to modulate the activity of LIP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barash et al., 1991</xref>)—rather than by the motion stimulus or by the accumulation of sensory evidence. This is especially evident since the pre-saccadic activity of LIP neurons has long been associated with the intention of performing a saccadic eye movement toward the RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Buneo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracewell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mazzoni et al., 1996</xref>), that reversible inactivation of LIP does not alter monkeys’ ability to perform such sensorimotor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2016</xref>), and since the motion stimulus in this task is presented outside LIP neurons’ RFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freedman and Assad, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another key difference between our work and previous studies on perceptual-decisions is related to the definition of decision-making. Previous work proposed that perceptual-decisions regarding a visual stimulus are supported by the same neurons as the ones encoding motor actions resulting from its detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>). However, this claim is a subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filimon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freedman and Assad, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tosoni et al., 2008</xref>). Our study, along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leathers and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filimon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freedman and Assad, 2016</xref>), distinguishes between perceptual-decision-making (making a decision about a sensory event) and motor-decision-making (making a decision about which action to initiate). For example, deciding whether an animal is a predator is different from deciding whether the best survival strategy is to run away or to attack him in order to defend your offspring. Our approach is supported by studies showing that LIP multiplexes and independently encodes cognitive (abstract category-selectivity) and saccade-related signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rishel et al., 2013</xref>). Although our task was not designed to specifically distinguish between detection, decision-making and motor-preparation, a large fraction of LIP neurons encoded the relevance of stimuli independently of monkeys’ behavioral responses. This supports the hypothesis that LIP is involved in perceptual decision-making independent of action.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Toward a new model of decision-making in LIP?</title><p>Recently, we showed that representation of individual features in LIP is consistent with the linear bottom-up integration of the activity of populations of feature-selective neurons in upstream visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>). However, this model does not account for how and whether LIP neurons flexibly combine these representations together in order to encode the identity and match-status of test stimuli. Testing how LIP neurons combine signals related to each feature allowed us to begin to identify which computations take place along the LIP visuo-decision continuum. We propose here that identity-selective neurons linearly pool color and motion-direction selective signals, presumably originating from upstream cortical areas. According to Bayesian inference theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kersten et al., 2004</xref>), decision-variables (match-selectivity in our data) are computed by comparing statistical inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parker and Newsome, 1998</xref>) (identity-selectivity in our data) about the stimuli subjects are looking at to an internal model of the stimuli subjects are looking for. The super-additivity observed for match-selective neurons in LIP hypothetically is the outcome of a computation related to the comparison of the identity of the stimuli with top-down signals, presumably originating in PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mante et al., 2013</xref>), related to internal models of which features are behaviorally relevant. The selectivity for sample identity across each trial epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) could reflect the integration of top-down signals related to the identity of the relevant stimuli kept in working memory. Unfortunately, we still lack evidence to understand whether this match-selectivity results from local computation or from the integration of signals from another source. Therefore, future research should focus on developing and testing this question. Specifically, it will be interesting to test how LIP neurons along the visuo-decision continuum respond to independent information encoded in different brain areas—including noisy sensory information, diverse expected value and behavioral costs—and how these sensory and cognitive representations are combined and transformed into a decision signal in LIP.</p><p>Finally, we showed that LIP encodes all the information required to solve the DCM task: (1) the information being encoded in working memory; (2) the stimuli monkeys were looking for; (3) the stimuli monkeys were currently looking at; (4) the monkeys’ match/non-match decisions; (5) the monkeys’ behavioral responses. This large amount of mixed selectivity poses a decoding challenge for downstream areas in charge of reading-out the activity of LIP neurons. Our results underline the diversity of signals influencing and shaping LIP neuronal selectivity and urge us to characterize the functional connectivity that allow LIP neurons to mediate decision-making by facilitating interactions between both upstream and downstream areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavioral task and stimulus display</title><p>Experimental procedures were identical to the ones presented in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibos and Freedman, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2016</xref>). The amplitude of feature-tuning shifts were already presented in this report. Two male monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, monkey M, ~10 kg; monkey N, ~11 kg) were facing a 21 inch CRT monitor on which stimuli were presented (1280*1024 resolution, refresh rate 85 Hz, 57 cm viewing distance), seating head restrained in a primate chair inserted inside an isolation box (Crist Instrument). Stimuli were 6° diameter circular patches of 476 random colored dots moving at a speed of 10°/s with 100% coherence. All stimuli were generated using the LAB color space (1976 CIE L*a*b), and all colors were measured as isoluminant in experimental condition using a luminance meter (Minolta).</p><p>Gaze position was measured with an optical eye tracker (SR Research) at 1.0 kHz sample rate.

Match selectivity was characterized by comparing neuronal firing rates to target and opposite-target stimuli. Significance of each comparison was defined using non-parametric Wilcoxon-test corrected for multiple comparisons (p&lt;0.01, Bonferroni corrected).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Dynamics of neuronal responses</title><p><italic>Individual neuron latencies:</italic> We defined neuronal latencies for identity-selectivity and match-selectivity independently as the first time at which the above-mentioned sliding Wilcoxon-tests reached significance (p&lt;0.01, Bonferroni corrected) for 100 consecutive milliseconds. We limited our analysis to a window between the onset of the test stimuli and the averaged manual-RT during the respective recording session. <italic>Decoding:</italic> We trained and tested two independent linear support vector machine classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>) to decode the identity of the test stimuli and their match status. Stimulus identity: training sets were built by randomly picking with replacement 140 trials from the pool of test A trials (70 target A and 70 opposite-target A test stimulus presentations) and 140 trials from the pool of match B trials (70 target A and 70 opposite-target B test stimulus presentations). Testing sets were built by picking with replacement 60 trials, different from training trials, for similar conditions each.

Testing sets were built by picking with replacement 60 trials, different from training trials, for similar target and opposite-target conditions. These procedures were repeated 1000 times, and classifiers were considered to perform above chance (50%) if the accuracy of the decoder was higher than chance level for more than 990/1000 iterations (p&lt;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Decimation approach</title><p>LIP neuronal responses were strongly influenced by both the identity (FBA) and the position (SBA) of the sample being remembered. These characteristics of neuronal responses interfered respectively with the analysis of the dynamic of identity and match selectivity and with the comparison of match selectivity between attention IN and attention OUT conditions. We equated activity between different conditions using a randomized decimation approach. This method gave qualitatively similar results as divisive normalization with respect to baseline activity (results not shown). <italic>Equating sample A and sample B trials:</italic> In order to test the dynamic of neuronal selectivity to the identity and to the match status of test stimuli, we used a decimation approach to equate the level of neuronal response between sample A and sample B trials based on pre-test stimulus averaged responses. For each neuron, we first computed the ratio of firing rates in a 200 ms window preceding test stimulus presentation between sample A and sample B trials. We then randomly removed from each neuron’s spike trains, the number of action-potentials required to equate the pre-stimulus firing rates. For example, if one neuron showed 20 spikes/s during the 200 ms preceding test stimuli presentation during sample A trials and 25 spikes/s during the same period during sample B trials, we randomly removed 1/5 of all the spikes emitted by this neurons during presentation of test stimuli during sample B trials. <italic>Equating attention IN and attention OUT trials</italic>: In order to compare selectivity to match stimuli located inside and outside each neuron’s RF, a similar approach was used to decimate the spike trains of neuronal responses during attention IN to the level of attention OUT. We computed the ratio of firing rates in a 200 ms window preceding test stimulus presentation between attention IN and attention OUT. In order to base this ratio on response to visual stimuli, we excluded trials in which pre-stimulus corresponds to the delay epoch (test stimulus one in the sequence of test stimuli presentation). We then randomly removed from each neuron’s spike trains as many action potentials as necessary to equate the ratio of pre-stimulus firing rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Permutation test for laterality index</title><p>We used permutations methods to compare match-selectivity to test stimuli located inside or outside neurons’ RFs. First, we selected randomly with replacement trials from target and opposite-target stimuli during attention IN and attention OUT conditions. We then performed ROC analyses comparing responses to target and opposite-target stimuli independently during attention IN and attention OUT conditions. This procedure was repeated 1000 times. We then computed all the combinatory differences between target/opposite-target IN and target/opposite-target OUT (1000 * 1000 direct comparisons). Levels of selectivity between attention IN and attention OUT conditions were considered significantly different if more than 95% of target/opposite-target IN minus target/opposite-target OUT measures were positive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Additivity</title><p>The logic of this analysis was to decompose LIP neuronal responses to target stimuli. Target stimuli were composed of the relevant color, the relevant direction and irrelevant information (such as the shape of the stimuli, the speed of movement of the dots….). We therefore hypothesized that LIP neurons encoded target stimuli as follows (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 1</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where T is the response to target stimuli, C represents the signal related to the relevant color; D represents the signal related to relevant direction and I represents the signal to irrelevant information. However, given our task design, it was impossible to directly assess C and D. We had access to LIP neuronal responses to color-match and direction-match stimuli, which, following the same logic, can be decomposed as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where CM and DM represent responses to color-match stimuli and direction-match stimuli respectively. Optimally, we should define color match stimuli as stimuli composed of the relevant color and the direction of the opposite-target and define direction match stimuli as the conjunction of the relevant direction with the color of the opposite-target. Unfortunately, given our task design, the low number of presentation of these stimuli did not ensure reliable signals. Therefore, in order to approximate CM, we used the conjunctions of the relevant color with any of the seven irrelevant directions. Similarly, we approximated DM using the conjunctions of the relevant direction with any of the seven irrelevant colors.</p><p>Therefore, combining <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9 equ7 equ8">Equations 1, 2 and 3</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Before testing our hypothesis that LIP linearly integrates color and direction-related signals, we need first to subtract signals related to irrelevant information (which in our task corresponds to responses to opposite-target stimuli) to responses to target, color-match and direction-match stimuli signals related to irrelevant information.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.

The main findings reveal that one group of LIP neurons reflects stimulus identity, another represents the match and still the activity of the third group reflects the mixture of the two. The authors also present the data showing correlation between neural responses for matches and reaction times, arguing that these decision-related signals are distinct from the motor preparatory signals.</p><p>Both reviewers had a number of positive comments on the manuscript, stressing its clarity, the rich data set, and solid experimental design.

These are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide an explanation how the data presented here go beyond what is already known about feature selectivity and category-related activity of LIP neurons reported earlier. Strengthening the link to behavior on a trial-by-trial basis could be one way to address this problem.</p><p>2) In the analysis of neural activity show the data for each monkey separately.</p><p>3) Additional analyses of the critical comparisons of identity and match selectivity should exclude 'match selective' neurons with selectivity that could be explained by motor planning.&quot;</p><p>4) Explain the advantages of the decimation approach over standard normalization for the analysis of response selectivity.</p><p>5) Address the apparent asymmetry in the analysis of identity and match selectivity, with the identity analysis involving large stimulus differences while match analysis involving all stimuli.</p><p>6) Address the comment about the use of maximum firing rate as a response metric for the reaction time correlation analysis.</p><p>7) Address the question about subtracting all non-matches in the linearity analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Ibos and Freedman describe a study of LIP's selectivity and dynamics during a task that involves matching of a conjunction of features (color and motion direction). This work thus stands to complement prior studies of both simpler categorization tasks (e.g., direction only) and simpler match-to-sample tasks used in many classic studies. In general, the study is clearly described and the manuscript reports a rich dataset with several appropriate descriptive analyses. The general pattern of results is supported by the figures and quantifications; namely, that (a) some LIP neurons reflect stimulus identity; (b) some LIP neurons reflect the match itself, with delayed dynamics relative to identity; (c) some LIP neurons reflect a mixture; (d) a substantial proportion of these response patterns are distinct from motor preparatory signals; and (e) the match signals arise from a stronger interaction than simple additivity of the color and motion identity signals.</p><p>While I think there's much to be learned from this dataset (and generally believe that this group is furthering our understanding of what LIP might actually compute), I am struggling with the take-home from the manuscript it its current form. I am looking forward to discussion with the other reviewers on this point. The basic identity selectivity seems like a straightforward extension of several studies by this group and others, i.e., we know that LIP neurons often exhibit selectivity for relevant visual features. The match-related signals and their dynamics.… well, might these also be consistent with the category-related activity described in simpler tasks? The dynamics and distribution across neurons are interesting, and the additivity analysis is also a nice touch that points the way toward more quantitative models of what these responses might signify. Perhaps I am just spoiled by some of the excellent work by this group that has compared LIP selectivity and dynamics to, say, PFC, as studied under the same conditions. But to kick off the discussion, I'm still searching for a way to push this study a few more yards to the level of major significance.</p><p>To summarize some possible ways to enrich/expand the impact of this study, the authors could consider:</p><p>1) Errors. I realize that the task is performed at &gt;90% accuracy, but perhaps LIP responses during errors could be leveraged to provide insight into what LIP's relation to behavior. The dissected RT correlation is nice, but given the multi-faceted selectivity and dynamics, it seems like some sort of trial-by-trial relation to behavior might be especially informative.</p><p>2) A more direct explanation of what new is learned from this study relative to both prior work on uni-dimensional categorization and in the related recent attention study by the same authors. I can't help but think I'm missing something pretty obvious about how the authors are thinking about the novelty of this study relative to what was reported in their previous attention study using this task, beyond the disambiguation of motor-related signalling.</p><p>3) Implication of a causal role. Much of the phrasing of the manuscript follows the usual convention of finding a neural correlate and assuming it plays a causal role. Although the authors have not done causal manipulations, I wonder whether this phrasing is not just conventional looseness, but rather reflects their confidence that the dynamics of these signals indeed imply a role in performing the task that is more compelling than in simpler tasks. Could this logic be laid out more clearly?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript reports on neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the macaque brain during a sequential visual matching task. In this task, monkeys are presented with a sample visual stimulus and up to three test stimuli. The stimuli consist of moving dots that can differ in color and direction between presentations. The sample stimulus can appear either in the response field (RF) of the recorded LIP neuron or in the opposite hemifield. The monkey must report with a manual response when the test stimulus matches the sample. All test stimuli are paired with a distractor in the opposite hemifield that provides no information about match vs. non-match.</p><p>The authors report distinct but overlapping populations of neurons in LIP with selectivity for the test stimulus identity, match vs. non-match within a neuron's RF, and match vs. non-match across both visual locations. These signals are multiplexed with residual selectivity that remains for the sample stimulus identity during presentation of the test stimuli. The authors find that selectivity for test stimulus identity generally precedes that for match vs. non-match. The authors also report a correlation between neural responses for matches and monkey's reaction times for the manual report of the match. Finally, the authors argue that identity selectivity in LIP derives from linear pooling of color and motion signals while match vs. non-match selectivity in LIP involves super linear combinations and a larger influence of feature-based attention.</p><p>The manuscript is written well and the experimental design is solid. Furthermore, the questions addressed are important and likely of interest to a large number of researchers. That said, I had numerous questions about the analyses that cause me concern. All of these questions are potentially addressable through clarification and/or further analysis. Below, I describe my questions in more detail.</p><p>1) The authors use two monkeys, but report individually on them only for one panel of the behavioral figure and for none of the neural analyses. It is important to establish which of the findings are supported independently by data from each monkey.</p><p>2) The authors have used an experimental design that allows them to find match selectivity that cannot be the result purely of motor preparation. In particular, they find neurons that respond selectivity for matches within their RF but not for matches outside their RF, even though the latter involve the same motor planning. While the authors have performed this nice analysis, I believe they have still included neurons with selectivity that may be explained by motor planning in most of their other analyses, including the timing analysis. Do the same results hold if this set of neurons is excluded?</p><p>Backing off my concern a bit, I think the authors are overly confident in attributing non-specific match selectivity to motor planning. It could be the result of motor planning, but it also could be a more abstract decision signal about matches regardless of location. Distinguishing the two would require a task with the movement but not the match decision.</p><p>3) One issue faced by the authors was disentangling multiple forms of selectivity that seem to be multiplexed by LIP responses. They dealt with this by combining ROC analyses with a &quot;decimation&quot; strategy that randomly removed spikes from neural responses to equate responsiveness for trials with different sample stimuli. I have multiple concerns about this. I am not sure why the decimation approach that involves randomness was needed. Why couldn't the authors use a more standard form of normalization that didn't involve randomness? Also, the authors should make clear that any approach of this variety assumes the brain knows the identity of the sample stimulus and knows how to compensate exactly for that.</p><p>Even with an alternative to decimation, the problem of multiplexing still exists. The authors have addressed it for selectivity to the sample stimulus, but I don't believe they have addressed it for mixed selectivity for test stimulus identity and match vs. non-match. This causes similar problems for a ROC-based approach. The heart of the issue is of course the mixed selectivity, so the core concern I have is that I don't think the authors have adequately acknowledged the full extent to which this poses challenges to their analyses.</p><p>4) I am worried that the comparison between identity selectivity and match selectivity may be biased. In particular, the description in the Methods seems to suggest identity selectivity is assessed comparing test stimulus A to test stimulus B and not using any intermediate stimuli, while match selectivity involves all stimuli, including ones very close to the match. If this is the case, it would be problematic because the former is an easier discrimination than the latter and it would call into question the comparisons between the two. Perhaps I am misunderstanding this, though, and the authors restricted the match selectivity analysis to the same stimuli as the identity selective analysis. In that case, I withdraw this concern.</p><p>5) I have a number of questions for the reaction time correlation analysis. I worry about the robustness of using the maximum firing rate as the metric for the neural responses. This treats very small maximum rates the same as large ones. It also discounts that the maximum may be achieved after the decision, sometimes even after the manual response. It would be nice to know that this analysis is robust to these concerns. Are similar results obtained using a metric that involves exceeding a threshold response level (recognizing this approach will involve some trials not being able to be included)? To what extent is the correlation driven by the ceiling caused by the actual movement? (For example, the absence of data points in the bottom right of the middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> seems to be driving the correlation.) Are the latencies (intercept of the correlation) reasonable given the authors conclusions?</p><p>6) For the linearity analysis, I didn't understand why the authors would subtract all non-matches. This treats very close non-matches as identical to very far non-matches. More generally, it seems odd to start an analysis about linearity with an extremely non-linear first step in the analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23743.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Provide an explanation how the data presented here go beyond what is already known about feature selectivity and category-related activity of LIP neurons reported earlier.

We hope that they agree that the following explanations and the changes made to our manuscript better portray the significance of our study. First, reviewer 1 suggested that we analyze error trials in order to link neuronal activity to behavioral responses. Such data would be of great interest and we tried to perform these analyses. Unfortunately, the number of error trials, which was very low for each condition, did not yield enough statistical power to draw reliable conclusions about these results nor did it allow us to detect trends in how erroneous behaviors affect LIP neuronal responses. However, we have improved the analysis of the correlation between neuronal dynamics and monkeys’ behaviors (see point 6).</p><p>Before responding to reviewer 1’s individual points, we would like to emphasize the novelty of our study compared to our previous work and that from other groups. To our knowledge, our study is the first:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To characterize overlapping populations of identity and match selective neurons in LIP (described in our study as a continuum).

Specifically, we propose that LIP is an interface between different sources of bottom-up and top-down signals, integrating task relevant signals in order to compute decision variables.</p><p>More specifically, we would like to address reviewer 1’s specific points and discuss how the pattern of results described in our study builds on, goes beyond, and differs from the discoveries from our previous studies. We understand reviewer 1’s concern came from 2 specific points:</p><p>A) The identity selectivity is not surprising given that “LIP neurons often exhibit selectivity for relevant visual features”.</p><p>This is an important point, which we have addressed and clarified in the revised manuscript. Our two previous articles (Ibos &amp; Freedman 2014, 2016) showed that, depending on feature-based or space-based attention, color and direction tuning of LIP neurons were shifted toward the relevant features. While LIP neurons were indeed selective to task relevant features (color and direction), they were not necessarily preferentially tuned to the color or the direction which was relevant on each trial. For example, the direction tuning shifts were subtle and relatively few neurons were tuned to direction A during sample A trials and to direction B during sample B trials. Therefore, it was difficult to predict how LIP neurons encode conjunctions of relevant color and relevant motion direction in order to facilitate the monkeys’ decisions. The current study describes this aspect of our data which was not described in our previous reports.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to stress that, in our 2 previous studies, we excluded from our analyses of feature selectivity neuronal activity acquired during presentation of match stimuli, and analyzed selectivity to either the color or the direction of test stimuli. However, we never described how LIP responded to conjunctions of color and direction. Therefore, the previous studies accounted for how LIP encoded color or direction features, it did not account for how LIP neurons encoded their conjunction. Nothing in these previous reports described how LIP combined these two sources of sensory information (color and motion direction), nor addressed mechanisms by which LIP might encode either the match status of the stimuli or their identity. Testing how LIP neurons encode conjunctions of relevant features is complementary but also fundamentally different than asking how attention affects LIP feature representations. We were able to address this distinction because of our task design: monkeys had to base their decision on multiple features (color and direction), each encoded in visual cortex by different pools of neurons located in different brain areas (presumably V4 for color, MT for motion-direction). Since monkeys were not able to base their decisions on a single feature (as it was the case in most, if not all, studies of decision-making in LIP), neurons involved in the match/non-match decision needed to combine both sources of information.</p><p>B) “The match-related signals and their dynamics […] might […] also be consistent with the category-related activity described in simpler tasks.”</p><p>We realize now that we need to make an additional effort in considering the relationship between this work and previous results from our lab during visual categorization tasks. The two lines of work differ in important ways.</p><p>It is true that some of our previous work about category selectivity in LIP described some aspect of the neuronal response to match stimuli. Supplementary Figure 5 of (Freedman &amp; Assad, 2006) shows that category selectivity in LIP is highly similar during sample and test presentation. For example, a neuron selective to category 1 during the sample and delay period was also selective to category 1 during test presentation, whether the presented stimulus was a match or a non-match. Therefore, this selectivity of LIP neurons to abstract category membership of test stimuli is related to encoding the task-relevant features of test stimuli, but cannot account for LIP match selectivity described in the current study.</p><p>Another study from our group (Swaminathan, Masse &amp; Freedman, 2013) compared responses of LIP and MIP neurons to matching and non-matching test stimuli. This study described a significant modulation of LIP neuronal response by the match status of the test stimuli (according to a two-way ANOVA) but specifically stated that “LIP response was more dependent on both the match/non-match status as well as category of test stimuli”. In addition, that study showed that the LIP population response to test stimuli was similar during match and non-match trials (Figure 2 of (Swaminathan et al., 2013)). We agree with reviewer 1 when she says that our description of match selectivity is consistent with our previous work. However, the current study goes well beyond previous work to give insight into how task-relevant feature encoding relates to, and aids in the computation of, decision variables.</p><p>In our opinion, and given the points mentioned above, the current study represents an important step forward in the understanding of selectivity to sensory and cognitive factors in LIP. In order to clarify these points, we made several changes in the manuscript:</p><p>Introduction: “Our previous studies and the model framework which accompanied them (Ibos and Freedman, 2014, 2016) can potentially account for the encoding of individual spatial and non-spatial features in LIP. However, it did not address the role of LIP in solving tasks in which decisions rely on grouping different sensory feature representations and comparing them to an internal cognitive model of task-relevant information.”</p><p>Introduction: “LIP has been proposed to encode the behavioral salience (Arcizet et al., 2011; Bisley and Goldberg, 2003, 2010; Gottlieb et al., 1998; Ipata et al., 2009; Leathers and Olson, 2012) of stimuli, to transform sensory evidence into decisions about the target of saccadic eye movements (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; Huk and Shadlen, 2005; Leon and Shadlen, 1998; Shadlen and Newsome, 2001) and to encode cognitive signals such as rules (Stoet and Snyder, 2004) or abstract categories (Freedman and Assad, 2006; Sarma et al., 2015; Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012) independently of LIP’s role in spatial processing(Rishel et al., 2013). The present study focuses on understanding how LIP jointly encodes sensory, cognitive and decision-related information during a complex memory-based visual-discrimination task in which decisions rely on comparing the identity of observed stimuli to the identity of a remembered stimulus.”</p><p>Discussion, first paragraph: “We found that, along the visuo-decision continuum, the encoding of the relevant conjunctions switched from additive to super-additive. […] We propose that LIP is composed of a visuo-decision continuum of neurons involved to different degrees in 1) the integration of bottom-up sensory inputs, 2) the linear grouping of these disparate sensory signals and 3) their transformation into a signal related to monkeys’ decisions about the relevance of the visual stimuli.”</p><p>Discussion, paragraph called “Toward a new model of decision-making in LIP?”: “The super-additivity observed for match-selective neurons in LIP hypothetically is the outcome of a computation related to the comparison of the identity of the stimuli with top-down signals, presumably originating in PFC (Mante et al., 2013), related to which features are behaviorally relevant. The selectivity for sample identity across each trial epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) could reflect the integration of top-down signals related to the identity of the relevant stimuli kept in working memory.”</p><p><italic>2) In the analysis of neural activity show the data for each monkey separately.</italic> </p><p>As proposed by reviewer 2, we now show the data separately for each monkey. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the time course of identity selectivity, match selectivity and of the visuo-decision index for each monkey and task. In addition, in each scatter plot, data from monkey M are shown with full black dots, data from monkey N are shown with empty circles.</p><p>During the two-location DCM task, 27/36 and 19/36 of Monkeys N’s neurons were selective to the identity and match status of the test stimuli, respectively. Similarly, 18/24 and 22/24 of monkey M’s neurons were selective to the identity and match status of the test stimuli, respectively.</p><p>During the one-location DCM task, 24/31 and 15/31 of monkey N’s neurons were selective to the identity and the match status of the test stimuli, respectively. Similarly, 23/56 and 47/56 of monkey M’s neurons were selective to the identity and the match status of the test stimuli, respectively.</p><p>This shows that both types of information are encoded similarly in both monkeys. However, an analysis of the visuo-decision indices showed asymmetric distributions. Monkey N’s VDI were shifted toward positive values (identity encoding), while monkey M’s VDI were shifted toward negative values (match status encoding). However, despite this asymmetry, both types of information are encoded in each monkey and the main conclusions of our analyses are marginally impacted by separating data from each monkey. Below, we provide a detailed description of the few analyses and results which were impacted:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Correlation between neuronal response and reaction times: Removing bilaterally selective neurons: this control analysis is impacted for monkey N if we remove neurons with bilateral selectivity to match stimuli (corr coef=0.01; p=0.9). This loss of statistical power for this control can be explained by the decrease in sample size. It is now explained in the Results section.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correlation between additivity index and VDI: full datasets: Additivity index and VDI of monkey N’s neurons are not significantly correlated (corr coef=-0.20, p=0.09) but follow the same trend as the ones of monkey M. Removing bilaterally selective neurons: results are statistically impacted for both monkeysbut follow the same trends (monkey M: corr coef=-0.37, 0.17; monkey N: corr coef=-0.23, p=0.26). This lack of statistical power can also be attributed to smaller sample sizes (monkey M, N=15; monkey N=25). This has been explained in the relevant section of the Results section.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correlation between amplitude of direction tuning shifts and VDI: full datasets: resultsare impacted for monkey N (corr coef=-0.08, p=0.53). Removing bilaterally selective neurons: results are impacted for both monkeys (corr coef=-0.06, p=0.68). This is not surprising given that direction tuning shifts are more subtle than color tuning shifts and therefore more difficult to characterize (Ibos &amp; Freedman 2014, 2016). Decreasing sample’s size strongly reduce the power of our tests.</p></list-item></list><p>Given the small impact of separating data from each monkey from a statistical point of view, and for sake of clarity of our manuscript, we now plot each monkey’s data separately but present statistics for both monkeys grouped together. We clarify this point now at the beginning of the Results section: “We recorded the activity of 201 individual LIP neurons while monkeys performed the tasks (74 during two-location and 127 during one-location DCM tasks). […] However, unless mentioned otherwise, analyzing data separately for each monkey did not affect the outcomes of the following analyses.”</p><p><italic>3) Additional analyses of the critical comparisons of identity and match selectivity should exclude 'match selective' neurons with selectivity that could be explained by motor planning.&quot;</italic> </p><p>Our analyses included neurons selective to either the identity of the stimuli or to their match status. We didn’t differentiate between neurons selective to match stimuli located only inside neurons’ RF (N=21, unilaterally match selective neurons) and neurons selective to match stimuli located both inside and outside neurons’ RF (bilaterally match selective neurons, N=20). This later population could reflect motor-related signals which are by definition linked to monkeys’ behaviors. It is therefore crucial to control for the possibility that the effects related to match selectivity described in our study are not due to this very specific population of bilaterally match selective neurons. We have now included controls for this issue in supplementary figures.</p><p>We focus our control analysis on the population of neurons acquired during the two-location DCM task (N=60/74). As a control, we removed from this pool of neurons the population of 20 neurons which showed bilateral selectivity and show that it does not affect our conclusions. LIP still shows a continuum of mixed selectivity from purely identity-selective to purely match-selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, removing neurons most closely associated with motor-related selectivity (the neuronal population bilaterally selective for the match status of test stimuli) does not change the sequential timing of identity and match selectivity. Finally, we still observe the inverse correlation between the visuo-decision index and the choice probability (correlation coefficient between firing rates dynamics and monkeys’ reaction times, this control has been added as Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>However, we had to make a choice: should we remove this population of 20 bilaterally match selective neurons from our pool or should we include them? The response to this problem was not trivial. It is directly related to reviewer 2’s comment in which they asked us to temper our claim that bilateral match selectivity reflects a motor-preparation signal. We completely agree with reviewer 2 about this point. Our task was not designed to differentiate motor/reward/abstract and non-spatial decision processes, which is an issue we are addressing with ongoing and planned follow-up studies.</p><p>Given the minor impact of removing bilaterally match selective neurons (shown in supplementary figures) on our results, we decided to group bilateral and unilateral match selective neurons together, and to include these data in our results, but also to present these controls in supplementary figures. This allowed us to merge data from both datasets (two-location and one-location delayed conjunction matching tasks, Ibos &amp; Freedman 2014, 2016).</p><p>In addition to what we originally claimed in the Results section – “However, our task was not specifically designed to characterize the exact nature of non-spatial match-selectivity signals, which could reflect different processes (e.g. motor-preparation, motor-execution or even reward expectancy)” – we have included additional details about this issue in the revised manuscript. First, we have removed the following sentence from our manuscript: “In the following, unilateral match selectivity will be associated with the decision process while bilateral selectivity will be linked to motor-planning.” Second, we have modified the end of the paragraph called “Typical LIP neuronal response” (in which we describe responses of individual LIP neurons). We now no longer directly refer to bilateral match selectivity as related to motor-preparation, we instead use the more neutral terminology of bilateral match selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; along the text):</p><p>“Moreover, selectivity for the identity and match status of test stimuli were not mutually exclusive and some neurons multiplexed these signals. […] In the following, we will characterize these two types of selectivity (identity, match status) at the population level along with the influence of sample identity on the neuronal response.”</p><p><italic>4) Explain the advantages of the decimation approach over standard normalization for the analysis of response selectivity.</italic> </p><p>In our study, we needed to equate level of neuronal activity between either sample A and sample B trials, or attention IN and attention OUT conditions in order to compare dynamics of identity and match selectivity. We used a randomized decimation approach. We could have used a more standard normalization method in which the firing rates (average over a period of time) would have been divided by a factor representing the ratio of response between sample A and B or attention IN and OUT conditions prior to stimulus presentation. The two methods are nearly equivalent. However, using a decimation approach allowed us to work with (decimated) spike trains instead of averaged firing rates and therefore to keep intact the dynamic of the neuronal response. Our method is therefore more conservative of the dynamics of neuronal responses on a trial to trial basis. This point has been clarified in the manuscript:</p><p>“Therefore, prior to analyzing data, we equated each neuron’s responses during either sample A or B trials (depending on each neuron’s preference) using a randomized decimation approach (an approach more conservative of spike train dynamics than standard normalization methods) based on the ratio of firing rate between sample A and sample B trials prior to test stimulus onset (see Methods).”</p><p>In the second part of their remark, reviewer 2 asks us to acknowledge two kinds of challenges raised by mixed selectivity in LIP: A) a conceptual challenge related to how the brain areas read out LIP population activity showing mixed selectivity, and B) a technical challenge related to our analysis.</p><p>A) We acknowledge the computation challenge it represents for the areas reading out LIP activity. We have now included a sentence in the last paragraph of the Discussion: “The observation of mixed selectivity poses a decoding challenge for downstream areas in reading-out the activity of LIP neurons.”</p><p>B) It is true that mixed selectivity for sample identity and test stimulus identity posed a challenge to our analyses. For example, prior to decimation, a neuron selective to the identity of the sample during test presentation would exhibit an artefactual identity selectivity in our analyses. However, the mixed selectivity of match and identity information did not pose such a challenge in our analyses, since they are symmetrical (we use the exact same neuronal responses to characterize identity and match selectivity). Therefore, there is no reason why identity selectivity would interfere with match selectivity (and vice versa). For example, a stronger response to test stimulus A during sample A and B trials compared to test stimulus B during sample A and B trials will show strong identity selectivity but weak match selectivity according to our ROC analyses.</p><p><italic>5) Address the apparent asymmetry in the analysis of identity and match selectivity, with the identity analysis involving large stimulus differences while match analysis involving all stimuli.</italic> </p><p>We realize that our original description of this analysis approach was confusing, which we have clarified in the revised manuscript. The following response also stands for point 7. When we talked about non-match stimuli in these comparisons and all along the study, we referred to either test stimulus A (during sample B trials) or test stimulus B (during sample A trials) when they did not match the sample stimulus. Therefore, the ROC analyses characterizing identity and match selectivity were symmetrical. This has been clarified in the revised manuscript. The terms “match stimuli” and “non-match stimuli”have been replaced by “target” and “opposite-target stimuli”: “test stimuli (presented at the sample location) were randomly picked among 3 types of stimuli: (1) target stimuli, matching the sample, (Connor et al., 1997) opposite-target stimuli (i.e. the sample stimulus which was not presented during that trial, e.g. test stimulus A during sample B trials), (McAdams and Maunsell, 2000) any of the remaining conjunctions of color and motion-direction.”</p><p><italic>6) Address the comment about the use of maximum firing rate as a response metric for the reaction time correlation analysis.</italic> </p><p>In this analysis, we wanted to link the dynamics of neuronal responses to the monkeys’ behavioral response. In the original version of this manuscript, we used maximum firing rates as a measure of neuronal dynamic. As pointed out by reviewers, this method is unconventional and our additional analyses show that it is not a crucial approach for this point. We have replaced it by a more standard method. Now, we first z-score the time course of each trials’ firing rates (after convolving each trial’s spike trains with a Gaussian (σ=15°)). We then correlate each trial’s z-scores with each trial’s manual reaction time (this method is similar to the one described and used by several studies, e.g. Cook &amp; Maunsell, 2002). This method allowed us to address the issue raised by reviewers about the previous version of the analysis. Results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We have also modified the paragraph describing these results in the Results section:</p><p>“To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether the time course of each neuron’s activity was correlated to the monkeys’ RTs. […] Artefactual correlation in this kind of analyses can emerge when monkeys’ detection rates fluctuate with the timing at which the stimuli were presented during each trial (Kang and Maunsell, 2012), leading to more presentation of the target stimulus at a certain trial epoch (e.g. larger number of target detected during the presentation of the 1<sup>st</sup> test stimulus).”</p><p><italic>7) Address the question about subtracting all non-matches in the linearity analysis.</italic> </p><p>We tried to understand how LIP neurons combine different sources of sensory information about the color and the motion direction of test stimuli. Our approach involved a subtracting normalization method which, we realize now, needs to be clarified. Reviewers’ remarks referred to two main concerns:</p><p>For the linearity analysis, reviewer 2 asked about the analysis step of subtracting neuronal activity for non-match trials. This concern relates to point #5, and our initially confusing explanation of the term “non-match” in the original manuscript. This has been clarified in the text as we replaced the term “non-match” by “opposite-target”.</p><p>Reviewer 2 raised a crucial point: “it seems odd to start an analysis about linearity with an extremely non-linear first step in the analysis.”</p><p>The logic of this analysis was to decompose LIP neuronal responses to target stimuli. Target stimuli were composed of the relevant color, the relevant direction and irrelevant information (such as the shape of the stimuli, the speed of movement of the dots….). We therefore hypothesized that LIP neurons encoded target stimuli as follow (equation 1):<disp-formula id="equ6"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where T is the response to target stimuli, C represents the signal related to the relevant color; D represents the signal related to relevant direction and I represents the signal to irrelevant information. However, given our task design, it was impossible to directly assess C and D. However, we had access to LIP neuronal responses to color-match and direction-match stimuli, which, following the same logic, can be decomposed as follow:<disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ8"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where CM and DM represent responses to color-match stimuli and direction-match stimuli respectively. Optimally, we should define color match stimuli as stimuli composed of the relevant color and the direction of the opposite-target stimulus and define direction match stimuli as the conjunction of the relevant direction with the color of the opposite target target-stimulus. Unfortunately, given our task design, the low number of presentation of these stimuli didn’t ensure reliable signals. Therefore, in order to approximate CM, we used the conjunctions of the relevant color with any of the 7 irrelevant directions. Similarly, we approximated DM using the conjunctions of the relevant direction with any of the 7 irrelevant colors. Therefore, combining equations 1, 2 and 3:<disp-formula id="equ9"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Before testing our hypothesis that LIP linearly integrates color and direction related signals, we needed first to subtract signals related to irrelevant information (which in our task correspond to responses to opposite-target stimuli) to responses to target, color-match and direction-match stimuli.

An <italic>additivity-index</italic> of 0 corresponds to a pseudo-linear model in which neurons encode conjunctions of features by summing feature-specific sensory inputs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
