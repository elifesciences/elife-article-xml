Vertebrates have three transcriptional factors, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Among them, Gli3 is a very special transcriptional factor which closely resembles <italic>Cubitus interruptus</italic> (Ci, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) structurally and functionally as a ‘double agent’ for Shh target gene expression. Here we show that Gli3 full-length, but not the truncated form, can be methylated at K436 and K595. This methylation is specifically catalyzed by Set7, a lysine methyltransferase (KMT). Methylation at K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3, resulting in an enhancement of Shh signaling activation. Furthermore, functional experiments indicate that the Gli3 methylation contributes to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that Set7 mediated methylation is a novel PTM of Gli3, which positively regulates the transactivity of Gli3 and the activation of Shh signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15690.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15690.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15690.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in mammals need to be able to communicate with each other to enable them to work together in tissues and organs. A signaling pathway called Hedgehog signaling plays a crucial role in carrying information between cells in developing embryos, but if it is active at other times it can also promote the development of cancers.</p><p>The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates the activity of several proteins, including one called Gli3. When the Hedgehog signaling pathway is not active, Gli3 is able to switch off certain genes in the cells. On the other hand, when the signaling pathway is active, Gli3 changes shape so that it is able to activate its target genes instead. It is thought that this shape change is triggered by the addition (or removal) of chemical tags to Gli3. So far, researchers have reported that several different types of chemical tags can modify the activity of Gli3. However, it is not clear whether another type of chemical tag – known as a methyl tag – is involved in regulating Gli3.</p><p>Fu et al. studied Hedgehog signaling in mice. The experiments show that an enzyme called Set7 can modify Gli3 by adding methyl tags to certain sites in the protein. This modification makes the protein’s structure more stable and helps it to bind to the target genes. Further experiments show that these methyl groups contribute to the progression of lung cancer. Fu et al.’s findings expand our understanding of how chemical tags can alter the cells’ response to Hedgehog signaling activity. Future challenges are to understand exactly how Set7 and Gli3 interact and to develop drugs that can block this interaction, which may have the potential to treat cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15690.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15690.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hedgehog signaling</kwd><kwd>Gli3</kwd><kwd>Set7</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31171414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31371492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81372233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hailong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The “Strategic Priority Research Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB19020104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Methylation of Gli3 by Set7 enhances the activation of Hedgehog signaling and contributes to tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays critical roles in embryonic development and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hooper and Scott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nieuwenhuis and Hui, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao and Chuang, 2015</xref>). Its misregulation leads to many types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gialmanidis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang and Hui, 2008</xref>). Hh pathway is activated when Hh ligands (Shh, Ihh or Dhh) bind to their repressive receptor Patched (Ptc), a twelve-transmembrane protein, leading to alleviation of its repression on the signaling transducer, Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein. The unleashed Smo can then activate the Gli transcription factors, resulting in the expression of downstream target genes, like <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic>. In vertebrate, there are three Gli proteins, Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. While Gli1 acts as a transcriptional activator and amplifies the Shh signal in a positive feedback loop, Gli2 and Gli3 mainly function as the Shh-regulated transcriptional activator and repressor. Among them, Gli3 draws considerable attentions due to its structural and functional similarity to Ci. Like Ci, Gli3 plays critical roles in modulating the switch-on and -off of Shh signaling. In the absence of Shh signaling, Gli3 is partially proteolyzed into a truncated transcriptional repressor (Gli3<sup>R</sup>) to block the expression of downstream target genes. In the presence of Shh signaling, Gli3 is in a full-length transactivation form and activates the expression of downstream genes like <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2002</xref>).</p><p>There is substantial evidence demonstrating that post-translational modifications (PTMs) play important roles in regulating protein functions, especially in regulating the transactivity of transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Filtz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inuzuka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Munro et al., 2010</xref>). Like many other transcriptional factors, Gli3 is also subjected to various PTMs. Among them, phosphorylation and ubiquitination modifications are well characterized in regulating the transactivity of Gli3. For example, in the absence of Shh signal, Gli3 is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3 and CKI, and subsequently ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>Slimb/β-TrcP</sup> for partial proteolyzation to confer it trans-repressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tempé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Li, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Whether other PTMs are involved in the regulation of Gli3 transactivity remains elusive.</p><p>Protein methylation is one of the most common PTMs and plays an important role in regulating the transduction of signaling pathways, like MAPK, BMP, WNT, Hippo and JAK-STAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bikkavilli and Malbon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oudhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Viña et al., 2013</xref>). Protein methylation typically happens on arginine or lysine residues catalyzed by peptidylarginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) or lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) respectively. So far, near 50 KMTs and 9 PRMTs had been identified in human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biggar and Li, 2015</xref>). Among them, Set7 is one of the most studied KMTs, regarding its pivotal role in methylation of non-histone proteins. Although Set7 was first identified as a histone lysine methyltransferase specifically for Histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation, an epigenetic marker associated with transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), accumulating evidence indicates that methylation of non-histone proteins including P53, P65, TAF10 and so on is the major biological function of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biggar and Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chuikov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ea and Baltimore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Set7 mediated methylation of Lys372 in P53 increases its stability, resulting in the induction of P53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chuikov et al., 2004</xref>). P65 can be methylated by Set7 at Lys37 which enhances the DNA binding and improves the expression of NF-κb target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ea and Baltimore, 2009</xref>). Previous sequence alignments of the methylated sites on the initial substrates of Set7 revealed a predicted consensus sequence motif for Set7: (K/R)-(S/T/A)-<bold>K</bold>-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Couture et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, a recent peptide-array based analysis redefined this recognition motif to: (G/R/H/K/P/S/T)-(K&gt;R)-(S&gt;K/Y/A/R/T/P/N)-<bold>K</bold>-(Q/N)-(A/Q/G/M/S/P/T/Y/V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhayalan et al., 2011</xref>), which dramatically expands the putative targets of Set7.</p><p>Here, we report that Gli3 full-length, but not the Gli3 repression form, can be methylated at the K436 and K595 sites in vivo and in vitro. This methylation is specifically catalyzed by Set7. Moreover, the methylation modifications on K436 and K595 respectively increases the stability and the DNA binding capacity of Gli3, resulting in enhanced activation of Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this Set7 mediated Gli3 methylations contribute to the tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. These findings expanded our understanding of PTM-directed Gli3 transactivity regulation, and implied a therapeutic potential of Set7 in treating tumors dependent on Shh signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Set7 methylates Gli3 full-length but not the repression form at K436 and K595 sites in vitro</title><p>Given that the transcriptional activity of Gli3 is orchestratedly regulated by multiple PTMs, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and that protein methylation plays an important role in regulating several key signaling pathways, we sought to examine whether Gli3 can be post-translationally modified by methylation. We performed a mass spectrometry analysis of flag-tagged Gli3 from the cell lysate of HEK293T. This mass spectrometry analysis showed two methylation modifications on Gli3 K436 and K595 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By comparing the flanking sequence of K436 and K595 with reported Set7 substrates, such as ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Subramanian et al., 2008</xref>), P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chuikov et al., 2004</xref>), PCAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masatsugu and Yamamoto, 2009</xref>) and Histone 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), we found strong similarities among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel), suggesting the possible involvement of Set7 in methylation of these two residues. Interestingly, these methylation signals were exclusively present in the Gli3 full-length but not the truncated repression form according to the mass spectrometry result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Through sequence alignments, we found that these two sites in Gli3 are evolutionally conserved in many species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further test if the methylations on K436 and K595 are catalyzed by Set7, in vitro methylation assays were performed by incubating MBP-tagged peptides of Gli3, MBP-K436 (amino acids from 344 to 463 of Gli3) or MBP-K595 (amino acids from 464 to 666 of Gli3) with GST-Set7 and <sup>3</sup>H-SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Set7 can specifically methylate the peptides, MBP-K436 and MBP-K595, whereas the substitution of K436 or K595 with arginine (K436R or K595R) abolished Set7 mediated Gli3 methylation. In addition, GST pull-down assays further indicated the interaction between Set7 and Gli3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15690.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Set7 methylates Gli3 full-length in vivo and in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the reported Set7 substrates with Gli3K436 and Gli3K595 (upper). Schematic representation of Gli3 protein and the truncated peptide used in in vitro methylation assay (<bold>B</bold>) and GST pull-down assay (<bold>C</bold>) (lower).

Dot plot assays confirmed the specificity of those antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with the results of mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous Gli3 in HEK293T cells followed by immunoblot showed that only the full-length Gli3 contains the methylation signals on Gli3-K436 and Gli3-K595 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The methylation signals were decreased upon Set7 knockdown, indicating that methylation on these two sites of Gli3 is mediated by Set7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of Set7 drastically improved the methylation levels whereas the catalytically inactive mutant of Set7, Set7<sup>H297A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), had no effect on those methylations of Gli3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, Set7 failed to methylate Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> or Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>, the arginine substitution mutants of Gli3, in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Since the methylation happens exclusively in the full-length Gli3, which acts as a principal transcription activator of Shh pathway in response to Shh signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 1999</xref>), we then adopted, NIH-3T3, a cell line fully responsive to the Shh signaling, to perform our further investigation. Cells with stable expression of individual unrelated Set7 shRNAs showed significantly reduced methylation signals on K436 and K595 of Gli3 compared to cells expressing luciferase control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, the Gli3 arginine substitution mutants, Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>, showed abolished methylation signals when blotted with the matched antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Given that only the full-length Gli3 can be methylated, we began to use a Gli3<sup>PA</sup> mutant, in which the six phosphorylatable serines in the PKA target clusters were mutated to nonphosphorylatable alanines, resulting in the resistance of Gli3<sup>PA</sup> to be processed into Gli3<sup>R</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niewiadomski et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I'</xref>). Similar to the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, the methylation signals can be detected in Gli3<sup>PA</sup> but not in its arginine substitution mutants, Gli3<sup>PAK436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>PAK595R</sup> when blotted with respective antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Given the Shh signaling plays an important role in the development of multiple embryonic tissues of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>), we started to examine whether these methylation signals exist in the Gli3 in several responsive mouse embryonic tissues, such as brain, lung, skin, skeleton and gut. Indicated tissues were collected from embryos 14.5 days post coitum (dpc) and Gli3 methylation signals were detected by western blot using anti-Gli3 antibody, Me-K436 antibody and Me-K595 antibody, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, the methylation signals on Gli3 full length were only detected in embryonic lung tissues. Since Gli3 full-length can be methylated by Set7 in vivo and in vitro, we then examined whether Set7 interacts with Gli3. GST pull-down assays indicated that GST-tagged Set7 can successfully pull down the flag-tagged Gli3 full-length of NIH-3T3 cells in the presence of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Therefore, we demonstrate that Set7 can methylate the full-length, but not the repression form of Gli3, at K436 and K595 residues, indicating that Gli3 is a novel substrate of Set7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Set7 positively regulates the activation of Shh signaling by methylating Gli3</title><p>Set7 can modulate the activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as NF-κb, JAK-STAT, we sought to examine whether Set7 also regulates Shh signaling. We performed Shh luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1990</xref>) in the condition of Set7 knockdown. In the absence of Shh, downregulation of Set7 had no effect on the luciferase activity. In contrast, Set7 knockdown dramatically decreased the luciferase activity in the presence of Shh, suggesting that Set7 plays a positive role on Shh pathway activation but has no effect on the basal level of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A’</xref>). In line with this finding, overexpression of Set7 but not its inactive mutant Set7<sup>H297A</sup> can significantly enhance the luciferase activity in the presence of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that its methyltransferase activity is required for Set7 mediated Shh activation. Furthermore, Set7 mediated increase of luciferase activity was in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then examined whether Set7 knockdown affects the expression of endogenous Shh target genes, like <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic>. In the presence of Shh, NIH-3T3 cells expressing Set7 siRNAs showed significant reduction in Set7 protein levels and a parallel decrease in <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> mRNA levels compared to cells expressing control siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). In addition, Gli1 protein level was also decrease in cells with Set7 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). It’s of interest that either Shh or SAG, the agonist of Shh pathway, directed activation of Shh signaling can upregulate Set7 levels, whereas Gli1 knockdown can lead to a decrease of <italic>Set7</italic> mRNA levels, suggesting the existence of a potential positive feedback loop between Set7 and Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A'</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, NIH-3T3 cells treated with Shh showed greatly increased methylation signals on Gli3 which may be probably due to increased Gli3 full-length or/and Set7 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the methylation signals of Gli3 is regulated by Shh input.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, although Set7 knockdown can suppress the activation of Shh signaling, this inhibition was abolished when the Gli3 level was depleted by RNAi. In contrast, depletion of both Gli1 and Gli2 in MEF cells showed no effect on releasing such inhibition due to Set7 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings apparently indicate the requirement of Gli3 on Set7 mediated Shh activation. Furthermore, compared to Gli3<sup>WT</sup>, the mRNA levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> and the Shh luciferase activity were decreased in cells expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>, suggesting that Set7-directed Gli3 methylation plays an important role in maintaining Shh activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). In consistent with this finding, cells expressing the Gli3<sup>PA</sup> point mutants, Gli3<sup>PAK436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>PAK595R</sup>, showed decreased Shh luciferase activity and levels of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> transcripts compared to those with Gli3<sup>PAWT</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). To further confirm this notion, Shh luciferase reporter assays were performed. Either Set7 downregulation or upregulation can lead to the reduction or the induction of Shh luciferase activity respectively in cells with Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression but not in cells expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). Thus, our findings strongly suggested that Gli3 methylation at K436 and K595 sites are required for Set7-mediated enhancement of Shh signaling activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Methylation by Set7 improves the stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3 full-length</title><p>Gli3 can be regulated at multiple levels to affect the transduction of Shh signaling, such as trafficking to the primary cilium, changes of protein stability or binding ability to the promoters of target genes. In mammal, the primary cilium (cilia) is an essential organelle for Shh signaling transduction. Gli3 traffics in and out of the cilia all the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In the presence of Shh, Gli3 initially accumulates in the cilium tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and then functions as Gli3<sup>A</sup> to bind to the promoter of <italic>Gli1</italic> to further transduce the signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). In order to verify whether Set7 mediated Gli3 methylation affects its cilial translocation, we performed cilial staining in Shh treated NIH-3T3 cells with stable expression of Set7 shRNA, Set7 or Set7<sup>H297A</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, the Gli3 accumulation on the tips of cilia was comparable among those three groups, suggesting that the Set7-related changes of Shh activation are not due to the cilial translocation of Gli3.</p><p>It has been reported that Set7 can influence the stability of its methylated substrates like P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chuikov et al., 2004</xref>). Given the importance of Gli3 stability on Shh signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tempé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), we then tested whether Set7 can also affect the stability of Gli3. Western blot showed that knockdown of Set7 caused a significant reduction of endogenous Gli3 at protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel), whereas overexpression of Set7 improved the Gli3 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). This Set7 mediated induction of Gli3 seems due to PTMs, because the mRNA level of Gli3 had no change regardless whether Set7 was knocked down or overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further confirm this point, we then tested whether Set7 can affect the protein levels of the unmethylatable Gli3 mutants, Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>. As expected, exogenous Gli3<sup>WT</sup> had the same change as the endogenous Gli3. Interestingly, like the Gli3<sup>WT</sup>, the protein levels of Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> were still subjected to the modulation of Set7, whereas the protein levels of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup> were not responding to either knockdown or overexpression of Set7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). These findings suggested that the methylation at K436 but not K595 causes stability change of Gli3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Finally, the reduced half-life of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, but not Gli3<sup>WT</sup> or Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> was defined by western blot in cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

To examine whether Set7 also affects the DNA binding ability of Gli3, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed in NIH-3T3 cells in the presence of Shh. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, knockdown of Set7 greatly decreased the binding of Gli3 on <italic>Gli1</italic>’s promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although Shh treatment can almost completely block the processing of Gli3 full-length to Gli3<sup>R</sup>, trace Gli3<sup>R</sup> background may still disturb the result of ChIP assays. In order to address this concern, we established NIH-3T3 cell lines with stable expression of C-terminal flag-tagged Gli3 (Gli3-flag). Thus, only the Gli3 full-length can be recognized by anti-flag antibody. ChIP assays with anti-flag antibody demonstrated that Set7 knockdown markedly affected the binding of Gli3 on <italic>Gli1</italic>’s promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>), suggesting that Set7 augments the DNA binding of Gli3 full-length. Given that K595 is on the zinc finger which is important for DNA binding of Gli3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pavletich and Pabo, 1993</xref>), it’s conceivable that the Set7 mediated methylation on K595 may contribute to increased DNA binding of Gli3. Stable cell lines expressing Gli3<sup>WT</sup>-flag, Gli3 mutants (Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>-flag and Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>-flag) were established. Comparable expression of flag-tagged Gli3 was detected in those three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). ChIP assays with anti-flag antibody showed dramatically impaired the DNA binding ability in Gli3<sup>K595R</sup>-flag, whereas the Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>-flag presented the similar DNA binding ability to Gli3<sup>WT</sup>-flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), suggesting that Set7 mediated methylation at K595 enhances the DNA binding ability of Gli3. In addition, the binding ability of Gli3 was also examined in the promoter regions of <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>Hhip</italic> by ChIP assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the binding of Gli3 to these regions was markedly impaired after Set7 knockdown. In conclusion, Set7 improved the protein stability and DNA binding ability of Gli3 through methylation of K436 and K595 sites respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The methylation of Gli3 positively regulates tumorigenesis in NSCLCs</title><p>Misregulation of Shh pathway has been reported in many types of cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gialmanidis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hui and Angers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang and Hui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>). Since Set7 can augment Shh activation by increasing Gli3 stability and its DNA binding ability on the promoter regions of <italic>Gli1</italic>, we then determined whether this Set7-Gli3-Gli1 axis plays a role in tumor development. By comparison on the mRNA levels of <italic>Set7</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> between Beas2B, a normal bronchial epithelial lung cell line, and A549, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, we found that both <italic>Set7</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> were extensively expressed in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the GEO database search (GSE10245) showed a positive association between <italic>Set7</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic> in NSCLC tumor samples, suggesting the involvement of this Set7-Gli3-Gli1 axis in the development of NSCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To examine the existence of this regulation axis in A549 cells, we performed Shh luciferase reporter assays and qPCR to evaluate the activity of Shh signaling in A549 cells with Set7 knockdown. Depletion of Set7 displayed a decreased luciferase activity and reduced expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Our above findings indicate that unmethylatable mutations at either K436 or K595 cause a significant reduction of Shh signaling activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). To examine whether unmethylatable mutations at both sites will lead to a synergistic suppression on Shh signaling activation, we constructed a double arginine substitution mutant of Gli3, Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup>, in which both K436 and K595 were mutated to arginine. To further examine whether Gli3 methylations at K436 and K595 are important for Set7-mediated Shh activation in A549 cells, we performed luciferase assays and qPCR. Compared to A549 cells with stable Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression, reduced luciferase activity and transcripts of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> were detected in cells stably expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). In addition, more severe suppression on luciferase activities and <italic>Ptch1</italic> mRNA, but not <italic>Gli1</italic> mRNA, was observed in cells expressing Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup>, suggesting that the methylation at these two sites plays a synergistic role in regulating Shh signaling activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In line with the reduced Shh activation, MTT assays showed attenuated growth in cells stably expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> compared to cells with Gli3<sup>WT</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Since anchorage-independent growth is tightly associated with tumor development, we then determined whether Set7-mediated Gli3 methylation affects this feature.

Combined with our results above, we started to examine whether this Set7-Gli3-Gli1 axis also plays a role in cell migration or invasion. To evaluate cell migration changes, transwell migration and wound healing assays were performed in A549 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K and L</xref>, A549 cells with the expression of Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> had limited migration ability compared to Gli3<sup>WT</sup>.

It further confirms that the methylation on Gli3 full-length regulates tumorigenesis in NSCLCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In present study, we demonstrated that Set7 can exclusively methylate Gli3 full-length at K436 and K595 sites in vitro and in vivo. These methylations on Gli3 augment the activation of Shh signaling. To our knowledge, we for the first time identified Gli3 as a novel substrate of Set7 and demonstrated the involvement of Set7 in Shh activation. Furthermore, we showed that Set7 mediated methylation on K436 increases the protein stability of Gli3 whereas the methylation on K595 boosts the DNA binding of Gli3. Finally, functional experiments indicated that this Set7-mediated Gli3 methylation contributes to the tumor growth and metastasis in NSCLCs in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Hh signaling is one of the most conserved signaling pathways. The silence or activation of Hh signaling is tightly regulated by various post-translational modifications (PTMs) at multiple levels. Gli3 is a key transcriptional factor determining the switch-off and -on of Shh signaling. The PTMs of Gli3 like phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tempé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Li, 2006</xref>) and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) are largely involved in this process. For example, in the absence of Shh, Gli3 full-length is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3 and CK1 and is subjected to SCF<sup>Slimb/β-TrcP</sup> mediated ubiquitination followed with partial proteasome degradation to generate a truncated repression form, Gli3<sup>R</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tempé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Li, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Protein methylation, as one of the most common PTMs, participates in the regulation of signaling transduction of multiple signaling pathways, like MAPK, BMP, WNT, Hippo and JAK-STAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bikkavilli and Malbon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oudhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Protein methylation is catalyzed by methyltransferase. Among them, Set7 draws tremendous attention to its predominant role in methylating non-histone proteins. In this study, we identify that Gli3 is a novel substrate of Set7. By methylating Gli3, Set7 positively regulates the activation of Shh signaling pathway.</p><p>It’s of particular interest that, although Gli3<sup>R</sup> also has these two residues, K436 and K595, the Set7 mediated methylation solely occurs in Gli3 full-length. One possible explanation comes from the differential cellular localization of Gli3<sup>R</sup> and Gli3 full-length in the absence of Shh. A recent study demonstrates that the stability of Dnmt1 can be dynamically regulated by Set7 and demethylase, Lsd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Since Lsd1 is a nuclear protein, it is conceivable that Lsd1 can also remove the methylation modifications of Gli3<sup>R</sup>, resulting in these signals undetectable either by mass spectrometry or western blot. In addition, we found increased Set7 levels in cells treated with Shh or SAG, suggesting a positive feedback loop between Set7 and Shh signaling. Thus, in the presence of Shh signaling, although Gli3 full-length also translocates into the nucleus subjected to Lsd1 mediated demethylation, increased Set7 could possibly compensate this demethylation effect, resulting in augment in Shh signaling. Therefore, it will be particularly interesting to examine whether Lsd1 and Set7 can dynamically regulate the activation of Shh signaling by demethylation and methylation of Gli3 respectively.</p><p>We demonstrated that Set7 methylates K436 and K595 of Gli3. The methylation on K436 increases the protein stability and the methylation on K595 enhances the DNA binding of Glli3. These two methylation modifications of Gli3 are not redundant, because arginine substitution in either point severely impairs the activation of Shh signaling, suggesting the role of Set7 in fine-tuning the transactivity of Gli3.</p><p>It has been recently reported that the activation of Shh signaling represses the canonical WNT signaling in colon epithelial cell differentiation, and that WNT pathway activation negatively regulates Shh pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van den Brink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yanai et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a mutual repelling crosstalk between these two pathways. Given that Set7 can inhibit WNT signaling by methylating β-catenin, and activate Shh signaling by methylating Gli3, it’s very possible that Set7 is a key regulator involved in this WNT-Shh crosstalk.</p><p>Abnormal activation of Shh signaling contributes to tumor development by promoting cell proliferation and EMT in many cancer types. Our present study indicates that Set7 mediated Gli3 methylation is critical for this oncogenic role of Shh pathway because cancer cells expressing Gli3<sup>K436R</sup>, Gli3<sup>K595R</sup> or Gli3<sup>KRKR</sup> showed severely reduced growth and metastasis in xenograft tumor models. This finding strongly suggests a therapeutic value of Ser7 in targeting Shh-dependent tumors, such as BCC, MB and Lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The Gli3 and Set7 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Chi-chung Hui and Dr. Min Wu respectively.

All identified MS/MS spectra were searched against this target/decoy database (Human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, 2014-10-29 download). Spectra were initially searched with a mass tolerance of 7 ppm in MS and 0.5 Da in MS/MS and strict trypsin specificity. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed modification, whereas N-acetyl protein, oxidized methionine, and mono-methylated lysine (putative methylation site) were searched as variable modification. The estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of all peptide and protein identifications was fixed at maximum 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro methylation assay</title><p>Prepare a 100 µl reaction mixture containing 75 µl MAB buffer (50 mM Tris pH8.5, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM BME, 250 mM Sucrose), 4 µl of <sup>3</sup>H labelled S-adenosyl methionine (<sup>3</sup>H-SAM) (Perkin elmer), 4 µl of GST-Set7 protein (at 1 mg/ml), 10 µl 10×BSA and 4 µl of 10×protease inhibitor cocktail.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Set7 mediated Gli3 methylation plays a positive role in the activation of Sonic Hedgehog pathway&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by one peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Green as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fu et al. investigate the potential methylation regulation of Hh-Gli signaling. They show that Gli3 can be methylated at K436 and K595 by the lysine methyltransferase Set7, leading to enhanced stability and DNA binding activity. The results linking posttranslational methylation to Gli function are interesting and have potential cancer relevance. However, the authors need to address several issues to confirm their conclusions and demonstrate their physiological relevance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All of the RNAi experiments need to be done with at least two unrelated siRNAs or shRNAs. This is done in some but not all experiments. For example, the use of two siRNAs or shRNAs appears to be missing in Figures: 1G, 2G, K and 3A, B, H.</p><p>2) The authors claim that Set7 methylates full-length Gli3, but not the truncated repressor form. However, this is hard to assess in several of the current immunoblots. High-quality immunoblots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, G and H</xref> should be provided. In addition, the authors should also test whether Set7 can methylate the Gli3 truncated form when ectopically expressed.</p><p>3) With the available K436/K595 antibodies, the authors should examine whether methylation at these sites occurs in vivo in responsive tissues in mice or fly. Please let us know if you have access to these tissue samples and the time frame for you to complete an experimental test of Gli3 methylation in vivo.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. ChIP-qPCR should be carried out on other well-established Gli targets in addition to the sites in the Gli1 promoter.</p><p>Desirable but not essential revisions:</p><p>1) Is the level of methylation regulated by Hedgehog ligand input?</p><p>2) The importance of the manuscript would be strengthened if the authors could demonstrate that the Set7-Gli3 regulation occurs in canonical Hh tumors, such as BCC and MB.</p><p>3) Gli3 has been reported to function both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor. Therefore, the strong pro-oncogenic effect of Gli3 in the presented xenografts experiments may be a bit surprising. Can the authors comment on this issue?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15690.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) All of the RNAi experiments need to be done with at least two unrelated siRNAs or shRNAs.

As suggested, we have now included an additional siRNA or shRNA in revised Figures: 1G, 2G, K and 3A, B, H.

However, this is hard to assess in several of the current immunoblots. High-quality immunoblots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, G and H</xref> should be provided. In addition, the authors should also test whether Set7 can methylate the Gli3 truncated form when ectopically expressed.</italic></p><p>We are sorry for the low-quality immunoblots in our original manuscript. As suggested, we have now repeated the experiments and replaced the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, G and H</xref> with high-quality immunoblots. Thanks for point out this issue.</p><p>We also tested whether Set7 can methylate Gli3 truncated form in the context of ectopic expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>, the methylation signals in Gli3 truncated form were detectable when Gli3<sup>R</sup> or both Set7 and Gli3<sup>R</sup> were ectopically expressed. As we showed in our manuscript, however, the methylation signals were undetectable in the Gli3 truncated form derived from either endogenous Gli3 or flag-Gli3 full length (please see the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). More important thing is that this phenomenon is repeatable. Thus we believe that the methylation signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref> are quite artificial which are possibly due to excessive expression of Gli3<sup>R</sup> or the lack of Gli3 processing in this ectopic expression model. Therefore, we decide not to include this result into the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15690.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Methylation signals in Gli3<sup>R</sup> when both Set7 and Gli3<sup>R</sup> were overexpressed.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15690.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15690.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15690-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) With the available K436/K595 antibodies, the authors should examine whether methylation at these sites occurs in vivo in responsive tissues in mice or fly. Please let us know if you have access to these tissue samples and the time frame for you to complete an experimental test of Gli3 methylation in vivo.</italic></p><p>We thank Reviewers for this good suggestion. Given that Shh signaling plays an important role in the development of multiple embryonic tissues of mice (Ingham &amp; McMahon, 2001), we started to examine whether these methylation signals exist in the Gli3 in several responsive mouse embryonic tissues, such as brain, lung, skin, skeleton and gut, by western blot. These embryonic tissues were collected from embryos at 14.5 (dpc). Gli3 methylation signals were detected by western blot using Me-K436 and Me-K595 antibodies respectively. The methylation signals on Gli3 full length were only detected in embryonic lung tissues. Consistent with our original manuscript, methylation signals were not detectable in Gli3 truncated forms of all embryonic tissues tested. Accordingly, we also included this data into revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. ChIP-qPCR should be carried out on other well-established Gli targets in addition to the sites in the Gli1 promoter.</italic></p><p>We thank the Reviewers for this constructive suggestion to improve our study. <italic>Hhip</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> are well-established Shh downstream target genes. A previous report indicates that Gli3 can bind <italic>Ptch1</italic> promoter to transactivate <italic>Ptch1 (</italic>Agren et al., 2004). Bioinformatic analysis revealed a putative binding sequence of Gli3 in the promoter of <italic>Hhip</italic>. Through CHIP-qPCR, we found that Gli3 can bind to promoter regions of both <italic>Hhip</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> and this binding is subjected to the regulation of Set7. Accordingly, we also included this data into revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Desirable but not essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Is the level of methylation regulated by Hedgehog ligand input?</italic></p><p>We do observe increased methylation levels in endogenous Gli3 after Shh treatment in 3T3 cells. This Shh mediated the increase of methylation signals may be probably due to increased Gli3 full-length or/and Set7 levels which were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A'</xref>. Therefore, we conclude that the Gli3 methylation level is regulated by Hedgehog ligand input. Accordingly, we also included this data in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.

In our opinions, it’s very likely that the Set7-Gli3 regulation occurs in canonical Shh tumors. Unfortunately, due to the lack of collaboration with clinicians, we do not have BCC and MB samples to examine the existence of this regulation in these tumors currently. However, we will definitely pursue this point in our future studies. Thanks for this important suggestion. Thanks!</p><p><italic>3) Gli3 has been reported to function both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor. Therefore, the strong pro-oncogenic effect of Gli3 in the presented xenografts experiments may be a bit surprising. Can the authors comment on this issue?</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that Gli3 functions both as a transcriptional activator and a repressor. Because of this bipartite feature of Gli3, its oncogenic potential has been long neglected. However, recent emerging evidence indicates that Gli3 actually promotes tumor progression in multiple cancer types such as cervical cancer and colon cancer (Kang et al., 2012; Wen et al., 2015). Similar to these two cancer types, we demonstrate the oncogenic role of Gli3 in lung cancer in our current study. The tumor promoting role of Gli3 may be probably attributed to its transactivation of <italic>Gli1</italic> or other oncogenes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
