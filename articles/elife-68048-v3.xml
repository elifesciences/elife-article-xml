loss. Our analysis of cerebral cortex, lung, liver, and muscle transcriptomes of 16 mice, covering development and ageing intervals, revealed widespread but tissue-specific ageing-associated expression reversals. Cumulatively, these reversals create a unique phenomenon: mammalian tissue transcriptomes diverge from each other during postnatal development, but during ageing, they tend to converge towards similar expression levels, a process we term <italic>Di</italic>vergence followed by <italic>Co</italic>nvergence (DiCo). We found that DiCo was most prevalent among tissue-specific genes and associated with loss of tissue identity, which is confirmed using data from independent mouse and human datasets. Further, using publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we showed that DiCo could be driven both by alterations in tissue cell-type composition and also by cell-autonomous expression changes within particular cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>reversal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013060</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dönertaş</surname><given-names>Handan Melike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific and Technological Council of Turkey</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somel</surname><given-names>Mehmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science Academy (Turkey) BAGEP Awards</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somel</surname><given-names>Mehmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>METU Internal Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Somel</surname><given-names>Mehmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leibniz Institute on Aging – Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dönertaş</surname><given-names>Handan Melike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dönertaş</surname><given-names>Handan Melike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cross-sectional transcriptome analysis of mice, covering the whole lifespan, reveals that inter-tissue divergence during development is accompanied by a weaker but widespread convergence during ageing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development and ageing in multicellular organisms are highly intertwined processes. On the one hand, certain ageing-related phenotypes, such as presbyopia and osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luegmayr et al., 2004</xref>), are believed to represent the continuation of developmental processes into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blagosklonny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Magalhães and Church, 2005</xref>). Such cases of ‘runaway development’ or higher than optimal function during ageing (recognised as the hyperfunction theory of ageing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gems and Partridge, 2013</xref>) may arise due to declined natural selection pressure failing to optimise expression regulation after sexual reproduction starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Medawar, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams, 1957</xref>). Indeed, recent experimental studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> show that senescence phenotypes promoted by insulin-IGF-1 signalling pathways support the hyperfunction theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lind et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ezcurra et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, molecular studies have also reported a reversal of the ageing transcriptome towards pre-adult levels in various contexts, including primate brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colantuoni et al., 2011</xref>), and mouse liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anisimova et al., 2020</xref>). Studying the functional consequences of this reversal pattern in the ageing human brain, we previously interpreted it as an indication of loss of cellular identity in neurons, possibly exacerbated by a reduction in the relative frequencies of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>). Such changes, in turn, could be caused by the accumulation of stochastic damage at the genetic, epigenetic, and proteomic levels over an adult lifetime, causing deregulation of gene expression networks.</p><p>Several major questions remain. First, the prevalence of reversal phenotypes across tissues is unclear as most research has been conducted in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>). A second question pertains to the similarity of reversal-exhibiting genes and pathways across tissues. Ageing-related expression changes are partly shared among organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zahn et al., 2007</xref>), and reversal trends are also shared across different regions of the primate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>). Distinct tissues might hence show parallel reversal patterns. Alternatively, as mammalian tissues diverge from each other during development in their transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>), one may hypothesise that during ageing tissues converge back towards similar transcriptome profiles. Such a putative late-age convergence phenomenon would be consistent with the notion of ageing-related cellular identity loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>). A final question concerns the mechanism behind the observed reversal trends at the bulk tissue level. Specifically, the contribution of cell-type composition and cell-autonomous changes to the reversals at the tissue level remains unexplored.</p><p>Documenting the reversal phenomenon is critical to better understand the proximate mechanisms of mammalian ageing, and its ultimate mechanisms, such as the stochastic disruption versus continued expression of developmental genes. However, such work has been limited by the scarcity of studies that include both development and ageing periods of the same organism and across different tissues. This work presents an age-series analysis of bulk transcriptome profiles of mice, including samples of four tissues across postnatal development and ageing periods covering the whole postnatal lifespan. Using this dataset, we study the prevalence, mechanisms, and functional consequences of the reversal phenomenon in different mouse tissues. We further test the related hypothesis of tissue convergence during ageing and investigate the contribution of cell-type composition and cell-autonomous changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We generated bulk RNA-seq data from 63 samples covering the cerebral cortex (which we refer to as cortex), liver, lung, and skeletal muscle (which we refer to as muscle) of 16 male C57BL/6J mice, aged between 2 and 904 days of postnatal age (Materials and methods). As mice reach sexual maturity by around 2 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tacutu et al., 2018</xref>), we treated samples from individuals aged between 2 and 61 days (n = 7) as the development series, and those aged between 93 and 904 days (which roughly correspond to 80-year-old humans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>) (n = 9) as the ageing series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The final dataset contained n = 15,063 protein-coding genes expressed in at least 25% of the 63 samples (one 904-day-old mouse lacked cortex data).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tissues diverge during postnatal development</title><p>Consistent with earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>), we found that variation in gene expression is largely explained by tissue differences, such that the first three <underline>p</underline>rincipal <underline>c</underline>omponents (PCs) separate samples according to tissue (ANOVA p&lt;10<sup>–20</sup> for PC1–3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), with the cortex most distant from the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Meanwhile, PC4, which explains 8% of the total variance, displayed a shared age effect across tissues in development (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ρ = [-0.88, –0.99], nominal p&lt;0.01 for each test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Also, after the tissue effect was removed by standardisation, principal components analysis (PCA) showed a strong influence of age on the first two PCs, which explains 31% of the variance in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We further observed higher similarity among tissues at the juvenile stage compared to the young-adult stage. In other words, distances between tissues increased with age (change in mean Euclidean distance among tissues with age during development in PC1–PC4 space ρ<sub>dev</sub> = 0.99, p<sub>dev</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which resonates with previous reports of inter-tissue transcriptome divergence during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). This divergence pattern was also observed when PCA was performed with developmental samples only (days 2–61: change in mean Euclidean distance among tissues in PC1–PC4 space; ρ = 0.95, p=0.0008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a and b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Data summary and age-related expression patterns.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Principal components analysis (PCA) of expression levels of 15,063 protein-coding genes across four tissues of 16 mice.

First, we investigated similarities in overall trends of gene expression changes with age using the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ) between expression levels and age for each gene in each tissue separately for the developmental and ageing periods (Materials and methods; tissue-specific age-related gene expression changes and functional enrichment test results are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then examined transcriptome-wide similarities across tissues during development and ageing by comparing these gene-wise expression-age correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Considering the whole transcriptome without a significance cutoff, we found a weak correlation of age-related expression changes in tissue pairs, both during development (ρ = [0.17, 0.39], permutation test p&lt;0.05 for all the pairs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and ageing (ρ = [0.23, 0.33], permutation test p&lt;0.05 in 4/6 pairs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We then tested whether developmental patterns among tissues may be shared more than ageing-associated patterns, but we did not find significant difference between inter-tissue similarities within the development and those within ageing (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.31). Moreover, the number of genes with the same direction of change (without applying a significance cutoff) across four tissues was consistently more than expected by chance (permutation test p&lt;0.05), except for genes upregulated in ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This attests to overall similarities across tissues both during postnatal development and during ageing, albeit of modest magnitudes. We obtained similar results using another normalisation approach, variance stabilising transformation (VST) from the DESeq2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Love et al., 2014</xref>), and confirmed that the observed patterns are not affected by the choice of normalisation method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplements 10</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">11</xref>).</p><p>In the second approach, we focused on genes showing a significant age-related expression change, identified separately during development or during ageing (using Spearman’s correlation coefficient and false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected p-value&lt;0.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We found that the developmental period was accompanied by a large number of significant changes (n = [1,941, 6,151], 13–41% across tissues), with the most manifest changes detected in the cortex. The genes displaying significant developmental changes across all four tissues also showed significant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>; permutation test: p<sub>shared_up</sub> = 0.027, p<sub>shared_down</sub> &lt; 0.001). Using the Gene Ontology (GO), we found that shared developmentally upregulated genes were enriched in functions such as hormone signalling pathways and lipid metabolism (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1). Meanwhile, shared developmentally downregulated genes were enriched in functions such as cell cycle and cell division (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Contrary to widespread expression change during development (13–41%), the proportion of genes undergoing significant expression change during ageing was between 0.013 and 15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This contrast between postnatal development and ageing was also observed in previous work on the primate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Işıldak et al., 2020</xref>). In terms of the number of genes with a significant ageing-related change, the most substantial effect we found was in the lung (n = 2319), while close to no genes showed a statistically significant change in the muscle (n = 2), a tissue previously noted for displaying a weak ageing transcriptome signature across multiple datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turan et al., 2019</xref>). Not unexpectedly, we found no common significant ageing-related genes across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>). Considering the similarity between the ageing and development datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and the similar sample sizes in development (n = 7) and ageing periods (n = 9), the lack of overlap in significant genes in ageing might be due to low signal-to-noise ratios in the ageing transcriptome as ageing-related changes are subtler compared to those in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Gene expression reversal is a common phenomenon in multiple tissues</title><p>We then turned to investigate the prevalence of the reversal phenomenon (i.e. an opposite direction of change during development and ageing) across the four tissues. We first compared the trends of age-related expression changes between development and ageing periods in the same tissue, without a significance cutoff, to assess transcriptome-wide reversal patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This revealed weak negative correlation trends in liver and muscle (though not in the lung and cortex), that is, genes up- or downregulated during development tended to be down- or upregulated during ageing, respectively. These reversal trends were comparable when the analysis was repeated with the genes showing relatively high levels of age-related expression change (|ρ| &gt; 0.6 in both periods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). We further studied the reversal phenomenon by classifying each gene expressed per tissue (n = 15,063) into those showing up- or downregulation during development and during ageing. Here, again, we did not use a statistically significance cutoff and summarised trends of continuous change versus reversal in each tissue. This approach follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref> and focuses on global trends instead of single genes. In line with the above results, as well as earlier observations in the brain, kidney, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anisimova et al., 2020</xref>), we found that ~50% (43–58%) of expressed genes showed reversal trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), although these proportions were not significantly more than randomly expected in permutation tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>, Materials and methods). Overall, we conclude that although the reversal pattern is not ubiquitous, the expression trajectories of the genes do not necessarily continue linearly into the ageing period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pathways related to development, metabolism, and inflammation are associated with the reversal pattern</title><p>We then asked whether genes displaying reversal patterns in each tissue may be enriched in functional categories. Our earlier study focusing on different brain regions had revealed that up-down genes, that is, genes showing developmental upregulation followed by downregulation during ageing, were enriched in tissue-specific pathways, such as neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>). Analysing up-down genes compared to all genes upregulated during development, we also found significant enrichment (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1) in functions such as ‘synaptic signalling’ in the cortex, as well as ‘tube development’ and ‘tissue morphogenesis’ in the lung, ‘protein catabolic process’ in the liver, and ‘cellular respiration’ pathways in the muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Meanwhile, down-up genes (downregulation during development followed by upregulation during ageing) showed significant enrichment in functions such as ‘wound healing’ and ‘peptide metabolic process’ in the cortex, ‘translation’ and ‘nucleotide metabolic process’ in the lung, ‘inflammatory response’ in the liver, and ‘leukocyte activation’ in the muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Genes showing a reversal pattern are not shared among tissues</title><p>As tissues displayed modest positive correlations in their development- or ageing-related expression change trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), and as we had previously observed that distinct brain regions show similarities in their reversal patterns (i.e. the same genes showing the same reversal type), different tissues might also be expected to show similarities in their reversal patterns. Interestingly, we found no overlap between gene sets with the reversal pattern (up-down or down-up genes) across tissues, relative to random expectation (permutation test, p<sub>up-down</sub> = 0.08, p<sub>down-up</sub> = 0.53; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). Such a lack of overlap might be explained if genes showing reversal patterns in each tissue tend to be tissue-specific. It would also be consistent with the notion that reversals involve loss of cellular identities gained in development, during which tissue transcriptomes appear to diverge from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). This result led us to ask whether, in accordance with the reversal phenomenon, inter-tissue transcriptome divergence may be followed by increasing inter-tissue similarity, or convergence, during ageing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Inter-tissue divergence during development and convergence during ageing</title><p>We studied the inter-tissue divergence/convergence question using two approaches. In the first, we analysed how transcriptome-wide expression variation among tissues changes with age regardless of their age-related expression patterns in any particular tissue. To do this, for each individual, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CoV) across the four tissues for each commonly expressed gene (n = 15,063), which represents a measure of expression variation among tissues. Then, we assessed how such inter-tissue variation changes over the lifetime by calculating the Spearman’s correlation coefficient between CoV and age separately for development and ageing periods (correlation values for all genes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Using the CoV values calculated across all 15,063 genes (excluding one 904-day-old individual for which we lacked the cortex data), we observed a significant mean CoV increase in development (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ρ = 0.77, two-sided p=0.041), confirming that tissues diverge as development progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Interestingly, during ageing, we observed a decrease in mean CoV with age, albeit not significant (ρ = −0.50, p=0.204, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), suggesting that tissues may tend to converge during ageing. This was also supported by the PCA in which we observed a trend of ageing-associated decrease in mean Euclidean distance among tissues (using PC1–PC4 space with quantile-normalised data: ρ = −0.87, p=0.0026; with VST-normalised data ρ = −0.58, p=0.102, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Among these, n = 4802 showed convergent trends in ageing, which we refer to as DiCo genes. We next studied the transition points between divergence and convergence by clustering genes showing the DiCo pattern (n = 4802) based on their CoV values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, cluster 1, which shows a slightly delayed divergence starting after 8 days and peaks around 3 months, was associated with metabolic and respiration-related processes (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1), and cluster 5, which shows a relatively delayed convergence after 4 months, was enriched in categories related to vascular development (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). To assess the contribution of different tissues to the DiCo pattern, we further clustered DiCo-displaying genes (n = 4802) based on their expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Not surprisingly, the clusters with relatively higher expression levels of a tissue (e.g. muscle in cluster 9) were enriched in functional categories (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1) related to that tissue (e.g. muscle cell development) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>We then studied DiCo at the single-gene level. We tested each gene for a significant CoV change in their expression levels (i.e. divergence or convergence) in development and ageing (Spearman’s correlation test with FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1). We found that the ratio of divergent and convergent genes differed significantly between development (70% divergence among 2581 significant genes) and ageing (68% convergence among 62 significant genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). The same pattern was also observed without using significance cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also confirmed that this pattern is also observed with VST-normalised data (Materials and methods), and is thus not affected by the data preprocessing approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2—figure supplement 14</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, inter-tissue convergence during ageing is a novel phenomenon. We first considered the possibility that convergence during ageing could be explained by heteroscedasticity which could arise due to increased inter-individual variability in gene expression during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Somel et al., 2006</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we compared expression-age heteroscedasticity levels between two gene sets: (1) genes with the DiCo pattern and (2) genes showing divergent patterns throughout lifetime (divergent-divergent [DiDi, n = 4182]) for each tissue separately (Materials and methods). We did not observe any significant difference in heteroscedasticity between DiCo and DiDi genes in any of the tissues (two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov [KS] test, p&gt;0.05 in all tissues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2—figure supplement 15</xref>), which suggests that heteroscedasticity due to increased inter-individual variability probably does not drive the observed age-related convergence during ageing. Visual inspection of gene expression clusters also suggested that the DiCo pattern is not particularly associated with nonlinear changes in gene expression with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplements 12</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s15">15</xref>).</p><p>In order to further verify the DiCo pattern, we used a second approach to test it in our mouse dataset. For each individual, we calculated correlations between pairs of tissues across their gene expression profiles. Under the DiCo pattern, we would expect pairwise correlations to decrease during development and increase during ageing. Among all pairwise comparisons, we observed a strong negative correlation during development (ρ = [-0.61, –0.9], nominal p&lt;0.05 in five out of six tests), while during ageing, four out of six comparisons showed a moderate positive correlation (ρ = [0.16, 0.69], nominal p&lt;0.05 in one out of six comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Calculating the mean of pairwise correlations among tissues for each individual, we observed the same DiCo pattern (nominal p&lt;0.05 for both periods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The DiCo pattern indicates loss of tissue specificity during ageing</title><p>Potential explanations of the DiCo pattern involve two scenarios consistent with the age-related loss of identity: (1) decreased expression of tissue-specific genes in their native tissues or (2) non-specific expression of tissue-specific genes in other tissues. To test these predictions, we first identified tissue-specific gene sets based on relatively high expression of that gene in a particular tissue (cortex: 1175; lung: 839; liver: 986; muscle: 766 genes). We noted that tissue-specific genes show clear up-down reversal patterns, being mostly upregulated during development, and downregulated during ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 57–89%).

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaum et al., 2020</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Repeating the analysis on the same four tissues and also a larger set of eight tissues, we did not find support for transcriptome-wide convergence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2—figure supplements 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">19</xref>). In the 4-tissue comparison, 4/6 tissue pairs, and in the 8-tissue comparison only 16/28 tissue pairs showed positive correlations, supporting the inter-tissue convergence during ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2—figure supplements 18c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s20">20c</xref>). Interestingly, 75% of the negative correlations involved muscle and subcutaneous fat. Convergence ratios among genes showing significant change in CoV (FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1) were marginally above 50%. Although we did not observe widespread convergence during ageing in this dataset, we still detected strong associations between convergence in ageing and tissue specificity (OR<sub>4-tissue</sub> = 1.33, p=1.08 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) and identity loss (OR<sub>4-tissue</sub> = 58.3, p&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>; OR<sub>8-tissue</sub> = 84.2, p &lt; 10<sup>–16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we used the GTEx dataset to investigate inter-tissue convergence during ageing in humans. Calculating the change in mean Euclidean distance based on PCA and mean CoV values, we found a non-significant tendency towards convergence across the whole transcriptome in the same 4 tissues and a larger set of 10 tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">10</xref>). We also performed the four-tissue comparison with female and male individuals separately and observed relatively strong inter-tissue convergence among ageing females (ρ<sub>female</sub> = –0.58, p<sub>female</sub> = 0.059) but less in males (ρ<sub>male</sub> = –0.052, p<sub>male</sub> = 0.77) which lack individuals at the youngest and oldest age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2—figure supplement 16</xref>). Moreover, 5/6 and 29/45 tissue pairs showed increased correlation with age in 4-tissue and 10-tissue comparisons, consistent with inter-tissue convergence during ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">11</xref>). Notably, 8 of 16 negative correlations in the 10-tissue comparison involved the skin tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2—figure supplement 11c</xref>). We also studied significant changes in CoV per gene, but found no significant gene in the 4-tissue comparison and only three genes in the 10-tissue comparison, all of which were convergent. Finally, we tested the association between the loss of expression in native tissue and gain in other tissues during ageing among convergent genes, confirming the association with the tissue identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Overall, analysis of these three additional datasets indicates that inter-tissue convergence during ageing is commonly, but not always, observed at the transcriptome-wide level in mice and in humans. Notably, the transcriptome-wide trend was weak in the Jonker et al. and GTEx datasets and not evident in the Schaum et al. dataset. The association between the loss of identity and convergence, on the other hand, was strong across all datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We further asked whether convergent gene sets identified in different datasets overlap. 11 of 15 comparisons were significant, but the effect sizes (ESs) were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We reason that the low overlap across datasets might reflect that transcriptome-wide convergence was weak and that we lack the developmental samples for the external datasets, that is, we can only compare convergence during ageing but not the DiCo pattern. Noteworthy, only 62% of convergent genes in ageing are divergent during development in our dataset, and low overlap between convergence does not rule out overlap across DiCo genes.</p><p>These results suggest that inter-tissue convergence in ageing may be a weak but widespread phenomenon and associated with the loss of tissue identity. Overall, while mouse and human tissues display divergence in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>), this appears to be followed by a trend towards inter-tissue convergence in ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s20">20</xref>) and could be linked to loss of tissue identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Changes in cellular composition and cell-autonomous expression can both explain the DiCo pattern</title><p>Ageing-related transcriptome changes observed using bulk tissue samples may be explained by temporal changes in cell-type proportions within tissues, by cell-autonomous expression changes, or both. To explore whether the observed inter-tissue DiCo patterns may be attributed to changes in cell-type proportions, we used published data from a mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>). For each of the four tissues in our original experiment, we collected cell-type-specific expression profiles from 3-month-old young adult mice in the Tabula Muris Senis dataset. We deconvoluted bulk tissue expression profiles in our mouse dataset using the corresponding tissue’s cell-type-specific expression profiles by regression analysis (Materials and methods) and studied the relative contributions of each cell type to tissue transcriptomes and how these change with age. The analysis was performed with three gene sets; all genes (n = [12,492, 12,849]), DiCo (n = [4007, 4106]), and non-DiCo genes (n = [8485, 8743]). Studying these deconvolution patterns, we observed a weak but consistent trend involving the most common cell types in different tissues. For instance, analysing DiCo genes in the liver and lung, we found that the most common cell type’s contribution (hepatocyte in the liver, and bronchial smooth muscle cell in the lung) tends to increase during development (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ρ<sub>liver</sub> = 0.95, ρ<sub>lung</sub> = 0.81, nominal p&lt;0.05). This contribution then decreases during ageing (ρ<sub>liver</sub> = –0.77, ρ<sub>lung</sub> = –0.86, nominal p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This pattern was also observed in muscle and cortex, albeit not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These changes most likely reflect shifts in cellular composition, some of which were demonstrated directly in mice using in situ RNA staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). Repeating the analysis with non-DiCo genes resulted in highly similar patterns considering the most common cell types in tissues, except in muscle ageing in which the age-related decrease was significantly higher with DiCo genes than the non-DiCo genes (permutation test with resampling all genes, p<sub>skeletal-muscle-satellite-cell</sub> = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>).

Cell-autonomous changes could contribute to inter-tissue convergence during ageing in two ways. First, expression profiles of similar cell types shared across different tissues, such as immune cells, might converge with age. Another possible scenario, consistent with the notion of age-related cellular identity loss, is that the expression profiles of unrelated cell types, such as tissue-specific cell types in different tissues, converge with age. To test these scenarios, we first ordered the pairwise correlations between cell types in different tissues at the 3-month age group to determine the most similar and dissimilar cell types across tissues (Materials and methods). Then, we studied how these similarities (i.e<italic>.</italic> pairwise correlations) change with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that pairs of similar cell types (i.e<italic>.</italic> those with the highest correlations) among tissues tend to become less similar with age (36/54 [67%] of pairwise comparisons, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). On the contrary, the most distinct cell types (i.e<italic>.</italic> those with the lowest correlations) among tissues become more similar with age (45/54 [83%], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Repeating the analysis considering DiCo genes only yielded a similar trend (30/54 [56%] decrease in correlation among the most similar cell types, permutation test with resampling non-DiCo genes, p&gt;0.1; and 47/54 [87%] increase in correlation among the most distinct cell types, permutation test, p&gt;0.1). These trends are consistent with age-related cellular identity loss, and they suggest that cell-autonomous changes may also contribute to inter-tissue convergence during ageing, although further data and analyses would be needed to fully establish their validity.</p><p>Finally, we tested the possibility of intra-tissue convergence of cell types in the Tabula Muris Senis dataset by calculating expression variation among cell types using the CoV measure for each individual. However, we did not observe a consistent trend of increasing similarity among cell types within tissues from 3-month-old to 24-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings confirm a number of ageing-associated phenomena identified earlier, while also revealing new patterns. First, we report parallel age-related expression changes among the four tissues studied, during development, as well as in ageing. The inter-tissue correlation distributions were modest and also comparable between development and ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This last point may appear surprising at first glance, given the stochastic nature of ageing relative to development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bahar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Somel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Enge et al., 2017</xref>), and also given earlier observations that developmental expression changes tend to be evolutionarily conserved, while ageing-related changes much less so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zahn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Somel et al., 2010</xref>). At the same time, when we consider that tissues diverge during development, and also that ageing is characterised by parallel expression changes among tissues related to damage response, inflammation, and reduced energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zahn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), similar magnitudes of correlations during development and ageing may be expected.</p><p>Second, we verify the generality of the reversal pattern, that is, up-down or down-up expression change patterns across the lifetime, among distinct mouse tissues that include both highly mitotic (lung and liver) and less mitotic ones (skeletal muscle and cortex). Consistent with earlier observations in fewer tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anisimova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dönertaş et al., 2017</xref>), we find that about half the expressed genes display reversal in all cases studied. Importantly, expression reversal is not ubiquitous across all genes and our findings do not necessarily contradict the hyperfunction theory. Instead, we suggest that reversal is a common phenomenon that influences a notable fraction of the transcriptome and is a likely contributor to mammalian ageing.</p><p>Two observations here are notable. One is that reversal-displaying genes, especially those displaying the up-down pattern in each tissue, can be associated with tissue-specialisation-related pathways (e.g<italic>.</italic> morphogenesis) and tissue-specific functions (e.g<italic>.</italic> synaptic activity). The second observation is the lack of significant overlap among reversal genes among tissues. We thus hypothesised that reversals might be reflecting tissue specialisation during development (hence lack of overlap among tissues) and loss of specialisation during ageing. These processes could manifest themselves as inter-tissue divergence and convergence patterns over lifetime. We indeed observed that the up-down reversal pattern is enriched in tissue-specific genes, except in the liver. Studying inter-tissue similarity across mouse lifespan, we further found that the four tissues’ transcriptomes diverged during postnatal development, and we further detected a trend towards inter-tissue convergence during ageing. We then further investigated this phenomenon through different approaches: (1) by studying overall trends using PCA, (2) by analysing transcriptome-wide trends of inter-tissue CoV without considering gene-wise significance cutoffs, (3) by focusing on genes with significant age-related changes in inter-tissue CoV, (4) by studying age-related changes in pairwise tissue correlations, (5) by analysing different cell types using scRNA-seq data, and (6) by repeating the same analysis using independent mouse and human ageing datasets. The patterns we found were mostly consistent with inter-tissue convergence, but the majority of transcriptome-wide results were associated with low ESs, and some were not statistically significant. Importantly, all significant results suggested convergence during ageing. We therefore conclude that (1) developmental inter-tissue divergence does not continue into ageing and (2) convergence during ageing may be common although possibly not ubiquitous.</p><p>The weakness of the inter-tissue convergence signal per dataset and the limited overlap between convergent gene sets among datasets could have multiple reasons. These include the low signal-to-noise ratios characterising ageing-related expression patterns, the lack of old-age individuals in our mouse dataset (&gt;3-year-old mice) and the GTEx dataset (&gt;90-year-old humans), limited overlap of tissues between our mouse dataset (cortex, liver, lung, and muscle) and the Jonker et al. dataset (cortex, liver, lung, spleen, kidney), as well as differences in ageing patterns between species or between sexes. Further research involving larger sample sizes and diverse species is needed to confirm the generalisability of the observations.</p><p>Finally, we report a number of interesting observations on DiCo. We determine that tissue-specific genes tend to be downregulated in the tissues that they belong to during ageing, while non-tissue-specific genes are upregulated, which was confirmed by all external datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Second, using deconvolution, we infer that cell types most common in a tissue (e.g<italic>.</italic> hepatocytes in the liver) tend to increase in frequency during development, but then decrease in frequency during ageing, as also shown recently using immunohistochemistry in a number of mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, the DiCo phenomenon may at least partly be explained by shifts in cellular composition. This is intriguing as both highly mitotic and low mitotic tissues share this trend, indicating that an explanation based on stem cell exhaustion may not be applicable here. Third, we find increased expression similarity between distinct cell types in different tissues during ageing, but decreased similarity between similar cell types. Cell-autonomous expression changes, therefore, likely also contribute to the DiCo phenomenon. We note that higher expression variability among cells at old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Enge et al., 2017</xref>) could also lead to inter-tissue convergence during ageing. A fourth interesting observation was the absence of significant enrichment for specific transcription factor or microRNA targets among DiCo genes. This result may not be surprising if inter-tissue convergence is mostly driven by stochastic damage accumulation, such as loss of epigenetic marks. It is also possible that instead of specific regulators their interaction and cooperativity are associated with the DiCo. Future experimental studies could test both mechanistic aspects and functional link to tissue specificity.</p><p>We also note two major limitations of our study. One is related to the fact that our dataset represents bulk tissue samples, which may suffer from infiltration of foreign cell types into tissues. Indeed, one of the external datasets, Schaum et al., included samples from perfused mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>), and we did not find support for the transcriptome-wide convergence during ageing, even though the association between tissue identity loss and convergence was also evident. The scRNA-seq dataset we analysed further suggested that DiCo is associated with tissue-specific genes and not immune- or blood-related categories, but we still cannot rule out possible infiltration artefacts that may affect our results. A second limitation is related to ageing being highly sex-dimorphic in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sampathkumar et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, in-depth analysis of sex specificity of the DiCo pattern could be relevant. Our mouse dataset included only male mice, while that of Jonker et al. was female-only. The fact that both revealed DiCo patterns suggest DiCo is not particular to one sex, but there could still exist sex-specific effects. In fact, when we analysed DiCo among human male and female individuals in the GTEx dataset separately, we observed slightly stronger inter-tissue convergence among ageing females than in males, although the GTEx male samples have also a drastically narrower age range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2—figure supplement 16</xref>). Accordingly, the prevalence of DiCo among humans and sexes waits to be determined.</p><p>Despite the open questions that remain, our results consistently support a model where ageing mammals suffer from loss of specialisation at the tissue level, and possibly also at the cellular level, which are observed as expression reversals and the newly discovered DiCo phenomenon we report here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>We collected bulk tissue samples from 16 male C57BL/6J mice.

To statistically confirm tissue differences, we performed ANOVA on individual PC scores with tissue as explanatory variable; this was run on each of the first four PCs (PC1–PC4) separately.

Then, we tested the effect of age on mean Euclidean distance among tissues using the Spearman’s correlation test.

Thus, we created a null distribution with the expected reversal ratios and tested the significance of observed values for each tissue separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Functional associations</title><p>We used the GORA procedure as described earlier to test functional associations of reversal genes in each tissue but kept the developmental changes constant in the background.

We thereby specifically test the functions associated with the reversal pattern, but not development-associated functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Overlap of reversal genes: Permutation test</title><p>We tested the significance of overlap using the same permutation scheme described above. Specifically, among developmental up- (or down-) regulated genes shared among tissues, we constructed null distributions by calculating the ratio of UD vs. UD + UU (or DU vs. DU + DD) genes shared among tissues, identified in 1000 random permutations of individual ages only in the ageing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). The number of shared upregulated genes was n<sub>up</sub> = 2255 (one gene excluded since it has constant expression in one tissue in ageing period), and the number of shared downregulated genes was n<sub>down</sub> = 2209.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Tissue convergence and divergence calculations using CoV</title><p>For each individual mouse, for each gene (n = 15,063), we calculated the inter-tissue CoV estimate using normalised expression levels from the four tissues, dividing the standard deviation by the mean. We studied inter-tissue expression-variation change with age in development and ageing periods separately using two approaches: (1) using the change in mean or median CoV across genes and (2) studying significant CoV patterns at the single-gene level.</p><sec id="s4-16-1"><title>Mean/median CoV across all genes</title><p>We assessed transcriptome-wide variation among the tissues of each individual mouse by calculating the mean (or median) CoV of genes and then performing the Spearman’s correlation test between mean-CoV (or median-CoV) and individual age.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-2"><title>CoV at the single-gene level</title><p>In the second approach, we tested the correlation between the CoV value of a gene and individual age for each commonly expressed gene using the Spearman’s correlation test. p-Values were corrected for multiple testing using the ‘BH’ procedure. We used FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1 as cutoff. The genes showing positive correlation between CoV and age were called ‘divergent,’ and the ones showing negative correlation were called ‘convergent’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Genes that display a divergent pattern during development and convergent pattern in ageing (without using a significance level) were called divergent-convergent (DiCo) genes (n = 4802).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-3"><title>Permutation test</title><p>To test the significance of DiCo genes (n = 4802), we kept the developmental divergent genes constant (n = 9058, without a significance cutoff) and randomly permuted the individual ages only in the ageing period (as described earlier). Among developmental divergent genes, we calculated the DiCo% for each permutation, simulating a null distribution for the DiCo pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2—figure supplement 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-4"><title>Clustering of DiCo genes</title><p>We used the k-means algorithm to cluster DiCo genes according to their CoV or expression changes with age separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). To find the optimum number of clusters for both procedures, we applied gap statistics using the ‘clusGap’ function in the ‘cluster’ package v.2.1.2 with 500 simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tibshirani et al., 2001</xref>). We used the ‘kmeans’ function in base R with ‘iter.max = 20’ and ‘nstart = 50’ parameters to cluster CoV values or expression levels which were standardised to mean = 1 and sd = 0 across genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-5"><title>Effect of gene expression trajectories on DiCo</title><p>To identify potential non-monotonic expression changes with age that could not be detected with the Spearman’s correlation coefficient, we clustered all expressed genes (n = 15,063) in each tissue separately using the k-means algorithm following the same steps explained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplements 12</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s15">15</xref>). The list of genes belonging to each cluster is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>. Then, for each cluster, separately in each tissue, we performed a Fisher’s exact test to assess if a particular cluster pattern is enriched or depleted in DiCo genes relative to all other expressed genes (the background).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-6"><title>Functional association analysis</title><p>To test the functional associations of the genes showing the DiCo pattern among tissues, we performed GSEA using GO BPs. We retrieved developmental divergent genes (with ρ<sub>CoV-age</sub> &gt; 0, n = 9058) and multiplied these ρ<sub>CoV-age</sub> values with the ones calculated in the ageing period. Therefore, the genes with a negative value represent a DiCo pattern, while the ones with a positive value represent a DiDi pattern. We then ranked the genes according to the calculated product values and sought enrichment for the upper and lower tail of the distribution using the KS test implemented in the ‘clusterProfiler’ package v.4.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). The ‘gseGO’ function was used with parameters: ‘nPerm = 1000, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500 and pValueCutoff = 1’. Therefore, the enriched categories for the genes in the lower tail of the distribution would represent DiCo enrichment. Categories with FDR-corrected p-value&lt;0.1 were considered as significant.</p><p>We summarised DiCo-enriched categories into representative ones following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dönertaş et al., 2021</xref> and used hierarchical clustering on gene similarities among categories. The tree was cut into 25 clusters. For each cluster, we chose as representative the category that has the highest mean Jaccard similarity to the other categories in the same cluster. Then, we calculated the mean age-expression correlation across all the genes in each representative category in each tissue and in each period. As the unrelated categories, those with the low within-cluster similarity were grouped into one cluster, we denoted them ‘Other GO,’ and performed the same clustering steps to further summarise them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We further sought functional enrichment among DiCo genes that were clustered with the k-means algorithm for both CoV and expression clusters separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Genes in each cluster were tested among all DiCo genes using the same GORA procedure as described before.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-7"><title>Jackknife to test the Di/Co ratio between development and ageing</title><p>We tested the significance of divergent/convergent gene ratios using a jackknife resampling procedure in development and in ageing periods separately. Leaving out an individual in each iteration, we recalculated the number of significant divergent and convergent genes and their ratios. As we could not obtain any gene with significant CoV changes when the youngest adults were left out due to the decreased power, standard error and confidence interval calculation was not possible. Instead, we report the range of pseudovalues. We note that the range of ratios in leave-out samples do not contain the value 1 either in the development (0.41–0.49) or in the ageing (1.20–2.83) period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Pairwise tissue DiCo test</title><p>In order to further verify the inter-tissue DiCo pattern that we observed between development and ageing periods, we used a different approach based on expression correlations among tissues. We calculated pairwise Spearman’s correlation coefficients among tissues of the same individual mouse using all commonly expressed genes among the tissues (n = 15,063). For each tissue pair, we tested the correlation between age and inter-tissue expression correlations using the Spearman’s correlation test in development and in ageing periods separately. In addition, we calculated the mean (or median) of all six pairwise tissue correlations for each individual mouse and tested the correlation between age and average inter-tissue expression correlations using the Spearman’s correlation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Determination of tissue-specific genes</title><p>To identify which tissue(s) contribute to the reversal pattern, we assigned each gene to a tissue to identify tissue-specific expression patterns. First, we calculated an ES between the expression of a gene in a tissue versus other three tissues using the development samples only, and repeated this procedure for all tissues. Hence, we obtained ES for each commonly expressed gene in each tissue. ES was calculated using the ‘Cohen’s d’ formula defined as the difference between the two means divided by the pooled standard deviation. We then assigned each gene to a tissue in which the gene has the highest ES. Finally, we retrieved only the fourth quartile (&gt;Q3) of genes assigned to a tissue to define tissue-specific expression. Using this approach, we identified 3766 tissue-specific genes in total (cortex: 1175; lung: 839; liver: 986; muscle: 766 genes).</p><sec id="s4-18-1"><title>Enrichment test with the direction of age-related change</title><p>We tested the association between tissue specificity and age-related expression change during ageing using Fisher’s exact test. Specifically, we constructed a contingency table with two categorical variables; the first variable defines the direction (either positive or negative) of maximum expression change during ageing identified in a tissue-specific gene, which is determined by the slope of the regression between log2 age and expression. The second variable defines whether this maximum expression change identified in a tissue-specific gene occurs in its native tissue or not (either yes or no). Hence, a positive odds ratio (OR) suggests that (1) either the expression of genes decreases the most in their native tissue and/or (2) the expression of genes increase the most in a non-native tissue during ageing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-2"><title>Enrichment of tissue-specific genes in DiCo genes</title><p>We tested the association between tissue specificity (being either tissue-specific [n = 3766] or not [n = 11,297]) and the DiCo pattern (either showing DiCo [n = 4802] or not [n = 10,261]) using the Fisher’s exact test, calculating the enrichment of tissue-specific genes within DiCo genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Additional publicly available bulk tissue transcriptome datasets</title><sec id="s4-19-1"><title>Jonker</title><p>We downloaded the raw data from the GEO database with GSE34378 accession number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonker et al., 2013</xref>) and followed the same analysis pipeline described above using all the samples from five tissues (‘brain – cortex,’ ‘lung,’ ‘liver,’ ‘kidney,’ ‘spleen’) of 18 female mice comprising 90 samples in total. This dataset represents the ageing period of the mouse, ranging from 90 to 900 days. Using the oligo package v.1.56.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010</xref>), we retrieved the expression matrices and performed ‘rma’ normalisation followed by removing the probesets that were annotated to more than one gene. We confined the analysis to only the protein-coding genes expressed in at least 25% of all samples. The resulting 17,661 genes were log2 transformed (after adding 1) and quantile normalised using the preprocessCore library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolstad, 2020</xref>) across all samples.

We discarded the samples that have less than 4 million reads, which was the cutoff used in the article. We restricted the analysis to only protein-coding genes expressed in at least 25% of the samples that have expression in four tissues (‘brain,’ ‘lung,’ ‘liver,’ ‘muscle’). One individual was removed from the analysis due to being an outlier in PCA after visual inspection (mouse ID: ‘3m7,’ PCA plots before and after outlier removal are present in our GitHub repository; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">hmtzg, 2022</xref>). Final dataset contained 16,806 protein-coding genes from 37 mice that range from 3 to 27 months of age covering the ageing period. There were 11 female mice ranging from 3 to 21 months of age and 26 male mice ranging from 3 to 27 months of age. We performed the same normalisation method and downstream analyses described above. We extended the analysis to eight tissues (‘brain,’ ‘heart,’ ‘kidney,’ ‘liver,’ ‘lung,’ ‘muscle,’ ‘spleen,’ ‘subcutaneous fat’) which were chosen based on the highest number of individuals that have the same tissue samples and that cover the whole ageing period (3–27 months). For the fat tissue, ‘subcutaneous fat’ was chosen as representative tissue which has the highest number of samples among all minor fat tissues. After performing the same preprocessing steps explained above, the final dataset contained 17,619 genes from 26 mice.

We first confirmed our results in the same 4 tissues (‘brain – cortex,’ ‘lung,’ ‘liver,’ ‘muscle – skeletal’) and then expanded the analysis to 10 tissues (‘adipose – subcutaneous,’ ‘artery – tibial,’ ‘brain – cerebellum,’ ‘lung,’ ‘muscle – skeletal,’ ‘nerve – tibial,’ ‘pituitary,’ ‘skin – sun exposed [lower leg],’ ‘thyroid,’ ‘whole blood’). In order to choose which tissues to analyse, we first chose the minor tissues with the highest number of samples for each major tissue, which prevents the representation of the same tissue multiple times. We then performed hierarchical clustering of tissues based on the presence of samples from the same individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2—figure supplement 13</xref>) and cut the tree into three clusters based on visual inspection. We selected the cluster with the highest number of overlapping individuals to analyse. The same procedure was followed for both 4- and 10-tissue analyses. In particular, we restricted the analysis to the individuals with samples in all tissues analysed and with a death circumstance of 1 (violent and fast deaths due to an accident) and 2 (fast death of natural causes) on the Hardy scale (n = 47 for 4 tissues, n = 35 for 10 tissues). We removed duplicated genes from the analysis. Similar to our analysis with the mice data, we used only the protein-coding genes that are expressed in at least 25% of all samples, totalling 16,197 for 4 tissues and 16,305 for 10 tissues. The TPM values obtained from the GTEx data portal were log2 transformed (after adding 1) and quantile normalised using the preprocessCore library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolstad, 2020</xref>) in R.

As the database contains target information only for human HGNC IDs, we first converted those IDs to human Ensembl IDs and then to mouse Ensembl IDs only for the one-to-one ortholog genes using ‘getBM’ and ‘getLDS’ functions from the biomaRt package. In total, we analysed 235 miRNAs associated with 5458 target genes and 158 TFs associated with 7427 target genes. We conducted the overrepresentation analysis in the same way as for the DiCo functional enrichment analysis: specifically, we tested the targets of each regulator for enrichment in -Co genes (convergent genes in ageing) among Di- genes (divergent genes in development) used as background to keep developmental patterns fixed. We restricted the analysis for miRNA and TFs that have at least five target genes. After multiple testing correction with the BH procedure, we found no enrichment among either of the regulator types.

This represents the variability of error along the explanatory variable, age. Then, we calculated Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the absolute residual values and age, which can be used as an estimate of heterogeneity change with age. We compared the heterogeneity change values of DiCo and DiDi genes using a two-sided KS test in each tissue. In the second approach, we used the ‘ncvTest’ function from the ‘car’ package v.3.0.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fox and Weisberg, 2018</xref>), which is a chi-squared test for heteroscedasticity estimated using a linear model.

Seurat-processed FACS data of the tissues lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and non-myeloid brain were downloaded from the figshare database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pisco, 2020</xref>). The Seurat package v.4.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) was used to retrieve the expression matrix of the cells that are annotated to cell types in the original article. Each tissue contains samples from three time points: 90- (3 months), 540- (18 months), and 720-day-old (24 months) mice, totalling 14 samples each in lung, liver, and brain, and 9 samples in liver. We excluded cell types with less than 15 cells among all samples and excluded genes if the expression level is 0 for all cells at a given age. This resulted in a median number of 99–382 cells assigned to cell types, 6–24 cell types and 16,951–22,122 genes across tissues. Using 3-month-old mice, we calculated cell-type-specific expressions in each tissue. Specifically, we first calculated the mean expression levels among cells of an individual mouse for each cell type, and then calculated the mean among individuals to obtain an average expression value for each cell type.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers noted some potential issues with the normalization of the RNA-seq data that could affect the results, including the use of FPKM normalization, which may drive some of the observations due to lack of inter-sample-normalization (see specific comments by Reviewers #2 and 3). The authors would need to show that using appropriate count-based methods yields similar conclusions.</p><p>2. The authors often support their conclusions on low effect sizes and significance above usual thresholds. It would be important to explicitly discuss these as caveats, as well as strongly tone down these conclusions (including in the title.). More generally, the reviewers felt that potential alternative hypotheses needed to be clearly laid out, and potential ruled out, for the manuscript to stand more strongly (see specific comments by Reviewers #1, 2 and 3.)</p><p>3. In general, the reviewers felt that additional information on methods was required for reproducibility (see individual reviewer reports for specific points).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. &quot;Such &quot;runaway development&quot; phenomena may be due to insufficient natural selection pressure to optimise regulation after sexual reproduction starts.&quot; As stated, this sentence suggests that maladaptive traits that could lower an organism's total reproductive success would not be selected against as long as they only appear after the beginning of reproduction. I would perhaps ask that here the authors cite, not a general review of evolutionary theories of aging, but a publication that specifically proposes that alleles that are deleterious as early as the beginning of sexual reproduction nevertheless are not selected against.</p><p>2. Lines 84-91, 145-153, 229-240, 245-250, etc. Here the font size changes in the manuscript which I assume is not intended.</p><p>3. Figure 1 caption. &quot;Similarities were calculated using Spearman correlations coefficient between expression-age correlations across tissues.&quot; Here I suspect that &quot;Spearman correlations coefficient&quot; was intended to be &quot;Spearman's correlation coefficient&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the authors report an intriguing finding, there are major issues in the manuscript as it stands, notably concerning the clarity and rigor of the data analysis and manuscript.</p><p>1. For the analysis of their RNA-seq dataset across samples, the authors describe using the FPKM framework (methods, line 438). This is very problematic for a number of reasons – use of FPKM for differential gene analysis across samples is deprecated because it poorly controls for inter-sample variability [PMID: 22988256; PMID: 32284352]. FPKM are not comparable between samples because the normalization is sample-specific – thus, since no cross-library normalization step is performed, it should never be used for between sample comparison. Thanks to community benchmarking efforts, TMM or VST normalized counts are widely believed to be the superior choice for DGE analysis [PMID: 22988256; PMID: 32284352]. Thus, it is crucial that the authors correct their analysis to avoid the use of FPKM, and show that their conclusions would hold with an analysis on TMM or VST normalized counts.</p><p>2. There are issues regarding consistency in analytical choices throughout the paper.</p><p>a. Application of significance cutoffs vary widely in the manuscript when selecting specific gene sets. Reasoning should be provided for each case in which significance cutoff was (or not) applied (e.g. Line 111). For example, it is rather concerning that in Figure 1d, no gene was significantly up-regulated with age in the muscle (significance cutoff applied), but in Figure 1f, a large proportion of genes are shown to increase in expression with age in the muscle (significance cutoff not applied).</p><p>b. Authors are not consistent with the FDR threshold applied (e.g. FDR &lt; 10% in Line 123, FDR 20% in Line 127). The reasoning for the chosen thresholds, as well as the different choices should be provided for cases in which higher than standard FDR is applied.</p><p>c. In Figure 1, authors show that the muscle presents with the least number of significantly changed gene expression patterns (up and down) with age. Additionally, in the manuscript, the authors explain that the lack of genes that show statistically significant change in the muscle is supported by a previous study that also showed &quot;weak ageing transcriptome signature across multiple datasets (Line 137).&quot; Thus, it is rather concerning that excluding the cortex, a tissue with a large number of differentially expressed genes, for CoV calculation resulted in greater significance.</p><p>d. The authors use a mix of multiple correction methods without clear explanations as to why a consistent measure isn't used (i.e. FDR/BH, BY) – BY test is justified for GO analysis line 472, but why BY was not used for DGE analysis is not clear (line 462).</p><p>e. A number of statistical analyses performed in the manuscript do not pass the standard significance thresholds (FDR &lt; 5% or p &lt; 0.05). The standard applied in the field is usually p-value or FDR &lt; 5%, although relaxing this threshold can be done when dealing with noisier datasets. When using more relaxed FDR or p-value thresholds, the authors should also be careful to strongly tone down statements proportionally to the lower statistical support for their claims (eg. Line 240: &quot;a SIGNIFICANT divergence-convergence pattern).</p><p>3. The authors use a dataset from exclusively male mice. Since aging is known to be extremely sex-dimorphic [PMID: 27304504], the authors need to explicitly discuss this caveat/limitation in the main text (i.e. these observations may not hold in female animals). If the authors wish to make a more general statement, a suggestion would be to reanalyze data from the recent Tabula Muris Senis Companion paper Schaum et al., [PMID: 32669715], which includes similar tissues, &quot;developmental&quot; time points (1 vs 3 months) and aging course (3 to 27 months), and both sexes to extend the findings. In addition, the Schaum dataset is also RNA-seq, and thus more directly comparable to the author's dataset compared to the microarray Jonker dataset used for partial validation (Figure 2 – supplement 8).</p><p>4. The authors should consider revising the title, since the current form seems to indicate that the work discovered s significant loss of cellular identity during aging. This statement is too strong based on the analyses of the paper. We suggest toning down the title, for instance to &quot;Transcriptomic analyses suggest inter-tissue convergence of gene expression and loss of cellular identity during ageing&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors only analyze the gene sets that are correlated with age i.e. linearly go up or down with age. However, ageing trajectories for different genes can be very dynamic. This is the likely reason why only a few age-related changes were detected in some tissues. To assess the robustness of some of the key observations, authors should consider an orthogonal and unbiased clustering analysis similar to Figure 2 supplement to get the patterns for gene expression changes with age and to what extent DiCo is observed with different clusters.</p><p>Some of the key observations have either low effect size or are not statistically significant. For example, inter-tissue expression similarity during ageing and development (lines 115-119), the expression reversal (lines 158-161), changes in coefficient of variation with age (lines 202-207) etc. Authors clearly mention these in the manuscript, but it raises concerns on the extent to which some of these observations might be random, or due to idiosyncrasies of RNA-seq itself. These caveats should also be discussed.</p><p>In the global PCA based analysis for figure 1 and 2 combining both development and ageing data, the variance can be driven by one of the two states. For example, transcription divergence analysis in PCA in figure 1 based on development alone is not significant which suggests that the divergence of the developmental samples is driven in-fact by ageing. For PCA based analysis using separate PCAs for development and ageing will be more statistically sound.</p><p>Are there any known gene categories that have stronger expression reversal trends? For example, do known transcription factors or pathways that regulate development show DiCo if analyzed separately? Or is this trend only seen at the genome-wide level and completely stochastic?</p><p>For functional enrichment analyses authors only mention some selected functions in the text but GO terms have a lot of redundancy and it is unclear if there is any emerging functional trends looking beyond the redundancy or selected examples. It will be useful to thoroughly analyze and summarize the enriched GO terms to assess for any functional patterns that connect functional decline with ageing and convergent expression or DiCo.</p><p>Is there a significant overlap between mouse and human ageing related changes at the gene or pathway level?</p><p>Line 299 – linking the functional categories with cellular identity appears a bit hand-wavy. Stronger support would be needed to make this conclusion.</p><p>Some of the aspects need more methodological details:</p><p>For RNA-seq analysis, were all the samples normalized together, or were development and ageing samples normalized separately? It should be clarified in the methods.</p><p>Were the mouse perfused? The details should be added in methods. If the mouse were not perfused, a significant shared proportion of gene expression can be due to blood components. Also, the possibility that some of the shared changes could be due to infiltration of immune and other cell types in tissues should be mentioned.</p><p>More details for single cell deconvolution should be added in methods.</p><p>It is unclear to me how how the age related gene expression and PC correlation was performed. Was the loadings underlying PC axes used for correlation analysis? It should be elaborated in methods.</p><p>Some of the supplemental figures are missing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68048.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The article by de Magalhaes and Church is the review article in which the authors revised the developmental theory of ageing especially in the light of genomic studies and thus is the original article where the ‘runaway development’ phenomenon was introduced in these exact terms. We now also included the original article by Mikhail V. Blagosklonny, where a related phenomenon, the hyperfunction theory was first proposed (Blagosklonny, 2006) – however, this is again a conceptual review where the theory was first proposed based on observations on many different grounds. Therefore, we have now also included papers with experimental support for this notion (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Lind et al., 2019). Moreover, we have now included a statement in the discussion to convey the message that we observe a reversal in the majority of the genes, but this does not necessarily negate the developmental or hyperfunction theory, which might be relevant for a limited number of pathways and may contribute to the ageing phenotype (lines 550-553). Finally, we now cite (Fisher, 1930; Medawar, 1952; Williams, 1957), which suggests the force of natural selection declines with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We had used FPKM followed by quantile normalisation, which performs an inter-sample normalisation. We had mentioned this at lines 443, 662, and 682 in the previous version, but had not explained this normalisation procedure in detail. Now the relevant section in the methods is updated to explain the quantile normalisation method (line 690). The main reason we choose quantile normalisation is that we analysed both RNA-seq and microarray data and this normalisation method can be applied to both, following other background normalisations and transformations (i.e. FPKM + log2 transformation for RNA-seq and RMA correction and log2 transformation for microarray). However, we agree with the reviewer that use of VST and TMM are more conventional as these are already implemented in the widely used analysis pipelines of DESeq2 and EdgeR.</p><p>We thus repeated the analysis of our dataset using VST and confirmed the main results.</p><p>We replicated our findings presented in Figure 1 using VST-normalised data. The results are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 10 and 11:</p><p>i) We first compared VST- and QN-processed data in terms of age-related expression change trends in each tissue and period separately, without applying a significance cutoff (across n=14,973 genes). We found high correlations in all 8 comparisons (⍴<sub>dev</sub>=[0.81, 0.94], ⍴<sub>ageing</sub>=[0.83, 0.93], Figure 1—figure supplement 11).</p><p>ii) Repeating PCA analysis with VST-normalised data, we show that variation in gene expression (n=14,973 genes) is largely explained by tissue differences across PC1, 2, and 3 (ANOVA p&lt;10<sup>-16</sup> for PC1-3). In PC4, which explains 7% of the total variation (as opposed to 8% in Figure 1b, we observe an age-effect across tissues in development (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ⍴=[0.57, 0.99], nominal p&lt;0.01 for each test except in muscle; Figure 1—figure supplement 10b). We also confirmed that tissues diverge during postnatal development, although the convergence during ageing was not significant (change in mean Euclidean distance among tissues with age in PC1-4 space, ⍴<sub>dev</sub>=0.937, p<sub>dev</sub>=0.00185; during ageing ⍴<sub>ageing</sub>=-0.58, p<sub>ageing</sub>=0.102, Figure 1-source data).</p><p>iii) Similar to Figure 1c results, we find that tissue pairs show weak correlations in their age-related expression change trends measured with VST-normalised data (n=14,973 genes), both during development (⍴=[0.19, 0.39]) and during ageing (⍴=[0.25, 0.34]). Furthermore, we find that the number of genes with the same direction of change (with or without significance cutoff) across four tissues with VST-normalised data is comparable to Figure 1d and Figure 1e result (Figure 1—figure supplement 10d-e).</p><p>iv) Reversal analysis with VST-normalised data revealed that ~50% (42-59%) of expressed genes (n=14,973) showed reversal patterns (without significance cutoff) in tissues comparable to Figure 1f result (Figure 1—figure supplement 10f). Comparing VST- and QN-normalised data, we found that 70-79% of the genes showed similar reversal or continuous patterns across tissues.</p><p>We confirmed our findings from Figure 2 with VST normalisation and presented the results in Figure 2—figure supplement 14:</p><p>i) We calculated CoV values across all expressed genes (n=14,973) among tissues in VST-normalised data and confirmed a significant mean CoV increase in development (Spearman’s correlation coefficient ⍴=0.99, p=10<sup>-5</sup>), consistent with QN normalised data that yielded ⍴=0.77 (p=0.041). During ageing, the decrease in mean CoV with age (⍴=-0.48, p=0.23) was comparable to the results shown in Figure 2a (⍴=-0.50, p=0.204).</p><p>ii) We replicated the difference between development and ageing in the proportion of genes showing divergent versus convergent patterns (at gene-wise FDR&lt;0.1) with the VSTnormalised data (Figure 2—figure supplement 14d-e). Specifically, VST-normalised data displayed 89% divergence in development (among 3,476 significant genes) as opposed to 70% divergence in QN normalised data (among 2,581 significant genes). Likewise, during ageing, VST-normalised data displayed 68% convergence (among 19 significant genes) similar to 68% convergence in QN normalised data (among 62 significant genes).</p><p>We conclude that the choice of the normalisation method does not affect our results. We now present the VST-based results briefly in the text (lines 143-146, 263-265) to prevent redundancy and provide detailed explanations in the supplementary figure legends (Figure 1figure supplement 10, Figure 2—figure supplement 14). We now also explain the VST normalisation steps in the Methods (line 675).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are issues regarding consistency in analytical choices throughout the paper.</p><p>a. Application of significance cutoffs vary widely in the manuscript when selecting specific gene sets. Reasoning should be provided for each case in which significance cutoff was (or not) applied (e.g. Line 111). For example, it is rather concerning that in Figure 1d, no gene was significantly up-regulated with age in the muscle (significance cutoff applied), but in Figure 1f, a large proportion of genes are shown to increase in expression with age in the muscle (significance cutoff not applied).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. We actually analyse all the results in two ways: (1) using a consistent significance cutoff (multiple testing (FDR) adjusted p-value&lt;0.1, or if no multiple testing was applied, p-value&lt;0.05), and (2) without using a significance cutoff to assess transcriptome-wide trends. We emphasise this as soon as the first sentence of the Results section titled “Tissues involve common gene expression changes with age”. We now added a second sentence to emphasise this point:</p><p>“We next characterised age-related changes in gene expression shared across tissues by (i) studying overall trends at the whole transcriptome level and testing their consistency using permutation tests, and (ii) studying statistically significant changes at the single gene level.”</p><p>This has two motivations. First, given the low signal/noise ratios during mammalian ageing, identifying statistically significant patterns in individual genes is frequently difficult, but transcriptome-wide patterns can be more effectively identified. Second, observing the same trends using both approaches increases the robustness of our conclusions and may suggest that the observations are a genome-wide phenomenon, not restricted to a small number of genes. However, since transcriptome-wide trends are more prone to technical artefacts, we further test the genes that show statistically significant changes.</p><p>We now attempted to further clarify where a significance cutoff was and was not used in the analyses, by updating the text to emphasise the gene set of interest for each analysis (lines 131, 140).</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for pointing out the ambiguity about muscle genes. In Figure 1f, we study global reversal trends in each tissue for all the genes without any significance cutoff, i.e. only analysing expression change trends (following (Dönertaş et al., 2017)). Thus, although there are no statistically significant ageing-related genes in muscle tissue (Figure 1d), we observe a transcriptome-wide reversal trend (Figure 1f). We now updated the figure text to explain clearly what is presented (lines 183-187).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Authors are not consistent with the FDR threshold applied (e.g. FDR &lt; 10% in Line 123, FDR 20% in Line 127). The reasoning for the chosen thresholds, as well as the different choices should be provided for cases in which higher than standard FDR is applied.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the difference between FDR (e.g. line 123 in the previous version) and FPR (e.g. line 127 in the previous version) was not clearly explained in the text. FDR is the multiple testing correction ‘false discovery rate’ applied using the ‘p.adjust’ function with BH procedure in R, which we did not clearly state in the first submission. We updated the text to explain that FDR is applied to correct the p-values for all statistical tests (functional association tests were corrected with BY procedure in the previous version but for consistency, we used FDR in all the tests in the current version – see point d.) (lines 711-714).</p><p>We have also updated the text to replace all “FDR&lt;0.1” with “FDR corrected p-value&lt;0.1”.</p><p>We had used the term FPR as an estimate of the false-positive rate calculated using random permutations (FPR = median number of positives observed across permutations / number of positives observed in the data). We provide this metric with permutation test results as additional information on the effect size, not as an alternative to FDR corrected p-values. However, thanks to the reviewer’s comment we realised that the phrase FPR could be confused with other metrics. We, therefore, redefined it as eFPP, ‘estimated false-positive proportion’ (lines 740-743). We now updated the relevant sections to make sure that these two definitions are not interchangeable. We also removed eFPP from the main text to avoid confusion and only provide this information only in the supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In Figure 1, authors show that the muscle presents with the least number of significantly changed gene expression patterns (up and down) with age. Additionally, in the manuscript, the authors explain that the lack of genes that show statistically significant change in the muscle is supported by a previous study that also showed &quot;weak ageing transcriptome signature across multiple datasets (Line 137).&quot; Thus, it is rather concerning that excluding the cortex, a tissue with a large number of differentially expressed genes, for CoV calculation resulted in greater significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reviewer’s concern perhaps stems from our poor wording of CoV calculation in the text. For each individual, we calculated CoV across tissues using all expressed genes (n=15,063) regardless of their specific age-related expression changes (significant or not) in any tissue. Then, we summarised these gene-wise CoV values by calculating their mean to assess a genome-wide variation score among tissues of an individual and how these scores change with age (Figure 2a). We have now updated the relevant Results section to explain the CoV calculation in more detail (lines 221-223). We believe that the significant age-related expression changes in one tissue should not have a direct impact on the results as the number of significantly changed genes during ageing in the cortex was also very small (n=68).</p><p>Despite this, we repeated the same analysis, this time excluding the muscle tissue, which resulted in a nonsignificant but similar pattern during ageing (Spearman’s correlation test between mean CoV and age (n=15): ⍴<sub>dev</sub>=0.85, p<sub>dev</sub>=0.016; ⍴<sub>ageing</sub>=-0.29, p<sub>ageing</sub>=0.49, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref> -right panel), and the lack of significance again might be driven by the lack of one cortex sample.</p><p>The exclusion of the cortex data was motivated by the fact that we were missing an aged individual in this tissue. However, estimating CoV using only three points may be suboptimal, and we, therefore, decided to be conservative and thus removed this analysis (i.e. results excluding cortex) from the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Age-related change in CoV summarised across genes excluding cortex or muscle.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68048-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Change in CoV using 15 samples from three tissues (one oldest individual (904 days of age) excluded due to its missing data in the cortex), either excluding cortex (left column) or muscle (right column) tissue.

The authors use a mix of multiple correction methods without clear explanations as to why a consistent measure isn't used (i.e. FDR/BH, BY) – BY test is justified for GO analysis line 472, but why BY was not used for DGE analysis is not clear (line 462).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. For consistency, we now use FDR (BH) for multiple testing correction for all statistical tests throughout the text. We now updated the relevant sections (lines 711, 713-714).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. A number of statistical analyses performed in the manuscript do not pass the standard significance thresholds (FDR &lt; 5% or p &lt; 0.05). The standard applied in the field is usually p-value or FDR &lt; 5%, although relaxing this threshold can be done when dealing with noisier datasets. When using more relaxed FDR or p-value thresholds, the authors should also be careful to strongly tone down statements proportionally to the lower statistical support for their claims (eg. Line 240: &quot;a SIGNIFICANT divergence-convergence pattern).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We believe that the 10% FDR cutoff allows a compromise between overall false positives and false negatives, and is commonly used as a threshold in the transcriptomics literature, including recent analyses on the association between gene expression and splicing (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.67077), expression and neurodegeneration (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.64564), or expression and psychosocial experiences (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.63852).</p><p>Using a more stringent threshold would reduce the false positive probability per gene. However, our emphasis in this manuscript is not individual genes but transcriptome-wide patterns, which we test using the whole transcriptome without significance threshold, and also with significant genes (with an FDR corrected p-value&lt;0.1). The particular instance where we use ‘significant’ in line 240 refers to the result of Spearman’s correlation test between mean pairwise correlations among tissues and age in development and ageing periods.</p><p>That said, we did follow the reviewer’s suggestion and toned down our conclusions. Accordingly, we changed the referred line to ‘we observed the same divergence-convergence pattern’ (lines 286-287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors use a dataset from exclusively male mice. Since aging is known to be extremely sex-dimorphic [PMID: 27304504], the authors need to explicitly discuss this caveat/limitation in the main text (i.e. these observations may not hold in female animals). If the authors wish to make a more general statement, a suggestion would be to reanalyze data from the recent Tabula Muris Senis Companion paper Schaum et al., [PMID: 32669715], which includes similar tissues, &quot;developmental&quot; time points (1 vs 3 months) and aging course (3 to 27 months), and both sexes to extend the findings. In addition, the Schaum dataset is also RNA-seq, and thus more directly comparable to the author's dataset compared to the microarray Jonker dataset used for partial validation (Figure 2 – supplement 8).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. In fact, we identify convergent trends in ageing in both female and male animals, in our dataset (only males) and in the Jonker et al., dataset (only females), respectively. We further find that convergent genes overlap between the two datasets, although modestly (OR = 1.22, p = 1.67x10<sup>-8</sup>, Figure 4—figure supplement 2b). This suggests that DiCo is not unique to a single-sex in mice. We now explain this in lines 430-434, 614-616.</p><p>We would also have been interested in testing possible sex dimorphism in DiCo, but this is not possible given technical differences between the two datasets (i.e. Jonker et al.,'s and ours).</p><p>The GTEx dataset includes both male and female humans and displays patterns consistent with convergence during ageing, although not significantly (Figure 2—figure supplement 811). Following the reviewer's point, we repeated the GTEx dataset analysis separately for females and males. We observed a stronger convergence in females than in males, although none of these results were significant (⍴<sub>female</sub>=-0.58, p<sub>female</sub>=0.059; ⍴<sub>male</sub>= -0.052, p<sub>male</sub>=0.77) (Figure 2—figure supplement 16). The female and male GTEx samples differ both in sample size (n=11 vs n=36, respectively) and age range (no male individuals within 20-29 and 70-79 age groups), which could explain the observed differences between sexes.</p><p>We now discuss possible sex-dimorphism in Discussion as a limitation of this study and suggest a more comprehensive analysis with different datasets in the future (line 612-620).</p><p>Finally, we thank the reviewer for suggesting including the Schaum et al., dataset. We now included this dataset, analysing both the same 4 tissues we have and a broader set of 8 tissues (Figure 2—figure supplement 17-20). However, we could not include the development period as the sample size was very small for the two time points; 1 and 3 months of age. We could not confirm the transcriptome-wide trend towards convergence during ageing in this dataset and found that the muscle and subcutaneous fat tissues showed the most divergent patterns.</p><p>However, we confirmed a strong association between the loss of identity and convergence during ageing. Not having the developmental period for the external datasets limited the complete replication of our original study, which focuses on the DiCo pattern, divergence followed by convergence. Nevertheless, a trend towards convergence during ageing was observed at the transcriptome level in Jonker et al., and GTEx and the association between convergence and loss of identity was evident across all datasets. We now updated the text to reflect that the support for the transcriptome-wide trend is weak and our most robust result is the association between identity loss and convergence.</p><p>We now add Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Table 1 to summarise all results across datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should consider revising the title, since the current form seems to indicate that the work discovered s significant loss of cellular identity during aging. This statement is too strong based on the analyses of the paper. We suggest toning down the title, for instance to &quot;Transcriptomic analyses suggest inter-tissue convergence of gene expression and loss of cellular identity during ageing&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion – we have now toned down the title: ‘Inter-tissue convergence of gene expression during ageing suggests age-related loss of tissue and cellular identity’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Authors only analyze the gene sets that are correlated with age i.e. linearly go up or down with age. However, ageing trajectories for different genes can be very dynamic. This is the likely reason why only a few age-related changes were detected in some tissues. To assess the robustness of some of the key observations, authors should consider an orthogonal and unbiased clustering analysis similar to Figure 2 supplement to get the patterns for gene expression changes with age and to what extent DiCo is observed with different clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The reason we used Spearman’s correlation was to capture potential non-linear but monotonic changes. However, we agree with the reviewer that Spearman’s correlation cannot identify non-monotonic changes. As suggested, we now performed k-means clustering for each tissue to identify age-related expression patterns and then performed an enrichment test to assess if DiCo genes are enriched or depleted in any cluster. The results are now presented as supplementary figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 12-15). Notably, we did not observe a bias towards a cluster having a linear pattern with age or not in any of the tissues. For example, the cortex tissue displayed 15 clusters of expression changes, among which 5 are enriched and another 5 are depleted in DiCo (Figure 1—figure supplement 12). Two of the DiCo enriched clusters (2/5) do not have linear trajectories with age (clusters 12 and 14) whereas three of the DiCo depleted clusters (3/5) display linear patterns (clusters 6, 7 and 15). We have now presented this result in the relevant section (lines 276-277).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the key observations have either low effect size or are not statistically significant. For example, inter-tissue expression similarity during ageing and development (lines 115-119), the expression reversal (lines 158-161), changes in coefficient of variation with age (lines 202-207) etc. Authors clearly mention these in the manuscript, but it raises concerns on the extent to which some of these observations might be random, or due to idiosyncrasies of RNA-seq itself. These caveats should also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a limitations paragraph in the Discussion, detailing both this aspect and other limitations raised by the other reviewers (lines 605-620).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the global PCA based analysis for figure 1 and 2 combining both development and ageing data, the variance can be driven by one of the two states. For example, transcription divergence analysis in PCA in figure 1 based on development alone is not significant which suggests that the divergence of the developmental samples is driven in-fact by ageing. For PCA based analysis using separate PCAs for development and ageing will be more statistically sound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We now followed the reviewer’s suggestion and analysed age-related convergence using PCA performed only on ageing samples. In this way, we now analyse Euclidean distance in PC1-4 (i) using all samples together (across the lifetime – Figure 1a), (ii) using samples from developmental period only (Figure 1—figure supplement 3a-b), and (iii) using samples from ageing period only (Figure 1—figure supplement 3d-e). For the PCA analysis based on all the samples together, change in mean Euclidean distance with age among tissues was significant both during development and ageing (⍴<sub>dev</sub>=0.99, p<sub>dev</sub>=1.5x10<sup>-5</sup>; during ageing ⍴<sub>age</sub>=-0.87, p<sub>age</sub>=0.0026). When we performed the PCA analysis separately for the two periods, we still observed a significant divergence among tissues during development (⍴=0.95, p=0.0008) and observed a marginally significant convergence during ageing (⍴=-0.64, p=0.0596). We hope that this analysis addresses the reviewer’s point. We also note that our earlier analysis had an error (we had used PC3-4 spaces to calculate the Euclidean distance for the mouse dataset, mistakenly excluding PC1-2), which we now corrected (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any known gene categories that have stronger expression reversal trends? For example, do known transcription factors or pathways that regulate development show DiCo if analyzed separately? Or is this trend only seen at the genome-wide level and completely stochastic?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now used the MiRTarBase database for miRNAs and TRANSFAC for transcription factors and tested if any specific regulator is associated with DiCo pattern genes. We did not find any significant association (lines 353357). This may be consistent with DiCo being a transcriptome-wide and diffuse phenomenon caused by stochastic changes, as the reviewer indicates. It is also possible that not specific regulators but a change in their cooperative action influences the pattern, or we lack sufficient power with the current datasets to identify subtle effects of individual regulators. We now mention this also in the Discussion (line 601-603).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For functional enrichment analyses authors only mention some selected functions in the text but GO terms have a lot of redundancy and it is unclear if there is any emerging functional trends looking beyond the redundancy or selected examples. It will be useful to thoroughly analyze and summarize the enriched GO terms to assess for any functional patterns that connect functional decline with ageing and convergent expression or DiCo.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version, enriched GO terms were summarised according to their Jaccard similarities using the ‘emapplot’ function of the ‘enrichplot’ package. However, we agree with the reviewer that the enrichment network did not remove redundancy among the categories, and might have hidden unique and interesting functions.</p><p>We have now used another approach to summarise and interpret DiCo enriched categories in more detail. First, we clustered the categories based on the number of genes they share using hierarchical clustering and cut the tree into 25 clusters. For each cluster, we chose a representative category that has the highest mean-Jaccard similarity to the other categories in the same cluster (Dönertaş et al., 2021). Then, we calculated the mean expression changes (⍴ between expression and age) of the genes in the representative categories for each tissue, separately (Figure 4h). We believe that this new analysis provides better insight to our main findings such that tissue-related functions gained during development display opposing expression trends during ageing, i.e. reversal pattern, providing support to loss of tissuespecific expression and thus contributing to convergence during ageing. We have now updated the main text and methods (lines 343-351, 874-881).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a significant overlap between mouse and human ageing related changes at the gene or pathway level?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now compare the correlations between ageing related expression changes and overlap between convergent genes during ageing (Figure 4 figure supplement 2). While mouse datasets, especially our data and Jonker et al., showed higher correlations among each other, the correlations between age-related expression changes in the human and mouse datasets were smaller but overall positive when we consider the same tissues in both datasets (average correlations between GTEx and mouse datasets are ⍴<sub>Jonker</sub>=0.12, ⍴<sub>Our_dat</sub>=0.13, ⍴<sub>Schaum</sub>=0.01). Convergent genes in ageing also showed weak but significant overlaps across datasets. Human dataset showed significant overlap with Jonker et al., and Schaum et al., datasets but not with ours. Nevertheless, the overlap for these datasets was also small. Importantly, apart from the differences in species, sex, age distribution and the technology used to generate the data, the small overlap between datasets may stem from the fact that the external datasets lack developmental samples. Thus, we can only compare convergence during ageing but not the DiCo pattern, the main focus of our study. Since only 62% of the convergent genes during ageing are divergent in development in our dataset, we should emphasise that low overlap for convergence does not rule out overlap across DiCo genes. Similarly, we use divergent genes during development as the background for our functional enrichment tests to find functional associations of DiCo. Since we lack the developmental background we performed functional enrichment for only the convergent genes but did not find any significant association for the GTEx dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 299 – linking the functional categories with cellular identity appears a bit hand-wavy. Stronger support would be needed to make this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

We have combined all the samples together regardless of their age (development and ageing together) or tissue (n=63) and performed quantile normalisation on log2 transformed (after adding 1) FPKM values. As FPKM normalisation does not account for inter-sample variability, we adopted this approach to control for cross-library variability between different tissues and ages. We have rewritten the relevant section in the methods to explain the normalisation in more detail (line 666-685). The same approach is used for the VST-normalisation in this version and development and ageing periods are normalised together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the mouse perfused? The details should be added in methods. If the mouse were not perfused, a significant shared proportion of gene expression can be due to blood components. Also, the possibility that some of the shared changes could be due to infiltration of immune and other cell types in tissues should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Indeed, infiltration of other cell types is a serious consideration in most bulk tissue analyses. Since we observe a similar trend between different cell types using scRNAseq data and that DiCo is particularly associated with tissue-specific genes and not with any bood or immune-related signature, we believe the effect should be minimal in our analysis. However, the new dataset we included in the analysis, Schaum et al., did use perfused mice and although the association between the loss of tissue identity and convergence was particularly strong, the transcriptome-wide trend did not support convergence. We now included the potential influence of infiltration of other cell types as a limitation of our study in the Discussion (line 606-612).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More details for single cell deconvolution should be added in methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the deconvolution section in the methods to explain how we conducted the analysis in more detail (lines 1054-1064).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me how how the age related gene expression and PC correlation was performed.
