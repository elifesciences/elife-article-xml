characteristics of a fibrocartilage transition zone. Enthesis development has historically been studied with lineage tracing of individual genes selected a priori, which does not allow for the determination of single-cell landscapes yielding mature cell types and tissues. Here, in together with open-source GSE182997 datasets (three samples) provided by Fang et al., we applied Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to delineate the comprehensive postnatal RC enthesis growth and the temporal atlas from as early as postnatal day 1 up to postnatal week 8. And, we furtherly performed single-cell spatial transcriptomic sequencing on postnatal day 1 mouse enthesis, in order to deconvolute bone-tendon junction (BTJ) chondrocytes onto spatial spots. In summary, we deciphered the cellular heterogeneity and the molecular dynamics during fibrocartilage differentiation. Combined with current spatial transcriptomic data, our results provide a transcriptional resource that will support future investigations of enthesis development at the mechanistic level and may shed light on the strategies for enhanced RC healing outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enthesis development</kwd><kwd>fibrocartilage</kwd><kwd>rotator cuff</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82230085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82272572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate the comprehensive postnatal RC enthesis growth from as early as postnatal day 1 to postnatal day 56.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RC and its enthesis are essential components of the shoulder, which are critical in facilitating coordinated shoulder movements and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schett et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to other RC tissues, the attachment site of supraspinatus (SS) tendon is vulnerable to injury and difficult to achieve complete regeneration, due to its high heterogeneity in composition and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nourissat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schett et al., 2017</xref>). Histologically, the attachment site of the SS tendon is a classic fibrocartilaginous enthesis, also termed BTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). In its native state, the fibrocartilaginous enthesis exhibits gradations in tissue organization, cell phenotype, and matrix composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moffat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). Fibrocartilaginous entheses manage to disperse stress and facilitate load transfer between vastly different materials like tendons and bone, with modulus ranging from 200 MPa to 20 GPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, the intrinsic regenerative capacity of fibrocartilaginous enthesis is not well-understood, which limits the exploitation of the best and most rigorously proven early intervention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derwin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, understanding the complex process of the enthesis morphogenesis and maturation during development may inform strategies for enhanced BTJ healing.</p><p>Currently, the mechanism underlying the growthof the enthesis fibrocartilage is less understood. Details are scarce, but the fibrocartilage layer is formed by a pool of site-specific progenitor cells, and initially organizes as an unmineralized cartilaginous attachment unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>). Such development pattern shares an overlapping biological behavior with the growth plate, which is a process of mesenchymal stem cells differentiating into chondrogenic cells and then sequentially into fibrocartilage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Killian, 2022</xref>). A unique enthesis progenitor pool has been identified since the embryonic stages, as cells sandwiched between primary cartilage and tendon, expressing a mixed transcriptome of both chondrogenic and tenogenic genomic features (Scleraxis and SRY-related transcription factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugimoto et al., 2013</xref>). These enthesis progenitors can differentiate into either chondrocytes or tendon fibroblasts, under the regulation of Krüppel-like (<italic>Klf</italic>) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kult et al., 2021</xref>). In the later embryonic and postnatal stages, cells from the enthesis progenitor pool ultimately either differentiate into or are replaced by a <italic>Hh</italic>-positive cell population marked by <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Gli1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and their progenies are retained in the enthesis region throughout postnatal development and eventually populate the entire fibrocartilage region between tendon and bone, thereby contributing to enthesis growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). However, compared with our in-depth understanding of enthesis development during the embryonic stage, the cell-type composition and distribution in the enthesis at different postnatal stages, as well as biochemical markers for enthesis stem cell progenitor used in tissue engineering, remain to be not well-understood and require novel methods for elucidation.</p><p>As is proved, the normal enthesis maintains a gradient of cell phenotypes, from tendon fibroblast to chondrocyte then to mineralizing chondrocyte and to osteoblast/osteocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moffat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossetti et al., 2017</xref>). It is unclear how this gradient in cell phenotypes develops and how it is regulated by the local environment (e.g. extracellular matrix, muscle loading, and growth factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derwin et al., 2018</xref>). scRNA-seq is a powerful method to analyze various cell types and provide insights into tendon enthesis postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gulati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kult et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, Fang Fei et al., reported an exciting single-cell work to define the enthesis cell transcriptomes at postnatal day 11, 18, and 56, revealed the clonogenicity and multipotency of enthesis <italic>Gli1</italic>+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2022</xref>). However, compared to the abundant and growing amount of single-cell resources in bone, cartilage, and tendon, more enthesis single-cell resources are needed to cover long-range timepoints of BTJ development or entheseal diseases. Here, we applied single-cell transcriptomics along with the spatial transcriptomic sequencing to analyze the cellular and molecular dynamics during postnatal tendon enthesis growth. The results provided here for deciphering postnatal tendon enthesis development may facilitate future studies of enthesis regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The development of fibrocartilage in the enthesis occurs postnatally</title><p>The heterogeneity of the fibrochondrocytes in enthesis development has been an open question. Aiming to evaluate the postnatal development pattern of enthesis fibrocartilage, we first stained the shoulder sections and compared the morphological parameters of the enthesis cells at P1, P3, P7, P14, P28, and P56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). At postnatal day 1, an articular cavity was formed and the supraspinatus tendon (ST) was observed attached to the humeral head. The cells at the ST attachment site were highly dense and homogeneous, and were visibly different from tendon cells and the primary cartilage cells inside the humeral head, suggesting that postnatal enthesis is formed by site-specific progenitor cells since the embryonic stage. At P1, P3, and P7, the fibrocartilage layer and subchondral bone could hardly be visualized. Fibrocartilage was not evident at the enthesis of the mouse rotator cuff until 2–3 weeks after birth. To examine the cellular morphological changes, we further measured the 2D parameters (including 2D area, roundness, frete diameter, and minimal frete diameter) of enthesis cells, statistics results demonstrated that cell size remarkably increased during postnatal development, from postnatal day 7–14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). After postnatal day 14, the enthesis cells were observed as typical chondrocyte phenotype, column-like stacked alongside the direction of tendon fiber, with more prominent patterns at P28 and P56. From toluidine blue/fast green stainings, fibrochondrocytes can be observed since P14, with a larger cellular size in comparison with condensed primary chondrocytes in P7. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibrocartilage with mineralization can be observed after P28. Type 2 collagen is a major ECM component of cartilage, thus we stained enthesis with col2a1 antibody. The IHC results show the col2a1 protein levels are relatively low at P14, and significantly increase after P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The development of fibrocartilage in the enthesis occurs postnatally.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) H&amp;E staining of P1, P3, P7, P14, P28, and P58 mouse supraspinatus tendon entheses (n=4).

First, the expression pattern of FGF-FGFR signaling was noticed, as both autocrine and paracrine in BTJ chondrocyte. BTJ chondrocytes, tenocytes, and mesenchymal progenitors were leading senders of FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). We observed <italic>Fgfr2</italic> expressed mostly in BTJ chondrocyte cells via <italic>Fgf2-Fgfr2</italic> or <italic>Fgf9-Fgfr2</italic>, and we validated the expression of FGFR2 protein in enthesis by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily includes a family of proteins, such as TGF-βs (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) and bone morphogenetic proteins (e.g. BMP2, BMP4). In the BMP signaling network, the BTJ chondrocytes acted as critical receivers and contributors by secreting BMP ligand <italic>Bmpr2</italic>, especially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the cellular complexity and heterogeneity of developing RC enthesis are poorly understood, as previous studies could hardly resolve it at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). So far, there is only one transcriptomic study for embryonic mouse enthesis has been carried out using single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kult et al., 2021</xref>). However, the development of fibrocartilage at the enthesis of mouse RC occurs no earlier than 2 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galatz et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the investigation at the postnatal stage of cellular and genomic mechanisms in enthesis development is needed. According to the works performed by Fang F et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2022</xref>), they found enthesis progenitors (<italic>Gli1</italic>+ progenitors) and validated their stemness in-vitro and in-vivo, within the timepoints from P11 to P56. In this study, we applied single-cell transcriptome analysis to delineate the comprehensive postnatal enthesis growth with temporal atlas from as early as postnatal day 1 up to postnatal day 56. We next used the spatial transcriptome sequencing on postnatal day-1 mice enthesis to verify the anatomical position of different cell populations. This study may facilitate a better understanding of the enthesis development and add to the single-cell datasets repository of enthesis.</p><p>According to prior studies, three distinct populations appear where supraspinatus tendon attaches to the humeral head cartilage: tendon midsubstance progenitors, enthesis progenitors, and primary cartilage progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dyment et al., 2015</xref>). Enthesis morphogenesis involves predominately enthesis progenitors transforming into fibrocartilage, during which process enthesis progenitors are organized as an unmineralized cartilaginous attachment unit and then mineralizes via endochondral ossification postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galatz et al., 2007</xref>). We used H&amp;E staining to characterize the morphological changes of the cellular components of enthesis after birth. We found that fibrocartilage did not appear at the BTJ site in mice until 2–3 weeks after birth, and the statistical results showed that enthesis cells’ size increased significantly during postnatal development at 7–14 days after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At 14 days after birth, these cells showed a typical chondrocyte phenotype. This is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galatz et al., 2007</xref>. According to the literature, the development of fibrocartilage in the enthesis occurs postnatally, which is not evident until 2 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galatz et al., 2007</xref>). We consider that the postnatal 7–14 days were the critical stages for fibrocartilage cell differentiation in enthesis, based on the results of our cell morphology studies. Although there is no qualitative evidence for cells with specific gene markers, morphological changes can reflect changes in cell composition and function, which is a very important characteristic change in the study of the development of cell populations. Consistent with the timing we found, Schwartz AG et al., reported that Gli1-expressing cells significantly increased and populated at the enthesis site since postnatal day 7, well before the onset of mineralization, and persisted in the mature enthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Gli1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and their progenies are retained in the enthesis region throughout postnatal development, contributing hugely to enthesis growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). Fei F et al., also focused on <italic>Gli</italic>+ progenitor cells, their data provided important clues to questions related to the development of the enthesis. In order to obtain sequencing data over a broader time span, we combined our own data with that of Fei F et al. And, we further mapped BTJ chondrocytes onto spatial positions by spatial transcriptome sequencing and found that they were consistent with the anatomical positions of enthesis, which verifies the accuracy of our definition of cell populations.</p><p>It is generally recognized that difficulties in restoring the mechanical properties after BTJ injury are largely due to the failure of fibrocartilage recapitulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shengnan et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, in modern RC reconstruction surgeries, anchors fix the tendon to the insertion areas without access to bone marrow, which means BMSCs are not likely the main stem cell source for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Utsunomiya et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is needed to investigate the native cellular origination and molecular biology of fibrocartilage formation, in order to enlighten developmental engineering strategies. To investigate the trajectory of postnatal bone-tendon junction cell development. Cellrank analysis was performed, and results showed that the directionality of differentiation between BTJ chondrocytes, tenocytes, and two subsets of osteocytes were independent of each other. The fate probabilities analysis, consistent with RNA velocity, showed that only BTJ chondrocytes contributed to the fate of enthesis chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>), suggesting that the fibrocartilage in postnatal enthesis origin from enthesis site-specific progenitors, instead of tendon cells. We also noticed that <italic>Tnn</italic> was one of the driving genes in chondrogenic fibroblasts differentiating into fibrochondrocytes, and we confirmed the existence of the tenascin N protein (also named tenascin W) in the developing fibrocartilage layer. We still know very little about the basic biology of tenascin W, which has been reported to be expressed in developing and mature bone, specifically in a subset of stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2006</xref>). Details are scarce, but the stimulating effects of tenascin-W on osteoblastic progenitors’ differentiation and migration have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meloty-Kapella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting its potential role in facilitating enthesis progenitors differentiating into fibrochondrocytes.</p><p>To investigate the key factors that regulate enthesis development, CellChat analysis was performed. We found that enthesis cells mainly received signals from other cell types, instead of sending signaling factors. And, we focused on the growth factors signaling pathways that were involved in the enthesis cells network, mainly including the previously reported FGF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobzin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>), BMP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>), TGF-β family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>), and PTH family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among them, we first found that FGF signaling was widely expressed in enthesis cells. As previously mentioned, the development of fibrocartilage in enthesis is similar to a growth plate with an endochondral-like zone. According to the literature, pre-hypertrophic cells in the growth plate express high levels of <italic>Fgfr3</italic>, and hypertrophic chondrocytes express high levels of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). Yet we found enthesis cells mainly expressed <italic>Fgfr2</italic>, suggesting that the regulation of FGFs in enthesis progenitors differentiating into fibrocartilage cells was different from growth plate cartilage. Recent work has confirmed that enthesis development in the mouse mandible was regulated by FGF signaling via FGFR2-FGF2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest a potential role of FGFR2 in enthesis cells differentiating into fibrocartilage during enthesis development. We next noticed the BMP signaling (specifically Bmp2, Bmp4) was expressed in enthesis cells, as one key feature of the <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Scx</italic> positive progenitors is their dependence on <italic>Bmp2</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> for specification and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobzin et al., 2021</xref>). Blitz et al., found that BMP4 derived from the tendon tip induces enthesis progenitors differentiating into chondrocytes, and conditional inactivation of <italic>Bmp4</italic> using <italic>Scx</italic>-Cre blocks formation of the cartilage anlage prefiguring the bone eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitz et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, it has been indicated that BMP2 could upregulate tenascin-N expression through a p38-dependent signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scherberich et al., 2005</xref>), and we found <italic>Tnn</italic> was among the top driving genes in fibrochondrocyte differentiation. We also found the TGF-β signaling in enthesis cells, as TGF-β was important due to its crucial role in cartilage and tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Killian, 2022</xref>). Canonical TGF-β ligands may be diffuse into the near tendon and enthesis, positive in recruiting chondrogenic cells, and the secretion of TGF-β1 has been confirmed mechanically mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>There are some certain limitations in the current study. First, we could not remove all the humeral head cells because the enthesis tissues only contain 4–5 layers of cells and are located adjunct to bone marrow and growth plate. Future use of high-precision microdissection approaches to isolate region-specific cells will address the limitation. Second, it is undeniable that spatial transcriptomics are better reliable to address possible dissociation artifacts and gain spatial information. However, utilization of spatial transcriptomic sequencing on enthesis is limited owing to the difficulty in sectioning without decalcification, which restricted our attempt to acquire spatial transcriptomics on mature enthesis with tough bony tissue. Finally, this study was performed predominately on single-cell RNA and spatial transcriptomics datasets, despite we verified the molecules inferred by the analysis algorithm, the whole study was designed as descriptive research, Future studies will label the markers found in this study on transgenic mice and investigate their in-vivo function in enthesis development.</p><p>In summary, our study deciphered the cellular complexity and heterogeneity of postnatal enthesis growth by providing descriptive single-cell transcriptomic and spatial datasets. We then revealed the molecular dynamics during fibrocartilage differentiation, providing a valuable resource for further investigation of tendon enthesis development at the mechanistic level, which may facilitate a better understand of the enthesis development and add to the single-cell datasets repository of the enthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection of cells from the supraspinatus tendon enthesis</title><p>All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Central South University (No. 2022020058). The humeral head- supraspinatus tendon samples were dissected from the left shoulders of C57/BL6 mice at postnatal day-1, day-7, day-14, and day-28. In general, samples were harvested from pooled sibling limbs of two litters (five to six limbs per pool). Following dissection, the humeral heads and tendons were trimmed to retain the enthesis part, and all the samples were minced immediately and digested in type I collagenase (1 mg/ml, Gibico) and type II collagenase (1 mg/ml, Gibico) diluted in low-glucose DMEM (Gibco) solution at 37 °C for 30–40 min. Freshly isolated cells were resuspended into FACS buffer containing 2% FBS (Gbico) in PBS. Cell suspensions were stained with antibodies including Ter119-Alexa700 and Cd45- Alexa700 (Biolengend) to remove blood cells. DAPI (BD) stain was used to exclude dead cells. Flow cytometry was performed on BD FACS Aria II, single cells were gated using doublet-discrimination parameters and collected in FACS buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single-cell spatial transcriptomic sequencing by stereo-seq</title><p>Single-cell spatial transcriptomic sequencing was performed on the BGI stereo-seq platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, the tissue section of the postnatal day-1 left shoulder of C57/bl6 mice was placed on the Stereo-seq chip (1 cm * 1 cm), then incubated and stained with a mixture of nucleic acid reagent (Invitrogen, Q10212). Section images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 microscope (at EGFP wavelength, 10 ms exposure). Tissue sections were then permeated to release RNAs from the permeated tissue and captured by a Stereo-seq chip. RNAs were then reverse transcribed and the cDNA-containing chips were then amplified with Hot Start DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN). In the library preparing procedure, samples were tagmented with Tn5 transposases (Vazyme) and amplified. After amplification, the PCR products were used for DNB (DNA Nano Ball) generation. Finally, the DNBs were sequenced on the DNBSEQTM T10 sequencing platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Spatial mapping of cell states with cell2location</title><p>Cell2location was used to deconvolute and map single-cell clusters onto spatial transcriptomics spots. In brief, we first estimated reference signatures of cell states using scRNA-seq data of each region and a negative binomial regression model provided in the cell2ocation package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kleshchevnikov et al., 2022</xref>). The regression model for the single-cell data was initialized with default settings. The model was then trained using a maximum of 30,000 epochs.

After quality control, all the feature data were scaled with the sctransform algorithm, to avoid unwanted variation including percentages of mitochondrial reads, number of detected genes, and predicted cell cycle phase effect. All the datasets were integrated and batch-corrected by using SCVI with default parameters. Furthermore, this integrated data was analyzed and subclustered to exclude uninterested clusters (including immune cells, red blood cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and neural cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and DEGs analysis</title><p>We used the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Potential of Heat diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moon et al., 2019</xref>) method to visualize the dataset in low dimensions. Furthermore, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method and the Louvain algorithm were applied to cluster the cells, with 50 PCs selected and resolution set to 2.4, resulting in nine major cell clusters for subsequent analyses. For second-round chondrocyte sub-clustering, we reconstructed the SNN graphs for BTJ clusters, and three subclusters were determined resolution set as 0.6 for each fibrochondrocyte cluster. The FindAllMarkers function in Seurat was used to calculate DEGs among different clusters, the ‘test.use’ function was set to a statistical framework called MAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finak et al., 2015</xref>). Genes met the criteria that (1) expressing a minimum fraction of 10% in either of the two tested populations; (2) at least a 0.1-fold difference (log-scale) between the two tested populations; (3) adjusted p values less than 0.01, were considered as signature genes.

The regulon data was then analyzed using the RcisTarget package to create TF motifs referring to the mm9-tss-centered-10kb-7 database. The regulon activity scores were calculated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) method. Besides, we used Cellcall package to analyze the cluster-specific TF enrichment and intercellular communication by combining the expression of ligands/receptors and downstream TF activities for certain L-R pairs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Murim Choi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xiao Chen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the editors and reviewers agreed that the work is valuable, it needs further improvements to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Major issues are:</p><p>1) The paper should be discussed relative to the results in Fang et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2022.</p><p>2) The importance of P7 as a critical differentiation timepoint is not well supported.</p><p>3) Validation is needed (e.g., IHC and/or FISH) for many of the scRNAseq results (e.g., CellChat pathways).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The results and their novelty should be discussed in comparison to the recent Cell Stem Cell study describing enthesis development using scRNAseq and lineage tracing approaches (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2022.11.007).</p><p>2. Figure 1d: The PCA for histomorphologic parameters (which typically have high variations) does not show any meaningful separations or groupings. I do not agree with the authors' conclusion that this analysis reveals P7 as a critical developmental timepoint. In general, PCA may not be appropriate for this data set.</p><p>3. According to the methods, it appears that the entire humeral head-supraspinatus tendon was used for cell isolation for scRNAseq. This results in the inclusion of cells from bone, growth plate, enthesis and tendon. As such, only a very small percentage of cells came from the enthesis, as is clear from the cell clusters in Figure 2b and 2c. This is a flaw in the approach; inclusion of such a wide range of cells makes interpretation of &quot;enthesis&quot; cells difficult, as described in more detail in the comments below.</p><p>4. The differentiation/pseudotime analysis described in Figure 3 is difficult to follow. I do not think it is useful to combine cell transcriptomes from vastly different tissues and then define a velocity map. There is too much varied information for the algorithm to create valid connections, as the there will be many many branches/paths from mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblast, tenocyte, chondrocyte, etc. Presumably, embedded in these maps are trajectories for osteoblast differentiation, chondrocyte differentiation, tenocyte differentiation, etc. There are too many layers of overlapping information to deduce anything meaningful for the small number of cells associated with the enthesis.</p><p>5. The authors uses the term &quot;function&quot; throughout the paper (e.g., &quot;functional definition of fibrocartilage subpopulations&quot;). However, this is a descriptive study, and &quot;function&quot; (or mechanism) can only be theoretically inferred from the various algorithms used to analyze the data. A role for any of the pathways or processes can only be defined with gain- and/or loss-of-function studies.</p><p>6. &quot;C2 highly expressed biomineralization-related genes (Clec3a, Tnn, Acan)&quot;. The three example genes are not related to biomineralization.</p><p>7. The functional characterization of the three enthesis cell clusters is not convincing. For example, activation of metabolism-related processes is a vague result than can mean a lot of things (including changes in differentiation), yet the authors interpret it very specifically as &quot; role in postnatal fibrochondrocyte formation and growth&quot;.</p><p>8. The pseudotime analysis of the enthesis cell clusters is not convincing. The three clusters are quite close and overlapping on the UMAP. Furthermore, the authors focus on Tnn as a novel and unique gene, yet the expression pattern shown in Figure 5g implies even expression of this gene across all three clusters.</p><p>9. The TC1 markers (Ly6a, Dlk3, Clec3b) imply a non-tendon-specific cell population. Perhaps a tendon progenitor pool or an endothelial cell phenotype is more appropriate.</p><p>10. Pseudotime analyses assume that your data set includes cells from progenitor through mature cell populations. It is unclear that the timepoints studied here included cells from early progenitor states.</p><p>11. The CellChat analysis is not useful, as the authors included 18 cell types. The number of possible interactions among so many cell types is enormous, and deducing valid connections between any two cell types in this case is questionable.</p><p>12. The authors should validate their key scRNAseq results with in situ hybridization. Only a single gene, Tpp, was validated on tissue sections. This validation is particularly important for this study because the authors included a wide variety of tissues/cells in their isolation and analyses.</p><p>13. The authors should demonstrate functional necessity of at least one gene/pathway identified by the scRNAseq analyses (e.g., through gene knockout).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As known, Fei Fang et al. have established single-cell transcriptomes of mouse supraspinatus tendon enthesis cells (Cell Stem Cell, 2022). It is suggested that the authors introduced Fei Fang et al.'s work in Introduction and emphasize the significant novelty compared with Fei Fang et al.'s work.</p><p>2. In Figure 1, the authors highlighted P7 was a critical stage for enthesis differentiation. But this section was less associated with the following content. The authors should link these results with the scRNASeq data. Is there any time-dependent change/signaling in scRNASeq data at this critical time point?</p><p>3. In the H and E staining of Figure 1A, the tendon structure was separated and random. It is suggested that the authors provide high-quality staining figures.</p><p>4. Figure 2 showed that the Scx+ or <italic>Sox9</italic>+ cells was decreased in enthesis over time. At least it should be co-staining to show the distribution and frequency of double positive and single positive cell populations. However, a previous study has demonstrated this finding (PLOS ONE, 2020). It is suggested to verify some new findings by IF or IHC staining.</p><p>5. There are some conflicts about trajectory analysis. In Figure 3C, RNA velocity showed that the arrow flowed from BTJ to MTJ and CTFb. However, in Fig3d, PAGA plot indicated that BTJ cells is independent of other cells. Furthermore, in supplementary figure S3, RNA velocity showed that the trajectory flowed from TC to BTJ. These figures were inconsistent with the described results. Please provide detailed explanation to avoid misleading readers.</p><p>6. Figure 5 showed that C1 was the original cluster, and whether C1 cluster expressed canonical progenic/stem cell markers.</p><p>7. The authors performed cell-cell interaction based on cellchat analysis. But the cell-cell interaction was not actively examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Fang et al. (A mineralizing pool of Gli1-expressing progenitors builds the tendon enthesis and demonstrates therapeutic potential. Cell stem cell. 2022) defined enthesis cell transcriptomes and differentiation trajectories, and identified Gli1+ progenitor population for enthesis. Please further clarify the innovation of your research, and in depth introduction or discussion is needed to compare and contrast the results between the two research.</p><p>2. In Figure 1, more evidence are needed to prove that Neonatal to postnatal day 7 (P7) is the critical stage for enthesis fibrocartilage cell differentiation, for example, immunofluorescence staining or qPCR for enthesis fibrocartilage cell makers, instead of relying on H and E only.</p><p>3. Line123. Figure 2e showed that the expression of Clec3a and Col2a1 were low in c4,&quot; which were ubiquitously expressed in bone-tendon junction cell (c4)&quot; seems to be an inexact expression.</p><p>4. Line 117, which cell clusters belong to &quot;fibroblast-associated cells&quot;?</p><p>5. Line 125, it is better to co-staining the scx and <italic>Sox9</italic> to validate the existence of BTJ cells. Scx and <italic>Sox9</italic> are known markers of BTJ, do you have find new makers for BTJ by scRNA-seq?</p><p>6. Line 148, &quot;stemness&quot; degree? Are there other evidence, such as stem cell maker expression, to show that &quot;growth plate cells and fibroblasts associated clusters are higher than other cell types&quot;. The expression of &quot;stemness&quot; seems exaggerated.</p><p>7. There is no description of figure 4b in the results.</p><p>8. In figure 5, 2-3 makers identified by scRNA-seq for fibrocartilage formation are suggested to be validated by immunofluorescence stainning or other methods, instead of only proving the Tnn expression in postnatal BTJ growth.</p><p>9. There are no verification of the signaling network for the enthesis postnatal growth which were revealed by Cellchat. It is suggested to validate the key signaling, such as Bmpr2 signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85873.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the editors and reviewers agreed that the work is valuable, it needs further improvements to warrant publication in eLife.

Yet we found the cell sizes of enthesis cells remarkably increased during postnatal day 7-14, and the enthesis cells were observed as typical chondrocyte phenotype, column-like stacked alongside the direction of tendon fiber. These findings led us the conclusion that the development of fibrocartilage in the enthesis occurs postnatally.

In general, samples were harvested from pooled sibling limbs of two litters (five to six limbs per pool). Following dissection, the humeral heads and tendons were trimmed to retain the enthesis part, and all the samples were minced immediately and digested. (revised in Lines 456-458)</p><p>Although, we can’t deny the fact that we could not remove all the humeral head cells under microscope because the enthesis tissues only contained 4-5 layers of cells and located adjunct to bone marrow and growth plate. The enthesis datasets inevitably contains some cells came from bone marrow and growth plate in humeral head, as shown by the work reported by Fang F et al. (Figure 1a, Cell Stem Cell. 2022) (revised in Lines 406-409)</p><p>In order to better understand the preciseness of our cluster and annotation results, we furtherly performed single cell spatial transcriptomic sequencing on postnatal day 1 mice enthesis ice section, we then deconvoluted and mapped P1 single-cell clusters (BTJ chondrocytes) onto spatial transcriptomics spots, and the cell2location results showed that BTJ chondrocytes we had annotated in single cell dataset could be properly mapped onto enthesis site (Figure 2e). (revised in Lines 134-136)</p><p>However, utilization of spatial transcriptomic sequencing on enthesis are limited owing to the difficulty in sectioning without decalcification, which restricted our attempt to acquire spatial transcriptomics on mature enthesis with tough bony tissue.

We realized the bad effects caused by too many layers of overlapping information in our prior results, and we re-analyzed the differentiation pseudotime across cell types.</p><p>Because we integrated our dataset with open source GSE182997 datasets (3 sample) provided by Fang et al., thus we re-clustered and re-annotated the cell clusters. We first performed Cytotrace and Cellrank analysis across all cell clusters to predict cellular differential potential and terminal differentiate states. And we identified differentiation trajectories of these 3 terminal cell types (revised in Figure 3 and lines 155-184).</p><p>Our next step was performed by refining the input for pseudotime analysis (including mesenchymal progenitors, enthesoblasts, and enthesis chondrocytes), and we focused on BTJ chondrocyte differentiation trajectory to reconstruct the gene dynamics (revised in Figure 4 and lines 197-225).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
