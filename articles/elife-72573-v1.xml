Neurons in primate visual cortex encode which object owns a border (border ownership), but the underlying circuitry is not understood. Here, we used multielectrode probes to record from border ownership-selective units in different layers in macaque visual area V4 to study the laminar organization and timing of border ownership selectivity. We find that border ownership selectivity occurs first in deep layer units, in contrast to spike latency for small stimuli in the classical receptive field. Units on the same penetration typically share the preferred side of border ownership, also across layers, similar to orientation preference. Units are often border ownership-selective for a range of border orientations, where the preferred sides of border ownership are systematically organized in visual space. Together our data reveal a columnar organization of border ownership in V4 where the earliest border ownership signals are not simply inherited from upstream areas, but computed by neurons in deep layers, and may thus be part of signals fed back to upstream cortical areas or the oculomotor system early after stimulus onset. The finding that preferred border ownership is clustered and can cover a wide range of spatially contiguous locations suggests that the asymmetric context integrated by these neurons is provided in a systematically clustered manner, possibly through corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To understand a visual scene, the brain needs to identify objects and distinguish them from background. A border marks the transition from object to background, but to differentiate which side of the border belongs to the object and which to background, the brain must integrate information across space. An early signature of this computation is that brain cells signal which side of a border is ‘owned’ by an object, also known as border ownership. But how the brain computes border ownership remains unknown. </p><p>The optic nerve is a cable-like group of nerve cells that transmits information from the eye to the brain’s visual processing areas and into the visual cortex. This flow of information is often described as traveling in a feedforward direction, away from the eyes to progressively more specialized areas in the visual cortex. However, there are also numerous feedback connections in the brain, running backward from more specialized to less specialized cortical areas. </p><p>To better understand the role of these feedforward and feedback circuits in the visual processing of object borders, Franken and Reynolds made use of their stereotyped projection patterns across the cortex layers. Feedforward connections terminate in the middle layers of a cortical area, whereas feedback connections terminate in upper and lower layers. Since time is required for information to traverse the cortical layers, dissecting the timing of border ownership signals may reveal if border ownership is computed in a feedforward or feedback manner. To find out more, electrodes were used to record neural activity in the upper, middle and lower layers of the visual cortex of two rhesus monkeys as they were presented with a set of abstract scenes composed of simple shapes on a background. </p><p>This revealed that cells signaling border ownership in deep layers of the cortex did so before the signals appeared in the middle layer. This suggests that feedback rather than feedforward is required to compute border ownership. Moreover, Franken and Reynolds found evidence that cells that prefer the same side of border ownership are clustered in columns, showing how these neural circuits are organized within the visual cortex. </p><p>In summary, Franken and Reynolds found that the circuits of the primate brain that compute border ownership occur as columns, in which cells in deep layers signal border ownership first, suggesting that border ownership relies on feedback from more specialized areas. A better understanding of how feedback in the brain works to process visual information helps us appreciate what happens when these systems are impaired.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>figure-ground segregation</kwd><kwd>visual scene segmentation</kwd><kwd>single unit</kwd><kwd>artificial dura</kwd><kwd>orientation tuning</kwd><kwd>multiunit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012505</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY031795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fiona and Sanjay Jha Chair in Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>John H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The assignment of borders to foreground objects occurs in cortical columns in primate visual cortex, and first in deep layers, suggesting a central role for feedback.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the deepest and most enduring mysteries of visual perception is how the brain constructs an internal model of the ever-changing world that falls before our eyes. An essential step in this dynamic process of constructive perception is the assignment of border ownership. Consider panel 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The dashed circle indicates the classical receptive field (cRF) of a hypothetical neuron, straddling the edge of an object. The portion of the edge falling inside the circle is perceived to be owned by the light gray square on the bottom left of the edge. Now consider panel 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The local edge within the circle is identical to that in the left panel but this local edge is now perceived as owned by the dark gray square to the upper right of the edge. This phenomenon is called border ownership. It was first recognized by the Gestalt psychologists in the early 20th century and is beautifully illustrated in Rubin’s famous face-vase illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koffka, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rubin, 1921</xref>). Border ownership represents a fundamental computation in visual perception that is thought to be critical to visual scene segmentation and object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakayama et al., 1995</xref>). Von der Heydt et al. discovered neurons in primate visual cortex that are selective for border ownership, most prominently in extrastriate visual areas V2 and V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Laminar multielectrode recordings from border ownership-selective units in area V4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top row shows set of border ownership stimuli.

Some authors have proposed a dominant role for feedforward inputs, which carry information from upstream areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakai and Nishimura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Supèr et al., 2010</xref>), whereas others posit a central role for horizontal connections and/or cortical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craft et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu and Niebur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhaoping, 2005</xref>). These pathways have a distinct laminar organization: feedforward inputs arrive primarily in the granular (input) layer, whereas horizontal and corticocortical feedback connections predominantly target superficial and deep layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rockland and Pandya, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rockland and Lund, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshioka et al., 1992</xref>). The laminar timing of border ownership may thus give clues regarding the roles of these pathways in this computation. Here, we used linear multielectrode probes to compare onset times of border ownership selectivity between laminar compartments.</p><p>It is also unknown how the preferences of border ownership-selective neurons in different layers relate to each other. This is in contrast to orientation preference, which is well known to be spatially organized in the primate brain. Primate areas V1 and V2 contain orientation columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Livingstone, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubel et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vanduffel et al., 2002</xref>). In V4, imaging studies indicate that there is at least clustering of orientation preference in superficial layers of V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghose and Ts’o, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanigawa et al., 2010</xref>), although it is unclear whether these clusters are columnar. Nor do we know if border ownership preference is organized in columns. The border ownership of a given border is defined entirely by asymmetries outside the cRF (as opposed to the border’s orientation). A systematic organization of border ownership preference would therefore imply a clustered arrangement of the neural pathways that underlie these asymmetries.</p><p>Finally, the relation between border ownership selectivity and orientation tuning is unclear. Prior studies have focused on orientation-selective units and tested border ownership at the neuron’s preferred orientation, without examining the relationship between orientation preference and border ownership preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hesse and Tsao, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). One possibility is that border ownership is fundamentally a border property, such that border ownership selectivity is maximal for the preferred border orientation. Another possibility is that border ownership selectivity rather represents a surface signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossberg, 2015</xref>), and may thus be less strictly tied to border orientation and orientation tuning.</p><p>Here, we addressed these questions using laminar multielectrode probes to record from border ownership-selective units in macaque area V4 across layers. We replaced the native dura with a transparent artificial dura (AD) to enable us to reliably position the probe normal to the cortical surface, on the relatively narrow exposed surface of area V4. We compared the timing and magnitude of border ownership selectivity across laminar compartments. If border ownership selectivity in V4 is inherited from V2, its dominant source of cortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markov et al., 2011</xref>), we expect to see it early and prominently in neurons in the granular layer, which is the main target of this projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rockland, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gattass et al., 1997</xref>). Next, we compared the functional organization of border ownership preference across layers, to test whether the preferred side of ownership is shared. Finally, we examined the relationship between border ownership preference and border orientation preference.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To elucidate the functional organization and timing of border ownership we used laminar recording electrodes oriented normal to the cortical surface to record from well-isolated units and multiunit activity in macaque area V4, during fixation. We present data from two rhesus macaques recorded over 88 penetrations (animal Z: 34; animal D: 54). Laminar analyses are performed for 81 penetrations for which the current source density (CSD) analysis (see below and Methods) was interpretable. For each penetration, we first obtained data to map the receptive fields (RFs) by presenting fast sequences of Gaussian windowed luminance contrast edges and rings at random positions in the appropriate visual quadrant. The orthogonal position of the probe relative to the cortical surface resulted in a vertical stacking of the RFs from different electrode contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Orthogonality was evaluated by computing the distance between RF centers per mm depth along the probe (<italic>D</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; Methods; median [interquartile range] 0.83<bold>°</bold>/mm [1.00<bold>°</bold>/mm], <italic>n</italic> = 81 penetrations). At this retinotopic location we then obtained data to determine orientation tuning (using luminance contrast edges of different orientations) and to compute CSD (see below). We then presented the border ownership stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). These stimuli were similar to those that have previously been used to measure border ownership tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). We carefully positioned square stimuli such that one edge (termed the ‘central edge’) fell within the cRF, while ensuring that the stimulus features that defined border ownership (the other three edges and the four corners of the square) all fell outside of the cRF. Units for which the stimulus was not properly placed relative to the cRF were not included in the analysis (see inclusion criteria in Methods). This resulted in 685 well-isolated units (animal Z: 227; animal D: 458) and 765 multiunit clusters (animal Z: 329; animal D: 436).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the responses from a well-isolated unit to the stimuli in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> as raster plots. The unit fires more to stimulus 1 than to stimulus 2, even though the stimulus information in the cRF is identical in both cases. In other words, this unit fires more to an identical contrast edge in the cRF if that edge is owned by an object on the lower left compared to when it is owned by an object on the upper right. To test whether the difference in spike rates could be explained by the difference in luminance of the square object between stimuli 1 and 2, we also reversed all luminances (resulting in stimuli 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Again we observe that this unit prefers the stimulus where the central edge is owned by an object on the lower left (prefers stimulus 3 over stimulus 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, we conclude that this unit’s preferred side of border ownership is the lower left side of the border, indicated by the direction of the green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. We assessed statistical significance of border ownership selectivity with a permutation test on the absolute value of the border ownership index (<italic>BOI</italic>, see Methods, |<italic>BOI|</italic> = 0.38 for this unit, permutation test p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>To estimate the laminar position of units, we performed current source density (CSD) analysis of the local field potential (LFP) evoked by small rings in the cRF (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nandy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poort et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bijanzadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferro et al., 2021</xref>). This analysis results in a pattern of current sinks and current sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows an example CSD map for the penetration during which the unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> was recorded). Such maps show a prominent leading current sink in the central portion of the penetration (white star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), with a current source followed by a current sink on the electrode contacts positioned deep from it (white disc in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Below this current source, we typically observe a current sink with longer latency (white triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This sink–source pattern occurred consistently in different penetrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This consistency between penetrations resulted in an average CSD map across penetrations that was very similar to that of individual penetrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Studies from other laboratories in behaving macaques have described this sink–source pattern as well in area V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettine et al., 2019</xref>, their Figure 1C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2018</xref>, their Figure S4B) but also downstream in the medial temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takeuchi et al., 2011</xref>, area 36, their Figure S1, note that the ordinate is reversed in this figure relative to ours). These sink–source patterns are very similar to those in our data (compare panels A–C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Takeuchi et al. paired this analysis with histological verification by applying electrolytic marks during the recordings and found that the prominent early current sink indicates the position of the granular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), thus consistent with CSD analysis in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitzdorf, 1985</xref>). The very similar sink–source patterns between individual penetrations, and between studies from different laboratories, including work from others that has been validated histologically, gives us confidence that we can meaningfully use these patterns to assign electrode contacts to granular, superficial, and deep layers, as other laboratories have done (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferro et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore draw boundaries above and below this current sink and identify this compartment as the granular layer (white star, between white dashed and dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). From the position of the electrode contact on which each unit was recorded relative to the CSD map, we could then locate units in superficial, granular, or deep layer compartments (see Methods for classification criteria). For example, the unit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> was located in the deep compartment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,G,I</xref> show another example (multiunit cluster), recorded in deep cortical layers from a different penetration (|<italic>BOI|</italic> = 0.51, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Across the population, we find border ownership selectivity in 51.1% of well-isolated units (350 out of 685 units; pooling across well-isolated and multiunit clusters, we find border ownership selectivity in 44.6% of units [647 out of 1450 units]). This proportion is high in all laminar compartments (superficial: 43.3% [58 out of 134]; granular: 57.3% [102 out of 178]; deep: 56.0% [121 out of 216]; pooled well-isolated and multiunit clusters: superficial: 42.8% [140 out of 327]; granular: 51.5% [167 out of 324]; deep: 49.1% [210 out of 428]).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Border ownership selectivity occurs first in deep cortical layers</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the time course of the responses evoked by the preferred (solid red line) and non-preferred (dashed blue line) side of border ownership, averaged over all well-isolated units that are selective for border ownership. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>), we observe that border ownership selectivity (difference in response to the preferred and the non-preferred side) occurs early after onset of the stimulus-evoked response. The asterisk indicates when the difference between these functions first becomes statistically significant (56.5 ms after stimulus onset; sign rank test p &lt; 0.05 for 20 adjacent ms). When evaluating these functions in each laminar compartment we observe that these functions diverge substantially early after onset in deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; significant at 58.8 ms), but later in superficial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; significant at 85.8 ms) and granular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; significant at 67.3 ms).

We quantified the difference by defining latencies on these functions as the crossing with a threshold defined from the null distribution obtained by shuffling the stimulus labels (see Methods). Latency was significantly shorter for deep layer units (75.8 ms, 95% CI [68.4 85.2]) than for granular layer units (94.7 ms, 95% CI [82.2 105.7], bootstrap procedure [see Methods] p = 0.006) and for superficial layer units (97.7 ms, 95% CI [78.0 103.7], bootstrap procedure p = 0.018). The same was true when well-isolated units and multiunits were pooled (deep: 78.2 ms, 95% CI [73.3 88.2], <italic>n</italic> = 210; granular: 94.0 ms, 95% CI [87.9 106.5], <italic>n</italic> = 167; superficial: 100.7 ms, 95% CI [85.1 104.6], <italic>n</italic> = 140; deep vs. granular: p = 0.007; deep vs. superficial: p = 0.009). To verify the robustness of the temporal differences between layers, we also evaluated the time course of border ownership selectivity using another method, by evaluating border ownership reliability (<italic>BOR</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>; detailed in Methods). Briefly, this metric quantifies the reliability of border ownership tuning when comparing spike counts between single trials to stimuli with opposite border ownership. Reliability values correspond to the proportion of such single trial comparisons for which the spike count is highest for the border ownership condition that is preferred across trials. We computed <italic>BOR</italic> in 100-ms sliding windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; latency defined similarly as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, using right edge of the analysis window). Again we find that <italic>BOR</italic> rises earlier in the deep layers (89.9 ms, 95% CI [81.5 99.9]) than in the granular (105.4 ms, 95% CI [94.9 114.6]; bootstrap procedure p = 0.015) and superficial layers (109.4, 95% CI [98.9 124.9]; p = 0.006). After border ownership selectivity has been established, the average border ownership index tends to be higher in the deep compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <italic>BOI</italic> between 200 and 500 ms after stimulus onset: mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], 0.50 ± 0.02) than in the granular (0.43 ± 0.02) and superficial compartment (0.45 ± 0.03), but the differences do not reach statistical significance (deep vs. granular: Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.051; deep vs. superficial: p = 0.22). <italic>BOR</italic> saturates around 0.85 in all three compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that border ownership selectivity does not occur first in granular layer units but instead in deep layer units.</p><p>To test whether the short latency in deep layers is specific for border ownership or a general feature of this laminar circuit, we performed two additional analyses. First, we evaluated the latency of spikes evoked by small ring stimuli in the cRF. For these responses we find, in contrast to border ownership selectivity, that the latency is shorter in the granular layer compared to the deep layers and superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; latency defined as crossing of the functions with a threshold value a third of the way from baseline to peak). Note that these responses are derived from the same stimuli used to compute the CSD maps, but represent a different signal (spiking responses as opposed to the current sink–source patterns from local field potentials used to define the laminar compartments). Second, we evaluated the responses to the border ownership stimuli for another type of selectivity, contrast polarity. This refers to the relative luminance contrast across the edge, that is the difference between panels 1 and 3 (or between panels 2 and 4) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. For the contrast polarity index functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we do not find an earlier rise in selectivity in the deep layers, even though they are derived from the same units as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

The preferred orientation for a penetration was then calculated as the resultant vector across the vectors of all orientation-selective units in that penetration, and its angle is indicated by the blue dashed line. The significance of clustering of orientation preference was assessed by comparing the magnitude of this resultant vector against a null distribution generated by randomizing the preferred orientation for each orientation-selective unit in the penetration and performing the same calculation. For each of these six penetrations, this resultant was significantly larger than expected from the null distribution (p &lt; 0.05). This was true for 9 out of 18 penetrations with at least four orientation-selective well-isolated units distributed over all three laminar compartments (for 17 out of 34 penetrations when well-isolated units and multiunit clusters were pooled). These data suggest that orientation domains in V4 are columnar.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Columnar clusters of preferred orientation in V4.</title><p>Polar plots are shown for six penetrations with at least four orientation-selective units distributed across all three laminar compartments.

These polar plots are organized according to the location of the square object relative to the cRF, for different orientations of the central edge (the edge that runs through the cRF). This is indicated by the stimulus cartoons around the plot. For opposite locations on the polar plot, the central edge has thus the same orientation, but is owned by a square positioned on opposite sides of the cRF (opposite border ownership). The <italic>BOI</italic> for each tested orientation of the central edge is shown by a red vector (filled red circles indicate statistically significant border ownership selectivity). The amplitude of this vector corresponds to |<italic>BOI</italic>|, and the polarity of the vector points toward the square location that corresponds to the preferred side of border ownership for that orientation of the central edge. For example, in case of a vertical central edge, the third unit (cyan triangle) prefers that that edge is owned by a square on the right (if it would have preferred the vertical central edge to be owned by a square on the left, the red vector that points down would have pointed up). The black line indicates the preferred orientation of a luminance contrast edge in the cRF for each unit. For the left unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (red star), this preferred edge orientation matches with the orientation of the central edge for which border ownership selectivity is significant (filled red circle). This is the expected scenario: border ownership has been assumed to act on edges at the preferred orientation, and prior studies have used edges at the preferred orientation to test border ownership selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). At the population level, the average orientation of edges with border ownership selectivity is indeed mildly biased toward the preferred orientation for edges. This is subtle but can be seen as the tendency of the data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> to appear close to the identity lines. Note that both plotted variables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> are periodic and two periods are shown for each (thus each data point is plotted four times, and the identity line appears three times; the gray square outlines an area corresponding to one period for both variables). This bias is easier to see when the closest distance of the data points to the identity lines is plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This distance is on average distance 27.6°, significantly smaller than chance (randomization test [see Materials and methods] p = 0.018; <italic>n</italic> = 68 well-isolated units tested with at least four orientations; including multiunit clusters: p = 0.017; <italic>n</italic> = 159).

This unit shows, paradoxically, significant border ownership selectivity for edge orientations that are nearly orthogonal to the preferred edge orientation. This is true for two edge orientations (filled red circles), suggesting that this misalignment is systematic. We ruled out that this is related to a difference in orientation preference for isolated edges versus edges that are part of squares by comparing orientation tuning for both data sets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows that the preferred orientations for both stimuli match very well for this unit (black line vs. cyan line), and this is true for the population as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we find that border ownership-selective units often show border ownership selectivity to edges that maximally differ in orientation, that is orthogonal edges. An example unit is shown in the right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (cyan triangle). This is true for 29.7 % of border ownership-selective well-isolated units (<italic>n</italic> = 182; 24.4 % including multiunits, <italic>n</italic> = 353) that were tested with sets of squares at orthogonal angles. In such cases, the preferred side of border ownership for a central edge with an orientation in between those orthogonal orientations could in theory be spatially discontiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panel) or contiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle panel) with the preferred sides of border ownership for the pair of orthogonal orientations. We find that for all 24 out of 24 well-isolated units that were selective for the border ownership of squares at orthogonal and intermediate orientations, the preferred side of border ownership for these intermediate orientations was spatially contiguous (such as the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel; including multiunits, this is true for 35 out of 35 units). Those units thus have a wide but spatially contiguous area of preferred sides of border ownership. For example, the unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (right panel) has an area of preferred sides of border ownership that spans 120° (cyan double arrow). A span of at least this width occurs for 18.0 % of border ownership units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; 15.4 % including multiunit clusters).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The correct assignment of borders is a key step in the process of constructive perception that enables us to identify and localize objects in a visual scene. Prior studies have found neurons that signal border ownership, but the underlying circuitry is not understood. Various theoretical accounts have been offered. One group of models hypothesizes that border ownership selectivity arises in a feedforward manner, through the successive elaboration of progressively more complex receptive field properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakai and Nishimura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Supèr et al., 2010</xref>). Other accounts posit that border ownership assignment crucially depends on horizontal connections and corticocortical feedback signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craft et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von der Heydt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhaoping, 2005</xref>). These different pathways differ in their laminar organization. Feedforward inputs terminate mostly in the granular layer, whereas long-range horizontal fibers and cortical feedback projections avoid the granular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rockland and Pandya, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rockland and Lund, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshioka et al., 1992</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Border ownership selectivity and the laminar circuit</title><p>Given that about half of the neurons responsive to edges in V2 are selective for border ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>), neurons in V4 could simply inherit this property from V2 through the feedforward projection from V2 to V4. This projection is the most important source of feedforward input to V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markov et al., 2011</xref>), and targets mostly layer 4 (granular layer) in V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gattass et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rockland, 1992</xref>). Our data show that spike latency for stimuli in the cRF is shortest in the granular layer, which is similar to what has been described in other areas in macaque visual cortex (V1: e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nowak et al., 1995</xref>; MT: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raiguel et al., 1999</xref>), and consistent with work by others in awake V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). Note that this may not be universal across areas: in anesthetized V2 spike latency has been reported to be longer in layer 4 than in infragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nowak et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>If this feedforward projection would thus simply provide the earliest border ownership signals in V4, we would thus detect border ownership selectivity in the granular layer at least as early as in the other compartments, or earlier. While we do observe such a pattern for responses evoked by flashed stimuli appearing within the cRF, and also for the emergence of selectivity for contrast polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we do not observe this pattern for selectivity to border ownership. Instead, we find that deep layer neurons compute border ownership selectivity significantly earlier than neurons in the granular layer and in the superficial layers. One might argue that these data are consistent with V2 afferents preferentially targeting apical dendrites of deep layer neurons that extend in the input layer. But in that case, we would expect shorter spike latencies for deep layer neurons than for granular layer neurons irrespective of the cue or stimulus. This is, again, not what we find: spike latencies for responses evoked by small stimuli in the cRF are shorter in the granular layer than in the deep layers, and also for contrast polarity we do not observe the earliest selectivity in deep layers in V4.</p><p>Another possibility is that deep layer neurons perform this computation earliest solely by relying on an integration of feedforward signals from the V2-to-V4 projection relayed by multiple granular layer neurons. We think this is unlikely. First, this would mean that those relaying granular layer neurons do not receive sufficient contextual information to become selective for border ownership as fast as the deep layer neurons that integrate their output, despite the substantial input that granular layer neurons receive from other granular layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Second, while deep layer neurons certainly receive input from granular layer neurons, the densest projections from granular layer neurons typically target superficial layers (e.g., macaque V1: ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callaway, 1998</xref>; rat barrel cortex: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lübke et al., 2000</xref>). If that projection leads to the first computation of border ownership signals, one would thus expect to observe these signals in superficial layer neurons as fast as in deep layer neurons, in contrast with our data.</p><p>We think that the earlier computation of border ownership selectivity by neurons in deep layers is more likely a consequence of their unique properties. Scanning laser photostimulation studies in primary visual cortex showed that layer 5 neurons receive significant input from nearly all cortical layers, regardless of cell type, as opposed to neurons in other layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs and Callaway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Deep layers of the cortex, including in primates, include tall pyramidal cells whose apical dendrites reach up to layer 1, which could thus directly sample and integrate afferent information that arrives in a wide range of layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binzegger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callaway, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lund and Boothe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Markov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zarrinpar and Callaway, 2016</xref>). Such neurons thus seem well suited to integrate information provided by feedforward input with contextual information provided through corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). Corticocortical feedback in V4 terminates densely in all layers except layer 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockland et al., 1994</xref>). Intra-areal horizontal connections are prominent in layer 2/3 and in layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lund et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshioka et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas and Martin, 2007</xref>). This may set these deep layer neurons up to be able to integrate the border in the cRF (light gray arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) with visual context from a wide region of space (dark gray arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which is required to compute border ownership selectivity. Indeed, studies in V2 showed that border ownership selectivity does not rely on a small number of localized object features but instead occurs through integration of extraclassical stimulus features over large areas of visual space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>). Specialized intrinsic properties could further assist in this integration, such as the calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer five neurons that can amplify the effects of feedback inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to test whether deep layer neurons in other areas, for example in V2, also display early border ownership signals (although obtaining penetrations orthogonal to the cortical surface in macaque V2 is challenging, given that only a small part of this area is exposed on the lateral convexity of the brain). Perhaps such contextual integration is a general computation performed by deep layer neurons in different cortical areas. In addition, as discussed below, deep layer neurons in V2 may inherit early border ownership signals from V4.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cartoon of a conceptual model of columnar processing of border ownership, supported by our data.</title><p>Two columnar structures are shown, each of which responds to vertical edges in the classical receptive field (cRF), but they have opposite preferred sides of border ownership (indicated by the direction of the arrows on the units in the columns, and by the symbol below each column). Such columns may or may not be adjacent. The earliest occurrence of border ownership selectivity in the deep layers is symbolized by the positon of deep layer units near the left edge of the column. Light and dark gray arrows indicate where different types of stimulus information likely arrive first. Stimulus information in the cRF (gray edge) arrives first in the granular layer. Deep layer neurons may first compute border ownership selectivity by integrating this information with contextual information that arrives in superficial and deep layers, possibly provided by corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections. The content of these context signals is necessarily asymmetric to result in border ownership preference, and different for the two columns shown (indicated by the symbols above the columns). Because of their prominence in deep layers, early border ownership signals may be part of the feedback that projects from V4 to upstream areas (e.g., V2), and to subcortical targets, such as the superior colliculus (black arrows). Later on during the response, after border ownership signals have first been established in V4, the feedforward input from V2 to V4 likely also contains border ownership signals, since roughly half of V2 units are selective for border ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72573-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our findings are consistent with the concept of the grouping cell model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von der Heydt, 2015</xref>). This model proposes that border ownership is a modulation of feature neurons by an external grouping signal that acts through feedback. The grouping signal is supposed to represent a ‘proto-object’, a computational structure that (1) links the visual feature signals, (2) is being remapped across eye movements, and (3) serves object-selective attention. Compared to the large number of studies of feature selectivity in visual cortex, the question of the representation of object structure has prompted relatively few studies. It remains unclear where and how such grouping signals are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). It is also possible that these deep layer neurons in V4, rather than computing border ownership selectivity de novo from an external grouping signal, inherit this selectivity from higher areas through corticocortical feedback. The source of feedback, whether it provides border ownership signals or grouping signals, would need to have a spike latency that is short enough to explain the early border ownership signals in deep layers in V4. Because of shorter latencies, dorsal stream areas such as LIP may therefore be more likely sources of such feedback than inferotemporal cortex, where shape-selective signals occur after 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brincat and Connor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullier, 2001</xref>; see also discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our conclusion that the earliest border ownership signals in V4 are not inherited from V2 does not imply that the projection from V2 to V4 does not carry any border ownership signals. Indeed, since about half of V2 neurons are selective for border ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>), this feedforward input most likely contributes to the border ownership signals in V4 later in the response. As argued in the next section, these border ownership signals in V2 may have been sculpted by border ownership-selective feedback from deep layers in V4. That V4 does not simply inherit its earliest border ownership signals from V2 is also consistent with a study in V4 on shape encoding that compared responses to identical shapes in the presence or absence of an occluder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushnell et al., 2011</xref>). When the preferred shapes had sharp convexities and concavities, responses were suppressed if those features were rendered incidentally by an adjacent occluder. Suppression latency was relatively short (63 ms after stimulus onset in the population, and for an example neuron as short as 46 ms). Because this is shorter than the latency of border ownership signals reported in V2 (under somewhat different stimulus consitions: ~68 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>), the suppression effect is likely not due to border ownership signals that are inherited from V2. A caveat when interpreting this suppression as border ownership selectivity is that both the shape and the occluder fell in the cRF. Thus, while the suppression may be due to the change in border ownership, it may instead be due to local contour geometry at the T-junctions in the cRF. In any case, this suppression of incidental shapes in V4 could contribute to border ownership signals in V2 in the presence of occluders, through feedback.</p><p>A computational model has shown that contextual information carried by myelinated feedback afferents could indeed arrive fast enough to result in border ownership selectivity within ~20 ms after response onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craft et al., 2007</xref>). An alternative mechanism based solely on horizontal fibers is unlikely, given the slow conduction velocity of these fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>), although, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhaoping, 2005</xref>, it should be noted that data on horizontal fibers are scarce. That said, horizontal fibers could still provide part of the required contextual information: since these fibers are limited in length, their role could be to provide information from the portions of the stimulus closest to the cRF (reminiscent to their proposed role in surround suppression in V1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelucci et al., 2017</xref>]). This would explain why the effect of near corners of squares tends to occur later than that of far corners of squares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential function of early border ownership signals in deep layers</title><p>Once border ownership selectivity has been established in V4 deep layers, these signals may contribute to visual processing along different pathways (black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, V4 is the dominant source of cortical feedback to V2, and 75 % of these feedback neurons are located in deep layers in V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Markov et al., 2014</xref>). Early border ownership signals in deep layers of V4 may thus sculpt border ownership selectivity in V2. Second, V4 deep layers include neurons that project to the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fries, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gattass et al., 2014</xref>). The superior colliculus may thus receive early border ownership signals from V4, which could contribute to planning upcoming saccades. Saccades target objects more frequently than background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothkopf et al., 2007</xref>). Early border ownership signals in deep layer neurons that project to the superior colliculus could serve to facilitate the rapid foveation of objects. Our data show that these signals are established in deep layers well before 100 ms after stimulus onset. They are thus computed quickly enough to allow time for saccade planning within the intersaccadic interval, which is typically on the order of 200–300 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otero-Millan et al., 2008</xref>). This proposed early role for deep layer neurons in supporting saccadic decisions is consistent with recent findings showing that deep layer V4 neurons encode more information about the direction of planned eye movements than do superficial neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettine et al., 2019</xref>). Border ownership signals may thus play a role beyond visual perception, perhaps including a role in guiding rapid oculomotor behavior. Finally, deep layer neurons may convey border ownership signals to neurons in more superficial layers, which would be consistent with the canonical laminar circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas and Martin, 2004</xref>). Our results suggest a potential strategy to study the flow of these signals within single trials. We find that border ownership preference is shared across layers in a columnar fashion. Border ownership is presumably evaluated in the brain by comparing the activity between neurons from such oppositely tuned border ownership columns. In future work, it would thus be interesting to record from such columns simultaneously, and use directionality measures such as Granger causality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferro et al., 2021</xref>) to study the interlaminar flow of border ownership signals within single trials.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Border ownership and orientation tuning</title><p>Prior studies on border ownership only evaluated border ownership selectivity at the preferred orientation of each neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hesse and Tsao, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang and von der Heydt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). In our data, there is indeed a bias toward border ownership selectivity for edges near the preferred orientation. However, we find that there is substantial scatter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This does not seem to stem from measurement noise. First, there is a good match between preferred orientations estimated from two separate data sets: one based on recordings made with isolated edges, the other using edges that are part of squares (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that our estimates of orientation preference are highly reliable, with relatively tight bounds. Second, for some units, border ownership selectivity, surprisingly, systematically only occurs for edges with orientations that are nearly orthogonal to the preferred orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, middle). Third, almost a third of units that are selective for border ownership to an edge with a given orientation are also border ownership-selective to an edge that is orthogonal to that orientation. This reflects systematic tuning, because the preferred sides of border ownership in such cases form a single contiguous area in retinotopic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, a substantial number of units that are selective for border ownership are not selective for orientation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the relation between orientation and border ownership is much richer than has previously been appreciated. Encoding of orientation and of border ownership may represent separate axes of representation. This is not inconsistent with the idea that border ownership assignment represents a surface signal rather than a property tied to a border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakayama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peterson and Skow, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Clustering of border ownership selectivity</title><p>Functional clustering is a recurring theme in primate cortical visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Livingstone, 1987</xref>), and has been reported for several modalities in V4 including orientation, hue, direction of motion, spatial frequency, and recently curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanigawa et al., 2010</xref>). We find here that border ownership preference is preserved across layers within a vertical penetration, indicating that this modality is also organized in a columnar fashion. Importantly though, border ownership is of a fundamentally different nature than these other modalities: the border ownership of an edge is computed based on stimulus features falling outside the cRF. Combined with our finding that early border ownership signals are computed by deep layer neurons rather than being passed on from upstream areas, this columnar organization has important implications for the functional anatomy. It indicates that there is a systematic asymmetric arrangement of the extraclassical contextual information, which, as argued above, may be provided through horizontal fibers and corticocortical feedback. For example, consider a cluster in which neurons prefer that a vertical edge belongs to an object on the left (left column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, symbol below left column indicates preferred border ownership). The neurons in this column thus need to receive asymmetric contextual synaptic information favoring the presence of an object to the left of the edge (symbol above the left column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Neurons in another cluster (right column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) will instead prefer that the same edge is part of an object on the right, and these neurons will thus necessarily receive asymmetric contextual information of the opposite polarity (symbol above right column). The clustered architecture of preferred border ownership therefore requires clusters of asymmetric contextual information in cortex, such that opposite polarities of contextual information occur in distinct and complementary clusters. The present data indicate that border ownership selectivity initially does not arrive through the feedforward pathway. They thus suggest that the substrate of these clusters consists of clustered asymmetries in the retinotopic information carried by afferents from horizontal fibers and cortical feedback.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Reagent type (species) or resource</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Designation</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Source or reference</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Identifiers</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Additional information</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Macaque</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UC Davis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Mathworks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MonkeyLogic</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov/">https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brown.edu/Research/monkeylogic/">https://www.brown.edu/Research/monkeylogic/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CircStat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berens, 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SpyKING CIRCUS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yger et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">32-channel multielectrode probe</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATLAS Neuroengineering</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E32+ R-100-S1-L10 NT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We obtained recordings in two male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), age 13 years (animal Z) and age 15 years (animal D).

The probe was then lowered through the artificial dura over the prelunate gyrus, positioned orthogonally relative to the cortical surface under visual guidance (Zeiss microscope). While monitoring the voltage signals from the electrodes for multiunit activity, the probe was lowered to penetrate the cortical surface. The probe was advanced until multiunit activity was visible on the deepest ~2600 µm of the probe. Then, the probe was retracted typically by several 100 µm to ease dimpling of the cortex. Between recording sessions, probe position was varied (RF eccentricity median 4.87 degrees of visual angle (dva), interquartile range 2.51 dva).

Stimuli consisted of static modified Gabors, constructed using square-wave instead of sinusoidal gratings, and dark gray rings (80 % luminance contrast, diameter 2 dva, thickness 0.25 dva). Grating spatial frequency and phase were such that a single contrast edge was visible centrally in the Gaussian window (grating parameters: 6 orientations, 2 contrast polarities, typically 80 % luminance contrast, one half was one of seven colors or grayscale, the other half was always grayscale; window: FWHM 2 dva). The stimuli were presented every 50 or 60 ms while the animal maintained fixation. Each stimulus appeared at a random location selected from a grid sized 25 × 25 dva with 1 dva spacing centered at coordinates [7.5 dva; 7.5 dva] in the appropriate visual quadrant. During the recording session, high-gamma filtered voltage waveforms in response to these stimuli were analyzed to estimate the retinotopy of the probe position, and choose location and size for the border ownership stimuli. Detailed RFs were calculated for each unit offline after spike sorting and used to verify the proper position of the border ownership stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Layer assignment</title><p>A CSD mapping procedure on evoked local field potentials (LFP) was used to estimate the laminar position of recorded channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nandy et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, animals maintained fixation while dark gray ring stimuli were flashed (32 ms stimulus duration, 94 % luminance contrast, sized and positioned to fall within the cRF of the probe position). The CSD was calculated as the second spatial derivative of the stimulus-triggered LFP (filtered between 3.3 and 88 Hz) and visualized as spatial maps after smoothing using bicubic (2D) interpolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; MATLAB function <italic>interp2</italic> with option <italic>cubic</italic>, the spatial dimension was interpolated at a resolution of 10 µm), but the laminar analysis did not critically depend on this particular method of smoothing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Red regions depict current sinks, blue regions depict current sources. As described in more detail in Results, we observed a consistent pattern between different penetrations, strikingly similar to the current sink–source maps reported by other laboratories in behaving macaques beyond V1 (V4: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettine et al., 2019</xref>; V4: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; area 36: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takeuchi et al., 2011</xref>). Through histological verification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takeuchi et al., 2011</xref> found that the prominent current sink with the shortest latency corresponded to the position of the granular layer. We therefore identified this current sink (current sink indicated by white star, between dashed and dotted white lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) as the granular layer. For each unit, the positions of the electrode contacts (using the five contacts surrounding the one with the largest spike waveform) were weighed by the average peak-to-trough amplitude of the unit’s spike waveform on these contacts, to assign the unit to the depth where its spike waveform is largest. By comparing this position with the range of contacts in the granular layer, we could locate units to superficial, granular, or deep layers. Seven penetrations where the CSD map could not be interpreted were excluded from the laminar analyses, and we also required that all units included in the laminar analyses were located ≤2 mm from the most superficial channel with multiunit activity, to minimize the risk of including white matter activity. We evaluated the orthogonality of penetrations by comparing the receptive field (RF) positions for neural activity recorded on different electrode contacts on the probe. To obtain an estimate for these RF positions, for the population of neurons in the vicinity of each electrode contact, we derived multiunit activity as the amplitude of the envelope from the signal on each electrode contact, by band-pass filtering the recorded signal between 500 Hz and 5 kHz, rectifying it and then low-pass filtering it at 200 Hz (adopting the approach from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Self et al., 2019</xref>). RF contours at <italic>z</italic> = 3 were then computed on the <italic>z</italic>-scored root mean square level of this analog signal, using the same procedure as for the spiking data (see <italic>Receptive field mapping</italic>). For each contour, the RF center was defined as the centroid of the region defined by the contour (using MATLAB function <italic>centroid</italic>). A line was then fitted in three dimensions through these RF centers (stacked according to the position of the electrode contact from which they were computed) from a range of electrode contacts covering 2 mm, starting with the most superficial contact that recorded multiunit activity. The variation between RF positions along the probe was then computed as <italic>D</italic>, the distance in the azimuth × elevation plane between the ends of this line, per mm depth (<italic>D</italic> is indicated for the vertical positions of RF contours shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, and the population data are described in Results).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Orientation tuning stimuli</title><p>A data set for orientation tuning was obtained using luminance contrast edges similar to those used for RF mapping, but with a circular window, sized and positioned such that the stimulus covered and was centered on the estimated aggregate cRF of the probe (12 orientations; 2 contrast polarities; 54 % luminance contrast; 200 ms stimulus duration).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Border ownership stimuli and task</title><p>From the online analysis on the RF mapping data, position, size, and color of the border ownership stimulus set were chosen. An isoluminant square was positioned on an isoluminant background, as in prior studies on border ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). There were four basic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), consisting of a factorial combination of two square positions and two contrast polarities. Note that this results in two pairs of stimuli, where both scenes in a pair have identical stimulus information inside the cRF (dotted black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). The two luminance areas in each scene were either both grays or a combination of gray and a color, and luminance contrast was 54%, as in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>). Square sizes were between 12 × 12 and 20 × 20 dva. At the beginning of each trial, a small light gray fixation point (0.2 × 0.2 dva, 80 % luminance contrast) was presented on a blank gray screen (with luminance set at the geometric mean of the luminances in the border ownership stimulus). After the animal maintained fixation for 400 ms, the border ownership stimulus appeared for 500 ms. Then, for a separate project, the stimulus was replaced with a stimulus in which the central edge was prolonged to cover the entire screen (with identical colors and luminances) and the other parts of the square removed, for another 1000 ms. Spikes elicited during that time window were not included in the analyses in this paper. The animal received a juice reward if it maintained fixation throughout the trial. Depending on recording time, data were obtained for different orientations or positions. Conditions were played pseudorandomly in counterbalanced blocks such that each condition was played once before repeating conditions. Typically 8–10 repetitions were obtained per condition. Often these stimuli were played at a few different orientations and/or positions, in order to increase the likelihood of proper stimulus placement for most units recorded on the probe (because the precise cRF for each unit was only available offline, after spike sorting). On some days, the trials analyzed here were randomly interdigitated with similar trials using stimuli defined for other projects. Some of these trials – not analyzed here – included a condition in which the animal had to saccade to a new fixation position if the fixation point moved.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA).

Latency was defined using a threshold a third of the way from baseline to peak (0.435) using the highest baseline across compartments, and confidence intervals and statistical tests were computed in the same way as for the BOI functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Border ownership reliability and latency</title><p>We also evaluated the time course of border ownership selectivity using the metric border ownership reliability (<italic>BOR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>), which reflects the trial-to-trial reliability of encoding border ownership. This metric was computed for the border ownership-selective units in each laminar compartment, in 100 ms sliding windows (1 ms steps).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rudiger von der Heydt (Reviewer #2); Alexander Thiele (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Determination of layers: The CSD based method used to determine the layers seems a bit ad hoc, although other studies have often used a similar approach. Some histological evidence would be great. If that is not possible, the authors should provide some more details to determine the layer specificity. For example, where were the supragranular-granular and granular-infragranular borders for different penetrations (i.e., which electrode(s) marked these boundaries)? These could be expressed as fractions of the shaft length, and from that, we would approximately know the depth. Also, were these results affected by how the CSDs were smoothed?</p><p>2) Another important factor is the orthogonality of the penetrations. This can also be better quantified based on the variation of the RF centers with depth.</p><p>3) The authors mentioned the possibility of BO signals being generated in one layer and then relayed to another. Many studies have used directionality measures such as Granger causality to test such predictions. Given the authors have the LFP data, it would be interesting to see this analysis done to test potential inter-layer communication. However, previous studies have studied Granger Causality across, but not within an area, so this analysis may not be suitable for this study. The authors should nonetheless present some results showing the same if that is indeed the case, or at least discuss if this approach is unlikely to work within an area.</p><p>4) There is one previous study (Bushnell et al., J Neurosci, 2011) that also concluded, based on the latency of the effect, that border ownership selectivity in V4 cannot be simply inherited from upstream areas. They tested curvature selective V4 cells and found that the responses to the optimal shape were suppressed when the critical curved contour was not intrinsic to the shape but owned by an occluding object. They found latencies of suppression as short as 46 ms, shorter than the latencies of V2 cells reported in Zhou et al., 2000. The present study should mention this finding.</p><p>5) These comments would be interesting as discussion points: It would be very interesting to see a similar laminar analysis applied to area V2. Perhaps the computation of border ownership there occurs also in the deep layers, using similar sources of context information. Alternatively, the V2 border ownership selectivity could be the result of back projection from V4. Because of the importance of representing object structure for many visual tasks, as pointed out above, I would not be surprised if similar fast border ownership computation would be generally found in the deep cortical layers, in V1 and V2 and in areas of the ventral stream beyond V4. The new findings support the idea of the grouping cell model, namely that the context information is provided by an external grouping signal that modulates the activity of the feature neurons in the visual cortex. The grouping signal is supposed to represent a 'proto-object', a computational structure that (1) links the visual feature signals, (2) is being remapped across eye movements, and (3) serves object-selective attention. Compared to the large number of studies of feature selectivity in visual cortex, the question of the representation of object structure has prompted relatively few studies, despite its theoretical importance, and the big question of where and how grouping signals are generated still awaits an answer.</p><p>6) They speculate that it is computed de novo by infragranular neurons, but there is no proof for that. It could also be is due to feedback from higher areas. Kindly discuss this point.</p><p>7) It is hard to see clustering around the identity line in figure 6C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors mentioned the possibility of BO signals being generated in one layer and then relayed to another.

Using CSD from individual penetrations to define the position of laminar compartments is a strategy has been used by several different laboratories, not only in primary visual cortex (e.g. Mitzdorf, 1985; Poort et al., 2016; Bijanzadeh et al., 2018), but also in extrastriate areas, such as other studies in V4 (Nandy et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018, Pettine et al., 2019; Ferro et al., 2021), and in other cortical areas, for example in medial temporal cortex (Takeuchi et al., 2011). We include a new figure that shows the similarities between the CSD profiles from different studies (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Figure 1—figure supplement 3A shows the population average of the CSD in our data. The similarity between this panel and the individual examples shown in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 further highlights the fairly consistent sink-source patterns observed across individual penetrations in our data. Figure 1—figure supplement 3B shows that this pattern is also consistent with that found in macaque V4 in another laboratory (Pettine et al., 2019). Figure 1—figure supplement 3C shows that this pattern is not specific for V4, but also occurs in other areas, such as the medial temporal cortex (Takeuchi et al., 2011).</p><p>Importantly, in the latter study Takeuchi et al. were able to verify histologically, after applying electrolytic marks, that the prominent current sink with short latency (white star in Figure 1—figure supplement 3C) corresponds to the granular layer, thus consistent with CSD analysis in V1 (Mitzdorf, 1985). Thus although we are not able to perform such histological verification in our study (one animal has been euthanized, and the other animal is destined to take part in another project), the very similar sink-source patterns between these different studies (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-C), including with work from others that has been verified histologically, gives us confidence that we can meaningfully use them to assign electrode contacts to granular, superficial and deep layers, as other laboratories have done (e.g. Lu et al., 2018). In addition to the new Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we added language in the corresponding paragraph in Results to explain this better. We clarified in Results that interpretable CSD maps were found in 81 out of 88 penetrations and that only those were used in the laminar analysis (which was already indicated in Methods in the previous version of the manuscript).</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have added the positions of the electrode contacts to the CSD maps in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 (labels along ordinate on the right of the panels). The electrode contacts on the probe covered 3.1 mm (32 contacts with 0.1 mm distance between adjacent contacts), thus the full depth of the cortex was covered even though the vertical position of the probe varied between penetrations (also because a layer of granulation tissue develops over time between the artificial dura and the pial surface). Therefore, to aid in estimating the depth of the individual penetrations, we indicate the position of the most superficial contact on which multiunit activity was recorded (solid black triangles in Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2; for all cases where this contact could be identified, i.e. if the most proximal contact on the probe did not show multiunit activity). The average position of this contact is shown on the population CSD map (solid black triangle on Figure 1—figure supplement 3A). The advantage of a method that assigns layers for a penetration based on data from the same penetration, as we have used here, as opposed to a method that assigns compartments based on depth derived from a population average, is that the former helps to avoid errors due to variations in probe position, and due to a variable degree of tissue compression that may occur for different penetrations.</p><p>To test whether the results were affected by how the CSDs were smoothed, we performed the layer assignment separately using different methods of smoothing. To ensure that we did not bias the results we blinded ourselves to the original layer assignment when applying each method. We find that the laminar position of &gt;97% of well-isolated units was identical as that obtained when using the standard procedure of smoothing the CSDs. This resulted in robust latency differences of border ownership signals between layers, irrespective of which smoothing method was used. These results are presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another important factor is the orthogonality of the penetrations. This can also be better quantified based on the variation of the RF centers with depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the Reviewer’s suggestion and evaluated orthogonality of the penetrations by computing the distance <italic>D</italic> between receptive field centers along the probe (Methods). We show this metric for the vertical positions of receptive field contours shown for the penetrations in Figure 1H, I and Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and describe the population data in the first paragraph of Results (median (IQR) 0.83 º/mm (1.00 º/mm), for all 81 penetrations that were included in the laminar analyses). This indicates that the variation is small relative to the average diameter of the receptive fields (7.36 º), and that the deviation from orthogonality is limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mentioned the possibility of BO signals being generated in one layer and then relayed to another. Many studies have used directionality measures such as Granger causality to test such predictions. Given the authors have the LFP data, it would be interesting to see this analysis done to test potential inter-layer communication. However, previous studies have studied Granger Causality across, but not within an area, so this analysis may not be suitable for this study. The authors should nonetheless present some results showing the same if that is indeed the case, or at least discuss if this approach is unlikely to work within an area.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. As the Reviewer notes, a number of studies have applied Granger Causality analysis to data recorded across areas. We did, however, find two studies that have applied this approach across laminar compartments within an area (e.g. van Kerkoerle et al., PNAS 2014 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402773111 ; Ferro et al., PNAS 2021, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022097118<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022097118">)</ext-link>. So, we do not think that the laminar nature of the question itself is a problem.</p><p>However, it is unclear that this analysis can be applied to the present dataset. In line with prior studies of border ownership, we defined the border ownership signal as the normalized difference in the firing rate of single neurons, across stimulus conditions that differed in terms of which side of the border was object and which side was ground. Thus, the border ownership signal is defined as a difference in firing rates recorded on separate trials. Granger Causality is typically applied to time series that are recorded simultaneously, with a view to determining the degree to which one time series predicts another. We believe that the brain certainly computes border ownership signals in real time, presumably by comparing the responses of oppositely tuned border-ownership-selective neurons. As shown in the manuscript, the neurons recorded from a single laminar electrode penetration tended to share border ownership preference. Therefore, to answer this question one needs to use a different experimental approach to record simultaneously from subpopulations with opposite border ownership tuning. In theory, one could record laminar signals from columns of oppositely tuned neurons, perhaps by using intrinsic imaging to identify oppositely tuned border ownership columns and using these data to guide penetrations. Such data would allow one to define border ownership signals at the level of single trials, and for the different laminar compartments. This would enable one to study the ongoing flow of BO signals across layers throughout the full response. We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion, which we may take up in future studies. We have added a discussion of these issues to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is one previous study (Bushnell et al., J Neurosci, 2011) that also concluded, based on the latency of the effect, that border ownership selectivity in V4 cannot be simply inherited from upstream areas. They tested curvature selective V4 cells and found that the responses to the optimal shape were suppressed when the critical curved contour was not intrinsic to the shape but owned by an occluding object. They found latencies of suppression as short as 46 ms, shorter than the latencies of V2 cells reported in Zhou et al., 2000. The present study should mention this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We had not included this work initially because it focuses on shape encoding, comparing isolated shapes with identical shapes that occur incidentally in the presence of an occluder, rather than border ownership. We do agree that their results are consistent with the feedback hypothesis of border ownership, given the short latency of the suppression of incidental shapes (63 ms after stimulus onset in the population, as early as 46 ms for an example neuron). A limitation of interpreting their data as border ownership signals is the different stimulus arrangement compared to our study and prior studies of border ownership. In the Bushnell et al. (2011) study, both the shape and the occluder fell within the classical receptive field. Thus the observed suppression could also be due to differences in the local contour geometry at the T-junctions within the classical receptive field. In any case, we do agree that this suppression of incidental shapes could contribute to border ownership signals in V2 in the presence of occluders, through feedback. We have added a section in the Discussion that discusses this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) These comments would be interesting as discussion points: It would be very interesting to see a similar laminar analysis applied to area V2. Perhaps the computation of border ownership there occurs also in the deep layers, using similar sources of context information. Alternatively, the V2 border ownership selectivity could be the result of back projection from V4. Because of the importance of representing object structure for many visual tasks, as pointed out above, I would not be surprised if similar fast border ownership computation would be generally found in the deep cortical layers, in V1 and V2 and in areas of the ventral stream beyond V4. The new findings support the idea of the grouping cell model, namely that the context information is provided by an external grouping signal that modulates the activity of the feature neurons in the visual cortex. The grouping signal is supposed to represent a 'proto-object', a computational structure that (1) links the visual feature signals, (2) is being remapped across eye movements, and (3) serves object-selective attention. Compared to the large number of studies of feature selectivity in visual cortex, the question of the representation of object structure has prompted relatively few studies, despite its theoretical importance, and the big question of where and how grouping signals are generated still awaits an answer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added comments on potential similar functions of deep layer neurons in different areas to the Discussion. We point out that at least for V2 in the macaque it is challenging to obtain orthogonal recordings with linear multielectrodes, given that at most a few mm of V2 is exposed on the lateral convexity of the brain. We agree that our findings are consistent with the grouping cell model. We have added this more explicitly to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) They speculate that it is computed de novo by infragranular neurons, but there is no proof for that. It could also be is due to feedback from higher areas. Kindly discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers that infragranular neurons may (in full or in part) inherit border ownership signals from higher areas. A requirement for the source of such feedback, whether it contains border ownership signals or grouping signals from which border ownership is computed, is that the latency is short enough to be able to explain the early occurrence of border ownership signals in deep layers in V4. Therefore, as suggested by Zhu et al. (2020), an area in the dorsal stream such as LIP may be a more likely candidate source of such feedback than inferotemporal cortex. We have added this to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is hard to see clustering around the identity line in figure 6C.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers that the bias of data points to cluster around the identity lines in Figure 6C is subtle. The bias is easier to evaluate in Figure 6D, which shows the distribution of the shortest distance of each data point in Figure 6C to the identity lines (the identity line appears three times in panel 6C, because of the periodic nature of both plotted variables). More surprising than finding this bias is that it is this subtle (compare this panel for example with the much stricter relation of orientation preference derived from both datasets in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Prior studies have studied border ownership selectivity at the preferred orientation. However, our data show that there is no very strict relation between orientation preference and the orientation of borders for which there is border ownership selectivity (Figure 6C; and the individual examples in Figure 6A, middle and right; Figure 6B). We made changes to this paragraph in Results to explain this better.</p></body></sub-article></article>
