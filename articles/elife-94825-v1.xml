hormone therapy (GAHT) on spermatogenesis in trans women has already been studied, data on its precise effects on the testicular environment is poor. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize, through histological and transcriptomic analysis, the spermatogonial stem cell niche of 106 trans women who underwent standardized GAHT, comprising estrogens and cyproterone acetate. A partial dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells was observed, marked by the co-expression of androgen receptor and anti-Müllerian hormone which mirrors the situation in peripubertal boys. The Leydig cells also exhibited a distribution analogous to peripubertal tissue, accompanied by a reduced insulin-like factor 3 expression. Although most peritubular myoid cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin 2, the expression pattern was disturbed. Besides this, fibrosis was particularly evident in the tubular wall and the lumen was collapsing in most participants. A spermatogenic arrest was also observed in all participants. The transcriptomic profile of transgender tissue confirmed a loss of mature characteristics - a partial rejuvenation - of the spermatogonial stem cell niche and, in addition, detected inflammation processes occurring in the samples. The present study shows that GAHT changes the spermatogonial stem cell niche by partially rejuvenating the somatic cells and inducing fibrotic processes. These findings are important to further understand how estrogens and testosterone suppression affect the testis environment, and in the case of orchidectomized testes as medical waste material, their potential use in research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transgender women</kwd><kwd>spermatogonial stem cells</kwd><kwd>testicular tissue</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>hormonal treatment</kwd><kwd>germ cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific fund Willy Gepts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baert</surname><given-names>Yoni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G026223N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baert</surname><given-names>Yoni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004418</institution-id><institution>Strategic research program 89 Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRP89</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goossens</surname><given-names>Ellen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gender-affirming hormone therapy in trans women leads to a loss of mature characteristics in the spermatogonial stem cell niche, causes spermatogenic arrest, and triggers fibrotic processes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) plays a crucial role in the care of many transgender individuals who seek alignment between their gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. Trans women may undergo GAHT which usually combines the administration of estrogens and anti-androgens to suppress endogenous testosterone production and to develop feminine secondary sexual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hembree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman et al., 2022</xref>). Following feminizing GAHT, trans women without any surgical contraindications can opt for a sex reassignment surgery (SRS) which typically consists of a bilateral orchidectomy, as well as a gender-affirming vulvoplasty or vaginoplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Sluis et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>While various effects of feminizing GAHT on the physical transition have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trans Primary Care, 2023</xref>), its impact on the testicular microenvironment remains a subject of ongoing research. Previous studies mainly focused on the impact of GAHT on spermatogenesis, yielding contrasting outcomes, ranging from maturation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu and Steinberger, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapino et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leavy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jindarak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matoso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schneider et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vereecke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Nie et al., 2022a</xref>) to full spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alford et al., 2020</xref>). Besides this, varying degrees of tubular hyalinization were found after GAHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapino et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venizelos and Paradinas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jindarak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Nie et al., 2022b</xref>). Some studies also suggested dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>) and/or dedifferentiation or loss of Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodriguez-Rigau et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapino et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venizelos and Paradinas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kisman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matoso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornejo et al., 2022</xref>). These discrepancies may stem from the limited sample sizes in most studies and the differences in GAHT regimens, involving diverse hormone types, dosages, modes of administration or adherence to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hembree et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, previous findings on the testicular cells mainly relied on histological outcomes and lacked the use of specific markers to accurately identify the condition of these cells.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to thoroughly characterize the spermatogonial stem cell niche in a large cohort of trans women subjected to a standardized GAHT regimen. This research entails (immuno)histochemistry to examine the general condition of the tissue and the maturity/functionality of the somatic cells. Comparative differential gene expression and functional analysis are performed to compare testicular tissue of trans women with that of cisgender adults, as well as peri- and prepubertal boys.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participant background</title><p>A summary of the participants’ characteristics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

However, in peripubertal boys, the AMH signal starts to vanish while the AR signal emerges. By the time adulthood is reached, Sertoli cells are positive for SOX9 and AR and no longer express AMH. For the evaluation of the AMH signal, expression patterns could be established based on the control tissues. Briefly, the ‘prepubertal’ pattern showed a strong AMH signal in all seminiferous tubules, which always overlapped with the SOX9 signal. In the ‘peripubertal’ pattern, there was a moderate AMH signal overlapping with the SOX9 signal within the seminiferous tubules, but also a stronger AMH signal in the tubular wall that did not overlap with the SOX9 signal. The ‘adult’ pattern only showed an AMH signal within the tubular wall which never overlapped with the SOX9 signal. Therefore, the ‘adult’ pattern was considered as AMH<sup>-</sup>. Interestingly, it has been shown that AMH receptor type 2 starts to be expressed in peritubular mesenchymal cells within the tubular walls during puberty and it remains so throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sansone et al., 2020</xref>). AMH bound to this receptor may help explain the observed AMH signal in the tubular wall of peripubertal and adult controls.

The DEGs were subsequently clustered into five expression patterns (P1-P5) to understand how the different testicular tissue types relate to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Functional analysis revealed 1689 enriched GO terms to be significantly associated with the five expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> provides all enriched GO terms). The top and more revealing GO terms for each pattern were selected and displayed next to the five expression patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> with their corresponding number of associated genes and p-value. Pattern P1 is characterized by biological processes related to tissue morphogenesis and development. As expected, prepubertal tissue shows the highest gene expression for this pattern, as the tissue is in development. Interestingly, transgender tissue shows a gene expression intensity similar to that in peripubertal tissue (particularly donor Peripubertal 1) and between adult and prepubertal tissue. For pattern P2, mainly cellular components were significantly enriched in the GO terms analysis, which means that this pattern describes the location where activities and actions of these gene products are executed. Contrary to pattern P1, P2 can be related to a more stable tissue environment, where most activities happen outside the cells providing structural support, and biochemical or biomechanical cues. Consequently, for P2, adult control tissue shows the highest expression, and, again, transgender tissue has a similar expression to donor Peripubertal 1. Pattern P3 represents meiosis and sperm production. As expected, since spermatogenesis is repressed in trans women, transgender tissue showed a low expression of genes in this pattern similar to prepubertal tissue. P4 and P5 are the patterns that set transgender tissue apart from all other tissue types. P4 is associated with cell components (chromosome and spindle) important in both mitotic and meiotic processes. In prepubertal tissue, proliferation and tissue morphogenesis (mitosis) are present, while spermatogenic activity (meiosis) is part of adult tissue. Thus, as expected, less gene expression for P4 was observed in transgender tissue since it is structurally adult (no mitosis) but does not host spermatogenesis (no meiosis). P5 is a gene expression pattern specific to transgender tissue. This pattern includes several biological processes pointing to active inflammation and fibrosis described by the GO terms ‘cell population proliferation’ (119 genes, adjusted p-value&lt;5.90e-15), which is not necessarily related to the mitotic cell cycle, but rather an increase in the number of cells in a certain space over a period (due to cell infiltration), ‘cell activation’ (96, 1.69e-13) or ‘leukocyte activation’ (83, 5.19e-11), ‘cell migration’ (95, 1.59e-11), ‘cell death’ (107, 1.38e-07), ‘regulation of cell differentiation’ (83, 5.46e-07) if associated with macrophages, e.g., ‘response to stimulus’ (348, 2.39e-16), ‘cellular response to cytokine stimulus’ (72, 3.05e-10), ‘response to growth factor’ (49, 7.02e-07), ‘regulation of multicellular organismal process’ (167, 4.21e-22), and ‘extracellular matrix organization’ (44, 8.84e-13). In addition, commonly associated with inflammation and fibrosis, tumorigenesis-related processes suggested by the GO terms ‘angiogenesis’ (56, 4.43e-14) and ‘MAPK cascade’ (53, 9.85e-06) are also part of P5. Highlighting these findings, trans woman 6 shows the highest expression for this pattern, which is also the most fibrotic tissue out of the six transgender tissues used for the gene expression analysis (pictures not shown). Also noteworthy, is the GO term ‘response to estrogen’ (8, 1.55e-2) in P5, suggesting the particularity of this expression pattern to transgender tissue. Thus, the biological processes in P5 show in what ways transgender tissue is divergently transforming from the other tissue types. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAHT can significantly change the adult testis transcriptome to a less mature one, as well as initiate other biological processes that are not normally activated in the testis transcriptome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As many individuals with gender dysphoria seek medical treatment, the need to comprehend the impact of hormone therapy on their bodies, and more particularly on their fertility increases.

Similarly, in another examination of 136 adult trans women undergoing estrogen and CPA treatment, a majority exhibited tubular hyalinization, ranging from 76% to 92%, depending on the cessation of the GAHT for 4 weeks, or its continuation before SRS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Nie et al., 2022b</xref>). Additionally, most of these participants exhibited an absent or half-open lumen, regardless of whether the GAHT was discontinued. Conversely, two other recent studies, one involving 173 trans women undergoing mixed GAHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jindarak et al., 2018</xref>), and another one including 85 trans women treated with estrogen and spironolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>), only reported hyalinization in 6–28% of the participants, respectively. These variations in results could be attributed to differences in study methodologies as the latter two studies focused exclusively on severe cases of hyalinization, while both our study and the one conducted by De Nie and colleagues considered a broader spectrum, encompassing milder forms of hyalinization.</p><p>As we reported earlier, most trans women in this cohort lacked ongoing spermatogenesis, primarily showing spermatogonia-only patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vereecke et al., 2020</xref>). This previous report mentioned a positive correlation between the number of spermatogonia and the serum T, LH, and inhibin B levels, and a negative correlation with the serum AMH levels and the age at the time of surgery. In the current study, a negative correlation could be observed between the serum AMH levels and the degree of tubular hyalinization and spermatogenesis. Moreover, the regression analysis indicated that higher LH values were associated with differentiation up to secondary spermatocytes and, even more, with differentiation up to round spermatids, while an older age at the time of surgery was indicative of a spermatogonia-only pattern or the complete absence of germ cells.</p><p>Examining the PTMCs, a major component of the tubular wall, was crucial to delve deeper into the abnormalities observed in the tubular wall of trans women. The PTMCs provide structural support to the seminiferous tubules, contribute to their contractile function, and exhibit a smooth muscle phenotype characterized by intensive expression of ACTA2, distinguishing them from fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volkmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayerhofer, 2013</xref>). Our results indicated that nearly half of the included trans women showed a ‘disconnected’ ACTA2 pattern. The occurrence of this phenotype might be linked to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, causing spacing between the PTMCs and a more intensive thickening of the tubular wall. Moreover, 16% of the trans women displayed an ‘interrupted’ pattern, while 6% presented an ‘absent’ pattern, reminiscent of the patterns of peripubertal and prepubertal boys, respectively. However, by looking at the morphology of the tissue, the latter two patterns are more likely a reflection of the hyalinization within the tubular wall, causing a loss of the PTMCs rather than their rejuvenation. Noteworthy, our regression analysis revealed that as trans women are older at the time of surgery, they are more likely to have an ‘interrupted’ or an ‘absent’ pattern. Nevertheless, these disturbed patterns do not seem to be age-related, as older adult controls only exhibited a slightly thicker ACTA2 layer, without a ‘disconnected’ or ‘interrupted’ appearance. Apart from this, ACTA2 expression is stimulated by androgens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlatt et al., 1993</xref>) which are suppressed in trans women undergoing GAHT. This may result in a loss of ACTA2 expression, causing a shift in the PTMC phenotype as smooth muscle cells are known to do so in response to changes in the local environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Owens et al., 2004</xref>). Adult Klinefelter syndrome participants, for example, also typically possess low T levels and exhibit an ‘interrupted’ or ‘absent’ ACTA2 pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Saen et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the regression analysis pointed out that higher serum T values were indicative of ‘intact’ ACTA2 patterns, and to a somewhat lesser extent of ‘disconnected’ ACTA2 patterns.</p><p>Since it was previously suggested that the Sertoli cells of trans women might transform into immature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>), their maturation state was of particular interest. Almost all trans women in this cohort exhibited only semi-mature Sertoli cells, expressing both the mature marker AR and the immature marker AMH, resembling the peripubertal controls. A minority of the trans women in this cohort showed mixed phenotypes, in which the presence of semi-mature tubules accounted for a significant portion of the total tubule count. Only a few trans women exclusively exhibited mature Sertoli cells, and none showed solely immature tubules. As T is essential for maintaining the differentiated phenotype and function of Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gholami et al., 2023</xref>), these findings suggest that the disrupted steroid hormone levels after GAHT could cause a partial dedifferentiation of the Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nistal et al., 2013</xref>). Upon comparing Sertoli cell maturity among the different stages of spermatogenesis, it became apparent that although the group without spermatogonia exhibited the highest ratio of mature/semi-mature tubules, those with only spermatogonia and partial differentiation followed an increasing trend. Moreover, the ratio of immature/semi-mature tubules decreased as participants displayed more advanced stages of germ cell differentiation. These observations could possibly be attributed to the older age of participants within the group without spermatogonia, with an age of 46.3±12.7 years old compared to 34.3±13.0 years old in the spermatogonia-only group and 27.9±8.7 years old in the group with partial differentiation. A less pronounced age difference was also noted between the only spermatogonia and partial differentiation groups. Such an age-related variation aligns with earlier findings on this cohort, indicating that suppressing spermatogenesis might be more challenging in younger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vereecke et al., 2020</xref>). The age-related differences in drug sensitivity, particularly the higher metabolization in younger people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherry and Morton, 1989</xref>), or the use of transdermal estrogens in older participants could contribute to the observed trend. Nevertheless, the age at SRS did not emerge as a predictor for the number of AMH<sup>+</sup> tubules, whereas elevated serum T levels were contraindicative for having 100% AMH<sup>+</sup> tubules. Previous research also indicated a correlation between intratesticular AMH levels and the duration of GAHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). Our study did not find a correlation between serum AMH levels and GAHT duration, but there was a significant positive correlation between serum AMH and the percentage of AMH<sup>+</sup> tubules.</p><p>The significant role of Leydig cells in male masculinization prompts intriguing questions about their status in trans women undergoing GAHT. Earlier work already mentioned a reduction in their number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodriguez-Rigau et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapino et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venizelos and Paradinas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kisman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornejo et al., 2022</xref>), their regression to an immature phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matoso et al., 2018</xref>), or their dedifferentiation into fibroblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulze, 1988</xref>). Something that immediately stood out in the present analysis was the fact that, contrary to adult controls, trans women exhibited very small Leydig cell clusters, reminiscent of what was observed in peripubertal controls. Interestingly, estrogens promote Leydig cell engulfment by macrophages by stimulating Leydig cells to produce growth arrest-specific 6, which mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by bridging cells with surface-exposed phosphatidylserine to macrophage receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). INSL3 was used to further assess the Leydig cells, as it is exclusively produced by Leydig cells and is only indirectly regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, making it a reliable marker to assess the Leydig cell population size and Leydig cell maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand-Ivell et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, it should be considered that excessive E2 concentrations might suppress INSL3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laguë and Tremblay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sansone et al., 2019</xref>). Within this cohort, the functional maturity of the Leydig cells varied widely, ranging from 2% to 97%. Only in 47% of the trans women, the functional maturity of the Leydig cells exceeded 70%, which was similar to the adult controls. Comparing scores across the different stages of spermatogenesis revealed significantly fewer functionally mature cells in the groups with no or only spermatogonia compared to those with partial differentiation. This was expected since adequate T levels, produced by Leydig cells, are essential for supporting spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith and Walker, 2014</xref>). The regression analysis indicated that age-related differences between the groups could also account for this effect. This could again be attributed to variations in GAHT sensitivity related to age but also to the tendency of Leydig cells to lose functionality with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand-Ivell et al., 2022</xref>). However, even the oldest control (77 years of age) still had 72% functionally mature Leydig cells. Additionally, this analysis implied that participants with lower FSH levels tended to have fewer functionally mature Leydig cells, aligning with findings by Sapino and colleagues who observed a decrease in Leydig cell numbers correlated with low serum gonadotropin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapino et al., 1987</xref>). In this study, functional Leydig cells were identified with the marker CYP11a1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lottrup et al., 2014</xref>). However, as shown by Guo and colleagues, and reflected in the prepubertal controls, CYP11a1 only gradually appears in Leydig cells around puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), meaning that truly immature Leydig cells could not be identified using this approach. Only the use of an immature Leydig cell marker (delta-like homolog 1) could confirm their presence. Unfortunately, our attempts to optimize the immunofluorescence protocol for this marker were unsuccessful. Due to the negative feedback of estrogens on steroidogenic enzymes, it was considered whether Leydig cells could lose their CYP11a1 signal. While a few cells were CYP11a1<sup>-</sup>/INSL3<sup>+</sup>, most Leydig cells seemed unaffected, suggesting that CYP11a1 expression is persistent to maintain basal T levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the differential gene expression analysis, this study showed clear segregation between prepubertal and adult control tissue based on spermatogenesis-related genes in P3. Due to the lack of spermatogenesis, transgender testicular tissue clustered with prepubertal rather than adult samples. In fact, it has been shown that the spermatogonia present in transgender tissue express transcripts of early undifferentiated spermatogonia, similar to the early undifferentiated spermatogonia in cisgender tissue of all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, also in other expression patterns (P1 and P2), transgender tissue was closer to prepubertal and peripubertal (Peripubertal 1) tissues than to adult tissue. P1 is a pattern that includes biological processes related to tissue morphology and development, and cell location establishment. This is in line with the histological findings regarding the spermatogonial stem cell niche, as well as the findings in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>) pointing to a rejuvenation of transgender tissue, particularly Sertoli cells. On the other hand, P4 reveals that transgender testicular tissue is deprived of - or at least less rich in - mitotic and meiotic cells in comparison to controls. Also, the observation that seminiferous tubules in transgender tissue shrink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leavy et al., 2017</xref>), which may be simply due to germ cell loss, but that they also become hyalinized ghost tubules, indicates that Sertoli cells are not proliferating, but rather depleting. Moreover, we show that transgender Sertoli cells exhibit a phenotype similar to that of Sertoli cells in Sertoli cell-only tubule disorders where immaturity markers and AR are concomitantly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharpe et al., 2003</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that Sertoli cells in trans women have only partially dedifferentiated.</p><p>Pattern P5 was the most specific for transgender tissue. This pattern, although including a variety of biological processes, points to inflammation and fibrosis, in line with what is observed histologically. Noteworthy, Leydig and PTMCs in the testes of trans women display altered transcriptomes not related to rejuvenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), which may point to potential malignant alterations due to GAHT and to the important role of T in keeping these cells healthy after maturation. Although a recent report shows no increased risk of testicular cancer in GAHT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Nie et al., 2022b</xref>), several other reports point to a tight correlation between elevated levels of estrogen and germ or Leydig cell cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huseby, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouskine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandhoke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fénichel and Chevalier, 2019</xref>). In another recent report, routine pathology examination following orchidectomy was advised even though malignant findings were rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonapace-Potvin et al., 2022</xref>). Also interesting to note, the GO term ‘response to estrogen’ (eight genes, adjusted p-value&lt;1.55e-2) is part of P5, showing that alterations at the testis level result from a combination of estrogen and anti-androgen therapy, and not solely from T suppression.</p><p>A common shortcoming in testis biology and male fertility research, testis toxicology, and endocrine disruption testing is the lack of human testicular tissue, particularly from prepubertal and peripubertal boys. Our findings suggest that transgender testicular tissue which expresses AMH, AR, CYP11a1, INSL3, and ACTA2 contains spermatogonia, and exhibits minimal tubular hyalinization, may serve as a valuable alternative for this. Moreover, a recent study showed that testicular cells from GAHT-treated trans women can preserve their function, and that spermatogenesis can be successfully restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Nie et al., 2023</xref>). The great advantage of using trans women’s testicular tissue is that it is abundant since it is treated as medical waste material. This advantage has particular interest for the testing of compounds, whether it be drugs or environmental toxicants, as this application always requires large amounts of samples. In fact, the use of digested trans women’s testicular tissue for the testing of compounds in vitro has been described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mincheva et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While this study provides valuable insights, it is essential to recognize its limitations. The first limitation is that the hormone levels were measured during the last visit before SRS rather than on the day of surgery, and not considering the time of last administration and blood draw, explaining suboptimal E2 serum levels in many participants. Nevertheless, this approach offers insight into the hormonal status throughout treatment, rather than 2 weeks post-GAHT cessation. It is however important to mention that, despite the recommended follow-up interval of 6–12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hembree et al., 2017</xref>), hormone measurements for four participants dated back more than a year before the surgery. Moreover, for eight participants, only hormone measurements from less than 1 year after the initiation of treatment were available. Another limitation of this study is the lack of information regarding the testicular function of the participants before the start of the hormonal treatment. It is possible that certain transgender-specific factors such as tucking, wearing tight underwear, and having a low masturbation frequency might have negatively impacted their testicular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Nie et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, all trans women in this study showed normal serum T values before initiating GAHT. Finally, it was challenging to draw strong conclusions from the regression analysis within the current cohort, and the available predictors are deemed inadequate for making predictions at an individual participant level. On the other hand, this study features a large cohort of 106 trans women who were subjected to a consistent hormone regimen involving both estrogens and a fixed dose of CPA, ensuring robust statistical analyses and reliable outcomes. Since in ENIGI the practice has changed over the recent years toward reduction in prescribed daily CPA dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuijpers et al., 2021</xref>) or abandoning CPA altogether in favor of GnRH analogues as anti-androgen treatment, a re-evaluation in this more recent cohort is advisable.</p><p>In summary, our findings show that trans women undergoing GAHT with E2 and CPA exhibit a partially rejuvenated spermatogonial stem cell niche. In the tubular wall, PTMCs continue to express ACTA2 although in a disturbed pattern, likely due to fibrotic processes. Additionally, there is evidence of a regressed seminiferous epithelium and a collapsing lumen. Sertoli cells have partially dedifferentiated (expression of both AMH and AR) and resemble those of peripubertal boys. Leydig cells also show a distribution similar to that of peripubertal tissue and a decreased INSL3 expression. The transcriptomic profiles of transgender and control testicular tissue reveal ongoing inflammation but also confirm the microscopy findings that point to a loss of mature characteristics - a partial rejuvenation - of the spermatogonial stem cell niche in transgender testicular tissue. Hence, testicular tissue from trans women holds the potential to be used as a surrogate for (pre)pubertal tissue in in vitro applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The collection and use of all tissues were approved by the Committee for Medical Ethics of the Universitair Ziekenhuis (UZ) Brussel - Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) (EC nos. 2016/V9, 2017/061, and 2022/161) and UZ Gent (EC nos. 2009/622, 2014/1175, and 2014/1175-AM01).

hematoxylin-eosin or hematoxylin-periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The degree of germ cell differentiation was determined through staining for melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4), boule homolog RNA-binding protein (BOLL), cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), and ACROSIN. These markers identify spermatogonia/primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes/round spermatids, round spermatids, and round/elongating/elongated spermatids, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peri and Serio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muciaccia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Michele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, germ cell staining results from 97 participants have already been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vereecke et al., 2020</xref>) and were integrated into the current paper’s findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Peritubular myoid cells</title><p>The status of the peritubular myoid cells was determined by the presence of ACTA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlatt et al., 1993</xref>). Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were treated with an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/methanol solution for 30 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, antigen retrieval was conducted in citric acid (made in-house, pH 6), using a water bath at 98°C for 75 min. Then, the sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum (NGS, B304, Tebu-bio, Boechout, Belgium)/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, 10735094001, Roche Diagnostics, Vilvoorde, Belgium) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 70011-036, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min. After this, all sections, except for the negative control, were exposed to the primary antibody ACTA2. The sections were then incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C. On the following day, the slides were treated with the Dako Real Envision Detection System kit (K500711-2, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sertoli cells</title><p>Sertoli cell maturation was assessed by the general marker SOX9, maturity marker AR, and immaturity marker AMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). After deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed in a Tris-ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) buffer (homemade, pH 9) using a water bath at 95°C for 75 min. Next, all sections were incubated with an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/methanol solution for 30 min. After blocking the slides with 4% NGS in PBS for 1 hr, they were incubated with the primary antibody AMH overnight. The sections were exposed to the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for an hour, followed by fluorescein (NEL741001KT, Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA, USA) for 5 min to develop the first color. Subsequently, the sections underwent a second antigen retrieval in a microwave for two cycles of 5 min at 500 W, in Tris-EDTA. After this, the sections were blocked with 20% NGS/5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, homemade, pH 7.4) for 30 min and incubated overnight with the primary antibody AR. The following day, the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit-HRP was added for 30 min, after which the second color was generated by Cyanine 3 incubation (NEL744001KT, Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA, USA) for 5 min. The final antigen retrieval was achieved in a 75 min water bath at 95°C in Tris-EDTA. The sections were then blocked with 5% NGS in TBS for 1 hr. Subsequently, the third primary antibody SOX9 was incubated overnight. The last secondary antibody, goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, was incubated for 1 hr, after which the slides were exposed to Hoechst (H3570, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 1/2000) for 10 min. Finally, the slides were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent (P36934, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Breda, The Netherlands) and stored in the dark at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Leydig cells</title><p>The maturity marker INSL3 and functional marker CYP11a1 were used to assess the status of the Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lottrup et al., 2014</xref>). Following deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed in the microwave for two cycles of 5 min at 500 W in Tris-EDTA. Subsequently, all sections were incubated with 0.1% Tween-20 (P1379-250ML, Sigma-Aldrich, Overijse, Belgium)/3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in TBS, followed by 20% NGS/5% BSA in TBS for 30 min each. After this, the sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibody INSL3. The secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit-HRP was added for 30 min, after which fluorescein was developed for 5 min. The second antigen retrieval took place in a 75 min water bath at 95°C in Tris-EDTA. After another blocking step with 5% NGS in PBS for an hour, the sections were exposed to the primary antibody CYP11a1 overnight. The next day, the secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 was added for an hour, and Hoechst was added for 10 min. The sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent and stored in the dark at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microscopic analysis</title><p>Histological examination was performed on an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus, Aartselaar, Belgium). Four representative images within one depth were captured for each participant using the imaging software CellF (version 2.8, Olympus, Aartselaar, Belgium) at a magnification of ×10. Damage to the testicular niche was evaluated on PAS stainings by three independent individuals and involved scoring of the tubular lumen and tubular hyalinization. One overall score was addressed for each participant using modified classification scales from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Nie et al., 2022b</xref>. The lumen was defined as ‘open’, ‘half-open’, or ‘absent’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tubular hyalinization was scored based on the presence and thickness of a hyaline region separating the peritubular layer from the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The absence of hyalinization was scored as ‘no’, while subtle hyalinization was categorized as ‘mild’. When a distinct, thick hyaline region could be observed, the tubule was scored as ‘moderate’, and when the tubule was nearly entirely hyalinized, it was classified as ‘severe’. To determine the stage of germ cell differentiation, images from the MAGE-A4, BOLL, CREM, and ACROSIN stainings were scored as positive or negative for each respective marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vereecke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To evaluate the PTMCs, the ACTA2 staining patterns in trans women were compared to those observed in the controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, four ACTA2 patterns could be established: ‘intact’ (adult-like), ‘disconnected’, ’interrupted’ (peripubertal-like), and ‘absent’ (prepubertal-like).</p><p>The immunofluorescent stainings were scanned with an axioscanner (Axioscan 7, Zeiss, Zaventem, Belgium). Four representative images within one depth were captured for each sample using the ZEN software (version 3.5, Zeiss, Zaventem, Belgium). For the Sertoli cell stainings, each image covered 2000 μm, whereas for the Leydig cell pictures, the images covered 1000 μm each. The images were subsequently analyzed with ImageJ (version 2.9.0/1.53t, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). All seminiferous tubules within the four images were assessed for the presence or absence of Sertoli cell markers SOX9 (general marker), AR (maturity marker), and AMH (immaturity marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For each participant, the outcomes were presented as the percentage of ‘mature’ (SOX9<sup>+</sup>/AR<sup>+</sup>/AMH<sup>-</sup>), ‘semi-mature’ (SOX9<sup>+</sup>/AR<sup>+</sup>/AMH<sup>+</sup>), and ‘immature’ (SOX9<sup>+</sup>/AR<sup>-</sup>/AMH<sup>-</sup>) tubules. Besides this, the CYP11a1-expressing Leydig cells (functional marker) within the four images were quantified and scored as either positive or negative for INSL3 (maturity marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For each individual, results were expressed as the percentage of ‘functionally mature’ (CYP11a1<sup>+</sup>/INSL3<sup>+</sup>) Leydig cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.3.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Data are displayed as the median (range) or as the mean ± SD. For each of the different research questions, different statistical choices were made, as will be explained in the Results section. It is worth mentioning here that the distributions of the data of interest present some challenges for their analysis, and different techniques are used to deal with those challenges. The data for the Sertoli and Leydig cells have many observations at the extremes of the scale (0% or 100%) and the different percentages are interdependent, for which a hyperbolic tangent transformation is used on specific ratios of these percentages. Certain predictors are also transformed or altered, because of too strong intercorrelation and skewness. A new variable was created that combined FSH and LH, creating three categories, those with FSH under 0.3, and those with FSH over 0.3 but either LH under 0.1 or over or equal to 0.1. A log-transformation of the E2 and T predictors was also considered. As these two are also strongly correlated they are never combined within one model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA extraction and RNA sequencing</title><p>Cryopreserved testicular tissue was thawed and cryoprotectants were osmotically removed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baert et al., 2013</xref>. RNA extraction was performed with the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentration after extraction was assessed by using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Breda, The Netherlands). Using the DNF-472 High Sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit, the quality of the RNA samples was assessed on the AATI Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA libraries were created from 150 ng of total RNA using the KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase kit (Roche Diagnostics, Vilvoorde, Belgium), according to the manufacturer’s directions. In summary, following ribodepletion and DNase digestion, RNA was fragmented to average sizes of 200–300 bp by incubating the samples for 6 min at 94°C. After first-strand synthesis, second-strand synthesis and adapter ligation, the libraries were amplified using 12 PCR cycles. Using the DNF-474 High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit, final libraries were qualified on the AATI Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and quantified on the Qubit 2.0 with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit (200 cycles), 25 million 2×100 bp reads were generated per sample on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). For this, 1.9 nM libraries were denatured according to the manufacturer’s directions. After demultiplexing and an adaptor/quality trimming step, the raw reads were mapped against the human genome (hg19) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference - STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), and then translated into a quantitative measure of gene expression with the tool HTSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Differential gene expression and functional analysis</title><p>The UMI matrix was normalized with the regularized log (rlog) transformation package from DeSeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The AMEN suite was used to identify DEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalmel and Primig, 2008</xref>). A statistical comparison between the different types of testicular tissue was made to identify DEGs. In short, genes that were more highly expressed than the background cutoff (overall median of rlog-transformed UMI dataset, 2.03), and that exceeded 2.0-fold change compared to the control, were used for further analysis. Significant DEGs were identified by using the empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics implemented into the LIMMA package with an adjusted F-value estimated using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) approach (p≤0.05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smyth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Partitioning of the DEGs was performed by using the k-means method. Expression profiles of DEGs were displayed as false-color heatmaps using the ‘pheatmap’ package. Functional analyses were performed with AMEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalmel and Primig, 2008</xref>) with an FDR-adjusted p-value of ≤0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, She conducted the staining procedures, performed the imaging and analysis, and processed the data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, He gathered the tissue samples for gene expression analysis, performed the RNA extraction, and the final gene expression analysis, and drafted the part on gene expression analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, He performed the differential gene expression and functional analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, He conducted the statistical analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, She conducted the statistical analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing, She managed the recruitment and consent of the trans women for the gene expression analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, He managed the recruitment of the trans women and their clinical data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The collection and use of all tissues were approved by the Committee for Medical Ethics of the Universitair Ziekenhuis (UZ) Brussel - Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) (EC nos. 2016/V9, 2017/061 and 2022/161) and UZ Gent (EC nos. 2009/622, 2014/1175 and 2014/1175-AM01).

The effect of GAHT in girls has been nicely worked out. Changes in Sertoli and peritubular cells appear valid, less strong evidence is provided for Leydig cell development. The recovery of SSCs appears an overjudgement and should be rephrased. The multitude and diversity of datasets appear a strength and a weakness as some datasets were not sufficiently critically reviewed and a selection of highlights provides a certain bias to the interpretation and conclusion of the study.</p><p>The authors need to indicate that the subset of data on SSCs has been reported previously Human Reprod 36: 5-15 (2021) and is simply re-incorporated in the present paper. as Fig. 1C. There are sufficient new results to publish the remaining datasets as a separate paper. Authors could refer to the SSC data with reference to the previous publication.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The patient cohort is impressive and is nicely characterized. Here, histological endpoints and endocrine profiles were analyzed appropriately for most endpoints. The paper is well-written and has many new findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The patients and controls are poorly separated in regard to pubertal status. Here additional endpoints (e.g. Tanner status) would have been helpful especially as the individual patient history is unknown. Pre- and peri-puberty is a very rough differentiation. The characterization and evaluation of Leydig cells is the weakest histological endpoint. Here, additional markers may be required. Fig. 1 suffers from suboptimal micrograph quality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94825.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The study is devoted to the deep investigation of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) niche in trans women after gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Both cellular structure and functionality of the niche were studied. The authors evidently demonstrated that all cellular components of SSC niche were affected by hormone therapy. Interestingly, the signs of &quot;rejuvenation&quot; within the niche were also observed indicating the possible reverse to the immature condition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The obtained findings are important for the better understanding of hormonal regulation of testis and SSC niche and provide some clues for using the biomaterials from these specific and even unique donors for biomedical research.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This study has some limitations. Many studies can't be done using the testes cells of trans women, since their cells are significantly different from adult man cells and less from prepubertal and pubertal cells. The authors themselves identify some of the limitations: this material is suitable only for studying prepubertal processes in the testis. However, the authors also report large variability in data due to different hormonal therapy regimens and, apparently, age. Accordingly, not all material obtained from trans women can also be used for studies of prepubertal processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94825.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Delgouffe</surname><given-names>Emily</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Samuel Madureira</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chalmel</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Rennes, Inserm, UMR_S 1085</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rennes</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cools</surname><given-names>Wilfried</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Raets</surname><given-names>Camille</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tilleman</surname><given-names>Kelly</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>T'Sjoen</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baert</surname><given-names>Yoni</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Goossens</surname><given-names>Ellen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Data on SSCs are published from a previous report (Fig. 1C). These should be deleted or marked as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the need for clarification regarding our study population for the germ cell stainings. As stated in our Materials and Methods section, our current study population includes the cohort from our previous publication (Vereecke et al., 2020), supplemented by nine additional participants, totaling n=106 trans women. Fig. 1C incorporates both previous and new data on germ cells, and this was further clarified in the Materials and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Many micrographs are suboptimal and need to be replaced by better photos presenting cellular details more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>The Figures were remade to solve the suboptimal resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Table 2 would benefit from a column indicating the target cell or organelle.</p></disp-quote><p>This column was added to Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The pubertal status is poorly defined by pre- and peripubertal terms. The authors should add more informative clinical scores.</p></disp-quote><p>We included information on the Tanner stages of the trans women in our cohort (all G5), as well as details on the selection criteria for our controls and their pubertal status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The characterization of Leydig cells is incomplete. Several better markers would validate the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As briefly touched upon in the discussion, the marker delta-like homolog 1 would indeed be valuable to assess the presence of truly immature Leydig cells. Unfortunately, our attempts to optimize the immunofluorescence protocol for this marker were unsuccessful, resulting in a double staining instead of a triple staining for the Leydig cells. This statement was also added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The selection bias for datasets is obvious. It seems that the authors try to create nice stories but do not always refer to less compelling datasets. Here a more critical view may be necessary to gain a more realistic view and may open alternative explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>We would appreciate clarification on which datasets may have been insufficiently reviewed and how our selection of highlights may have introduced bias to the interpretation and conclusion of the study. It is important to note that we did not select any patients/ data; all patient data were incorporated into our results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The term rejuvenation for the stem cell niche/germ cell complement is misleading in the title and text. Could the authors consider another team e.g... restoration., (de)differentiation. Alternatively, define the term juvenation in a more substantial manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not change the term “partial rejuvenation” as we believe it best describes our findings. We did however introduce the term in a more substantial manner in our Abstract and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors provided a lot of scattered data, but it would be useful to formulate clear criteria (hormonal therapy, age, end points, etc.) that the material must meet so that it can be used for research into prepubertal processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these criteria to our Discussion. However, our current results do not yet reveal how these tissues behave in vitro. Ongoing research is addressing this question and will be presented in a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Is there any research on the preservation of functions of testicular cells from trans women?</p></disp-quote><p>This data would be very useful, for example, for models for drug testing. Yes: a reference to this paper was added to our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is recommended to present the data in a table reflecting the correlations found by the authors and the correlations from the literature between cellular changes and hormone levels and age.</p></disp-quote><p>After careful consideration, we have decided to proceed without incorporating these suggested changes. Our paper focuses on original findings rather than synthesizing existing literature. As such, we have chosen to emphasize our novel results and to compare them to the existing literature in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors can also provide data on clinical standards for hormone levels depending on gender and age.</p></disp-quote><p>This was added as Supplementary Tables 1-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is recommended to add links to sources from which information about cellular prepubertal, pubertal and adult markers was taken.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was added throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Is it known which cells within the wall of the seminiferous tubules in adults express AMH? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown that AMH receptor type 2 starts to be expressed in peritubular mesenchymal cells within the tubular walls during puberty and it remains so throughout adulthood (Sansone et al., 2020). AMH bound to this receptor may help explain the observed AMH signal in the tubular wall of peripubertal and adult controls. This information was added to our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) How was the degree of hyalinization assessed? It's not obvious from the pictures.</p></disp-quote><p>This was further clarified in the Materials &amp; Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Why were inhibin B and AMH not measured in all patients?</p></disp-quote><p>Inhibin B and AMH levels were not available for all patients due to the retrospective nature of these analyses. The measurements were not consistently recorded for all individuals within the historical dataset upon which our research relies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Why does picture 3A present few SOX9 on adult Sertoli cells, although this is their typical marker?</p></disp-quote><p>SOX9 was present in the adult Sertoli cells. However, this signal appears to be more &quot;diluted&quot; in adults due to their ongoing spermatogenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
