dysfunction‐associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and other related metabolic syndromes. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway plays a crucial role in response to dietary stressors, and it was demonstrated that the inhibition of the JNK pathway could potentially be used in the treatment of MAFLD. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying these interventions remain incompletely understood given their multifaceted effects across multiple tissues. In this study, we challenged rats with sucrose-sweetened water and investigated the potential effects of JNK inhibition by employing network analysis based on the transcriptome profiling obtained from hepatic and extrahepatic tissues, including visceral white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain. Our data demonstrate that JNK inhibition by JNK-IN-5A effectively reduces the circulating triglyceride accumulation and inflammation in rats subjected to sucrose consumption. Coexpression analysis and genome-scale metabolic modeling reveal that sucrose overconsumption primarily induces transcriptional dysfunction related to fatty acid and oxidative metabolism in the liver and adipose tissues, which are largely rectified after JNK inhibition at a clinically relevant dose. Skeletal muscle exhibited minimal transcriptional changes to sucrose overconsumption but underwent substantial metabolic adaptation following the JNK inhibition. Overall, our data provides novel insights into the molecular basis by which JNK inhibition exerts its metabolic effect in the metabolically active tissues. Furthermore, our findings underpin the critical role of extrahepatic metabolism in the development of diet-induced steatosis, offering valuable guidance for future studies focused on JNK-targeting for effective treatment of MAFLD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAFLD</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>sucrose</kwd><kwd>JNK-IN-5A</kwd><kwd>multi-tissue transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>72110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardinoglu</surname><given-names>Adil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ScandiEdge Therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhlen</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Boren</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mardinoglu</surname><given-names>Adil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/812616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardinoglu</surname><given-names>Adil</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase exerts a cross-tissue therapeutic effect on metabolic dysfunction induced by sucrose overconsumption in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatic steatosis (HS) is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in the liver (at least 5% of liver weight) in the absence of secondary contributing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassir et al., 2015</xref>). MAFLD encompasses a spectrum of conditions, ranging from simple HS to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which is characterized by HS combined with various degrees of liver inflammation and liver injury, with or without fibrosis. MASH can progress to advanced liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machado and Cortez-Pinto, 2023</xref>). The global prevalence of MAFLD is estimated to be 20–25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Younossi et al., 2023</xref>), and it is rapidly increasing in parallel with the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotsiliti, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2023</xref>). Given the absence of approved pharmacological therapy for MAFLD by the US Food and Drug Treatment (FDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llovet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nassir et al., 2015</xref>), the discovery and development of effective therapies are of great importance in MAFLD treatment.</p><p>The progression of MAFLD is associated with various factors, including overnutrition, genetic determinants, and associated comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sveinbjornsson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yki-Järvinen et al., 2021</xref>). Strong evidence from meta-analysis, prospective cohort studies, and observational studies indicate that excessive sucrose, a disaccharide that comprises equal amounts of glucose and fructose and is prevalent in all kinds of sugar-sweetened beverages, maybe an initial factor for the development of MAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geidl-Flueck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geurtsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karlsen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malik and Hu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, a previous study reported that rats subjected to a 12 wk high-sucrose diet (25% w/v sucrose), developed a metabolic syndrome phenotype characterized by glucose intolerance, HS, and insulin resistance (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sousa et al., 2018</xref>). Recent research further reveals that the consumption of sucrose at a concentration of 10% w/v can disrupt energy balance and induce HS within 10–20 wk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephenson et al., 2022</xref>). In this context, JNK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase family member, emerges as a critical player due to its known function in response to intra- and extracellular stress, including hypercaloric diet consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikolic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sabio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Softic et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, accumulating evidence implicated JNK in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity, IR, development of metabolic syndrome, and MAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czaja, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabio and Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). JNK has three isoforms: JNK1 and JNK2, which are ubiquitously expressed, and JNK3 is specifically expressed in the brain, testis, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Karin, 2001</xref>). Previously, Singh et al. demonstrated that increased hepatic JNK signaling occurred simultaneously with steatosis and lipid accumulation in a steatohepatitis model induced by a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, MCD diet-fed JNK1 null mice exhibited significantly reduced levels of key hallmarks of MAFLD, including HS, TG accumulation, inflammation, lipid peroxidation, hepatocyte injury, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, high-fat diet-fed mice with hepatic ablation of both JNK1 and JNK2 are protected from HS and IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vernia et al., 2014</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that the suppression of the JNK pathway may prevent the development of HS and related metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kodama and Brenner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schattenberg et al., 2006</xref>). However, whether JNK mediates the metabolic disruption induced by sucrose overconsumption remains to be elucidated. Moreover, our previous study demonstrated that JNK-IN-5A, a selective JNK2 and JNK3 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerbone et al., 2012</xref>), effectively decreased fat accumulation and steatosis-related protein expression in an in vitro steatosis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). However, the inhibitory effect of JNK-IN-5A to JNK and JNK-related pathways in in vivo is unknown. It is established that JNK exerts its metabolic regulation as a result of multi-tissue communication, including those between liver and adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzu et al., 2020</xref>), and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikolic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vernia et al., 2014</xref>). A systematic investigation into tissue-specific and tissue-crosstalk metabolic changes in response to diet and therapy interventions is, therefore, paramount by using genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). GEMs are the collection of biochemical reactions and the associated enzymes and transporters between the cellular compartments and such models can be used in the analysis of omics data for gaining insights and interpretation of the omics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mardinoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mardinoglu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mardinoglu and Nielsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mardinoglu and Palsson, 2025</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first performed a 7 d oral toxicology study and studied the tolerability of JNK-IN-5A in rats. Next, we explored the potential therapeutic effect of JNK-IN-5A under high sucrose consumption in in vivo by performing systems biology analysis. To elucidate the systems-wide impact of sucrose overconsumption and JNK-IN-5A treatment, we investigated the intra- and inter-tissue response through integrative analysis of transcriptomics profiles from the metabolically active tissues, including liver and three other extrahepatic tissues: visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT), skeletal muscle (SkM), and brain tissues. We further predicted the genome-wide metabolic activity changes induced by liquid sucrose ingestion and JNK-IN-5A treatment by performing genome-scale metabolic modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The acute effect of the JNK-IN-5A in rats</title><p>We previously showed that the JNK-IN-5A can effectively decrease the TG accumulation and steatosis-related protein levels in an in vitro model simulating the activated de novo lipogenesis in MAFLD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2023</xref>).

Compass is a flux balance analysis-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orth et al., 2010</xref>) algorithms to model the metabolic state of a system (e.g. single cell or tissue), taking into account the observed expression levels of enzyme-coding genes in each sample from RNA-seq data. In this study, we employed Recon3D, a generic GEMs of human metabolism, comprising 10,600 metabolic reactions associated with 5835 metabolites and 2248 metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with our previous analysis, we observed a shift in metabolic activity in the liver and vWAT after JNK_D1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Specifically, Compass predicted that 2840 and 4170 metabolic reactions showed significantly altered activity (Wilcoxon test, adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) following the sucrose consumption in the liver and vWAT, respectively. 89.2% and 88.3% of which were correspondingly reversed after JNK_D1 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). The common altered reactions are partitioned into the subsystems named citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and tryptophan metabolism in Recon3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Some of the predicted metabolic changes align with previous findings in rodents subjected to sucrose overconsumption. For example, Öztürk et al. reported altered tryptophan metabolism in rats consuming 10% sucrose in drinking water, including decreased serum levels of kynurenic acid and kynurenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ozturk and Eryavuz Onmaz, 2022</xref>). Similarly, increased triglyceride-bound oleate, palmitate, and stearate were observed in the livers of rats fed a 10% sucrose solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephenson et al., 2022</xref>), indicating JNK-IN-5A treatment may regulate lipid metabolism by modulating these metabolic activities. Moreover, we found 8 metabolic reactions significantly altered in sucrose +JNK_D2-treated rats, including 2 reactions involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, 2 in nucleotide interconversion, 1 in pentose phosphate pathway, 1 in fructose and mannose metabolism, 1 in propanoate metabolism (Cohen’s d&lt;0, padj &lt;0.05), and 1 in drug metabolism (Cohen’s d&gt;0, padj &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

Our investigation into the metabolic changes from the major metabolically active tissues enabled us to systematically assess the potential therapeutic effects of JNK-IN-5A under high sucrose consumption. Here, we demonstrated that JNK-IN-5A attenuated the accumulation of circulating TG and inflammation exaggerated by liquid sucrose consumption. Importantly, the rats treated with JNK-IN-5A did not exhibit indications of anxiety or behavioral disorders. These results have important implications for the development of JNK3 inhibitors, taking into account the high expression of JNK3 in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Karin, 2001</xref>). Additionally, our data indicated that JNK-IN-5A, a selective inhibitor of JNK2 and JNK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerbone et al., 2012</xref>), also exerted an inhibitory effect on the gene expression of JNK1 in in vivo, especially in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>By studying the hepatic and extrahepatic tissues using genome-wide transcriptome data and integrative analyses with GEMs, we found that the intervention with sucrose-sweetened water triggered extensive transcriptional changes in the liver and adipose tissues, including those involved in fatty acid and oxidative metabolism. The metabolic axis between the liver and adipose tissues is a critical regulatory network that governs energy balance and metabolic homeostasis in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzu et al., 2020</xref>). It has been reported that upon chronic overnutrition, adipose lipogenesis is significantly downregulated, which leads to ectopic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeon et al., 2023</xref>). In line with this, we found that in the sucrose-sweetened water group, the mRNA expression of many genes related to fatty acid metabolism and uptake is downregulated in adipose tissue. Interestingly, those genes showed the opposite regulation between liver and adipose tissue, indicating their complementary role in these metabolic processes in response to the diet intervention. These findings also pinpoint the critical role of extrahepatic metabolism in the development of MAFLD.</p><p>JNK plays essential roles in a range of signaling pathways that have implications for metabolic processes such as insulin sensitivity, thermogenesis, adipogenesis, and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nikolic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solinas and Becattini, 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrated that JNK-IN-5A, especially when administered at a regular dosage (JNK_D1, 30 mg/kg/d), effectively opposite a substantial portion of the transcriptional changes induced by sucrose consumption, particularly those related to carbon, fatty acid metabolism, OXPHOS, and thermogenesis in the liver and adipose tissues. This suggests that JNK-IN-5A might hold promise as a potential strategy for restoring metabolic perturbation in tissues challenged by sucrose-induced stress. However, our study also revealed that JNK_D1-treated skeletal muscle exhibited profound transcriptional changes related to HSCs, osteoclast differentiation, and immune-related pathways. Importantly, we found that these changes were not confined to skeletal muscle but exhibited correlations with transcriptional changes in the liver, adipose tissue, and even brain tissue. The suggest the coordinated roles of JNK inhibition in mitigating sucrose-induced MAFLD across these tissues, while the exact molecular mechanisms by which JNK-IN-5A exert its muscle-specific effect warrant further investigations. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated that the JNK pathway regulates HSCs expansion and self-renewal in JNK-IN-8-treated CD34<sup>+</sup>CD45RA-CB cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lessard et al., 2018</xref> demonstrated that mice with muscle-specific JNK1/2 knockout, have a muscle phenotype that mimics that of endurance-trained athletes. Together with our data, these results suggest a multifaceted role of JNK signaling in the regulation of HSCs and metabolism in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Although overactivated JNK activity presents an attractive opportunity to combat MAFLD, inhibition of JNK presents substantial challenges and potential risks due to its broad and multifaceted roles in many cellular processes. One key challenge is the dual role of JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamb et al., 2003</xref>). For instance, long-term JNK inhibition may disrupt liver regeneration, as JNK plays a critical role in liver repair by regulating hepatocyte proliferation and survival following injury or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Papa and Bubici, 2018</xref>). In HCC, it has been reported that JNK acts as both a tumor promoter, driving inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysregulation, and a tumor suppressor, facilitating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in damaged hepatocytes. Its inhibition, therefore, carries the risk of inadvertently promoting tumor progression under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the differential roles of JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, JNK3) and a lack of specificity of JNK inhibitors present another layer of complexity. Given these challenges, while our study demonstrated the potential of JNK-IN-5A in mitigating early metabolic dysfunction in the liver and adipose tissues, JNK targeting strategies should be carefully tailored to the disease stage under investigation. For curative approaches targeting advanced MAFLD, such as MASH, future studies are warranted to address considerations related to dosing, tissue specificity, and the long-term effects.</p><p>In summary, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential of JNK-IN-5A treatment in a rat model of sucrose-induced MAFLD. Through an analysis of genome-wide transcriptome data in the major metabolic tissues, we shed light on the JNK-IN-5A-mediated metabolic effects in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. This implies a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diet-induced MAFLD and other metabolic complications, potentially by regulating cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism. Nevertheless, several limitations warrant consideration. First, while we observed transcriptional adaptations in skeletal muscle tissue following treatment, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these changes and their roles in skeletal muscle function and systemic metabolic homeostasis remain unclear. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the muscle-specific effects of JNK inhibition. Second, our study did not investigate the dose-dependent or potential off-target effects of JNK-IN-5A, particularly its activity on other members of the kinase family and associated signaling pathways. Lastly, the long-term effects of JNK-IN-5A administration remain unexplored. Understanding its prolonged impact across different stages of MAFLD, including advanced MASH, is crucial for assessing the full therapeutic potential of JNK inhibition in the treatment of MAFLD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental models and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Oral toxicity study in rats</title><p>Twelve male and twelve female rats of the Wistar strain (Envigo, Venray, Netherlands) were used to assess the 7 d oral (gavage) toxicology, in terms of clinical signs, body weight, and clinical pathological parameters, of JNK-IN-5A in rats.

Dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg of JNK-IN-5A were administered once daily via oral gavage for 7 d. The vehicle was 2 w/w% HPMC (Colorcon), 2 w/w% PS80 (Merck) in 10 mM PBS, pH 7 and dose volume was 5 mL/kg for JNK-IN-5A.

The rats had ad libitum access to tap water (Control) or 10% sucrose water (sucrose, sucrose+JNK_D1, and sucrose+JNK_D2) and a standard chow diet throughout the experimental period. The amount of water consumed by all groups was recorded daily, and drinking water was renewed every day. After feeding with sucrose for 4 wk, drug treatment was given at the following 3 wk. Behavioral tests were taken before the experiment started and after 3 wk of drug treatment. Locomotor activity tests, elevated plus maze tests, and passive avoidance tests were used as behavioral tests. Behavioral tests were repeated at the end of the 21 d treatment regimen. While the last behavioral tests were being taken, drug treatment continued so that the drug level in the blood would not change. After the experimental animals were sacrificed with a high dose (200 mg/kg thiopental sodium) anesthetic, the relevant tissues were taken for further analysis.</p><sec id="s4-1-2-1"><title>Monitoring behavior</title><p>All tests were performed twice in total, initially and after the 21 d treatment regimen. According to the results obtained from the initial measurements, rats with outliers for the experiment were determined. After the treatment measurement, it was determined whether there was any change in the behavior of the rats. The Locomotor Activity Test is a system used to test differences in motor activity and anxiety-related behaviors of rats. In the system scanned with infrared rays, each of the ambulatory, stereotypical, rearings, resting percentage and traveled distance movements of the rats are digitized and converted to computer output. These outputs are evaluated and provide information that needs to be interpreted about the animal’s adaptation to the new environment and the continuation of the sense of curiosity or anxiety. Stereotypical movement shows rats grooming and recognizing their environment. Ambulatory movement is all the movements that rats make on the ground without standing up. Distance shows the distance traveled by the rats in the cage. The rearing movement indicates the time the rats stand up in the cage. The resting percentage is an indicator of anxiety. Ambulatory movements are recorded with horizontal sensors that surround the cage 360 degrees at the base, and stereotypic and rearing movements are recorded with vertical sensors located 10 cm above the floor. The entire cage continues to be measured continuously with 250 ms infrared. Unlike the open field test, activity measurement is performed in this study and the computer automatically records all the recordings instead of an independent observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). The experiment is performed in a dark environment. Rats are placed in cages for 10 min periods and the system automatically records with infrared rays. After each rat, the cage is cleaned with alcohol to remove odor and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferah Okkay et al., 2022</xref>). The Elevated Plus Maze Test is used to measure anxiety-like behavior in rodents. The elevated plus maze apparatus is a system consisting of two open arms (without walls; 50 cm × 10 cm) and two closed arms (with black walls, 50 cm × 10 cm). The open and closed arms are connected by a central platform. The labyrinth is 55 cm above the ground. At the start of each test, rats are placed in the central zone and allowed to explore the platform for 5 min. The rats are recorded with a camera located at the top of the maze and the test is done in a quiet, dim room. The number of times the rats entered the open and closed arms, and the time spent in these arms were recorded. The device was cleaned with an alcohol solution between tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chellian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). Results are given as arm entries and time spent (durations) in these areas. The more entries into open arms and the more duration spent there, the less anxiety the rat has. The Passive Avoidance Test is a system consisting of two rooms (light/dark), the base of which is covered with rods that can apply electroshock, in which memory, behavior, and learning abilities are investigated. This system is used to test the learning ability of the animal by fear-driven conditional avoidance. In this test, the animal is expected to learn to avoid entering the electroshock chamber (dark room). Rats are nocturnal animals. By nature, they sleep during the day and are active at night. Although rats are not afraid of light, they generally live in dark compartments because they are uncomfortable with the bright environment. In the passive avoidance system, lighting the bright compartment with LED lights and high lumen light creates an uncomfortable environment for the animals, and they want to move to the closed compartment. Here, the low intensity electroshock they are exposed to causes a deterrent stimulus and allows the rats to understand and learn how the system works. The experimental procedure is built on these understanding and learning abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giménez De Béjar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosseini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The experiment is carried out on two consecutive days. Learning is measured on the first day and recall on the second day. The time that each rat took to enter the dark compartment was considered as initial latency. The next day (retention phase), the rats were reintroduced into the bright chamber and the step-through latency was noted down as memory retention. Shorter latencies indicated poorer cognition. At this stage, rats are expected to remember the shock in the dark compartment. For this reason, it was accepted that the memory of the rats that stayed longer in the bright compartment was stronger. In retention measurements, it is understood that the longer the rats stay in the bright compartment, the stronger the memory and learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2-2"><title>RNA extraction and library preparation for transcriptome sequencing</title><p>Total RNA is extracted from the snap-frozen rat tissues with Zymo Research Quick RNA Miniprep kit (California USA) by following the protocol provided on the manufacturer’s website with slight modifications made to improve the quality and quantity of RNA from each tissue.

All results were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05, unless stated otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>funder and shareholder of ScandiEdge Therapeutics that provide financial support for the study</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Oral toxicity study in rats: All the animal procedures (including housing, health monitoring, dosing, etc.) and ethical revisions were performed according to the 2010/63/EU Directive on the protection of animals used for biomedical research.

They used multi-tissue network analysis to study the effects of the JNK inhibitor JNK-IN-5A on metabolic dysfunction associated with excessive sucrose consumption. Their results show that JNK inhibition reduces triglyceride accumulation and inflammation in the liver and adipose tissues while promoting metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle.

This will better contextualize the findings within the broader field of metabolic disease research.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agreed on this constructive suggestion to improve our understanding of the metabolic effect of JNK inhibition under sucrose overconsumption. While technical limitations made it challenging to directly analyze metabolites in the current study, we employed genome-scale metabolic modeling—a robust approach for studying metabolism—to predict the metabolic pathways potentially impacted by the interventions (Fig. 7 and Data S8). Additionally, as part of this revision, we conducted an extensive literature review to identify metabolites previously reported to be affected by sucrose consumption in MAFLD rodent models and MASLD patients. A detailed summary of these metabolites is now presented in attached Table 1 and several of these metabolites have been incorporated into the revised results section (Lines 308-314) to support some of the predicted metabolic activities.</p><p>“Some of the predicted metabolic changes align with previous findings in rodents subjected to sucrose overconsumption. For example, Öztürk et al. reported altered tryptophan metabolism, including decreased serum levels of kynurenic acid and kynurenine, in rats consuming 10% sucrose in drinking water. Similarly, increased triglyceride-bound oleate, palmitate, and stearate were observed in the livers of rats fed a 10% sucrose solution, indicating JNK-IN-5A treatment may regulate lipid metabolism by modulating these metabolic activities.”</p><p>It is important to note, however, that data on metabolites specifically affected by JNK inhibition in MASLD contexts remains lacking in the literature. The predicted metabolites and associated metabolic pathways in the current study could provide a starting point for such exploration in future studies. We have emphasized this in the revised manuscript and highlighted the need for further studies to explore these mechanisms in greater detail.</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolites associated with sucrose overconsumption in MASLD.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Study</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Intervention(s) and duration</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Metabolites</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Metabolism</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fujii et al., <break/>2024 [1].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male rats fed a 10% sucrose solution for 16 days</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased blood acetate and butyrate levels</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gut microbial metabolism, Lipid metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sun et al., <break/>2021 [2].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male Wistar rats fed high-sucrose diet for 4 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased butyrate and formate in the cecal content</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Song et al., <break/>2024 [3].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male Wistar rats fed a high sucrose diet for 4 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased acetate and butyrate; increased succinate in cecal content</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ramos-Romero et al., 2019 [4].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male Wistar rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution for 24 weeks.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Increased uric acid in urine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Urea cycle</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><break/>Field, 2023<break/>[5].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either low-fat diet or high-fat diet with 30% sucrose water for 8 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Elevated serum and kidney erythritol concentration</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Carbohydrate metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beckmann et al. 2015 [6].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Healthy females (n=90) consumed 0,50 , or 100 g sucrose in water, followed by urine and blood sampling at 0,3 , and 24 hours.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Increased erythronic acid in plasma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Carbohydrate metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">He et al., <break/>2023 [7].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high sucrose diet (30% sucrose in drinking water) for 24 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased muricholic acid level in the liver, cecal and colon content. increased hyocholic acid levels in the serum.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bile acid metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stephenson et al. 2022 [8].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mice fed 10% sucrose solution in drinking water for 12 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Increased triglyceridebound oleate, palmitate, and stearate in liver; Mixed alteration in serum bile acids pool (sex and treatment interaction effect)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipid metabolism and bile acid metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mock et al. <break/>2017 [9].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Female rats fed 13% sucrose solutions for 8 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Increased palmitoleic acid in gonadal and retroperitoneal fat pads; higher serum triglyceride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipid metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oztūrk et al. <break/>2022 [10].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wistar male rats fed 10% sucrose in drinking for 3 months</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased serum levels of kynurenic acid and kynurenine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tryptophan metabolism</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gariani, Karim, et al. 2016 [11].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a Western high-fat and highsucrose</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Decreased NAD* levels in the liver</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fatty acid oxidation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Togo et al., <break/>2019 [12].</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J mice fed liquid (50% by weigh) or solid sucrose for 8 weeks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Elevated hepatic fat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipid metabolism</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The limitations of the study should be clearly stated, particularly the lack of evidence on the effects of chronic JNK inhibitor treatment and potential off-target effects.

We have acknowledged limitations of the current study in Discussion section (Lines 397-406) of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Nevertheless, several limitations warrant consideration. First, while we observed transcriptional adaptations in skeletal muscle tissue following treatment, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these changes and their roles in skeletal muscle function and systemic metabolic homeostasis remain unclear. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the muscle-specific effects of JNK inhibition. Second, our study did not investigate the dosedependent or potential off-target effects of JNK-IN-5A, particularly its activity on other members of the kinase family and associated signaling pathways. Lastly, the long-term effects of JNKIN-5A administration remain unexplored. Understanding its prolonged impact across different stages of MAFLD, including advanced MASH, is crucial for assessing the full therapeutic potential of JNK inhibition in the treatment of MAFLD.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The potential risks of using JNK inhibitors in non-MAFLD conditions should be highlighted, with a clear distinction made between the preventive and curative effects of these therapies in mitigating MAFLD conditions. This will ensure the therapeutic implications are properly framed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. The potential risks of using JNK inhibitors in nonMAFLD conditions have been considered and are now highlighted in Lines 369-390 of the revised discussion</p><p>“Although overactivated JNK activity presents an attractive opportunity to combat MAFLD, inhibition of JNK presents substantial challenges and potential risks due to its broad and multifaceted roles in many cellular processes. One key challenge is the dual role of JNK signaling (Lamb et al., 2003). For instance, long-term JNK inhibition may disrupt liver regeneration, as JNK plays a critical role in liver repair by regulating hepatocyte proliferation and survival following injury or stress (Papa and Bubici, 2018). In HCC, it has been reported that JNK acts as both a tumor promoter, driving inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysregulation, and a tumor suppressor, facilitating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in damaged hepatocytes. Its inhibition, therefore, carries the risk of inadvertently promoting tumor progression under certain conditions (Seki et al., 2012). Furthermore, the differential roles of JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, JNK3) and a lack of specificity of JNK inhibitors present another layer of complexity. Given these challenges, while our study demonstrated the potential of JNK-IN-5A in mitigating early metabolic dysfunction in the liver and adipose tissues, JNK targeting strategies should be carefully tailored to the disease stage under investigation. For curative approaches targeting advanced MAFLD, such as MASH, future studies are warranted to address considerations related to dosing, tissue specificity, and the long-term effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statistical analysis section could be strengthened by providing a justification for the chosen statistical tests and discussing the study's power. Additionally, a more detailed breakdown of the behavioral test results and their implications would be beneficial for the overall conclusions of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank you for this constructive suggestion. In this study, differences among more than two groups were tested using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test based on the normality testing (Shapiro–Wilk test) on the data (continuous variables from different measurements). Pairwise comparisons, were performed using Tukey’s post hoc test following ANOVA or Dunn’s multiple comparisons post hoc test following the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate.</p><p>The study used 11 animals per group, a group size widely used in preclinical animal research [13]. To evaluate the power of this study design to detect group differences, we conducted a power analysis using G*Power 3.1 software [14], with ANOVA used as an example. The power analysis revealed the following:</p><p>- For a small effect size (partial eta.sq = 0.01), the power was 7.5% at 𝑝&lt;0.05.</p><p>- For a medium effect size (partial eta.sq = 0.06), the power was 23.7% at 𝑝&lt;0.05.</p><p>- For a large effect size (partial eta.sq = 0.14), the power is 55.4% at 𝑝&lt;0.05</p><p>Bonapersona et al. reported that the median statistical power in animal studies is often between 15–22% [15], the achieved power of the current study design is within the range observed in most exploratory animal research. However, we acknowledge that the power for detecting smaller effects within groups is limited, which is also a common challenge in animal research due to ethical considerations on increasing sample sizes.</p><p>As suggested, we’ve revised the ‘Statistical Analysis’ and ‘Result’ sections to improve clarity:</p><p>“Statistical Analysis:</p><p>Data were shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD), unless stated otherwise.

Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s post hoc test following the ANOVA or Dunn’s multiple comparisons post hoc test following the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. The Jaccard index was used to evaluate the similarity and diversity of two gene sets, and a hypergeometric test was used to test the significance of their overlap. All results were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05, unless stated otherwise.”</p><p>Behavior tests (Lines 150-157):</p><p>“We found no significant differences among groups in retention latencies, a measure of learning and memory abilities in passive avoidance test (Data S3). Additionally, the locomotor activity test was used to analyze behaviors such as locomotion, anxiety, and depression in rat. No significant differences were observed among groups in stereotypical movements, ambulatory activity, rearing, resting percentage, and distance travelled (Data S4). Similarly, the elevated plus maze test (Walf and Frye, 2007), an assay for assessing anxiety-like behavior in rodents, showed that rats in all groups had comparable open-arm entries and durations (Data S5). Collectively, the behavior tests indicate the JNK-IN-5A-treated rats exhibit no evidence of anxiety and behavior disorders.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Excessive sucrose is a possible initial factor for the development of metabolic dysfunctionassociated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). To investigate the possibility that intervention with JNK inhibitor could lead to the treatment of metabolic dysfunction caused by excessive sucrose intake, the authors performed multi-organ transcriptomics analysis (liver, visceral fat (vWAT), skeletal muscle, and brain) in a rat model of MAFLD induced by sucrose overtake (+ a selective JNK2 and JNK3 inhibitor (JNK-IN-5A) treatment). Their data suggested that changes in gene expression in the vWAT as well as in the liver contribute to the pathogenesis of their MAFLD model and revealed that the JNK inhibitor has a cross-organ therapeutic effect on it.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1)It has been previously reported that inhibition of JNK signaling can contribute to the prevention of hepatic steatosis (HS) and related metabolic syndrome in other models, but the role of JNK signaling in the metabolic disruption caused by excessive intake of sucrose, a possible initial factor for the development of MAFLD, has not been well understood, and the authors have addressed this point.</p><p>(2)This study is also important because pharmacological therapy for MAFLD has not yet been established.</p><p>(3)By obtaining transcriptomic data in multiple organs and comprehensively analyzing the data using gene co-expression network (GCN) analysis and genome-scale metabolic models (GEM), the authors showed the multi-organ interaction in not only in the pathology of MAFLD caused by excessive sucrose intake but also in the treatment effects by JNK-IN-5A.</p><p>(4) Since JNK signaling has diverse physiological functions in many organs, the authors effectively assessed possible side effects with a view to the clinical application of JNK-IN-5A.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The metabolic process activities were evaluated using RNA-seq results in Figure 7, but direct data such as metabolite measurements are lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these valuable insights. We fully agree that direct metabolite measurements would provide a deeper understanding of the metabolic impact of sucrose overconsumption and JNK-IN-5A administration. Unfortunately, due to technical limitations, we were unable to directly measure metabolites in this study. To address this, we supported our genome-scale metabolic modeling predictions with an extensive literature review, which is summarized in attached Table 1. This table highlights key metabolites and associated metabolic pathways that have been previously associated with sucrose overconsumption in MAFLD contexts. We incorporated some of these metabolites into the revised results section (Lines 308–314) to demonstrate the consistency between our predicted metabolic changes and experimental findings from the literature. For instance, studies have reported altered tryptophan metabolism, including decreased serum kynurenic acid and kynurenine levels, as well as increased triglyceride-bound oleate, palmitate, and stearate in sucrose-fed rodents. These findings align with our predictions of altered metabolic activities in fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and tryptophan metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a lack of consistency in the data between JNK-IN-5A_D1 and _D2, and there is no sufficient data-based explanation for why the effects observed in D1 were inconsistent in the D2 samples.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point regarding the differences between the two dosages. As this was not the primary focus of the current study and we do not have sufficient data to fully explain these observations. Our speculation is that this may arise from pharmacokinetic differences associated with the dosing of this small molecule inhibitor, including potential saturation of transport mechanisms, alter tissue distribution, or off-target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although it is valuable that the authors were able to suggest the possibility of JNK inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy for MAFLD, the evaluation of the therapeutic effect was limited to the evaluation of plasma TG, LDH, and gene expression changes.

However, as you noted, our transcriptional and systems-wide investigation across multiple tissues provides novel and significant insights into the molecular and systemic impacts of JNK-IN-5A treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It would be useful to explain why the authors conducted their research using female rats but not male rats.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this insightful point. We chose female rats for the current study was based on several considerations. (1) Previous research has demonstrated that female rats exhibit metabolic dysfunction (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, liver steatosis, insulin resistance) in response to dietary factors, such as high-sucrose feeding [16-19]. These metabolic characteristics made them an appropriate model for assessing the in vivo effects of JNK inhibition under high-sucrose conditions. (2) It is also reported that female rats show resilience to high-sucrose-induced metabolic dysfunction due to the protective effects of estrogen [8], we aimed to determine whether JNK inhibition could provide therapeutic benefits in this context. This allows us to evaluate the effect of JNK inhibition even in metabolically advantaged groups. (3) Our results from the tolerance test (Fig. 2a) indicated that female rats displayed more fluctuating variation to JNK-IN-5A administration. This variation allowed us to evaluate how JNK inhibition influences metabolic outcomes in a sex that is more responsive to the intervention. Nonetheless, we emphasize the importance of future studies involving male rats to better understand sex-specific responses to JNK inhibition and to provide more comprehensive guidance for the development of JNK-targeting therapies in MAFLD treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2C shows that JNK-IN-5A administration reduces the mRNA levels of Mapk8 and Mapk9 in the liver and the SkM. It would be useful to provide the authors' insight into the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the liver, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref> in original submission and the attached Fig. 1 show that sucrose feeding induces opposite alterations in the mRNA expression of <italic>Mapk8</italic> (<italic>Jnk1</italic>, increased, log2FC<sub>SucrosevsControl</sub> = 0.02) and <italic>Mapk9</italic> (<italic>Jnk2</italic>, decreased, log2FC<sub>SucrosevsControl</sub> = -0.43), though these changes do not reach statistical significance. JNK-IN-5A administration reverses these effects, significantly decreasing <italic>Mapk8</italic> expression (log2FC<sub>Sucrose+JNK_D1vsSucrose</sub> = -0.37) while increasing <italic>Mapk9</italic> expression (log2FC<sub>Sucrose+JNK_D1vsSucrose</sub> = 0.42). This suggests potential differential yet compensatory roles of these two isoforms in regulating JNK activity during these interventions in the liver, keeping in line with the findings from <italic>Jnk1</italic>- and/or <italic>Jnk2</italic>-specific knockout studies [20, 21]. Additionally, emerging evidence indicates that <italic>Jnk1</italic> plays a major role in diet-induced liver fibrosis and metabolic dysfunction [22-25]. Therefore, the reduced <italic>Mapk8</italic> expression following JNK-IN-5A administration may contribute to the observed improvements in liver metabolism.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The spearman correlation between expression levels of <italic>Mapk8.</italic></title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98427-sa3-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In skeletal muscle, the primary site for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, insulin signaling is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis [26]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that JNK activation promotes insulin resistance and targeting JNK might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metabolic diseases associated with insulin resistance, such as MAFLD [24]. In our study, while sucrose overconsumption did not significantly alter the mRNA levels of JNK isoforms in this tissue, JNK-IN-5A at dosage 30 mg/kg/day administration significantly reduced the expression of both <italic>Jnk1</italic> and <italic>Jnk2</italic> as well as genes involved in insulin signaling (Fig. 5). This suggests a potential interplay between JNK inhibition and insulin signaling pathways in the skeletal muscle, where inhibition of JNK activity may improve insulin sensitivity by modulating these pathways. However, it is also crucial to investigate the longterm effects of JNK-IN-5A administration and its broader impact on many other physiological processes regulated by the JNK pathway. These aspects will be a focus of our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The notations a and b in Figure S5 are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive comment.
