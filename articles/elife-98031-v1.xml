gyrus (DG) including spatial, limbic and sensory information. Excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways of the EC connecting to granule cells of the DG play a role in memory encoding and information processing and are deeply affected in humans suffering Alzheimer’s disease and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing to the dysfunctions found in these pathologies. The plasticity of these synapses is not well known yet, as are not known the forms of long-term depression (LTD) existing at those connections. We investigated whether spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists at these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice, and whether they have different action mechanisms. We have found two different forms of t-LTD, at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses and characterised their cellular and intracellular mechanistic requirements. We found that both forms of t-LTD are expressed presynaptically and that whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not require NMDAR, t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR containing GluN2A subunits. The two forms of t-LTD require different group I mGluR, mGluR5 LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 MPP-GC synapses. In addition, both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB<sub>1</sub>R, astrocyte activity, and glutamate released by astrocytes. Thus, we discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Plasticity</kwd><kwd>LTD</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>NMDARs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-107677GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Moreno</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2022-136597NB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Moreno</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name><name><surname>Martínez-Gallego</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011011</institution-id><institution>Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20-0881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Moreno</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Society of Neurochemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Visiting Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coatl-Cuaya</surname><given-names>Heriberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Gallego</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two different forms of brain plasticity require astrocytes and show different action mechanisms at enthorrinal cortex hippocampal synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) conveys spatial, limbic and sensory information to the hippocampus, a structure responsible for important activities in the brain including learning, memory and spatial information coding. Excitatory projections from the EC to the dentate gyrus (DG) play a role in memory encoding, and they are affected in humans suffering from Alzheimer Disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing critically to these pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paré et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llorens-Martín et al., 2014</xref>). In rodents, evidence suggests that the lateral perforant pathway (LPP) conveys more sensory related information, whereas the medial perforant pathway (MPP) conveys information related to spatial location and limbic signals that are involved in attention and motivation. Evidence suggests that LPP- and MPP-GC synapses have distinct electrophysiological properties, these differences potentially affecting the functional processing of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krueppel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, these functional differences probably reflect their distinct inputs, as they contact the outer (LPP) or middle (MPP) third of the molecular layer of the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paré et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>). Significantly, MPP-GC synapses are associated with a higher probability of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Min et al., 1998</xref>) and the existence and/or activity of presynaptic NMDARs, which differs between the two types of fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, LPP and MPP synapses appear to influence pathological changes distinctly, with the former showing changes in release probability in models of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scimemi et al., 2006</xref>), preferential β-amyloid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reilly et al., 2003</xref>), earlier susceptibility to AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) and reduced plasticity with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Froc et al., 2003</xref>). The mechanistic bases of these differences are virtually unknown and they pose a challenge when attempting to understand circuit-specific biological computations, as well as the susceptibility to pathological insults. In addition, the forms of plasticity at these synapses remain unclear and the limited studies into plasticity available did not distinguish between these two pathways.</p><p>Plasticity drives the organization of cortical maps during development, and it underlies learning and memory (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mateos-Aparicio and Rodríguez-Moreno, 2019</xref>). The most extensively studied forms of plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission. Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a Hebbian form of long-term synaptic plasticity found in all known nervous systems, from insects to humans. Indeed, STDP appears to be a synaptic mechanism that underlies circuit remodelling during development, and it is thought to be involved in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman, 2012</xref>). In STDP, the relative order and millisecond timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials (spikes/APs) determine the direction and magnitude of the synaptic changes. Thus, spike timing-dependent LTP (t-LTP) occurs when a postsynaptic spike follows a presynaptic spike within ms, whereas spike timing-dependent LTD (t-LTD) is induced when this order is reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman, 2012</xref>). In addition, in vivo studies have suggested modifications to LTP and LTD after mice undertake behavioural tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is surprising that while plasticity of EC-DG granule cell (GC) synapses has been studied using classical protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Froc et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>), no information exists as to whether t-LTP or t-LTD can be induced at these synapses.</p><p>Here we studied t-LTD at PP-GC synapses, differentiating the lateral and medial pathways, determining whether these individual synapses are subject to t-LTD and the mechanisms involved. As a result, we identified two different forms of presynaptic t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses. Unlike LPP-GC synapses, the t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDARs that contain GluN2A subunits, and the t-LTD at each type of synapse require different group I mGluRs, with LPP-GC synapses dependent on mGluR5 and MPP-GC t-LTD requiring mGluR1. In addition, we found that both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) signalling, astrocytes and glutamate. Hence, we describe here two novel forms of presynaptic t-LTD in the brain at EC-GC synapses with different action mechanisms, probably implicated in the different aspects of information processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pairing presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low frequency can induce t-LTD at mouse lateral and medial perforant pathway-dentate gyrus granule cell synapses</title><p>We initially determined whether spike timing-dependent LTD can be induced at perforant pathway-DG GC synapses by pairing presynaptic stimulation with single postsynaptic spikes at low frequency (0.2 Hz) in slices from P13-21 mice. We used a post-pre protocol, pairing a single postsynaptic spike followed 18ms later by presynaptic stimulation 100 times, as described previously at cortical (L4-L2/3) and hippocampal (SC-CA1) synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martínez-Gallego et al., 2022a</xref>). We monitored the EPSPs evoked by extracellular stimulation of the LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, which make synaptic contacts with the distal and medial third of the dendritic arbour of hippocampal DG GCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). EPSPs were recorded from GCs using the current clamp mode of the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and k</xref>). A post-before-pre pairing protocol induced robust t-LTD at both LPP-GC (63 ± 5 %, n=14: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (59 ± 5 %, n=14: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l and m</xref>), while unpaired control pathways remained unaffected (103 ± 4% and 105 ± 7%, respectively: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c, l and m</xref>). We repeated the experiments at LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blockers (bicuculline, 10 µM and SCH50911, 20 µM, respectively) to determine whether they have a role in this form of t-LTD. In these experimental conditions, t-LTD was not affected at these synapses, indicating that these receptors are not necessary for t-LTD induction (LPP-GC: Control t-LTD: 67 ± 6%, n=6; Bicuculline + SCH50911: 69 ± 11%, n=6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As we observed failures in synaptic transmission at both types of synapses, we analysed these and found that the number of failures increased consistently after t-LTD at both LPP-GC (from 43 ± 7% at baseline to 76 ± 6% after t-LTD, n=8: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (from 40 ± 5% at baseline to 59 ± 4% after t-LTD, n=6: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1n</xref>), suggesting a presynaptic mechanism. We then analysed the PPR at baseline and 30 min after the pairing protocol, identifying a significant increase in the PPR after t-LTD at both LPP-GC (from 1.16±0.11 at baseline to 1.67±0.19 after t-LTD, n=14: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (from 1.17±0.11 at baseline to 1.81 ± 0.15% after t-LTD, n=14: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>), again suggesting a presynaptic expression of these two forms of t-LTD. Third, we estimated the noise-subtracted CV of the synaptic responses before and after t-LTD induction. A plot of CV<sup>–2</sup> versus the change in the mean evoked EPSP slope (M) before and after t-LTD mainly yielded points below the diagonal line at LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses (LPP-GC: Mean = 0.607 ± 0.054 vs 1/CV<sup>2</sup>=0.439 ± 0.096, R<sup>2</sup>=0.337; n=14) and MPP-GC (Mean = 0.596 ± 0.056 vs 1/CV<sup>2</sup>=0.461 ± 0.090, R<sup>2</sup>=0.168; n=13). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and p</xref>, consistent with a modification of the release parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brock et al., 2020</xref> for review). Finally, we recorded and analysed the miniature responses (mEPSP). We performed the experiments in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 300 nM) to avoid action potentials, before and after t-LTD, adding TTX at the baseline (we added TTX and started to record mEPSP after10 min. of TTX in the bath for additional 10 min) and washing it out for 30 min before performing the t-LTD experiment (we recorded EPSP for 10 min as a baseline after 30 min TTX washout, then applied the t-LTD protocol and then recorded EPSP for additional 30 min), and then added TTX again after t-LTD to record mEPSP for other 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>). This experimental approach serves to determine whether the frequency and amplitude of mEPSP change because of the induction of t-LTD. Under these conditions, a t-LTD similar to previous experiments was evident at both types of synapse (LPP-GC synapses 55 ± 11%, n=6; MPP-GC synapses 67 ± 8%, n=7), and we found that the frequency of mEPSPs decreased at both types of synapse after t-LTD induction: LPP-GC - baseline 1.4±0.13 Hz, after t-LTD induction 0.7±0.09 Hz, n=6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>); and MPP-GC - baseline 1.2±0.1 H, after t-LTD induction 0.7±0.07 Hz, n=8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1q and r</xref>). No effect on mEPSP amplitude was evident at any of these synapses: LPP-GC - baseline 1.13±0.09, after t-LTD 1.13±0.02 mV, n=5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>); MPP-GC - baseline 1.03±0.07, after t-LTD 1.00±0.09 mV, n=6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1s, t</xref>). These results again suggest a presynaptic locus for t-LTD expression. Hence, together these results are consistent with a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release and they are indicative of a presynaptic locus for these two forms of t-LTD at both types of synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Presynaptic t-LTD requires NMDARs at MPP-GC but not at LPP-GC synapses</title><p>Different forms of t-LTD have been shown to require NMDARs at cortical synapses and in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether the two forms of t-LTD studied here require NMDARs, we treated slices with the NMDAR antagonists D-AP5 (50 µM) or MK-801 (500 µM), completely blocking NMDARs and NMDAR-mediated currents (D-AP5: from 57±8 to 6±5 pA, n=5; MK-801: from 63±9 to 7±5 pA, n=5). In these experimental conditions, t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses was not affected by these antagonists (D-AP5 66 ± 4%, n=8; MK-801 62 ± 9%, n=6; interleaved controls 60 ± 6%, n=8: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>), whereas t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses was blocked in slices treated with either D-AP5 (90 ± 7 %, n=10) or MK-801 (107 ± 10 %, n=6) relative to the interleaved controls (60 ± 7 %, n=8: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>).

To determine whether glutamate, probably released by astrocytes, is required for t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, we repeated the experiments in slices from dnSNARE mutant mice but applying glutamate puffs (100 µM) in the proximity of the astrocytes and neurons under study. In these experimental conditions, t-LTD, which was not evident in untreated dnSNARE mice (LPP-GC synapses 95 ± 5%, n=7; MPP-GC synapses 109 ± 6%, n=6) was fully recovered at both LPP-GC (72 ± 11 %, n=6: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>) and MPP-GC synapses (70 ± 8 %, n=6: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i and j</xref>) relative to the control interleaved slices from WT mice (LPP-GC synapses 62 ± 8%, n=7; MPP-GC synapses 64 ± 5%, n=7).

Interestingly, t-LTD induction at MPP-GC synapses but not at LPP-GC synapses depends on presynaptic NMDARs containing GluN2A subunits. In addition, mGluRs are required for t-LTD at both types of PP-DG synapses, although LPP-GC synapses require mGluR5 activation and MPP-GC synapses require mGluR1 activity. These two forms of presynaptic t-LTD require postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from postsynaptic intracellular stores and whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses, requires calcineurin phosphatase activity; this is not the case at MPP-GC synapses.

Our results are consistent with the presence of NMDARs at MPP-GC synapses, in our case participating in LTD. Indeed, t-LTD is not present at MPP-GC synapses in the presence of D-AP5, and the presence of presynaptic NMDARs at MPP-GC synapses was demonstrated previously by immunogold labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). At these synapses, t-LTD was also blocked when MK801 was present in the bath but not when it was loaded into the postsynaptic neuron, indicating that the NMDARs necessary for t-LTD are not postsynaptic, as seen in L4-L2/3 synapses of the somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nevian and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodríguez-Moreno and Paulsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rodríguez-Moreno et al., 2013</xref>) and visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>) cortices.

Thus, the involvement of NMDARs is one important difference between LPP- and MPP-GC synapses that may account for at least some of the physiological differences described between these two pathways. By using antagonists with different NMDAR subunit specificities, we also found that the NMDARs required for t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses contain GluN2A but not GluN2B or GluN2C/D subunits. NMDARs that enhance glutamate release or that participate in LTP at PP-GC synapses are thought to contain GluN2B subunits in rats as their effect is blocked by ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). However, ifenprodil or Ro25698 had no effect on t-LTD here, such that the preNMDARs containing GluN2B subunits that participate in LTP and enhance glutamate release may differ from those participating in t-LTD, and there may even be differences between the species (i.e.: rat and mouse).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Presynaptic t-LTD at lateral and medial perforant pathway-dentate gyrus granule cell synapses requires mGluRs</title><p>While both forms of t-LTD described here appear to require group I mGluRs, they require different ones: mGluR5 at LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 at MPP-GC contacts.

This is similar to the LTD induced by LFS in DG GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang and Kelly, 1997</xref>). Our data also implies an involvement of calcineurin in t-LTD induction at LPP-GC synapses but not at MPP-GC synapses, an additional striking difference between these two types of synapses. Protein phosphatases, including calcineurin, may be required for different forms of LTD, both in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mulkey et al., 1994</xref>) and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Torii et al., 1995</xref>). Future experiments will determine the exact mechanism by which calcineurin mediates t-LTD at LPP but not at MPP-GC synapses. What is clear for the moment is that while the requirements for Ca<sup>2+</sup> seem to be similar at both LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is only involved in t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses.

Astrocytes participate in synaptic potentiation at PP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>), although little is known about the contribution of astrocytes to LTD. Thus, this is the first demonstration of the participation of astrocytes in LTD at these synapses. Interestingly, and as found in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>), glutamate is required to mediate t-LTD induction at both types of PP-GC synapses, and in fact, t-LTD is impaired when astrocytes were loaded with Evans blue and recovered by the local application of glutamate at both LPP- and MPP-GC synapses in slices from dnSNARE mice that do not develop t-LTD otherwise. These findings agree with previous studies showing that astrocytes can release glutamate that reaches the NMDARs located in the presynaptic boutons at PP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bezzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>), influencing synaptic transmission at MPP-GC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>).

While it is possible that glutamate from the presynaptic neuron also activates preNMDARs and mGluRs, the amount of glutamate released by presynaptic terminals may be insufficient to drive t-LTD, and hence, glutamate released from astrocytes may be required for t-LTD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>What is the physiological role of these forms of plasticity?</title><p>For the moment, the exact role of STDP in the perforant cortex or in the hippocampus is not known, and more work is necessary to specifically determine functions for t-LTP and t-LTD.

As a Hebbian learning rule, t-LTP should occur when the spike order is pre-before-post, strengthening those connections in which the presynaptic neuron takes part in firing the postsynaptic cell, as predicted by Hebb, whereas t-LTD occurs when the spike order is reversed, so that non-causal spiking weakens the connections involved, possibly as a first step in the elimination of those connections during development as has been suggested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bush et al., 2010</xref>).

Why some synapses, like L4-L2/3 synapses at somatosensory cortex (and as observed in the hippocampus at CA3-CA1 synapses), show pre- and/or post-synaptic plasticity requires further study. Interestingly, in the synapses studied here, t-LTD of LPP-GC and MPP-GC synapses have different requirements, indicating that the presynaptic expression of plasticity is fundamental for the correct functioning of brain circuits and it is possible that different presynaptic forms of t-LTD from synapses onto the same neuron (as pre- and postsynaptic forms of LTD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>) are regulated differently. Presynaptically expressed forms of t-LTD may in fact control the trial-to-trial reliability, and they may induce a larger change in signal-to-noise ratio than postsynaptic changes alone, as described in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Froemke et al., 2013</xref>). Broad-ranging input representations from the EC transmitted via the PP are sparse, and the DG processes this information and converts it into a less well-correlated output to become less similar and more specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borzello et al., 2023</xref>). Whether t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses described here are involved in this important process require further research and the different cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in t-LTD at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses may account for some of the difference in their physiological influence. Notwithstanding this, the potential behavioural influence of the presynaptic forms of LTD studied here is still an emerging issue of particular interest in the near future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethical approval</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU regarding the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and they were approved by the Ethics Committee at the Universidad Pablo de Olavide and that of the Andalusian Government. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Spain) and P13–21 (P, post-natal day) mice of either sex were used. Animals were kept at temperatures between 18 and 24 °C on a continuous 12 hr light/dark cycle, and at 40–60% humidity, with ad libitum access to food and water. In some experiments, dominant-negative (dn) SNARE mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pascual et al., 2005</xref>) of the same age were used. These mice were not fed with doxycycline from birth and the transgenes were continuously expressed. In these mice, the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP) promoter mediates the specific expression of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) in astrocytes, which in turn activates the tetracycline responsive element operator and drives the cytosolic expression of VAMP2/synaptobrevin II in these cells, along with the enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). Expression of the dnSNARE transgene interferes with the formation of the SNARE complex, blocking exocytosis and impairing vesicle release by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sultan et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Hippocampal slices were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade-Talavera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falcón-Moya et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%), decapitated, and their whole brain was removed and placed in an ice-cold ACSF solution (pH 7.2, 300 mOsm*L<sup>–1</sup>) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 glucose. Slices (350 µm thick: Leica VT1000S Vibratome) were maintained oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in the same solution for at least 1 hr before use. Experiments were carried out at 33–34°C and during the experiments; the slices were superfused continuously with the same solution indicated above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of DG GCs were obtained under visual guidance by infrared differential interference contrast microscopy. The identity of the neurons was verified by their characteristic voltage response to a current step protocol applied in current-clamp configuration using a patch-clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700B), and acquiring the data with pCLAMP 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Patch-clamp electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubes and had a resistance of 4–7 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution consisting in (in mM, pH 7.2–7.3, 290 mOsm L<sup>−1</sup>): potassium gluconate, 110; HEPES, 40; NaCl, 4; ATP-Mg, 4; and GTP, 0.3. Only cells with a stable resting membrane potential below −55 mV were assessed, and the cell recordings were excluded from the analysis if the series resistance changed by &gt;15%. All recordings were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz. For plasticity experiments, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked alternately at 0.2 Hz in two input pathways, test and control, by using two monopolar stimulating electrodes placed 200–400 µm from the cell soma. Stimulating electrodes were situated on fibres contacting the distal and medial third of the dendritic arbour of GCs, corresponding to LPP- and MPP-GC synapses, respectively. Stimulation was adjusted (200 µs, 0.1–0.2 mA) to obtain an EPSP peak amplitude of 3–5 mV in control conditions. Pathway independence was ensured by the lack of cross-facilitation when the pathways were stimulated alternately at 50ms intervals. Plasticity was assessed through the changes in the EPSP slope, measured in its rising phase as a linear fit between time points corresponding to 25–30% and 70–75% of the peak amplitude under control conditions. Miniature responses were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 300 nM). Astrocytes were identified by their morphology under differential interference contrast microscopy, and were characterized by low membrane potential (–81±0.6 mV, n=55), low membrane resistance (20±0.3 MΩ, n=55) and passive responses (they do not show action potentials) to both negative and positive current injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Plasticity protocols</title><p>After establishing a stable basal EPSP over 10 min, the test input was paired 100 times with a single postsynaptic spike. The single postsynaptic spike was evoked by a brief somatic current pulse (5ms, 0.1–0.5 pA), whereas the control pathway was left unstimulated during the pairing period. To induce t-LTD, a postsynaptic AP was evoked 18ms before the onset of the EPSP. EPSP slopes were monitored for at least 30 min after the pairing protocol, and the presynaptic stimulation frequency remained constant throughout the experiment. In some experiments, glutamate or WIN 55, 212–2 ‘puffs’ were applied using a Picospritzer (Parker Hannifin), expulsing glutamate or WIN55,212–2 dissolved in the external solution through a micropipette over an astrocyte in proximity to the LPP-GC or MPP-GC synapses at a pressure of 10 psi for 50–200ms. In each experiment, 100 glutamate or WIN55,212–2 puffs were applied to the recording neuron at 0.2 Hz at baseline, 18ms before the onset of the EPSP, which did not affect patch clamping. The EPSP slopes were then monitored for 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drugs</title><p>The following agents were purchased from: Sigma-Aldrich - BAPTA, Zinc chloride, and the compounds used to prepare the ACSF and current clamp internal solutions; and Tocris Bioscience - MK-801 maleate, D-AP5, TTX, PPDA, Ro 25–6981 maleate, L-glutamic acid, MPEP, LY367385, LY341495, AM251, Orlistat (THL), Evans blue, WIN 55,212–2, FK506, Nimodipine, Thapsigargin, Ifenprodil, ruthenium red, bicuculline, SCH50911 and NBQX.

They find that these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice show a presynaptically expressed form of long-term depression (LTD) requiring postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB1R activation, astrocyte activity, and metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. Interestingly, LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR activation whereas LTD at LPP-GC synapse is NMDAR independent. Thus, they discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses. Although plasticity of EC-DG granule cell (GC) synapses has been studied using classical protocols, These are the first analyses of the synaptic plasticity induced by spike timing dependent protocols at these synapses. Interestingly, the data also indicate that t-LTD at each type of synapse require different group I mGluRs, with LPP-GC synapses dependent on mGluR5 and MPP-GC t-LTD requiring mGluR1.</p><p>The authors performed a detailed analysis of the coefficient of variation of the EPSP slopes, miniature responses and different approaches (failure rate, PPRs, CV, and mEPSP frequency and amplitude analysis) they demonstrate a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release and a presynaptic locus for these two forms of LTD at both types of synapses. By using elegant electrophysiological experiments and taking the advantage of the conditional dominant-negative (dn) SNARE mice in which doxycycline administration blocks exocytosis and impairs vesicle release by astrocytes, they demonstrate that both LTD forms require the release of gliotransmitters from astrocytes.

In BAPTA-treated astrocytes and in dnSNARE mice, t-LTD was prevented. Notwithstanding this, and as suggested by the reviewer, we used two additional approaches to confirm astrocyte participation. We loaded astrocytes with the light chain of the tetanus toxin (TeTxLC), which is known to block exocytosis by cleaving the vesicle-associated membrane protein, an important part of the SNARE complex (Schiavo et al., 1992, Nature 359, 832-835).

Nevertheless, this new data suggests that mechanistic differences in the induction of t-LTD at these two DG synapses could contribute to the differences in the physiological influence of the LPP and MPP pathways.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Coatl et al. investigated the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity of two important hippocampal synapses, the excitatory afferents from lateral and medial perforant pathways (LPP and MPP, respectively) of the entorhinal cortex (EC) connecting to granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). They find that these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice show a presynaptically expressed form of long-term depression (LTD) requiring postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB1R activation, astrocyte activity, and metabotropic glutamate receptor activation. Interestingly, LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR activation whereas LTD at LPP-GC synapse is NMDAR independent. Thus, they discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses. Although plasticity of EC-DG granule cell (GC) synapses has been studied using classical protocols, These are the first analysis of the synaptic plasticity induced by spike timing dependent protocols at these synapses. Interestingly, the data also indicate that t-LTD at each type of synapse require different group I mGluRs, with LPP-GC synapses dependent on mGluR5 and MPP-GC t-LTD requiring mGluR1.</p><p>The authors performed a detailed analysis of the coefficient of variation of the EPSP slopes, miniature responses and different approaches (failure rate, PPRs, CV, and mEPSP frequency and amplitude analysis) they demonstrate a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release and a presynaptic locus for these two forms of LTD at both types of synapses. By using elegant electrophysiological experiments and taking advantage of the conditional dominant-negative (dn) SNARE mice in which doxycycline administration blocks exocytosis and impairs vesicle release by astrocytes, they demonstrate that both LTD forms require the release of gliotransmitters from astrocytes. These data add in an interesting way to the ongoing discussion on whether LTD induced by STDP participates in refining synapses potentially weakening excitatory synapses under the control of different astrocytic networks. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects the results must be clarified and extended.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our work and the constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) It should be clarified whether present results are obtained with or without the functional inhibitory synapse activation. It is not clear if GABAergic synapses are blocked or not. If GABAergic synapses are not blocked authors must discuss whether the LTD of the EPSPs is due to a decrease in glutamatergic receptor activation or an increase in GABAergic receptor activation. Moreover, it should be recommended to analyze not only the EPSPs but also the EPSCs to address whether the decrease in synaptic transmission is caused by a decrease in the input resistance or by a decrease in the space constant (lambda).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for rising these points. GABAergic inhibition was not blocked in our experiments. The observed forms of t-LTD seem to be due to a decrease in glutamate release probability as indicated in the manuscript, mediated by the mechanism we uncover and describe here. To determine and clarify whether GABA receptors have any role in these forms of t-LTD, we repeated the experiments in the presence of the GABAA and GABAB receptors antagonists bicuculline and SCH50911, respectively. Blocking GABA receptors do not prevent or affect t-LTD at LPP- or MPP-GC synapses, that is still present and with a similar magnitude that controls. These results indicating that these receptors are not involved in these forms of t-LTD. These results are now included in the text in the results section (page 8) and as a new figure S1. In our experiments, no changes in input resistance or space constant were observed, and importantly, no changes were observed in the amplitude/slopes of EPSP in the control pathway that does not undergo plasticity protocol that we routinely use in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Authors show that Thapsigargin loaded in the postsynaptic neuron prevents the induction of LTD at both synapses. Analyzing the effects of blocking postsynaptic IP3Rs (Heparin in the patch pipette) and Ryanodine receptors (Ruthenium red in the patch pipette) is recommended for a deeper analysis of the mechanism implicated in the induction of this novel forms of LTD in the hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We repeated the experiments loading the postsynaptic cell with heparin and ruthenium red using the path pipette. In these experimental conditions, we observed that t-LTD was not affected by the heparin treatment (discharging a role of IP3Rs), but that it was prevented by the ruthenium red treatment (indicating the requirement of ryanodine receptors). We include now this data in the text (page 12) and in the Figure 3a, b, e, f.</p><p>(3) Authors nicely demonstrate that CB1R activation is required in these forms of LTD by blocking CB1Rs with AM251, however an interesting unanswered question is whether CB1R activation is sufficient to induce this synaptic plasticity. This reviewer suggests studying whether applying puffs of the CB1R agonist, WIN 55,212-2, could induce these forms of LTD.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We repeated the experiments adding WIN55, 212-2 as suggested. The activation of CB1R by puffs of the agonist WIN 55, 212-2 to the astrocyte, directly induced LTD at both LPP- and MPP-GC synapses. We include now this data in the text (page 14) and in the Figure 3c, d, g, h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, adding a last figure with a cartoon summarizing the proposed model of action in these novel forms of LTD would add a positive value and would help the reading of the manuscript, especially in those aspects related with the discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

To strengthen the evidence that astrocytes are key regulators of t-LTD at MPP and LPP GC synapses by regulating SNARE protein-dependent glutamate release, additional complementary approaches should be considered, such as other mouse models enabling the control of SNARE-dependent exocytosis and/or optogenetic/chemogenetic tools to selectively manipulate astrocytes during the induction of t-LTD, thereby directly assessing the impact of astrocytic activity on synaptic plasticity. Implementing calcium imaging or glutamate sensors to visualize the dynamics of astrocytic calcium signaling and glutamate release during t-LTD could be also considered.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

NMDA currents has been recorded at +40 mV, blocking AMPAR and GABAR with NBQX and bicuculline. Related to the concentration, it has been described that the affinity from the internal site is much lower (several orders of magnitude) than from the extracellular side(Sun et al., 2018 Neuropharmacology, 143, 122-129) and the concentrations used have been extensively used in previous studies.

In experiment Figure a-h, it is not clear how the authors recognize astrocytes to patch. No details are provided in the methods or in the main text. If we understand correctly, it is only by performing a current steps protocol to ensure that the patched cell did not produce action potentials. If this was the case, the authors need to be more specific and provide details of this protocol. More importantly, the one trace that was provided in Figures 4a and 4f suggests, albeit by a rough estimation that we made with a ruler, that the highest current step only depolarized the cell to about -40 mV. This is not sufficient to ensure that the recorded cell is not a neuron. The authors should increase their steps to high depolarizing currents to ensure that the patched cell is not a neuron. Better yet, they should load the cell with an dye to process the slice after the electrophysiological recording for immunohistochemistry to ensure that it was indeed an astrocyte.
