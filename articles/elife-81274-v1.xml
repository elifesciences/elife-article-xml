For T cells, specificity is mediated by T-cell receptors (TCRs), which interact with peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules through their complementary-determining-region-3 (CDR3). TCRs are formed by rearrangements between hundreds of gene segments at the alpha and beta loci, theoretically generating &gt;10<sup>60</sup> possible sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy and Weaver, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murugan et al., 2012</xref>). Each rearrangement has its probability of generation, which has been modeled to vary by about 10 orders of magnitude for the beta chain alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradley and Thomas, 2019</xref>). During their development within the thymus, T cells undergo a selection largely based on the strength of their activation by thymic antigen-presenting cells that eliminates &gt;80% of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vrisekoop et al., 2014</xref>). For each individual, this process releases a pool of T cells expressing a repertoire of approximately 10<sup>8</sup> unique TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How evolution shaped a process that selects cells that would efficiently respond to antigens that are not yet present, that is, from an infectious agent to come, is a central question of immunology. The paradigm is that the production and selection of a diverse enough repertoire of TCRs should always provide a proper, though rare, specificity for any given need. Expansion of such rare T cells would then provide enough fighters for an effective immune response and later enough antigen-experienced cells for immune memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis and Bjorkman, 1988</xref>). Thus, it is widely accepted that ‘<italic>T-cell-mediated immunity to infection is due to the proliferation and differentiation of rare clones in the preimmune repertoire that by chance express TCRs specific for peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands derived from the microorganism</italic>’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, this theory is challenged by overlooked data questioning the essence of specificity. First, a child with an X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who had a reverse mutation in a single T-cell progenitor was protected from infections despite having a very restricted repertoire of only about 1000 different TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bousso et al., 2000</xref>). How such a repertoire (10<sup>–5</sup> of a normal repertoire size) could handle the numerous infections occurring during childhood awaits explanation. Second, robust experimental and epidemiological data have highlighted the importance of heterologous immunity, that is, immunity to one pathogen afforded by the exposure to unrelated pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Welsh and Selin, 2002</xref>). Likewise, for example, (i) memory T cells that are specific for one virus can become activated during infection with an unrelated virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verhoeven et al., 2008</xref>), (ii) there are numerous virus-specific memory phenotype T cells in unexposed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Su et al., 2013</xref>), (iii) CMV infection enhances the immune response to influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furman et al., 2015</xref>), and (iv) tumor-resident memory HBV-specific T-cell responses correlate with hepatocellular carcinoma outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that high-resolution sequencing of the TCR repertoire of developing thymocytes and peripheral T cells would yield insights into repertoire selection and function toward pathogens. We focused on the development of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as they represent the main effectors against viral pathogens, those that have had most chances to influence the evolution of our immune system. We obtained samples from organ donors allowing access to thymocytes and peripheral T cells, as well as data sets from patients undergoing vaccinations or with infections; we also used TCR data available from multiple public repositories.</p><p>We identified a population of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells harboring diversified and polyspecific α/β TCRs that each can bind to multiple unrelated viral peptides, notably those from commonly encountered viruses such as EBV, CMV, or influenza. We hypothesize that these cells represent a first line of defense that is promptly mobilized in response to infections, possibly containing them before a more specific response subsequently ensures their control. Our results support an evolutionary selection of polyspecific α/β TCRs for broad antiviral responses and heterologous immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Thymopoiesis selects a large and diverse set of clustered CDR3s with high generation probabilities</title><p>To investigate how TCR diversity influences immune response to infectious agents, we started by analyzing the TCR repertoire dynamics of developing thymocytes. We first focused on the hypervariable CDR3 region of the TCR that interacts with the antigenic peptide, while CDR1 and CDR2 usually interact with HLA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossjohn et al., 2015</xref>). CDR3 analyses can therefore be used to investigate the sharing of TCR specificities across individuals with distinct HLA molecules. We analyzed the repertoire of purified CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup> (DPCD3<sup>−</sup>), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (DPCD3<sup>+</sup>), and CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (CD8<sup>+</sup>) thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). DPCD3<sup>−</sup> thymocytes represent the earliest stage of TCRβ-chain gene recombination, and their repertoire embodies the unaltered outcome of the TCR generation process; DPCD3<sup>+</sup> thymocytes are at an early stage of the selection process and their repertoire should be minimally modified; CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes have passed the selection process and bear a fully selected repertoire. We analyzed and represented the structure of these repertoires by connecting CDR3s (nodes) differing by at most one single amino acid (AA) (Levenshtein distance less than or equal to 1: LD≤1). LD≤1 connected CDR3s have been described to most often bind the same peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dash et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glanville et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meysman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In such networks, connected CDR3s are designated as <italic>clustered nodes</italic> and the others as <italic>dispersed nodes</italic>. For normalization, we represented the first 18,000 most expressed β or α CDR3s from each sample.</p><p>We observed a significant increase in the number of clustered βCDR3s from DPCD3<sup>−</sup> to CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001), which was remarkably consistent among all individuals studied, independently of their age, sex, or HLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The degree of clustered CDR3s, that is, the number of neighbors based on LD≤1, was also significantly increased during T-cell differentiation for clustered βCDR3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001). Similar results were obtained for the αCDR3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).

For example, single-cell derived TCRs that bind HLA-matched dextramers loaded with EBV or CMV peptides are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Projecting the binding of EBV dextramers onto a t-SNE representation based on single-cell specificity identified a few distinct regions that contained CMV (blue) and EBV positive cells (red), and also cells bound to both CMV and EBV dextramers (violet). As another example, a chord diagram representation of the binding of unique TCRs to HLA-matched EBV dextramers loaded with different EBV peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, in green) shows that a large proportion of the TCRs that bind to the RAKFKQLL peptide also bind the other EBV peptides. Furthermore, some TCRs recognizing this RAKFKQLL peptide can also bind peptides from CMV (red), HIV (dark blue), or Flu (dark gray) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Altogether, these analyses reveal unique cells that bind to dextramers presenting different unrelated peptides.</p><p>To better understand this phenomenon, we analyzed in more detail the dextramer binding scores for 2074 cells from two individuals that all use the same CASSIRSSYEQYF βCDR3 associated with different αCDR3s, altogether representing 131 unique TCRs. We analyzed the binding score of these cells for all the 49 different dextramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), of which only those with a relevant binding are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Almost all of these 2074 cells had the highest binding score for a matched HLA-A*0201 dextramer bound to an influenza peptide, indicating that the strong binding of this dextramer was mostly driven by this βCDR3. However, approximately half of these 2074 cells also had a noticeable but weaker binding score for the three HLA-A*0301 and two A*1101 dextramers presenting peptides from either CMV or EBV. Importantly, each of these five dextramers had their own unique binding patterns, resulting in TCRs that could bind only one of these dextramers to TCRs binding them all or none. Also, these same dextramers do not have the same binding patterns for other TCRs using different CDR3s. Likewise, for example, we identified a CASSLYSATGELFF βCDR3 that has a strong binding for only one of these five dextramers when associated with many different αCDR3s and a weaker binding to the four others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also identified one βCDR3 that binds to four out of five of these dextramers only when associated to a specific αCDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, these peculiar binding patterns do not appear to reveal a nonspecific background staining, but rather indicate a TCR dependency of these weaker dextramer bindings.</p><p>We analyzed dextramer bindings in more details for the most represented clonotypes in donor 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This clearly identifies ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ binders, with some heterogeneity of binding for the different cells from a given clonotype. These weak bindings appear HLA-dependent as, for example, they are mostly seen for A03 and A011 dextramers, and are almost nonexistent for A02 or B08 dextramers. They also appear peptide-dependent as for the same HLA, the binding patterns are different according to the peptide presented. In addition, we observed that the binding intensity for weak binders is statistically lower when the cells also bind a strong binder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that the weak bindings are competed for by strong ones. This is important as in this experiment the cells were co-incubated with a mixture of all dextramers that all competed for available TCRs. Altogether, the peptide and HLA-dependent nature of the weak bindings and their competition by strong binders indicate that they are TCR mediated.</p><p>We could not relate these weak binding patterns to other surface proteins that can interact with MHC, such as KIR molecules. This was directly confirmed by analyzing KIR expression in the transcriptome of these cells. There was much fewer KIR<sup>+</sup> cells than there were polyspecific ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>) and there was no association between KIR expression and polyspecificity. Additionally, we showed that these weak binding patterns could not be linked to the CD45 RA naïve/quiescent versus CD45 RO memory/activated phenotype of the cells, nor to any other relevant genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>).

These 5KC transductants were then stimulated with K562 cells transduced with either HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*03:01 as antigen-presenting cells, in the presence of individual peptides at increasing concentrations. From the single-cell sequencing data set, we selected two TCRs with similar binding patterns for dextramers loaded with Flu, CMV and EBV peptides, and which differ by only two AAs in the CDR3beta region while using different alpha chains. TCR#35–13 responded strongly to HLA-A*02:01 loaded with Flu MP 58–66 (EC50: 2.02×10<sup>–9</sup> M) and CMV IE1-184-192 (EC50: 7.99×10<sup>–7</sup> M), and poorly to EBV BMLF1 280–288 (EC50: 9.37×10<sup>–3</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper left). TCR#36–150 had very similar responses for HLA-A*02:01 loaded with Flu MP 58–66 (EC50: 9.99×10<sup>–11</sup> M), CMV IE1-184-192 (EC50: 7.99×10<sup>–7</sup> M), and EBV BMLF1 280–288 (EC50: 9.37×10<sup>–3</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom left). None of the TCRs responded to peptide-pulsed K562 expressing HLA-A*03:01. In contrast, a control D222D TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Culina et al., 2018</xref>) known as specific for a ZnT8 186–194 peptide responded to this peptide (EC50: 2.68×10<sup>–7</sup> M), but not to the Flu, EBV, or CMV peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper right).</p><p>We then further analyzed TCRs derived from single-sorted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stained with tetramers loaded with pancreatic self-peptides.

We analyzed their response to a set of peptides comprising their cognate peptide and peptides with no significant structural commonalities, selected by testing combinatorial peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mann et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed a marked polyspecificity of these TCRs. For example, a TCR identified as responding to the VMNILLQYV peptide from the Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase protein responded even better to the structurally unrelated SLYNPAIVYA peptide from human chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work brings to attention an overlooked phenomenon hidden in the literature. In a simple curation of public data sets of antiviral TCRs that were assigned to respond to known viruses—retaining only those from cells that could bind or respond to a known peptide—we found a surprisingly frequent representation of CDR3s that had been assigned to different viral specificities from independent experiments. Within the 40,939 curated βCDR3, 24% were from TCRs that could bind at least two totally unrelated viral peptides. This observation is highly relevant, as it arises in part from data sets of full TCRs from single-cell sequencing. Noteworthy, in these latter experiments, cells are co-incubated with multiple dextramers bearing a large set of unrelated peptides; although this data set has been widely analyzed, researchers have missed (or dismissed) that a single cell could bind multiple dextramers (sometimes a dozen) possibly because some of these bindings are weak. Actually, in the methodology description, the technology provider recommends determination of the specificity of a given T cell by the identity of the dextramer that has the highest binding counts on that cell. This is a rather crude readout, as the highest count could be marginally so. Furthermore, as there are limited numbers of HLA molecules available per cell, there is competition between dextramers for binding at the cell surface during their co-incubation. We actually observed such competition in which dextramers with weak bindings are competed for by those with strong ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>That a single cell binds multiple dextramers bearing unrelated peptides is in our view meaningful. As the binding of multimeric HLA/peptide complexes is a paradigmatic method to define specificity, multiple binding indicates multiple specificities. We thus defined TCRs binding multiple HLA/peptide complexes as polyspecific, and by extension called the cells harboring these TCRs as polyspecific T cells (psT cells). The polyspecific nature of these TCRs translates in polyreactivity as we show here that cloned polyspecific TCRs indeed trigger cell activation in response to multiple peptides, although with different efficiencies and with not always a correlation between the dextramer binding and its reactivity. This is likely due to the fact that cell activation assays have better sensitivity and robustness than dextramer binding assays.</p><p>In this line, two cloned TCRs with beta CD3s differing by 2AA and associated with different alpha CDR3s have a remarkably quantitatively similar activation profile for three different unrelated peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), highlighting the assay robustness. Incidentally, it also emphasizes the validity of the Levenshtein distance parameter as a proxy of TCRs with similar antigen recognition properties. In contrast, it has been reported that some peptides that could not properly bind HLA were nevertheless capable of eliciting efficient CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T-cell responses capable of eradicating tumors expressing the cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebrahimi-Nik et al., 2021</xref>). Also, we repeatedly detected a strong, dose-dependent and saturable response to an A02-KLGGALQAK dextramer which was used as a ‘negative control’ for A03-KLGGALQAK. This is surprising as this peptide is predicted to be a very poor binder for HLA-A2. There are however several examples of peptides with these low predicted HLA binding scores that nonetheless show some experimental binding to HLA, sufficient for refolding recombinant HLA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez-Duque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azoury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azoury et al., 2021</xref>). The response to the A02 or A03 presented KLGGALQAK peptide illustrates how HLA binding affinity does not always predict the TCR-mediated activation. Moreover, it is known that the TCR avidity threshold for functional responses is notoriously lower than that required for dextramer binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rius et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that T-cell activation results are more relevant for discussing TCR reactivity.</p><p>A limitation of our work is that functional studies could not be performed with thymocytes’ TCRs as these were obtained by bulk sequencing and thus not as paired αβTCRs. Nonetheless, the polyspecific/polyreactive TCRs from the single-cell data set necessarily originated from a successful thymocyte differentiation and thus the observation made with CD8-derived peripheral T cells TCRs should apply to thymocytes derived TCRs. Also, the polyspecificity of TCRs translate in a polyreactivity of the T cells expressing them, although at peptide concentrations that can span &gt;6 log10 but that are considered physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rius et al., 2018</xref>). It thus remains to investigate how these different sensitivity of response impact polyreactivity at work.</p><p>TCRs are notoriously ‘cross-reactive’, and it is estimated that each TCR could potentially recognize &gt;10<sup>6</sup> different peptide/MHC combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mason, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wooldridge et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the HLA/peptide/TCR <italic>ménage à trois</italic> leaves room for mimotopic cross-reactivity, that is, the fact that two unrelated peptides can bind differently to a given HLA molecule, but altogether generate a globally similar structure that could be recognized by the same TCR. Also, it was recently shown that peptides need to share only five residues at specific positions to bind the same TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wooldridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>). This latter observation has functional relevance as bacterial-derived peptides sharing such five residues with a tissue-restricted MOG self-antigen were shown (i) to activate a known MOG-specific TCR as well as a MOG peptide and (ii) to trigger an autoimmune attack against brain tissues upon mouse immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995</xref>). Thus, a large part of cross-reactivity is explained by a structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface by different peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>). The functional relevance of these observations was described as that ‘<italic>TCR cross-reactivity enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of non-homologous peptides</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to this mimotopic cross-reactivity, we observed polyspecificity using a very restricted pool of peptides with no specific AA sharing conservation. According to Don Mason’s estimates, each TCR may respond to over 10<sup>6</sup> different peptides from an estimated repertoire of &gt;10<sup>10</sup> possible peptides, making the chance to find a cross-reactive peptide at random around 10<sup>–4</sup>. Here, the chance to find even just one cross-reactive peptide among these few peptides that we tested would be around 10<sup>–3</sup>, the chance to find two cross-reactive peptides around 10<sup>–6</sup> and to find three or more cross-reactive peptides infinitesimal. Thus, if the polyreactivity that we described is part of this general cross-reactivity, our results are at least highlighting a major previously unreported bias in the selection of these TCRs.</p><p>Thus, polyspecificity appears to have the properties of what was described above as ‘<italic>degenerate recognition of non-homologous peptides</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>). We prefer to describe polyspecificity as defining a fuzziness (rather than ‘degeneration’) in TCR recognition that makes it capable of interacting with multiple unrelated peptides and that is not strictly HLA-restricted. In this regard, it is noteworthy that B cells have a machinery for somatic mutations of their BCRs that ultimately allows them to generate antibodies with increased affinity (specificity) for antigens. While TCR generation and BCR generation share many common mechanisms, the fact that T cells did not evolve to use such somatic mutations suggest that T-cell recognition may have been selected to be more fuzzy than stringent.</p><p>As TCRs have been essentially selected during thymocyte differentiation for their ability to bind HLA molecules presented by thymic antigen-presenting cells, it could have been that polyspecificity represents some loose remnant of that property. However, it should be emphasized that a single cell does not bind randomly to any homologous-HLA/peptide complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, each polyspecific TCR has its own binding pattern regarding a large set of dextramers, with most that do not bind. Thus, this binding is not just ‘<italic>nonspecific</italic>’ and must obey some structural rules that remain to be defined.</p><p>Polyspecific TCR binding properties are distinct from those of innate-like MAIT and NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toubal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 2016</xref>). These have a restricted diversity, with an invariant TCRα chain and a constrained TCRβ repertoire, and are MR1- or CD1-restricted, respectively. In contrast, the repertoire of polyspecific TCRs is highly diverse for both the TCR αand β chains, although with a specific usage of VDJ/VJ recombination. Also, polyspecific T cells found in adults cannot be the remnant of fetal/neonatal T cells that have been described as having a promiscuous repertoire, as these cells have repertoires enriched in germline-encoded TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rudd, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davenport et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The polyspecific nature of these TCRs has a functional relevance, as we show here that cloned polyspecific TCRs indeed trigger cell activation in response to multiple peptides, although with different efficiencies. In agreement with our results, the analysis of the TCR repertoire of lung tumor-infiltrating T cells using GLIPH2, as we did here, recently identified a key TCR that, after cloning and expression, could bind and respond to a tumor-specific self-antigen as well as to a peptide from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and one from EBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiou et al., 2021</xref>). In the same line, a recent study of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis identified autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones that can respond to self-peptides as well as peptides from EBV and from the bacteria <italic>Akkermansis muciniphila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This further establishes the existence of psT cells that respond to multiple antigens from different microbes. Also, in the development of the T-scan platform aimed at characterizing the specificity of TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kula et al., 2019</xref>), the authors performed a setup experiment with CD8 cells activated by the immunodominant NLV peptide from the pp65 protein of CMV. While T-scan could identify two hits related to NLV overlapping peptides, they also detected two hits related to the unrelated CMV I1E CMV protein. Actually, tetramer staining revealed that while 25% of the T cells in the NLV-expanded population bind NLV tetramers, 2% of the T cells bind IE1 tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kula et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the fold enrichment of the IE1-specific cells was close to that of NLV-specific cells (60 vs. 80, respectively). Thus, activation with a single peptide results in a major expansion of cells with TCRs that can also respond to an unrelated peptide. These observations match well with ours, which show that the stimulation of peripheral T cells by pp65 peptides generates cells that respond to either or both pp65 and I1E peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The fact that CMV, EBV, and influenza specificities are highly represented in polyspecific binding patterns likely reflects the biased representation of these specificities in the databases (15.9%, 16.2%, and 50.6%, respectively), but also highlights that the detection of the diverse viral specificities of psT cells is largely underestimated due to the very low number of CDR3s with known viral specificities for viruses other than these. Our results suggest that polyspecific TCRs could represent at least 1/5 of the CD8 selected TCR repertoire. Altogether, our results identify and define peculiar binding properties of polyspecific TCRs. This warrants to study their physicochemical characteristics, with a special interest in solving the structure of such TCRs bound to two unrelated peptides.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculations</title><p>We believe that our findings may have important implications for the study of the adaptive immune response in health, diseases, and immunotherapies. In the field of infectious diseases and vaccination, they prompt reconsideration of the paradigm of highly diverse adaptive immune repertoires providing a highly antigen-specific antiviral immune response. Indeed, there is an intrinsic weakness in the view that a highly diverse TCR repertoire is ideal to protect us from a countless repertoire of constantly evolving viruses. As best illustrated by the deadly outcome of flu in the elderly or young infants, there is a very limited amount of time for the immune system to react against rapidly replicating deadly viruses. For life-threatening situations, the initial recruitment of frequent polyspecific effector T cells might be more efficient and rapid than having to rely on rare cells with stringent specificity that would need a period of expansion to provide enough fighters. In the race between virus replication and the mounting of the immune response, this early response of polyspecific T cells could provide some control of the viral spread that will allow time for the development of an immunologically fittest response to ensure the final control of the infection. This would explain how a very restricted repertoire of only about 1000 different TCRs arising from a single T-cell progenitor was sufficient to cope with viral infections in a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bousso et al., 2000</xref>). They would also explain why children vaccinated against measles in underdeveloped countries have a better life expectancy than unvaccinated ones (when excluding measles-related events), which could be linked to an overall better response to infections with other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aaby et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While our findings do not challenge that there are highly specific TCRs nor the importance of specific immune responses, they highlight another mechanism of preparedness of the immune system, reminiscent of the role of (i) other unconventional T cells like MAIT and NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godfrey et al., 2015</xref>), (ii) TCR activation by bacterial superantigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayday and Vantourout, 2020</xref>), and (iii) natural antibodies specific for microbial determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Panda and Ding, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, polyspecific TCRs form a paratopic network, made of TCRs that have a high probability of generation and are positively selected during thymocyte differentiation. These properties indicate that these TCRs have been positively selected during evolution, further supporting their overall beneficial effects. A fuzzy recognition by polyspecific TCRs would explain the so-called ‘heterologous immunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Welsh and Selin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sewell, 2012</xref>) in which T-cell responses to one pathogen can have a major impact on the course and outcome of a subsequent infection with an unrelated pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furman et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that individual histories of fuzzy immune responses may thus create patient-specific ‘antigenic sins’ that might be responsible for the diverse quality of immune responses to viruses, from unapparent infection to fulminant immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peteranderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertoletti and Ferrari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tay et al., 2020</xref>). Further studies will have to evaluate the contribution of fuzzy immune responses to the efficacy but also the immunopathology of antimicrobial responses and autoimmunity. We speculate that the origin of many immune diseases should be sought in the repeated activation of polyspecific T cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and samples</title><p>Thirteen human thymus samples were obtained from organ donors undergoing surgery (Department of Cardiac Surgery, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, France) after approval by the <italic>Agence de Biomédecine</italic> and the <italic>Ministry of Research</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benny Chain (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please comment on the correlation between TCR clustering, high Pgen, and sharing of TCRs amongst individuals.</p><p>2. Please address the issue concerning the lack of clarity in sections describing the relationship between thymic selection and poly-specificity, and between in silico &quot;cross-reactivity&quot; as evidenced by multiple annotations and the functional poly-specific T cells.</p><p>3. The mechanistic molecular details underlying poly-specificity also remain unclear. For one, the evidence for large-scale cross-reactivity comes mainly from a set of dextramers for A*03 and A*11-restricted peptides. But these dextramers appear to be binding in a uniquely non-specific and non-TCR-dependent manner in this experiment. Hence, TCR sequence doesn't appear to be the determining factor for binding to these dextramers; rather it may be expression of KIR genes or other surface proteins that can interact with MHC.</p><p>4. The claim that clustered public CDR3s are enriched in viral specificities is not justified by the data, which comes from sequence matching against literature-derived databases. To maintain this claim, it is necessary to show experimental specificity data on the very same datasets to make a conclusion about viral specificities in general.</p><p>5. In your discussion, please consider the observation of Slabodkin and colleagues who have shown that generation models differ by individual (Genome Research 2021). If that were true for TCR repertoires, how would this change your conclusions/data analysis?</p><p>6. The data need to be made public. The sequences of the individual TCRs that were expressed and characterized should be given, at least their V/J genes and CDR3 regions.</p><p>7. Figure 4., especially panels B and C, very hard to understand. Please revise the legends. What is the heatmap in B showing? What is the basis for the t-sne plot?</p><p>8. Figure S10 is missing.</p><p>9. The references for VDJdb and MCPas are incorrectly cited (wrong numbers) in multiple figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– &quot;In this regard, it is noteworthy that B cells have a machinery for somatic mutations of their BCRs that ultimately allows them to generate antibodies with increased affinity (specificity) for antigens. While TCR generation and BCR generation share many common mechanisms, the fact that T cells did not evolve to use such somatic mutations suggest that T cell recognition has been selected to be more fuzzy than stringent.&quot; --&gt; I would be careful with this assessment. Antibody responses are also known to be very polyreactive. Furthermore, in order to enter the GC reaction, naive B cells must already possess affinity to the antigen. The GC does not create antigen specificity de novo. So, it may be likely that B cells underlie similar principles. It would be interesting to understand further the differences in reactivity between B and T cell responses.</p><p>– Recently, Slabodkin and colleagues have shown that generation models differ by individual (Genome Research 2021). If that were true for TCR repertoires, how would this change your conclusions/data analysis? Can you discuss this in the discussion?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In part 1, I think the authors need to acknowledge that publicity, pGEN, and also sequence clustering are not independent processes, but all highly linked. High pGEN T CRs exist in a part of TCR space with many neighbours. This has been discussed previously in some detail, especially by Nit Freidman and his colleagues.</p><p>I found Figure 4., especially panels B and C, very hard to understand, and the Legends were unhelpful here. What is the heatmap in B actually showing? And what is the basis for the t-sne plot? I don't understand why this plot is being used, or what it claims to show.</p><p>As mentioned above, I found the different sections of the paper not really linked. For example, it was not clear to me that functionally poly-specific T cells are enriched during positive/negative selection. But I appreciate that this may require a lot of further work, and I would be happy for the authors to be a bit more guarded in their conclusions, and try and indicate clearly the gaps in their analysis which need addressing in future studies. The Discussion is rather uncritical in this respect, which is a pity because there are lots of interesting things to say.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure S10 is missing.</p><p>The references for VDJdb and MCPas are incorrectly cited (wrong numbers) in multiple figure legends.</p><p>No data is made public, not the sequencing results nor the derivative analyses of the public databases. This should be done or it should be clarified (with justification) that privacy concerns do not allow deposition of the donor TCR sequences in public databases (which seems a little surprising). The sequences of the individual TCRs that were expressed and characterized should be given, at least their V/J genes and CDR3 regions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Human thymopoiesis produces polyspecific CD8<sup>+</sup> α/β T cells responding to multiple viral antigens&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Some revisions or corrections of the 10X dataset need to be provided as all reviewers agreed that a nonspecific dextramer binding is being detected.</p><p>2) A more thorough discussion regarding this point of needs to be included.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all of my concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of the key reviewer points. In particular, they document and discuss the relationships between pGen and clustering; they improve the flow between the parts of the manuscript; they have removed or clarified figures which were hard to understand; and they have somewhat softened their conclusions. As I wrote previously, I think the findings of this study are not the whole story, but contribute some interesting and provocative findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I appreciate the authors' willingness to keep an open mind in revisiting their conclusions. I remain convinced that the binding of the A*03 and A*11 dextramers in the large public 10x dextramer dataset is largely not TCR specific (except a few A*11-positive clonotypes in the A*11 positive donor 1, more below). I've attached two figures that show the distributions of dextramer UMI (barcode) counts for the 30 largest clonotypes in donors 1 and 2. As I discuss in detail below, these show pretty convincingly that the binding of A*03 and A*11 dextramers is qualitatively different from the &quot;specific&quot; dextramers and does not look to be mediated by TCR sequence. Now that the authors have provided the TCR sequences for the in vitro TCR reconstruction assays, I also have more questions about that data. Here are some points for the authors to consider:</p><p>– On the question of A*03/A*11 non-specific binding, the authors state &quot;If it would be an MHC to KIR binding, then such dextramers should bind to most cells, independently of their TCRs&quot;. This ignores the fact that the cells in this dataset have diverse phenotypes (from naive to memory) and diverse transcriptional and presumably surface protein expression levels. So the fact that not all cells are bound does not imply that it is TCR mediated: these cells differ in more than just their TCRs.</p><p>– Looking at the distributions of dextramer UMI counts for donor 2, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Decision letter image 1</xref>), one can see that for the &quot;specific&quot; dextramers (the bottom 3 rows: A02-GIL, B08-RAK, and A02-GLC) there is a very clear separation between true binding clonotypes, which show high dextramer binding for essentially all of the member cells, and non-binding clonotypes, for which the majority of cells have a dextramer UMI count of 0. Examples of true-positive clonotypes are #12,20,26,27,30 for A02-GIL; #1,2,5,10,14,16,19,21-24,28,29 for B08-RAK, and #7 for A02-GLC. For the non-specific dextramers, it's a completely different story. Each clonotype has a broad distribution of UMIs, with many cells having 0 bound dextramers, and many having multiple bound dextramers, including many that exceed the authors' threshold for dextramer positivity (the red dashed line, the count at or above the threshold is shown in red above each clone's violin). Consider clone #2, for which 4270 of the 4274 cells meet the binding threshold for B08-RAK. This clone also has 574 cells that meet the threshold for the non-specific dextramer A03-KLG, but also a large number with 0 A03-KLG dextramers bound. Would the authors say that this TCR binds to the A03-KLG peptide-MHC? How about the other A03 and A11 dextramers, which also show large numbers of cells exceeding the threshold?</p><fig id="sa1fig1" position="float"><label>Decision letter image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81274-sa1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>– The distributions of dextramer UMI counts for donor 1, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig2">Decision letter image 2</xref>), show a very similar story, with the added feature that now we can see, for the A*11 dextramers, a mix of specific and non-specific binding. This donor is HLA-A*11 positive, and there are some genuine A*11-specific clonotypes, like the CASSLYSATGELFF clonotype that the authors put forward as proof that these dextramers bind specifically. For A*11-IVT, the true specific clonotypes are #1,11,26; for A*11-AVF they are #2 and 18 (which may in fact be the same dual-α clonotype that was inadvertently split; these both have the CASSLYSATGFELFF CDR3beta). In a sense, these A*11 dextramers in donor 1 are the &quot;exceptions that prove the rule&quot;, because they show side-by-side the difference between non-specific UMI distributions and specific UMI distributions for the same dextramer in the same donor. Note that all the A03-KLG distributions in both donors look like non-specific distributions. I would suggest that the authors, in the interest of transparency, show a supplemental figure like these to allow readers to judge for themselves whether these dextramers are binding in a specific, TCR-sequence-dependent manner.</p><fig id="sa1fig2" position="float"><label>Decision letter image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81274-sa1-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>– The two TCRs selected for in vitro reconstitution are shown with red boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Decision letter image 1</xref>. We can see that these are both &quot;specifically&quot; bound by A02-GIL (Flu M158). They both also show multiple cells that are positive for the A03-KLG dextramer, including many that meet the authors' positivity threshold (28 cells for TCR#35-13 and 42 cells for TCR#36-150). The first thing to point out about the in vitro data is that neither TCR shows any response to the A03-KLG pMHC, despite the many A03-KLG dextramer-positive cells in the single-cell dataset. This is not mentioned in the manuscript but should be along with some explanation for the discrepancy, as it calls into question the validity of the A03/A11 dextramer binding. A second interesting thing about TCR#35-13 is that the other peptide it showed a response to, albeit 3-4 logs lower than the cognate flu peptide, is A02-KLGGALQAK. This is interesting because that peptide is not predicted to bind to A02 (it's well above even the &quot;weak binder&quot; threshold for netmhcpan, for example, which is not surprising given the lysine at the second anchor position). For TCR#36-150, what is surprising is that the strongest binding (again by 3-4 logs) is to the non-cognate A02-GLC (EBV BMLF1) pMHC, rather than the A02-GIL flu peptide. I would strongly encourage the authors to revisit this data and double-check the experiment, because (1) this TCR is just about the most canonical A02-GIL (Flu M158) TCR sequence you can possibly imagine (TRBV19, RS motif, TRAV27/TRAJ42), so it's hard to believe that it would bind so much more weakly than TCR#35-13. And (2) the dextramer data from the 10x experiment shows zero binding to A02-GLC, the supposed tight binder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Decision letter image 1</xref>, clone #30, far right red box), and instead strong binding to A02-GIL. And the A02-GLC dextramer did indeed work in the 10x experiment: clone #7 shows strong binding (757/772 cells meet the threshold), and many other clonotypes outside the top 30 also showed specific binding (plus the TCR repertoires for A02-GLC are consistent with previously published repertoire data for this pMHC). This inconsistency between the in vitro data and the 10x dextramer data, like the failure to see A03-KLG binding, should also be pointed out.– In their response, the authors state &quot;we compared the CDR3 length distribution between DP CD3+ cells and CD8 SP cells from our thymic dataset. We did not observe major changes. The distribution and the mean of CDR3 length for the two cell populations remained identical.&quot; In fact, the orange distribution is significantly shifted (as the authors show) toward shorter lengths and probably also slightly compressed. It's certainly not the case that the &quot;distribution and mean&quot; remain identical. Perhaps the authors meant to say the &quot;mode&quot;? Still, the distribution is certainly not the same, and seemingly modest shifts in CDR3 length can have significant impacts on neighbor distributions.</p><p>– In Figure 4C, I wonder whether the authors are taking consistency within expanded clonotypes into account. Is a TCR called as positive for a given dextramer if any cells expressing it are bound by that dextramer, regardless of the fraction those cells represent of the full clonotype? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Decision letter image 1</xref>, we can see that even for the specific dextramers, there are occasional cells (typically less than 1 percent of the clone) in the non-binding clonotypes that meet the dextramer UMI threshold. There are all sorts of reasons why we might see this: minor stickiness in the reagents, non-specific dextramer adherence, incomplete washing of non-bound dextramers, incorrect TCR assignment (this happens a fair amount, possibly from ambient TCR transcripts that become trapped in the wrong emulsion).</p><p>To reiterate, I appreciate that the authors are keeping an open mind about their conclusions. I personally feel that the data as presented and as it regards the public 10x dextramer dataset needs to be corrected or revised along with the discussion on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81274.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The mechanistic molecular details underlying poly-specificity also remain unclear. For one, the evidence for large-scale cross-reactivity comes mainly from a set of dextramers for A*03 and A*11-restricted peptides. But these dextramers appear to be binding in a uniquely non-specific and non-TCR-dependent manner in this experiment. Hence, TCR sequence doesn't appear to be the determining factor for binding to these dextramers; rather it may be expression of KIR genes or other surface proteins that can interact with MHC.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree.</p><p>If it would be a KIR binding, then the dextramers would bind to most cells independently of their TCRs.

The claim that clustered public CDR3s are enriched in viral specificities is not justified by the data, which comes from sequence matching against literature-derived databases. To maintain this claim, it is necessary to show experimental specificity data on the very same datasets to make a conclusion about viral specificities in general.</p></disp-quote><p>“Sequence matching against literature-derived databases” is a much used and accepted mean to provide indication on the specificity of clusters, for example those generated by LV distance or GLIPH2. This is the only possibility to infer specificity for bulk TCR sequences from thymocytes, as these are not from αβ paired TCR sequences. In our study, the validity of thymocyte antigen-specificity inference is further supported by the functional data obtained with αβ paired TCR sequences from single-cell sequenced peripheral blood lymphocytes that have necessarily gone through thymocyte differentiation. The reviewers have clearly stated that experimental specificity determination with thymocytes TCRs was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>This said, we have softened our claim by stating: “The polyspecific nature of these TCRs translates in polyreactivity as we show here that cloned polyspecific TCRs from the single cell dataset indeed trigger cell activation in response to multiple peptides.

Antibody responses are also known to be very polyreactive. Furthermore, in order to enter the GC reaction, naive B cells must already possess affinity to the antigen.

This ignores the fact that the cells in this dataset have diverse phenotypes (from naive to memory) and diverse transcriptional and presumably surface protein expression levels. So the fact that not all cells are bound does not imply that it is TCR mediated: these cells differ in more than just their TCRs.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we agree that T cell activation stage may influence dextramer binding patterns. We looked at the available transcriptome data of the 10X dataset, and we can rule out a KIR binding.</p><p>These results show that, as known, CD8 T cells do not have a high expression of KIRs. Moreover, a positive KIR expression (regardless of the expression level) was only detected in 6.5% of all polyreactive cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>These results show that there is no difference between monospecific and polyspecific cells for KIR expression.</p><p>These results exonerating KIRs are also in line with our response to this comment in the first review. If the HLA-A11 and HLA-A3 dextramers bind to KIRs, all HLA-A11 and HLA-A3 dextramers, should be bound to the same cell irrespective of their peptide. This is not the case. For example, on figure 4—figure supplement 1C, we show that for the cell with TRA: CADTASGTYKYIF the binding is peptide dependent as only HLA-A3 dextramers with CMV and EBV peptides are bound, while HLA-A3 dextramer harboring a cancer peptide is not. Thus, the binding is peptide dependent, which should not be the case if it was a binding to KIRs</p><p>We went further in our analyses to explore if the cell status could influence the binding.</p><p>All these new results are now presented in &quot;Figure 4—figure supplement 2.

Examples of true-positive clonotypes are #12,20,26,27,30 for A02-GIL; #1,2,5,10,14,16,19,21-24,28,29 for B08-RAK, and #7 for A02-GLC. For the non-specific dextramers, it's a completely different story.

This is not mentioned in the manuscript but should be along with some explanation for the discrepancy, as it calls into question the validity of the A03/A11 dextramer binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss it. See below</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second interesting thing about TCR#35-13 is that the other peptide it showed a response to, albeit 3-4 logs lower than the cognate flu peptide, is A02-KLGGALQAK. This is interesting because that peptide is not predicted to bind to A02 (it's well above even the &quot;weak binder&quot; threshold for netmhcpan, for example, which is not surprising given the lysine at the second anchor position).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we were also surprised by this reactivity of A02-KLGGALQAK, which we initially included in our experiments as a “control” for A03-KLGGALQAK. We thus verified it multiple times with the same result (also note that the response is nicely dose-dependent and saturable).</p><p>For this peptide, the NetMHCpan4.1 returns a ranking for the HLA-A2 binding of this peptide of 12.4%. Although lower than the customary 2% used to define weak binders, we have several examples of peptides with these low scores that nonetheless show some experimental binding to HLA, which is sufficiently stable to allow recombinant HLA/peptide refolding. Examples can be found in Gonzalez-Duque et al., Cell Metab 2018 (Figure S2), Azoury et al., Diabetes 2020 (Table 1 and Figure S2), Azoury et al., Diabetes 2021 (Figure 1).</p><p>Indeed, this customary 2% binding threshold has been defined mostly based on viral and tumor immunology studies that may apply less stringently to cross-reactive T-cell responses, and to the autoimmune responses analyzed in the references provided.</p><p>Finally, there is a growing literature (previously cited in our article, e.g. Ebrahimi-Nik et al., Nat Commun 2021) highlighting peptides with non-detectable HLA binding that are nonetheless capable of eliciting significant T-cell responses mediating tumor rejection in vivo.</p><p>The possible functional relevance for autoimmunity of these weak interactions has been discussed in a recent review (Samassa and Mallone, Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes 2022), and some of these considerations may also apply to the cross-reactive T cells that we describe.</p><p>Altogether, the response to the A02 or A03 presented KLGGALQAK peptide illustrate that the Binding assays do not fully/always predict the TCR mediated activation. In this line, it is known that the TCR avidity threshold for functional responses is notoriously lower than that required for dextramer binding (see Rius et al., J Immunol 2018). We believe that the activation assay is more quantitative and robust and importantly more relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For TCR#36-150, what is surprising is that the strongest binding (again by 3-4 logs) is to the non-cognate A02-GLC (EBV BMLF1) pMHC, rather than the A02-GIL flu peptide. I would strongly encourage the authors to revisit this data and double-check the experiment, because (1) this TCR is just about the most canonical A02-GIL (Flu M158) TCR sequence you can possibly imagine (TRBV19, RS motif, TRAV27/TRAJ42), so it's hard to believe that it would bind so much more weakly than TCR#35-13. And (2) the dextramer data from the 10x experiment shows zero binding to A02-GLC, the supposed tight binder (Decision letter image 1, clone #30, far right red box), and instead strong binding to A02-GIL. And the A02-GLC dextramer did indeed work in the 10x experiment: clone #7 shows strong binding (757/772 cells meet the threshold), and many other clonotypes outside the top 30 also showed specific binding (plus the TCR repertoires for A02-GLC are consistent with previously published repertoire data for this pMHC).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy.</p><p>We have double-checked this experiment and detected a mis-labeling of the peptides displayed for TCR#36-150, which has now been corrected.</p><p>Noteworthy, these 2 TCRs #36-150 and #35-13 show very similar behavior. Interestingly, they use different α chains and differ by only two amino acids in the CDR3beta region. As they show remarkably similar quantitative responses, on the one hand, they highlight the robustness of our TCR re-expression and testing technology. On the other hand, they also emphasize the validity of the Levenshtein distance parameter as a proxy of TCRs with similar antigen recognition properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This inconsistency between the in vitro data and the 10x dextramer data, like the failure to see A03-KLG binding, should also be pointed out.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In their response, the authors state &quot;we compared the CDR3 length distribution between DP CD3+ cells and CD8 SP cells from our thymic dataset. We did not observe major changes. The distribution and the mean of CDR3 length for the two cell populations remained identical.&quot; In fact, the orange distribution is significantly shifted (as the authors show) toward shorter lengths and probably also slightly compressed. It's certainly not the case that the &quot;distribution and mean&quot; remain identical. Perhaps the authors meant to say the &quot;mode&quot;?
