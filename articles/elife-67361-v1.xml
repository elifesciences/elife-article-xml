Clinical data review studies estimated a prevalence of 3.2–6.2 per 100,000 for USH cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boughman and Fishman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koenekoop et al., 1993</xref>). However, a molecular diagnosis study in children with hearing loss found variants in USH-associated genes in 11% and estimated a frequency of 1/6000 individuals afflicted with USH in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimberling et al., 2010</xref>). Assuming similar prevalence, this would translate into 255,000–1.34 million USH cases worldwide. However, this estimate varies considerably in specific population substructures. For instance, the p.Arg245* founder variant of <italic>PCDH15</italic> (USH1F) has an ~2% carrier frequency amongst Ashkenazi Jews accounts for nearly 60% of their Usher syndrome type I (USH1) cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Yosef et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we speculate that a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology and disease mechanisms is a prelude for developing therapeutic interventions for USH after clinical trials.</p><p>Loss of vision in individuals with USH1, an autosomal recessive disorder, begins towards the end of their first decade of life due to RP, eventually leading to near total blindness. Night blindness is an early sign in USH1 subjects followed by constriction of the visual field (tunnel vision) and finally clinical blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vernon, 1969</xref>). Characteristic fundus features include pigmentary retinopathy, narrowing of the retinal vessels, and a pale appearance of the optic disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toms et al., 2020</xref>). Vestibular dysfunction in USH1 manifests as a delay in development of independent ambulation while hearing loss is usually severe to profound, congenital, and sensorineural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1994</xref>). Cochlear implants can restore auditory perception in USH1 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pennings et al., 2006</xref>), but presently there is no effective treatment for vision loss due to RP. Moreover, there is a lack of longitudinal data for the natural history of ocular abnormalities associated with variants of <italic>PCDH15</italic> in humans. Only anecdotal clinical data has been reported thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Yosef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobson et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we describe the natural history of retinopathy in 13 individuals followed for up to 30 years with an Ashkenazi Jewish recessive founder variant of PCDH15. Eleven patients from nine families were homozygous for the p.Arg245*, leading to truncation of the encoded protein, protocadherin-15. Two additional patients had compound heterozygous genotypes that included one p.Arg245* allele.</p><p>Protocadherin-15 is a member of a large cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Roy, 2014</xref>). Within the vertebrate inner ear, protocadherin-15 is required for the structural maintenance and the mechanotransduction function of the sensory hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>). In the retina, protocadherin-15 is localized to the outer limiting membrane of photoreceptors (PRs) and in Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reiners et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Wijk et al., 2006</xref>). We previously reported a reduction of electroretinogram (ERG) a- and b-waves amplitudes (~40%) at 5 weeks of age in at least two <italic>Pcdh15</italic> alleles in mice (<italic>Pcdh15<sup>av-5J</sup> and Pcdh15<sup>av-jfb</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haywood-Watson et al., 2006</xref>). However, the exact molecular function of protocadherin-15 in the retina remains elusive. Here, we describe the pathophysiology and function of protocadherin-15 in the retina of a novel murine model. Finally, ERG data show significant improvement after treatment of this USH mouse model with 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, raising the possibility that exogenous retinoids could preserve vision in USH1F patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spectrum and longitudinal ocular phenotypic data revealed early onset rod-cone dystrophy in USH1 subjects</title><p>We reviewed the medical records of 13 patients enrolled in an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol to study USH. Subsequent to congenital profound deafness, the first reported symptom was difficulty with vision at night. Ophthalmic manifestations depended on the age of the patient and the stage of retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Electroretinography (ERG) recordings were at noise-level for both scotopic and photopic responses, suggesting dysfunctional PRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In young patients with early stages of the retinal degeneration, findings included mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with early pigment redistribution, and mild to moderate vascular attenuation with typically preserved macular reflexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As RP progressed, more extensive pigment abnormalities were observed with deposition of bone spicules, severe attenuation of the retinal vasculature, macular atrophic changes, and waxy pallor of the optic nerve head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In advanced stages, these changes became more prominent and widely distributed throughout the fundus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cataracts were common, especially posterior subcapsular opacities. The panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> show the progression of macular atrophic changes over a 12-year period in a patient with compound heterozygous p.Arg245*/p.Arg929* variants. Both of these alleles of <italic>PCDH15</italic> are predicted to cause truncation of the protocadherin-15 protein. Kinetic visual field testing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) showed early loss of the ability to detect the smaller and dimmer target (I1e) in all but one patient (LMG268 #1722 at age 37 years). Early midperipheral scotomas and severe constriction were noted while testing the I4e isopter (target is equal in size to I1e but brighter). Progressive constriction of the V4e visual field isopter (largest and brightest target) is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> where the horizontal diameter is binned by the decade of life. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> shows an increase in logMAR visual acuity, corresponding to a decline in Snellen best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), starting at the fourth decade of life. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) with parameters corresponding to legal blindness (acuity at 20/200 and visual field limited to 20°) demonstrate severe visual function loss by the fifth decade.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Ophthalmic clinical manifestations of patients with biallelic <italic>PCDH15</italic> mutations.</title><p>Eleven patients in this study are homozygous for the p.Arg245* variants while two siblings carry compound heterozygous variants, <bold>¥</bold>p.Arg245*/p.Arg929*. Visual acuity assessments consistently show a decline between the third and fourth decade of life. Visual field loss in these subjects, shown in Table 1, further support severe retinitis pigmentosa. Macular atrophy and PSC cataract appear early and may contribute to the observed reduction in visual acuity. Optic nerve head pallor is also frequent and advanced.

However, the RPE was not assessed for the localization of protocadherin in those studies.

Furthermore, <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice displayed abnormal motor vestibular behaviors such as circling, hyperactivity, and head bobbing. Behavioral tests including exploratory behavior and tail-hanging tests confirmed that these deaf mice also have a significant vestibular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). Finally the <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant cochlear and vestibular hair cells also had no functional mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>), accounting for deafness, and at P60 also showed degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Dark-adapted (scotopic) ERG waves, which are preferentially driven by rod PRs at low light intensity and by rod and cone PRs at high light intensity, showed normal wave architecture albeit with reduced amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Quantification showed significant reduction in amplitudes of the a-wave derived primarily from the PR layer and the b-wave derived from Müller glia and bipolar neurons in 1-month-old <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice as compared to littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

The b- to a-wave ratio (b/a) was similar across genotypes indicating that deficits were manifested mainly at the PR level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4b</xref>). We then performed ERGs at 2–3, 6–7, and 12–14 months of age. <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice consistently had lower scotopic and photopic ERG amplitudes compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–h</xref>), indicating that the functional deficits observed at 1 month were not due to delayed development. Further, to assess the visual cycle dysfunction and dark adaptation, we assessed the recovery of a-wave amplitude following bleaching of more than 90% of rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolesnikov et al., 2020</xref>). We observed equivalent recovery of a-wave irrespective of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>), but we did observe that initial single flash a-wave amplitude was lower in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d</xref>), which suggests functional alterations in phototransduction such as are indicated by aberrant light-dependent translocation of arrestin and transducin (see details below).

Phototransduction proteins are generated in the PR cell body and delivered to the OS via the inner segment (IS) and connecting cilium.

Consequently, there is decoupling of opsin and all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal. All-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal must be re-isomerized to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal to form rhodopsin again. These enzymatic steps occur in the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Travis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wald and Brown, 1956</xref>). Next, we assessed the levels of crucial retinoid cycle proteins such as RPE65, an essential isomerase that catalyzes the conversion of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinyl ester to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moiseyev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Redmond et al., 2005</xref>), CRALBP (cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein), a key retinoid transporter, and IRBP (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein). These studies were rationalized based on the findings that protocadherin-15 is a binding partner of myosin VIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Senften et al., 2006</xref>), which also interacts with RPE65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>).

Intriguingly, immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced quantities of RPE65 and CRALBP, but not IRBP in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>).</p><p>We also quantified the absolute retinoid levels within the eyes after overnight dark adaptation, and as compared to controls found reduced levels of retinoids, particularly 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinaloxime, in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinaloxime levels correlate with PR rhodopsin levels. Next, we quantified the retinoid levels 1 hr after dark adaptation following bleaching with 15,000 lux for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Reduction of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinaloxime in control and mutant mice retinae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) correlated with prebleach levels, as did increase in all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinyl esters. These findings from <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutants suggest a reduced function of the visual cycle due to reduced expression of RPE65 and CRALBP. Since we observed lower visual cycle proteins (RPE65 and CRALBP), we also assessed the structure of the RPE, the main cell type harboring the key enzymes of the visual cycle. Transmission electron microscopy showed no gross structural deficits in the RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that the loss of protocadherin-15 in the retina leads to aberrant translocation of proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade and reduced levels of key retinoids and enzymes involved in the visual retinoid cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pre-clinical administration of exogenous retinoids</title><p>We hypothesized that low levels of retinoids in the mutant mice could be overcome by providing exogenous retinoids, thus rescuing the ERG deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palczewski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sethna et al., 2020</xref>).

Taken together, our data link the visual deficits to the retinoid cycle dysfunction in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice and provides a starting point to investigate the possibility of therapeutically boosting visual function in USH1F patients.</p><p>The spectrum and longitudinal ophthalmic phenotypes of USH1F patients homozygous for the p.Arg245* variant (or compound heterozygotes) consisted of a rod-cone dystrophy and are relatively uniform across this cohort of patients. They include an onset of symptoms such as night vision difficulties and visual field deficits in the first or early second decade, the presence of macular atrophy with reduction in central visual acuity by the third decade and, subsequently, the progressive constriction of visual fields resulting in tunnel vision between the third and fifth decades of life. Progressive posterior subcapsular cataract and optic nerve head atrophy are also frequent manifestations of this <italic>PCDH15</italic> genotype.</p><p><italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice have a retinal dysfunction as early as 1 month after birth. We do not observe gross retinal damage, however, in aged mutant mice we do observe marginal loss of ONL thickness. Our data indicate that protocadherin-15 has a dual role in PRs and the RPE. First, at the junction of the PR IS and OS, where protocadherin-15 is localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reiners et al., 2005a</xref>), the loss of protocadherin-15 leads to disrupted shuttling of arrestin and transducin under light-adapted conditions. Second, within the RPE, loss of protocadherin-15 is associated with lower levels of two key visual retinoid cycle enzymes, CRALBP and RPE65. Reduced levels of RPE65 were reported in <italic>Myo7a</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>), a binding partner of protocadherin-15. Further, CRALBP facilitates the transport of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal between the RPE and the PR OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saari et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, reduced levels of RPE65 and CRALBP lead to delayed and reduced regeneration and transport of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal to the PR OS, and thus we observed a concordant reduction in levels of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal oxime. Our data provide a plausible explanation for reduced ERG amplitudes without gross retinal degeneration in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutants, suggesting this may also be the case for other <italic>Pcdh15</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Libby and Steel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the typical human ocular manifestations of USH1, which have severe retinal degeneration, our mouse model has much less severe pathophysiology. The discordance between retinal pathologies in humans and mice may be further attributable to the structural differences in their PRs, particularly the presence of calyceal process in humans, monkeys, and frogs, but not in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sahly et al., 2012</xref>), light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2011</xref>), or environmental factors. The role of Usher proteins in the calyceal processes is supported by recent observations of PR degeneration in <italic>Ush1</italic> frog models that have calyceal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schietroma et al., 2017</xref>). Further, this is consistent with reported ocular phenotypes of other USH mouse models on C57BL/6J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jacobson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). However, a recent study showed degeneration of cone PRs in <italic>Ush1c</italic> and <italic>Ush1g</italic> knockout mice on an albino background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trouillet et al., 2018</xref>), which suggests that pigmentation might be providing protection to mice against the ambient light condition in their housing facilities. Currently, we are backcrossing <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> to generate congenic mice with an albino background. Future studies will assess the PR fate and ERG progression in these mice.</p><p>In conclusion, documenting the natural history and the degree of clinical variability of the ocular phenotype in human and animal models is pivotal for evaluating the efficacy and potential therapeutics in future clinical trials. Our longitudinal USH1F patient ocular data show that significant vision and PRs are preserved until the third decade of life, providing a long window of opportunity. Our results with an 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal analog, 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, raise the possibility that longer-lasting analogs such as 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinyl acetate, which has an excellent safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koenekoop et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scholl et al., 2015</xref>) or a synthetic version of 11-<italic>cis</italic> β-carotene, whose capsule formulation is already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rotenstreich et al., 2013</xref>), could preserve vision in USH1F patients. Furthermore, in mouse models lacking key visual cycle enzyme RPE65 or with one of the most common variants of opsin causing RP (p.Pro23His), administration of retinoids has been shown to preserve PR morphology or proper folding of opsin to a greater extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noorwez et al., 2004</xref>), and thus might also extend the life of functional PRs in USH1 patients. Based on our pre-clinical data in mouse and prior human trials, a clinical trial in USH1F patients may show benefit if the retinoid is administered early in life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>mouse</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pcdh15</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 11994</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>human</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>PCDH15</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 65217</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protocadherin-15 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2003a</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PB303;C-terminus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Opsin (Ret-P1; mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MilliporeSigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MAB5316</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transducin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sc-517057</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arrestin(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Drs.

Overnight dark-adapted mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine-xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), followed by dilation of pupils with 1% Tropicamide. A gold loop wire electrode was placed on the cornea, a reference electrode was placed on the scalp under the skin and a ground electrode was placed under the skin near the tail. ERG waveforms were acquired using sequentially brighter stimuli (0.003962233–3.147314 cd × s/m<sup>2</sup>) with 5–60 s intervals using the Diagnosys ColorDome Ganzfeld system (Diagnosys Systems, Lowell, MA). Three to five waveforms per intensity were averaged. Photopic, cone-only, responses were acquired at a single bright flash (3.15 cd × s/m<sup>2</sup>) under a steady rod-suppressing field of 30 cd × s/m<sup>2</sup>, with 10 waves averaged.

Briefly, mice were placed individually in a new cage. A camera was placed on top of the cage to record movements of mice for 2 min and tracked using ImageJ software. Tail hanging tests were performed as follows: mice were held 5 cm above a tabletop. The test scores were given as following: normal behavior was demonstrated by a ‘reaching position,’, with a score of 4, by the extension of limb and head forward and downward aiming to the tabletop. Mice with abnormal behavior, ranked with a score of 1, tried to climb towards the examiner’s hand, curling the body upward reaching with the head to the tail one time.

Overnight dark-adapted mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub>, eyes enucleated, lens and vitreous removed, followed by freezing the eyecups in pairs on dry ice. These were stored at –80°C until retinoid extraction was performed. Mouse eyecup pairs were homogenized in fresh hydroxylamine buffer (1 ml of 0.1 M MOPS, 0.1 M NH<sub>2</sub>OH, and pH 6.5). 1 ml ethanol was added, samples were mixed and incubated (30 min in the dark at RT). Retinoids were extracted into hexane (2×4 ml), followed by solvent evaporation using a gentle stream of argon at 37°C. After reconstituting in 50 μl mobile phase, the retinoid samples were separated on LiChrospher Si-60 (5 μm) normal-phase columns (two 2.1×250 mm in series; ES Industries, West Berlin, NJ) using an H-Class Acquity UPLC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) along with standards at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, following published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landers and Olson, 1988</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Henri Leinonen (Reviewer #2); Prof. Claudio Punzo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The paper nicely links clinical phenotype, disease model generation and finding a new therapeutic approach. The mouse phenotyping was done quite extensively. However, the main topic (it is even in the title) of the manuscript is the novel therapy, but then the drug research part itself is the smallest in the whole MS.</p><p>2. The level of 11-cis-retinal downregulation could explain the mouse phenotype the authors see. But the finding of arrestin and transducin mis-trafficking was a bit confusing. Does this fact affect visual function and how does the retinoid supplementation therapy address this?</p><p>3. How relevant is this mouse model translationally since there is no progression, and the human condition is progressive? Then, in humans, is progression caused by defective visual cycle or phototransduction protein mislocalization? The authors need to discuss this.</p><p>4. The paper requires elaboration of the proposed main mechanisms of visual function loss because the proposed drug treatment is specific to this mechanism. It also requires also clear presentation, or citing of previous literature, that the mutated gene/protein exists in main locus of the dysfunction, the RPE.</p><p>5. The authors find major types of mechanistic dysfunction in the retina; dysfunctional trafficking of arrestin/transducin and impaired visual cycle. Their treatment specifically addresses visual cycle, and vision is practically fully restored. Therefore, is dysfunctional trafficking of arrestin/transducin insignificant? Or is it also secondarily corrected by the retinoid supplementation?</p><p>6. A few experiments specifically to study visual cycle function are needed, because the treatment is fully dependent on this.</p><p>7. The specific experiments concerning how authors could elaborate the degree of visual cycle defect are:</p><p>a. Either dark-adaptation recovery with ERG, for example as in Figure 5 here:</p><p>https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.201902535R</p><p>b. Or retinoid recovery kinetics after strong bleach:</p><p>https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/27/13/2225/4969374</p><p>Figure 7 here. Three time points (e.g. 1 h, 4 h and 8 h) could be sufficient. Essentially, the authors already have 0 h time point as they did dark-adapted one.</p><p>8. How was the RPE affected in patients and mice with PCDH15 mutation? And with treatment?</p><p>9. One single IP injection of 9-cis retinal was shown to preserve retinal function in mouse mutants, levels of 9-cis retinal in circulation and retinas should be included after injection and the duration of the effect noted</p><p>10. Would 9-cis retinal administration prevent mislocalization of transducin and arrestin in light-adapted mice?</p><p>11. At least 2 mice per group should be added to 1-mon old ERG data set (current n=4) to increase n up to 6.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1.

Usher syndrome is divided into 3 subtypes differing in progression and severity such that type 1 is the most dramatic. Saumil and colleagues´ manuscript concerns Usher Syndrome type 1 (USH1) and proposes a novel treatment strategy to mitigate visual dysfunction in affected patients. In their manuscript Saumil et al., first present longitudinal phenotype characterization of a patient population affected mutation in the gene encoding protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) that is one of the gene mutations causative for USH1. They then generate a novel mouse model carrying the same mutation and perform a thorough phenotype characterization including auditory, vestibular and visual system; however, primarily focusing on the eye. They find that the Pcdh15 mutant mice have compromised photoreceptoral trafficking of phototransduction proteins transducin and arrestin at the dark-light switch, and abnormally low expression of visual cycle-related proteins RPE65 and CRALBP as well as lowered level of visual chromophore in their retinas culminating into retinal function impairment. The authors then test the hypothesis if chromophore supplementation by exogenous 9-cis-retinal could mitigate retinal dysfunction, which proves to be true: a single i.p. injection of 9-cis-retinal essentially rescued visual function to WT levels. The concept bears clinical importance as chromophore supplementation therapies have been used in other retinal degenerative diseases before and have proved acceptable safety profile.</p><p>The patient phenotype follow-up is uniquely longitudinal and quite comprehensive. Establishment and characterization of the new mouse model with respect to the inner ear problems is adequate. Where the current manuscript falls short is confirmation that visual cycle defect is the main cause of visual dysfunction. The authors base their conclusion on lowered visual cycle-protein expression levels and a single time-point retinoid level analysis. This poorly establishes the breadth of visual cycle dysfunction. The authors should test the kinetics of retinoid regeneration after a strong bleach and also preferably test how dark-adaptation differs from healthy mice using electroretinography (a dark-adaptation recovery test, well characterized in literature). The authors should also clearly and discreetly explain/show the expression level of PCDH15 in the RPE, which was not clear to me. Another puzzling thing is the defect in phototransduction-protein trafficking at dark-light switch. How much does this contribute to the observed visual dysfunction, and if it does, by what mechanism a single administration 9-cis-retinal corrects this defect as well, or does it? Authors should test transducin and arrestin trafficking during/after their treatment, similarly as they did in mouse phenotyping part. Finally, the authors did not quantitatively test presence of retinal degeneration in the mouse model. OCT was done only at 1-month of age and statistical analysis of morphometrical parameters is not shown. Nevertheless, due to its clinical applicability retinoid supplementation should be tested in PCDH15-mutation affected USH1 individuals as only a single dose could prove its potential.</p><p>– I suggest to use presence tense &quot;reveals&quot; instead of &quot;revealed&quot; in the manuscript main title.</p><p>– Transducin not transducing in the abstract.</p><p>– What are the retinoid products FDA-accepted for clinical use in retinal degeneration?</p><p>– In introduction, general prevalence of the condition is missing. How many patients per million inhabitants? This may not be known, but at least some kind of estimate would be good to disclose for readers.</p><p>– In row 81 authors write about vision preservation. In reality, the PCDH15 mutation causes also other problems than visual cycle, as authors even show themselves. How does the retinoid therapy tackle these issues? Maybe safer to say &quot;improve visual function&quot;.</p><p>– In row 91, the authors talk about ERG defects and refer to table 1, but I do not see any parameters of ERGs in the table.</p><p>– Row 140: I suggest to remove &quot;outer nuclear&quot; from bipolar neurons. Kind of confusing since BCs are located in the inner nuclear layer.</p><p>– Supplementary figure 3. Quantification of retinal layers from OCT images is missing. Best if authors did this in the older mice they tested with ERG. Based on the arrestin/transducin trafficking and visual cycle issues, one would expect there to be at least a slowly progressive degeneration (which may not be so readily detectable from current ERG follow-up).</p><p>– Major comment: visual cycle defect needs to be better characterized by a bleaching challenge test. Please perform a strong bleach and chromophore regeneration assessment preferably coupled with dark-adaptation test with ERG.</p><p>– Row 203: Current journal policies in general do not like (data not shown).</p><p>– Did the authors produce the 9-cis-retinal or where was it obtained from?</p><p>– Row 324-325: ethanol is highly toxic in mice. What was the total ethanol amount injected into mice?</p><p>– Retinoid extraction and analysis: Details missing how long the mice were dark-adapted.</p><p>– Data analysis: why/how did the authors use one-way ANOVA when there are two factors: treatment group as a between-subjects factor and flash intensity as a within-subjects factor. Would two-way ANOVA be more appropriate? Were the pre-assumptions tested and met for parametric tests, such as normality of the data?</p><p>– Data presentation in general. Largest amount of data granularity is encouraged, in keeping with the clarity of presentation. For example, in Figure S2C would be nice to see replicates. The number of biological/technical replicates need to be apparent in the M%M section and in figure legends.</p><p>– In Figure 1d, it would be nice to see the disease stage (e.g. age) associated with each of the panels in the figure (not figure legend).</p><p>– Figure 2: Do the authors mean log cd´s/m2 in the x-axis?</p><p>– Figure 2 legend says that t-test is applied. This is not proper for the ERG data performed with several flash intensities. Change of type 1 error becomes very prevalent, due to multiple comparisons.</p><p>Figure 2. Could the authors comment about the retinal sensitivity. It seems that sensitivity (I50) is not declined, but rather Rmax. Would significant visual cycle defect cause retinal drop in sensitivity (I50) parameter?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Sethna et al., decribes a new mouse model based on a founder mutation in the Usher syndrome type 1 gene called Protocadherin-15, known to cause Usher syndrome type 1F. The mouse model recapitulates most aspects of the human disease including hearing loss and sever visual dysfunction. However, unlike in humans there seems to be no apparent retinal degeneration. Unfortunately, this is a common problem seen with many gene mutations known to cause Usher syndrome. The authors therefore characterize the mouse model further with the aim to determine what underlies the visual dysfunction. They determine that there are problems in the visual cycle in these mice. In particular, the translocation of arrestin and transducin in light adapted mice is wrong as they are suddenly present throughout the inner and outer segments. They also identify reduced CRALBP and RPE65 levels in these mice. Both these proteins play an intricate role in the recycling of the visual chromophore. Consequently these mice had also reduced levels of 11-cis retinal. Based on their findings and previous reports in the literature they treated their mice with 9-cis retinal, which is a analog of 11-cis retinal that has more stable chemical properties and is easier to synthesize and administer. Treatment of mice with 9-cis retinal significantly improved visual function, even in 6 months old mice. The authors conclude that patients suffering from this particular founder mutation in Protocadherin-15 could be potentially treated with 9-cis retinal in a clinical trial. In particular, since the compound is already FDA approved.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and clear. major strength of the manuscript are the phenotypic analyses of 13 human patients, some over a prolonged period of time, with the same mutation as is mimicked in mouse. The recapitulation of the human phenotype in mouse and the discovery of a potential therapy in mouse add further strength to the rationale for a clinical trial in humans with the same therapeutic approach used in mouse. The data support this conclusion and idea, especially since the drug is already FDA approved. The only weakness is that the characterization of the eye phenotype in mouse is not extended beyond 6-7 months of age. While this does not diminish the conclusion it would have been interesting to see if there are phenotypes that take more time to develop in mouse. The explanation for why the authors believe there will likely be no phenotype is sound and supported by data from other Usher mouse models in the literature.</p><p>Overall this is an important study that may not only help individuals affected by this particular mutation in Protocadherin-15, but may also pave the way for similar approaches in other Usher syndrome cases. The study is therefore of broad impact.</p><p>The study by by Sethna et al., is a well developed study with a linear line that tracks through the manuscript. It is very logical and clear. There are no concerns with the study in its current form.</p><p>As mentioned in the above comments it would have been interesting to analyze the eyes also at a later time point (~1 year of age) to see if any degeneration develops slowly. While the rationale for why this is likely not the case is sound (absence of calyceal processes), given that this is a new mouse model it would have added more to the story. In case there would be some slow degeneration after a year this could have opened the opportunity to test how well the 9-cis retinal treatment works when the tissue is degenerating.

The paper nicely links clinical phenotype, disease model generation and finding a new therapeutic approach. The mouse phenotyping was done quite extensively. However, the main topic (it is even in the title) of the manuscript is the novel therapy, but then the drug research part itself is the smallest in the whole manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We agree and provided additional data on evaluating the impact of 9-cis retinal delivery on the visual function as well as on arrestin and transducin transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The level of 11-cis-retinal downregulation could explain the mouse phenotype the authors see. But the finding of arrestin and transducin mis-trafficking was a bit confusing. Does this fact affect visual function and how does the retinoid supplementation therapy address this?</p></disp-quote><p>To address reviewer’s comment, we performed additional experiments, including analyses of arrestin and transducin trafficking after 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal injections. We also evaluated the levels of 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal in the eye and liver tissues of injected mice. Based on the findings from these experiments, we added the following sentences in the Results section:</p><p>“To confirm the 9-cis retinal delivery and metabolism, in a separate cohort of mice, 24 hours post-injection followed by 2-hour light exposure, we evaluated the retinaloxime levels, including 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinaloxime, both in the liver and retina (Figure S7). As expected, we found no or trace levels of 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinaloxime levels in the same retinae.”</p><p>“Next, we assessed whether exogenous 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal treatment also improved translocation of arrestin and transducin in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice. For these studies, we injected a cohort of mutant mice with 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal and control mice with vehicle. Overnight dark-adapted mice were exposed to normal room light for two hours and their retinae examined for localization of arrestin and transducin. We found mis-localization of arrestin and transducin in mutant mice injected with 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinal as well (Figure S8). Taken together, our data link the visual deficits to the retinoid cycle dysfunction in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice and provides a starting point to investigate the possibility of therapeutically boosting visual function in USH1F patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How relevant is this mouse model translationally since there is no progression, and the human condition is progressive? Then, in humans, is progression caused by defective visual cycle or phototransduction protein mislocalization? The authors need to discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it’s important to explore the status of the visual cycle proteins in human tissue. However, USH1 subjects have a normal life span. Hence, obtaining ocular tissue in which the retina is still preserved is a limitation to correlating our observations in mouse models implicating the RPE and PR dual dysfunction. However, we did contact several EyeBanks in the USA. None of them have cadaver eye tissues from USH1F subjects. Perhaps a pig model of USH1F can be developed similar to the USH1C pig model (bioRxiv 2021.05.31.446123;), which seems to more faithfully mirror the human retinal degeneration, would be an alternative path forward.</p><p>To address the point raised by the reviewer, we have added the following sentences in the revised discussion:</p><p>“Unlike the typical human ocular manifestations of USH1, which have severe retinal degeneration, our mouse model has much less severe pathophysiology. The discordance between retinal pathologies in humans and mice may be further attributable to the structural differences in their photoreceptors, particularly the presence of calyceal process in humans, monkeys, and frog, but not in rodents (Sahly <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012), light exposure (Lopes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011) or environmental factors. The role of Usher proteins in the calyceal processes is supported by recent observations of photoreceptor degeneration in <italic>Ush1</italic> frog models that have calyceal processes (Schietroma <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017). Further, this is consistent with reported ocular phenotypes of other USH mouse models on C57BL/6J background (Haywood-Watson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006a; Jacobson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008; Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007; Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> 1999; Williams <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009). However, a recent study showed degeneration of cone photoreceptors in <italic>Ush1c</italic> and <italic>Ush1g</italic> knockout mice on an albino background (Trouillet <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018), which suggest that pigmentation might be providing protection to mice against ambient light condition in their housing facilities. Currently, we are backcrossing <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> to generate congenic mice with an albino background. Future studies will assess the photoreceptor fate and ERG progression in these mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The paper requires elaboration of the proposed main mechanisms of visual function loss because the proposed drug treatment is specific to this mechanism. It also requires also clear presentation, or citing of previous literature, that the mutated gene/protein exists in main locus of the dysfunction, the RPE.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the following information in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Immunostaining showed that protocadherin-15 is localized to the inner segments of the PR, the outer plexiform layer and the ganglion cell layer as reported previously (Haywood-Watson, Ahmed et al., 2006a). However, the RPE was not assessed for the localization of protocadherin in those studies. Here we show that protocadherin-15 is also expressed in the RPE using immunohistochemistry (Figure S2b).”</p><p>Furthermore, our new data reveals an improvement of ERG amplitudes with retinoids, but not a correction of arrestin and transducin trafficking after 9-cis retinal injection, further supporting the notion that the visual cycle deficit observed in <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutant mice stem from a retinoid cycle dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors find major types of mechanistic dysfunction in the retina; dysfunctional trafficking of arrestin/transducin and impaired visual cycle. Their treatment specifically addresses visual cycle, and vision is practically fully restored. Therefore, is dysfunctional trafficking of arrestin/transducin insignificant? Or is it also secondarily corrected by the retinoid supplementation?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to comment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A few experiments specifically to study visual cycle function are needed, because the treatment is fully dependent on this.</p><p>7. The specific experiments concerning how authors could elaborate the degree of visual cycle defect are:</p><p>a. Either dark-adaptation recovery with ERG, for example as in Figure 5 here:</p><p>https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.201902535R</p><p>b. Or retinoid recovery kinetics after strong bleach:</p></disp-quote><p>https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/27/13/2225/4969374</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 here. Three time points (e.g. 1 h, 4 h and 8 h) could be sufficient. Essentially, the authors already have 0 h time point as they did dark-adapted one.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting these experiments. We have performed the experiments suggested in 7a and b and incorporated the results in Figure 3d-e and Figure S5c-d.</p><p>“Next, we quantified the retinoids levels one hour after dark adaptation following bleaching with 15,000 lux for one hour (Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). Reduction of 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinaloxime in control and mutant mice retinae (Figure 3d) correlated with prebleach levels, as did increase in all-<italic>trans</italic> retinyl esters. These findings from <italic>Pcdh15<sup>R250X</sup></italic> mutants suggest a reduced function of the visual cycle due to reduced expression of RPE65 and CRALBP. Since we observed lower visual cycle proteins (RPE65 and CRALBP), we also assessed the structure of the RPE, the main cell type harboring the key enzymes of the visual cycle. Transmission electron microscopy showed no gross structural deficits in the RPE (Figure S5e). Together, our data indicates that the loss of protocadherin-15 in the retina leads to aberrant translocation of proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade and reduced levels of key retinoids and enzymes involved in the visual retinoid cycle.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. How was the RPE affected in patients and mice with PCDH15 mutation? And with treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>Clinically, it is difficult to address RPE involvement separately from the photoreceptor degeneration in PCDH15 patients. We did observe macular hypoautofluorescence indicating RPE atrophy, as well as RPE and outer retinal atrophy on Optical Coherence Tomography, in LMG197#1831 starting at 38 years of age. A supplement figure (Figure S1) was added showing the left eye fundus autofluorescence and OCT findings for this patient at 50 yrs. of age. The fundus autofluorescence shows a central reduced / absent autofluorescence consistent with RPE atrophy. The OCT shows the corresponding macular area with complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy as indicated by homogenous choroidal hypertransmission and absence of RPE band.</p><p>We also performed transmission electron microscopy in mutant and control mice, which showed no gross structural deficits of the RPE (Figure S5e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

How many patients per million inhabitants? This may not be known, but at least some kind of estimate would be good to disclose for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentences in the introduction:</p><p>“Usher syndrome (USH) is estimated to be responsible for more than 50% of deaf-blind cases, 8-33% of patients with RP and 3-6% of congenitally deaf individuals (Boughman <italic>et al.,</italic> 1983; Brownstein <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b; Vernon, 1969). Clinical data review studies estimated a prevalence of 3.2 to 6.2 per 100,000 for USH cases (Boughman and Fishman, 1983; Koenekoop <italic>et al.,</italic> 1993). However, a molecular diagnosis study in children with hearing loss found variants in USH-associated genes in 11% and estimated a frequency of 1/6000 individuals afflicted with USH in the USA (Kimberling <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010). Assuming similar prevalence, this would translate into 255,000 to 1.34 million USH cases worldwide. However, this estimate varies considerably in specific population substructures. For instance, the p.Arg245* founder variant of <italic>PCDH15</italic> (<italic>USH1F</italic>) has ~2% carrier frequency amongst Ashkenazi Jews accounts for nearly 60% of their USH1 cases (Ben-Yosef <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003). Thus, we speculate that a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology and disease mechanisms is a prelude for developing therapeutic interventions for Usher syndrome after clinical trials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In row 81 authors write about vision preservation.

Could the authors comment about the retinal sensitivity. It seems that sensitivity (I50) is not declined, but rather Rmax. Would significant visual cycle defect cause retinal drop in sensitivity (I50) parameter?</p></disp-quote><p>That is a very interesting and important comment. We think that the paradox is explained by the complex phenotype of the <italic>Pcdh15</italic> mutant, on the one hand there is reduced expression of visual cycle proteins (RPE65 and CRALBP), and on the other hand an effect on photoreceptor biochemistry/physiology. The visual cycle in mutants, though reduced in output, is still sufficient to supply what chromophore is needed by the mutant photoreceptors so sensitivity (“I50”) is not that impacted. The reduced a-wave response (“Rmax”) observed is probably due to the impacted photoreceptor biochemistry/physiology (as illustrated by arrestin/transducin effect) while the actual threshold is not that affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>As mentioned in the above comments it would have been interesting to analyze the eyes also at a later time point (~1 year of age) to see if any degeneration develops slowly.
