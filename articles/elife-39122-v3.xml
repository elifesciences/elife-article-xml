Previously we characterized the influence of positively charged pore-lining residues on anion conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). Here, we demonstrate the electrostatic control of permeation by the bound calcium ions in mouse TMEM16A using electrophysiology and Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. The currents of constitutively active mutants lose their outward rectification as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration due to the alleviation of energy barriers for anion conduction. This phenomenon originates from Coulombic interactions between the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> and permeating anions and thus demonstrates that an electrostatic gate imposed by the vacant binding site present in the sterically open pore, is released by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to enable an otherwise sub-conductive pore to conduct with full capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anoctamins</kwd><kwd>electrostatics</kwd><kwd>ion conduction</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>ligand-gated ion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC no 339116 AnoBest</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ion conduction in the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A is directly regulated by calcium, which binds to a site close to the pore thereby shaping the electrostatics at its intracellular entrance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A is part of a large family of membrane proteins that encompasses ion channels and lipid scramblases with a common conserved molecular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picollo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Terashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). With respect to their fold, the TMEM16 family is related to mechanosensitive channels of the OSCA and TMC families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballesteros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). TMEM16A is widely expressed and contributes to important physiological processes including the transport of chloride across epithelia and the control of electrical signal transduction in smooth muscle and certain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oh and Jung, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scudieri et al., 2012</xref>). Recent investigations have defined the structural basis for ion permeation and gating in TMEM16A and revealed features that distinguish this ion channel from other homologues working as lipid scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>). TMEM16A harbors two ion conduction pores, each contained within a single subunit of a homodimeric protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both pores function independently and are activated by the binding of two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to a site embedded within the membrane-inserted part of each subunit close to the ion conduction path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). In the open conformation, anions access the narrow neck of an hourglass-shaped pore via water-filled vestibules from the extra- and intracellular sides and permeate through the constricted part presumably after shedding most of their coordinating water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</xref>). During this process, the energetic penalty for dehydration is surmounted by positive charges placed on both sides of the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>). In the apo conformation, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is accessible from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> favors conformational changes in the pore-lining helix α6, which provides polar and acidic sidechains that coordinate the bound cations and thus directly couples ligand binding to pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Peters et al., 2018</xref>). The subsequent closure of the aqueous access pathway to the ligand binding site buries the bound calcium ions within the transmembrane electric field, which mechanistically accounts for the observed voltage dependence of activation by modulating the binding affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arreola et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). The movement of the helix relays a conformational change towards the neck to release a steric barrier, which acts as a gate in the closed conformation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). Additionally, the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions change the charge distribution at the wide intracellular vestibule thereby removing a second, electrostatic barrier that specifically hinders the access of anions in the ligand-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). Here we have used electrophysiology and Poisson-Boltzmann calculations to characterize the electrostatic control of anion permeation by the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. Our results reveal a strong and favorable Coulombic interaction of permeant anions with the positively charged Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the intracellular pore entry. These long-range interactions underlie an electrostatic gating mechanism that acts through space and that is synergistic with the opening of a steric gate, allowing an otherwise sub-conductive pore to conduct with full capacity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39122.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TMEM16A structure and conduction properties of constitutively active mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound mouse TMEM16A channel viewed from within the membrane (PDB: 5OYB), subunits are shown in unique colors.

In this model, a central small energy barrier originating from the diffusion of an anion across the narrow neck is sandwiched between two larger barriers resulting from the desolvation of the anion upon entering the constricted part of the channel from the aqueous vestibules located on either side of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The diffusion path does not contain deep energy wells and the model does not account for saturation of the pore, which is generally consistent with the high K<sub>M</sub> for chloride conduction. This model allowed us to phenomenologically interpret the effect of mutations of positively charged residues on current-voltage (I-V) relationships. Whereas single mutations in the wide vestibules do not exert a recognizable effect on conduction, mutations at the border of the neck region result in a pronounced rectification of currents whose shape depends on the location of the altered residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>). The rectification is a consequence of both pore occupancy and the rate of barrier crossing at the applied potential. Here we use a similar analysis to investigate the influence of the bound calcium ions on anion conduction by characterizing the properties of the mutant G644P. In this mutant, the replacement of a flexible glycine at a hinge in α6 (Gly 644, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with a rigid proline increases the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and concomitantly results in constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). The basal current of this mutant is highly outwardly rectifying but it progressively loses its rectification at increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations until it becomes pseudo-linear in saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This differs from the instantaneous currents of WT, which are linear in the entire Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When analyzed with our described minimal model of ion permeation, this effect seems to originate from the alleviation of local energy barriers for anion conduction at the intracellular entrance and the center of the pore as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is consistent with a change in long-range interactions affecting permeant anions entering and traversing the narrow neck region upon binding of the positively charged Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The lowering of the energy barriers can be described by a binding isotherm with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 60 nM and 170 nM, and Hill coefficients of 2.1 and 1.7 at 80 mV for the inner and the central barriers respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As the rate constants are not strongly coupled, the similarity of their respective EC<sub>50</sub>’s and their consistency with data from steady-state current responses provide independent evidence for a saturable effect associated with the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the transmembrane site identified in the structure.</p><p>Besides G644P, we have characterized the mutant Q649A that also causes constitutive activity. Located about one helix turn below Gly 644, the residue is not directly involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Like G644P, this mutant displays a left-shifted EC<sub>50</sub> and basal current that is equally outwardly rectifying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Since the current magnitude of this mutant is larger and the kinetics of irreversible rundown is slower compared to G644P, we were able to examine the influence of the membrane potential on Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by recording instantaneous currents with pre-pulses at different voltages on the same patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B—D</xref>). At the membrane potentials tested, we observed a similar effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the energetics of anion conduction as in G644P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>) and as with steady-state concentration-responses, the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Therefore, these results provide further evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> alleviates local energy barriers for anion conduction at the intracellular entrance and the middle of the pore by binding to the transmembrane site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The effect of the competitive antagonist Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and the trivalent cation Gd<sup>3+</sup> on conduction</title><p>To confirm that the charge of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than its ability to promote gating-associated conformational changes, accounts for the observed effect, we characterized the I-V relations of G644P in the presence of the divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although Mg<sup>2+</sup> is incapable of activating WT even at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it acts as a low affinity competitive antagonist that lowers the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, indicating that it might occupy the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). This is confirmed in the mutant G644P, for which we observed a concentration-dependent reduction of the outward rectification in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> thus appears to ‘activate’ G644P, by primarily increasing its conductance but not its open probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Although we cannot exclude a non-specific effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> due to the screening of surface charges, this is unlikely, as alanine mutations of positive charges in the wide vestibule have previously been shown to exert little effect on conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>). Interestingly, although Mg<sup>2+</sup> exerts a qualitatively similar effect on G644P as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the current remains rectifying even at saturating concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the activation by Mg<sup>2+</sup> proceeds with a Hill coefficient close to unity and a maximum conduction rate at the intracellular entrance (σ<sub>β</sub>) that saturates at an intermediate value, suggesting that the binding site is likely occupied by a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Taken together, our data show three discrete levels of conductance that correspond to the possible occupancies of the binding site with zero, one and two divalent cations bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with a scenario where sequential Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding lowers the energy barriers for anion conduction in a stepwise manner, as predicted by a simple Coulombic interaction. The model also describes the effect upon addition of the trivalent cation Gd<sup>3+</sup>, which strongly increases the conductance at saturating concentrations even beyond the level induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is likely a consequence of the increased positive charge density in the binding site and is manifested in the observed inward rectification of currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39122.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conduction properties of the constitutively active mutant G644P in the presence of intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Instantaneous I-V relations of the constitutively active mutant G644P from pre-pulses at 80 mV in the presence of the indicated intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.

Similar to PQ, this mutant likely binds only one calcium ion as the Hill coefficient is close to unity and the I-V relation retains its strong rectification even at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, consistent with the hypothesis that a more positive potential at the binding site lowers the energy barrier for anion permeation, the rate of chloride conduction at the intracellular entrance at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations is significantly higher than that observed for PQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we removed an additional negative charge in the binding site of the PR mutant by exchanging Glu 702 with Gln (PR2Q), which, similar to the equivalent mutation on the WT background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>), reduces the potency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As expected, the rate of chloride conduction at the intracellular pore entrance in the triple mutant PR2Q is increased compared to the double mutant PR both in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Together these observations consolidate the notion of the dependence of anion conduction on the electrostatic potential around the binding site.</p><p>For electrostatic interactions, we expect the contribution of individual charges in the binding site to conduction to be additive. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the effect of the removal of a negative charge in the binding site mutant E705Q in the PQ (PQ5Q) and PR (PR5Q) backgrounds. At maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy, E705Q increases the rate of anion conduction to the same extent in both PQ5Q and PR5Q irrespectively of its background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), which emphasizes the orthogonal contributions of individual mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The same mutations also exhibit a similar degree of additivity in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), further supporting an electrostatic mechanism for the functional interaction between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and the anion conduction path.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Electrostatic interactions are evident in calculations</title><p>To further strengthen our proposal of an electrostatic interaction between the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> and permeating anions, we investigated the effect of the binding site mutations and the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy on the electrostatic profile of the pore using Poisson-Boltzmann calculations on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound mouse TMEM16A structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the quantal effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on anion conduction, removal of a single calcium ion from the binding site partially decreases the positive potential observed in the fully bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also found that stepwise removal of charges in the binding site exerts progressively larger effects according to the number of charges neutralized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), as observed in our experiments. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the detailed geometric arrangement of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site and nearby helices might be influenced by the introduced mutations, local changes in backbone and sidechain conformations are unlikely to drastically affect the calculated electrostatic potential given the long-range nature of Coulombic interactions. Because several mutants described above seem to bind only one calcium ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is possible to estimate from our experimental data the effective dielectric constant of the intracellular vestibule that propagates the electric field originating from the binding site to the pore. When the above mutants are analyzed collectively, we observed an inverse and linear relationship between the energy barrier for chloride conduction at the intracellular pore entrance and the valence of the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Assuming a Coulombic potential and using the distance measured from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure, we estimated an effective dielectric constant of around 160 in the vacant and 90 for the single Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state. Although potentially inaccurate and physically unreasonable due to experimental limitations, these values indicate bulk solution-like aqueous properties that are consistent with the large water-filled intracellular vestibule observed in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effect of mutations of two residues, Lys 588 and Lys 645 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) located at the boundary between the intracellular vestibule and the neck, which lower the energy barrier for chloride conduction by contributing to the positive electrostatics of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>).

A direct effect of the ligand on the permeation properties of the open state is unique among ligand-gated ion channels and it is a consequence of the high positive charge density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the location of its binding site in the immediate vicinity of the permeation path. The described effect is synergistic with a conformational change upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding that opens a steric gate in the narrow part of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, even in a sterically released conformation, which in this study was stabilized by mutations, an electrostatic gate imposed by the vacant binding site would impede the access of chloride ions to the intracellular vestibule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases this second gate by neutralizing the negative charges, enabling the open channel to conduct with full capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our findings thus provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of anion permeation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels of the TMEM16 family and demonstrate that these channels are dually gated by both steric and electrostatic mechanisms. Moreover, they also provide a conceivable explanation for how the oppositely charged substrates, in this case permeating anions and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, access their respective site of action via the same intracellular vestibule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The observation that the conductance of the open channel can be electrostatically regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a stepwise manner also offers a unique opportunity to examine the relative contribution of open states with partial Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy during activation. The currents in such partially occupied states would be rectifying and thus be readily identifiable in the current-voltage relationships. In WT, the instantaneous I-V plots are all approximately linear and their shape is only mildly sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the entire activation range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since these plots reflect the weighted sum of the I-V relations of the open states with different Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy, our results indicate that, during activation, the major conducting state in WT is the open state with two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound, whereas the contribution of open states with submaximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy is minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). A similar but less pronounced distribution of states is also evident in the constitutively active mutant G644P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), where the apo and the singly occupied channel make a larger contribution to conduction at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. These observations thus provide direct evidence for the high cooperativity of TMEM16A activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39122.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanism.</title><p>Schematic depiction of gating in G644P (<bold>A</bold>) and WT (<bold>B</bold>).

HEK293T cells were transfected with 3 μg DNA per 6 cm Petri dish using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, and were used within 24–96 hr after transfection. Mutants were generated with a modified QuikChange method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>) using the wild-type mouse TMEM16A(<italic>ac</italic>) as the template. Double and triple mutants were generated sequentially. All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Recordings were performed on inside-out patches excised from cells expressing the construct of interest. Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (O.D. 1.5, I.D. 0.86, Sutter Instrument) and were fire-polished with a microforge (Narishige) before use. Pipette resistance was typically 3–8 MΩ when standard recording solutions were used. Seal resistance was typically 4 GΩ or higher. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed using Axopatch 200B and Digidata 1550 (Molecular devices). Analogue signals were filtered through the in-built 4-pole Bessel filter at 5 kHz and were digitized at 10–20 kHz. Data acquisition was performed using Clampex 10.6 (Molecular devices). Solution exchange was achieved using a double-barreled theta glass pipette mounted on an ultra-high speed piezo-driven stepper (Siskiyou). Liquid junction potential was found to be consistently negligible given the ionic composition of the solutions and was therefore not corrected. All experiments were performed at 20 °C.</p><p>Recordings were performed under symmetrical ionic conditions. Stock solution with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA contained 150 mM NaCl, 5.99 mM Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.40. Stock solution with EGTA contained 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.40. Free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were adjusted by mixing the stock solutions at the required ratios, which were calculated using the WEBMAXC program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxcS.htm">http://web.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxcS.htm</ext-link>). Recording pipettes were filled with stock solution with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA, which has a free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 1 mM.</p><p>For Mg<sup>2+</sup> experiments, stock solution with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA contained 75 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 23 mM (NMDG)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.40. Free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were adjusted by mixing the stock solutions with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA and EGTA at the required ratios. For Gd<sup>3+</sup> experiments, the final Gd<sup>3+</sup> concentrations were reconstituted from a 1 M GdCl<sub>3</sub> stock in a solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.40 with no added Ca<sup>2+</sup> and metal chelators. In all cases, solutions were prepared in ultrapure molecular biology grade water having a resistivity of 15–18 MΩ cm at 25 °C (ELGA or Millipore).</p><p>Concentration-response relations were constructed from steady-state current responses recorded using a rundown-correction protocol as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). For instantaneous I-V relations, current responses were measured at the time points (within milliseconds) where the capacitive current at 0 mV, the membrane potential at which the current reverses, has decayed. The sequence of the applied voltage steps was from −100 to +120 mV to minimize the effect of rundown on the smaller inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a typical recording, the magnitude of the steady-state current at +80 mV would have decayed irreversibly by 10–15% by the time the test pulse at +120 mV is applied. To correct for this effect, the I-V plots were normalized to the current amplitude of the pre-pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paulino et al., 2017b</xref>) before their normalization (I/I<sub>+120</sub>). When used judiciously, this procedure allows one to recover the true I-V relation and to correct for current fluctuation. Before and after each recording at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of interest, we also recorded in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> to ensure that the quality of the patch did not deteriorate over time. Background subtraction was performed for constructs that do not display visible basal activity but was not possible for the mutants that do. In all cases, leaky patches were discarded.</p><p>A similar procedure was used for experiments with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Gd<sup>3+</sup>. In contrast to the divalent cations Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Gd<sup>3+</sup> binding appears to be biphasic consisting of a reversible phase and an irreversible component that both affect the I-V relation of the instantaneous current (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). In order to titrate the second reversible site, we first incubated the patch with a submaximal concentration of Gd<sup>3+</sup> (0.4 mM) to saturate the irreversible binding site. We then recorded at the test concentration of Gd<sup>3+</sup> to obtain the corresponding instantaneous I-V relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Concentration-response data were fitted to the Hill equation<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the normalized current, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the concentration at which <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> equals 0.5 and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the Hill coefficient.

Partial protein charges were derived from the CHARMM36 all-hydrogen atom force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>). Hydrogen positions were generated in CHARMM. <italic>In silico</italic> mutagenesis was carried out in CHARMM. The protein was assigned a dielectric constant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) of 2.

A 5-Å-thick slab was included on each side of the membrane to account for the headgroup region (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>= 30).

Electrostatic calculations were carried out in the absence of an applied voltage. Although the structure of the protein used for calculations might not display a fully activated conformation, conformational changes are assumed to be small and would mainly affect the narrow neck region for which the dielectric constant is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Paulino et al., 2017a</xref>). The region most relevant for this study concerns the wide intracellular vestibule, which was assigned bulk-like dielectric properties. In calculations of mutants, positively charged residues were introduced as protonated histidines instead of arginines for modeling purposes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Criss Hartzell (Reviewer#1) and Alessio Accardi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lam and Dutzler discover that the negatively charged residues that form the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites act as an electrostatic barrier for the flow of anions once the pore has adopted the open conformation, thus acting as an additional activation gate in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. By introducing mutations in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sites in constitutively active mutants of TMEM16A and measuring their I-V relations at various Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations, the authors show that the binding of calcium reduces the two innermost energy barriers of an open channel through an electrostatic mechanism, allowing ions to flow. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the constitutively active mutants display pronounced outward rectification due to this electrostatic effect. Overall, these studies highlight a novel mechanism of regulation of ion permeation by a ligand. Nevertheless, the reviewers raise several concerns that should be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I am not sure that I understand the permeation model. Why do the electrostatics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> affect only inward and not outward current? The energy profile in Figure 1D could not lead to rectification, because the height of each energy barrier is the same whether the ion is coming from the inside or the outside. Outward rectification requires an energy well between the barriers <italic>h</italic> and <italic>β</italic> so that the height of <italic>β</italic> is greater from the out&gt;in than the in&gt;out direction. It would seem that the depth of this well would be significant considering the degree of rectification observed.</p><p>2) Furthermore, the second paragraph of the subsection “Data analysis” states that <italic>σ<sub>h</sub></italic> and <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic> are voltage-independent, but Figure 1G seems to show that <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic> is voltage-dependent. The statement in the next paragraph is rather inscrutable, as is the subsequent explanation about why the &quot;decay&quot; was omitted from the fits. What does &quot;inaccurate estimation of <italic>σ<sub>β</sub></italic>&quot; mean? It would be useful to know how the conclusions are affected by changing <italic>n</italic> in Equation 2. And why is <italic>σ<sub>h</sub></italic> not shown beyond Figure 1?</p><p>3) Even though the G644P and Q649A mutations increase the baseline open probability of the channel, it is unclear whether the protein with any of these mutations still undergoes some gating-associated conformational changes. If this were the case, some of the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding on the rectification of the mutant channels could arise from these conformational changes rather than the simple electrostatic influence of the site and the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. To test for this possibility, the authors could use Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as it is reported to compete with Ca<sup>2+</sup> without activating the channel. The authors should test whether the presence of internal magnesium in the context of either of the constitutively active mutants has the same effect as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as expected from their proposed mechanism. Although it is not necessary, I think it would be also interesting to test whether a trivalent cation could also bind and have a larger effect than Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>4) Large portions of the data shown depend on the use of a permeation model for analysis, together with the use of several equations for permeation and electrostatics. I think these play such a central role in the manuscript that it would make the reading easier if some of these models and equations were described with more detail in the main text, rather than the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39122.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) I am not sure that I understand the permeation model.

We have explained this model in detail in our previous manuscript published in <italic>eLife</italic>, to which this work refers to (Paulino et al., 2017). In this model, ions surmount energy barriers in a pore that does not contain deep energy wells and that cannot be saturated. We think that such model is appropriate for our analysis since we have not found evidence for tight ion binding sites in our structures and we have measured a K<sub>M</sub> of chloride conduction between 300-400 mM, thus underlining that there is no saturation in the applied conditions (Paulino et al., 2017). The energy profile displayed in Figure 1D or Figure 1—figure supplement 1 represents the potential of mean force for permeation in the absence of an applied electric field, where, in symmetric ion concentrations, the system is at equilibrium and there is no net flux in either direction. Upon application of a potential difference, the model predicts ionic currents. In such case, rectification is a consequence of the asymmetric free energy profile. The location of the barrier maximum governs the shape of the I-V relation, which becomes increasingly outwardly rectifying when the barrier maximum moves closer to the inner end. We note that the I-V relation is a function of both occupancy and rate of barrier crossing. Unlike the pseudo-ohmic cases, in case of low symmetric barriers, where the total occupancy remains approximately constant, ion depletion occurs in cases of an increased intracellular barrier at negative voltages where the channel is less conductive while ion accumulation occurs at positive voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Both behaviors likely account for the resulting outward rectification and the general reduction in ion conductance.

If this were the case, some of the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding on the rectification of the mutant channels could arise from these conformational changes rather than the simple electrostatic influence of the site and the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. To test for this possibility, the authors could use Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as it is reported to compete with Ca<sup>2+</sup> without activating the channel. The authors should test whether the presence of internal magnesium in the context of either of the constitutively active mutants has the same effect as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as expected from their proposed mechanism. Although it is not necessary, I think it would be also interesting to test whether a trivalent cation could also bind and have a larger effect than Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gating-associated conformational changes may still exist. However, since for our analysis we characterize instantaneous currents following a voltage jump prior to any conformational changes, the I-V relations correspond to the open populations of the channel.</p><p>In our revised version, we have now investigated the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding on the conductance. For that purpose, we have recorded data at varying Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consistent with previous observations by Chen and colleagues (Ni et al., 2014), we found that Mg<sup>2+</sup> binds with an apparent affinity of around 1-2 mM. Although Mg<sup>2+</sup> addition does not lead to activation of WT, its binding to the mutant G644P lowers the energy barrier for anion conduction at the intracellular part of the pore, consistent with the presence of a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the site (as judged by the remaining rectification at high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration). This result thus further confirms our proposed mechanism on the influence of divalent cations in the transmembrane binding site on the energetics of anion conduction in the open channel. In another set of experiments, we have also investigated the effect of the trivalent metal ion Gd<sup>3+</sup> and found that the application of this ion at high µM concentrations exerts an even stronger effect than Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to slight inward rectification of currents. This behavior is consistent with a larger increase in the positive charge density after the binding of two Gd<sup>3+</sup> ions. However, in this case the effect was not completely reversible upon washout indicating an unmeasurably slow off-rate for one of the bound ions. It should also be noted that in the case of Gd<sup>3+</sup>, we could not buffer residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the solutions by addition of EGTA and we can thus not exclude the presence of traces of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the solutions. In light of our new data, we have added another subsection to our manuscript “The effect of the competitive antagonist Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and the trivalent cation Gd<sup>3+</sup> on conduction”) and an additional accompanying figure (see the new Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Large portions of the data shown depend on the use of a permeation model for analysis, together with the use of several equations for permeation and electrostatics. I think these play such a central role in the manuscript that it would make the reading easier if some of these models and equations were described with more detail in the main text, rather than the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two sentences to the Results where we discuss general features of the model and extended its description in the methods. However, we have already explained the same model in great detail in our preceding study, which the current manuscript is referring to, and think that the link to this previous study would help interested readers to gain in-depth insight. We also think that a more extended description of the model in the main part of the manuscript might distract readers from the main findings of the work.</p><p>The following sentences were added to the Results section:</p><p>“The diffusion path does not contain deep energy wells and the model does not account for saturation of the pore, which is generally consistent with the high K<sub>M</sub> for chloride conduction.”</p><p>“The rectification is a consequence of both pore occupancy and the rate of barrier crossing at the applied potential.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
