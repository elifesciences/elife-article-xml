intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and low back pain. Here, we found that RG-7112, a potent mouse double-minute two protein inhibitor, selectively kills senescent IVD cells through apoptosis. Gene expression pathway analysis was used to compare the functional networks of genes affected by RG-7112, a pure synthetic senolytic with o-Vanillin a natural and anti-inflammatory senolytic. Both affected a functional gene network related to cell death and survival. O-Vanillin also affected networks related to cell cycle progression as well as connective tissue development and function. Both senolytics effectively decreased the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of IVD cells. Furthermore, bioavailability and efficacy were verified ex vivo in the physiological environment of degenerating intact human discs where a single dose improved disc matrix homeostasis. Matrix improvement correlated with a reduction in senescent cells and SASP, supporting a translational potential of targeting senescent cells as a therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pain in the lower back affects about four in five people during their lifetime. Over time, the discs that provide cushioning between the vertebrae of the spine can degenerate, which can be one of the major causes of lower back pain.</p><p>It has been shown that when the cells of these discs are exposed to different stress factors, they stop growing and become irreversibly dormant. Such ‘senescent’ cells release a range of proteins and small molecules that lead to painful inflammation and further degeneration of the discs. Moreover, it is thought that a high number of senescent cells may be linked to other degenerative diseases such as arthritis.</p><p>Current treatments can only reduce the severity of the symptoms, but they cannot prevent the degeneration from progressing. Now, Cherif et al. set out to test the effects of two different compounds on human disc cells grown in the laboratory. One of the molecules studied, RG-7112, is a synthetic drug that has been approved for safety by the US Food and Drug Administration and has been shown to remove senescent cells. The other, o-Vanillin, is a natural compound that has anti-inflammatory and anti-senescence properties.</p><p>The results showed that both compounds were able to trigger changes to that helped new, healthy cells to grow and at the same time kill senescent cells. They also reduced the production of molecules linked to inflammation and pain.</p><p>Further analyses revealed that the compounds were able to strengthen the fibrous matrix that surrounds and supports the discs. Cherif et al. hope that this could form the basis for a new family of drugs for back pain to slow the degeneration of the discs and reduce pain. This may also have benefits for other similar degenerative diseases caused by cell senescence, such as arthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intervertebral disc</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>nucleus pulposus</kwd><kwd>annulus fibrosus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR MOP-119564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haglund</surname><given-names>Lisbet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000142</institution-id><institution>Arthritis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TPF-19-0513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherif</surname><given-names>Hosni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012013</institution-id><institution>Réseau de Recherche en Santé Buccodentaire et Osseuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherif</surname><given-names>Hosni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting senescent cells in human intervertebral discs, using senotherapeutics, provides a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent or reduce disc degeneration and pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain is a global health problem that is experienced by ~80% of individuals at some point in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vos et al., 2012</xref>). This problem is the number one single cause of years lived with disability with enormous personal and health system related costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care, and Education, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartvigsen et al., 2018</xref>). Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a major factor contributing to low back pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Adams and Hutton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vergroesen et al., 2015</xref>). The cellular pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and the mechanisms leading to pain are not fully understood. One novel approach to treat painful degeneration is to target cellular senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest occurring in response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>). Stress-induced premature senescence is caused by factors such as oxidative and genotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Toussaint et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that accumulation of senescent cells during tissue degeneration contributes directly to initiation and development of musculoskeletal degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>) and IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Maitre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>). Senescent cells secrete a range of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases termed as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herbig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuilman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). These SASP factors are suggested to further induce senescence in a paracrine manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta et al., 2013</xref>), to promote matrix catabolism and sterile inflammation in IVDs, thereby accelerating the degenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parrinello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tominaga, 2015</xref>). Elimination of senescent cells enhances disc tissue homeostasis in genetically modified progeroid Ercc1<sup>−/Δ22</sup> and p16‐3MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patil et al., 2019</xref>) mice suggesting that senotherapeutic drugs have great potential to treat low back pain resulting from IVD degeneration. The effect could potentially be mediated by apoptotic (senoptosis) or nonapoptotic (senolysis) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmitt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soto-Gamez and Demaria, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedernhofer and Robbins, 2018</xref>) or by modulating the SASP, indirectly suppressing senescence (senomorphics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soto-Gamez and Demaria, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Childs et al., 2017</xref>). Further, interest is growing toward the use of natural senotherapeutic compounds such as quercetin, fisetin and piperlongumine, curcumin and o-Vanillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>); their key advantages being low toxicity and great potential to be translated into clinical applications.</p><p>Cell-cycle arrest of senescent disc cells is mainly mediated by the two pathways: p53-p21-Rb and p16-Rb. During disc degeneration, both pathways are activated simultaneously to induce senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). The FDA-approved drug RG-7112 (RO5045337) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>) is a highly potent and selective MDM2 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tovar et al., 2013</xref>) that restores the physiological activity of p53. RG-7112 is the first nutlin family member to be assessed clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>) showing evidence of acceptable safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray-Coquard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Constantinidou et al., 2012</xref>). RG-7112 was reported to selectively kill senescent lung fibroblasts (IMR90) where senescence was induced by ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>). The natural compound o-Vanillin, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santosh Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marton et al., 2016</xref>), has recently been described for its senotherapeutic activity in human IVD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One caveat in the field is that there are currently no large bipedal animal models that mimic naturally occurring IVD degeneration and human genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). One solution to this caveat is the use of an intact disc culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gantenbein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenzweig et al., 2016</xref>) of human IVDs to test and develop new senotherapeutic drugs suitable for human disc degeneration.</p><p>Here, we utilized in vitro and ex vivo models, to assess the senotherapeutic effects of RG-7112 and o-Vanillin on naturally occurring senescent cells in degenerating human IVDs. We have previously shown that o-Vanillin has senolytic effects on senescent human IVD cells. o-Vanillin is a natural compound that in addition to its senolytic effect has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We compared the effect of o-Vanillin to RG-7112, a pure senolytic drug, that we found to efficiently kill senescent annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. The objective was to evaluate if o-Vanillin with its dual function could further reduces inflammatory factors released by non-senescent cells thus enhancing the therapeutic effect. We also aimed to establish if one or both drugs could reach and kill senescent IVD cells in their native environment of intact human disc with naturally occurring degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of the senotherapeutic activity of RG-7112</title><p>We aimed to compare the senotherapeutic activity of the natural senolytic o-Vanillin a natural senolytics with antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties with a pure synthetic senolytic drug. We chose the commercially available FDA approved drug RG-7112 as a candidate. A concentration of 5 μM RG-7112, shown as a safe and effective dose for human IMR90 lung fibroblasts, was used to evaluate its effect on senescent and non-senescent human IVD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>). Pellet cultures of IVD cells from degenerate NP and AF regions were exposed to RG-7112 for 4 days, the drug was removed, and the treated pellets were maintained for 21 days in standard media. Then, evaluated for cytotoxicity, senolytic and therapeutic activity. No cytotoxicity was observed following treatment. In contrast, both NP (9.87%; p&lt;0.05) and AF (11.87%; p&lt;0.05) cells showed a significant increase in metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pellet cultures were treated as before and the presence of p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>, Ki-67 and caspase-3 were analyzed after 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RG-7112 significantly decreased the percentage of p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> positive NP (11.48%; p&lt;0.001) and AF (20.03%; p&lt;0.0001) cells compared to untreated control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, RG-7112 significantly increased the percentage of Ki-67-positive NP (23.07%; p&lt;0.05) and AF (34.92%; p&lt;0.0001) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Finally, we investigated proteoglycan synthesis using the DMMB assay following treatment.

The relationship between the differentially up- and downregulated genes are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Compared with the control group, the number of differentially expressed genes for o-Vanillin were 40 (30 upregulated and 10 downregulated) and eight for RG-7112 (6 upregulated and two downregulated). In upregulated DEGs, three are common to both drugs, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), cell division cycle 25 c (CDC25c) and cyclin dependant kinase 2D (CDKN2D or p19<italic><sup>ARF</sup></italic>). No down-regulated DEGs were common to the drugs. Although cyclin B1 (CCNB1) is significantly expressed following the treatment with the two compounds, it is upregulated in RG-7112 and downregulated in o-Vanillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Next, we compared gene expression profiles of the o-Vanillin group with the RG-7112 group. Of the 91 evaluated, only eight genes were significantly affected by RG-7112 treatment, four were common to o-Vanillin (MAPK14, CCNB1, CDC25c and CDKN2D (p19<italic><sup>ARF</sup></italic>)), and four were exclusive to RG-7112 (MDM2, CDKN1A (p21<italic><sup>ARF</sup></italic>), E2F1 and RBL1). In contrast, 40 genes were significantly affected by o-Vanillin treatment.

To verify an effect on SASP, media of untreated NP cell pellets, RG-7112 and o-Vanillin-treated pellets were used. The media collected were from the same donors used for gene expression analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Samples were analyzed using an antibody array that simultaneously screen 80 factors. Out of the 80 factors present, 50 were detected in at least four donors and were included in further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A</xref>). The 25 most affected SASP factors are divided into four classes: Cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–a</xref>), chemokines CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–b</xref>), chemokines CXC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–c</xref>), growth and neurotrophic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–d</xref>). The most reduced factors following RG-7112 treatment compared with control were for cytokines (TNF-α; −78.05 ± 4.69%) (p=0.71), CC-chemokines (CCL26; −66.69 ± 7.09%) (p=0.93), CXC-chemokines (CXCL13; −29.02 ± 17.26%) (p=0.68), growth and neurotrophic factors (HGF; −65.24 ± 5.9%) (p=0.87). The top four factors decreased by o-Vanillin treatment were: IL-7 (−60,37 ± 11.46%) (p=0.5), CCL26 (−40,14 ± 3.41%) (p=0.99), CXCL10 (−18,11 ± 6,15%) (p=0.62) and HGF (−52,42 ± 5,45%) (p=0.96) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (a-d)). To better visualize the overall effect of the two drugs on SASPs release, a scatter plot of average changes was generated demonstrating a similar overall effect of the two senolytics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–e</xref>). The trends for all 80 factors are visualized in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The semi-quantitative cytokine array results were used to select 19 factor that were quantified with the Luminex assay. The 19 factors were selected based on the following criteria: only factors detected in all conditions and in at least four donors were chosen. These factors were selected to represent all the SASP classes and to include the most variably expressed cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The 19 factors selected for further investigation were (INF-γ, TNF-α, IL1-α, IL1-b, IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, Angiogenin and VEGF-A). The concentrations were measured and expression heatmap showed an overall decrease in the level of proinflammatory factors from both RG-7112 and o-Vanillin when compared to non-treated cultures. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The levels of INF-γ, IL-6, IL-8 and CCL24 were significantly decreased following both treatments whereas the decrease in CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and VEGF significance was reached only following o-Vanillin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Although, o-Vanillin reduced more SASP factors than RG-7112 at a significant level when compared to untreated cultures, there was no significant difference in concentrations between o-Vanillin and RG-7112-treated cultures, validating the similar overall effect the two drugs have on SASP factor release observed by cytokine array in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–f</xref>.

Treatment with curcumin and o-Vanillin reduced SASP factors released and enhanced matrix synthesis in a pellet culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of a synthetic pure senolytic compound with a natural anti-inflammatory and senolytic compound, to determine a potential enhanced therapeutic effect with the latter. We used o-Vanillin instead of curcumin, as o-Vanillin has higher specificity and better bioavailability. For a synthetic and pure senolytic we chose RG-7112, a drug with documented senotherapeutic effects in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>). Cells from degenerate discs or intact degenerate discs that correspond with the tissue targeted for treatment were used. Cells from degenrating tissue was used as it would be difficult to evaluate an effect of removing senescent cells in non-degenerate discs since they have have very few senescent cells. Here, we demonstrated that RG-7112 has a potent senotherapeutic and a strong proliferative effect on human IVD cells in vitro. Metabolic activity and extracellular matrix production were also increased in treated cultures. We verified that treatment specifically targets senescent cells by activating the caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. This is similar to the effect of UBX0101, an analogue of RG-7112 that triggers apoptosis of senescent chondrocytes in a murine osteoarthritis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, phase I and II clinical trials are in progress to assess safety, tolerability and clinical effects of single dose (NCT03513016 and NCT04129944) and both single and repeated doses (NCT04229225) of intra-articular administration of UBX0101 in patients with moderate to severe painful knee osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Deursen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vassilev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cellular senescence can be induced by replicative senescence or stress-induced premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The pathway and resulting changes in the microenvironment surrounding the cells depends on inducing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frolov and Dyson, 2004</xref>). In this study, we found gene expression modulation for a number of inflammatory and cell cycle genes following treatment with the two senolytics, o-Vanillin and RG-7112. We evaluated differential gene expression in 96 pre-selected genes to determine the mechanisms by which the compounds mediate their effects. Our data demonstrate that 91 of the genes were expressed at a detectable level and a significant effect was found on 50% of the expressed genes, supporting the senolytic activity of the two compounds in vitro. RG-7112 decreased gene expression of CDK1A and MDM2 and increased expression of the E2F1, RB factors, MAPK-14, CDK2D, CCNB1 and CDC25c. o-Vanillin modulated gene expression of 40 genes including upregulation of cell cycle genes such as CDK6, CDK2C, CDK2D, and CDC25c while expression levels of CDK2A, Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1 and CCNB1 were decreased.</p><p>Collectively, the data support the mechanistic action of RG-7112 to stabilize p53 and p21 by attenuating the MDM2-p53 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tovar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henley and Dick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Che et al., 2020</xref>). Also, it confirms regulation of the RB–E2F1 pathway that releases E2F1 and activates genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andreeff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Another example of a senolytic drug that interferes with the E3 ubiquitin ligase-MDM2-p53 mechanism is UBX0101, which triggers apoptosis of senescent cells in articular cartilage and synovium in a murine osteoarthritis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>). o-Vanillin treatment affected multiple pathways suggesting that o-Vanillin eliminates senescent cells both by apoptosis and non-apoptotic means. Recently, p16 deletion in NP cells from mouse discs with induced degeneration was shown to also upregulate the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and transcription factor E2F<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Che et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Clinical trials with RG-7112 for cancer treatment were limited by the high incidence of hematological toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray-Coquard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we used a lower concentration (5 μM) and short exposure time of RG-7112, in contrast to the high and toxic doses used in cancer therapy (20–1400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administrated daily for 10 days). This may prevent these side effects in patients treated for IVD degeneration. This hypothesis was verified by the clinical study of the RG-7112 analogue UBX0101 in patients diagnosed with painful osteoarthritis of the knee. An administered dose of 4 mg was safe and well-tolerated, and it improved pain scores, reduced SASP factors and disease-related biomarkers after a single dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laberge et al., 2018</xref>). The activation of multiple pathways following o-Vanillin treatment and within the selected set of 91 genes implies that diverse biological processes are affected, which was also reported for other natural senolytics like Quercetin, Fisetin, and Dasatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pezet and McMahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Although it is difficult to determine how these natural senolytics eliminate senescent cells and drive their therapeutic effects, the activation of several mechanisms increases their capacity to target the heterogeneous cellular states acquired by senescent cells after the initial growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frolov and Dyson, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We further sought to determine if the two senolytics had apparent effects on the SASP secretome. Conditioned media of pellet cultures was analyzed by cytokine array following treatment. Although donor variation was observed, notable changes between treatment groups were found indicating an overall decrease in the majority of the SASP factors analyzed. Similar decrease in the SASP factors was observed following p16 deletion in NP cells in mice with induced disc degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yousefzadeh et al., 2018</xref>). An antiinflammatory effect was expected for o-Vanillin from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santosh Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marton et al., 2016</xref>). However, our study documents, for the first time, antiinflammatory properties of RG-7112 in human IVD cells. We selected 19 factors from the initial screening associated with SASP and measured their concentrations using a Luminex immunoassay. In general, concentrations were decreased in response to treatment. RG-7112 significantly reduced the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-6 and CCL24 while o-Vanillin in addition reduced factors IL-8, CCL7, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and VEGF-A. These factors are known for their implication in painful IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acosta and Gil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>) and for promoting senescence of surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams et al., 2015</xref>). For example, IL-8 and chemokines binding to the C-X-C motif chemokine receptors is needed for the establishment and maintenance of senescence. CCL7 expression has been reported to be concordant with IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binch et al., 2014</xref>) and it has previously been described as a SASP factor involved in IVD cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, the decrease of VEGF-A indicates a possible role of o-Vanillin to block the mechanism of neovascularization. VEGF and its receptors have been proposed to be closely correlated with inflammation, chronic back pain and accelerated IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freemont et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thompson et al., 1991</xref>). These results consolidate the senolytic effect of the two compounds and suggest a potential role in reducing degenerative factors in human discs with o-Vanillin having a possible stronger and broader antiinflammatory effect.</p><p>Animal models that replicate human disc pathology are limited due to the differences in anatomy, disc size, cell type, and loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, notochord cells are retained longer in the majority of animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grezella et al., 2018</xref>), further increasing the difference between humans and animals. Thus, we previously developed and validated an ex vivo intact human disc culture system to study the potential for biologic repair and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawri et al., 2011</xref>). Matrix differences were quantified pre- and post-treatment by T1ρ weighted MRI that directly correlates with proteoglycan content in the IVDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenzweig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mulligan, 2015</xref>). When comparing the intensity in RG-7112 and o-Vanillin-treated IVDs, we observed an increased intensity post-treatment, while a decrease was observed in vehicle-treated control. This suggests that treatment with senolytics could increase proteoglycan content in human patients. It also validates our results from the pellet cultures where the proteoglycan content also increased significantly in the treated cultures. The improvement of T1ρ MRI values was validated by the consistent high levels of proteoglycan content in the treated IVDs. We further verified that the improved matrix was linked to removal of senescent cells. Indeed, both compounds significantly reduced the number of p16<italic><sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-positive cells in treated discs. Moreover, we observed a slight but non-significant increase in proliferating cells. These findings correlate with the negative impact previously reported between the number of senescent cells and cell proliferation during IVD degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, culture media from control discs, showed no change in cytokine release whereas both compounds decreased levels of IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL6, CCL2, CCL22, GROa/b/g, IGFBP-2, TNSF-14 and OPN. Moreover, we observed a significant increase of EGF in the media from o-Vanillin treated discs. The positive effects of EGF on proteoglycan synthesis were first reported by Thompson et al.; these effects were more pronounced in the NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Together the results demonstrate an overall decrease in SASP factors following treatment. The difference in SASP compounds affected by the two drugs could be explained by the difference in selectivity and the specificity of the drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gawri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared the SASP factors release in pellet and disc culture media. The common SASP factors that were downregulated include INF-γ, IL-6, CCL24, CXCL1, CXCL10 and Angiogenin. Interestingly, o-Vanillin also significantly reduced the levels of IL8, CCL7, CXCL5, CXCL9 and VEGF-A. This could be due to the effect on the neighboring non-senescent cells. Consistent with prior literature, this decrease highlights the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties of o-Vanillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santosh Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marton et al., 2016</xref>).

Colors, ranging from blue to grey then red, for each treatment represents the average fold change of each subject in that group.</p><p>Differentially expressed genes were subjected to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and used as a starting point for building biological networks. This analysis uses computational algorithms to identify networks consisting of focus genes (genes that were present in our list of 91 genes) and their interactions with other genes (‘non-focused’) in the knowledge base. Scores were calculated for each network according to the fit of the network to the set of focus genes and used to rank networks on the Ingenuity analysis. IPA uses the genes from the highest-scoring network to extract a connectivity pathway that relates candidate genes to each other based on their interactions. The involved function and disease significantly associated with these candidates’ genes were shown. To generate the networks, significant pathways were filtered by p-value (α)&lt;0.05 and activation Z-score &gt; −2 or &gt;2, set as the cut-off values and representing a significant deactivation or activation, respectively.</p><p>Colors are based on log2 fold changes on these genes. To rank networks of the IPA, p-scores were calculated from p-values. For example, for n genes in the network and f of them are Focus Genes. The p-value is the probability of finding f or more Focus Genes in a set of n genes randomly selected from the Global Molecular Network calculated using Fisher’s exact test. Since interesting p-values are typically quite low, it is visually easier to concentrate on the exponent and the p-score is defined as p-score = -log10(p-value). Networks with a score ≥2 have at least 99% confidence that indicate a 1/100 chance that the focus genes are in a network because of random chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ex-vivo organ culture and MRI analysis</title><p>Intact lumbar spines were x-rayed, and discs were selected for the study based on the grading system described by Wilke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Page et al., 1993</xref>). Discs with a Wilke grade of 2 were included for this study. Three IVDs from the same spine (n = 4 spines, 12 discs) were isolated and cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenzweig et al., 2016</xref>). Disc characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. Isolated discs were scanned by MRI before and after treatment at day 28 as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenzweig et al., 2018</xref>. Images were obtained on a 7T Bruker BioSpec 70/30 USR (Bruker Biospin, Milton, ON, Canada) with the high-performance mini-imaging kit gradient upgrade AVIII electronics (Bruker) and a Bruker-issued T1ρ-RARE pulse sequence, as previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenzweig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mulligan, 2015</xref>). Briefly, 3D images were acquired and T1ρ values were quantified using the MIPAV software (NIH Center for Information Technology, Bethesda, MD, USA). T1ρ values of the same region of interest (ROI) of ʹbeforeʹ and ʹafterʹ treatment scans of each disc were normalized to the surrounding culture medium using editing features in MIPAV software. After 4 days of culture and one media change, single injection of the discs with vehicle, RG-7112 (5 μM/g disc) or 100 μM o-Vanillin (100 μM/g disc) in a total volume of 200 μl PBS was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenzweig et al., 2016</xref>). Discs were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1x Glutamax, 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1% FBS for 28 days. Media was changed and collected every 4 days. On day 28 and after MRI imaging, discs were prepared for immunohistochemistry as described below (See Intact IVD Tissue Immunohistochemistry). Conditioned media was collected at each change and frozen as individual samples at −80°C for protein analysis.</p><p>Preliminary measures to delimitate the NP region of interest (ROI) were calculated using 11-disc images from random organ donors. A contour was drawn around the disc using a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet and stylus (Wacom, Japan). This polygon was used to measure total disc voxel intensity. The NP area was created by reshaping the original disc contour to 30% of its frontal size and 40% of its sagittal size centered around the middle of NP area, which was calculated to be 10% shift below the center of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). The T1ρ images were manually cropped around the perimeter of the IVDs. The average of the T1ρ values was calculated within the ROIs for the vehicle and the injected discs slices per image. Heat maps representing signal intensity were created using the MIPAV software.</p><p>Age of an individual donor is specified in years. The level of the disc injected with either DMSO, O-Vanillin, and RG-7112 from the lumbar region is indicated. Discs were graded based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilke et al., 2006</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Page et al., 1993</xref>). Disc height was determined by averaging the dorsal, ventral and midsection disc height. No differences in grade or height were found between groups prior to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Human cytokine array of pellet and intact IVD culture media</title><p>Media from the Degenerate NP Pellet used in gene expression analysis was collected from day 4 to day 21 and pooled separately for each group (vehicle, o-Vanillin and RG-7112) and subject. Then, they were analyzed and compared to evaluate the effect of the two senolytics on SASP release. Disc media collected from day 4 (pre-treatment) and day 28 (post-treatment) were analyzed separately for each disc and each factor. The Human Cytokine Antibody Array C5 (RayBiotech, Inc) was used for semi quantitative detection of 80 proteins according to manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krock et al., 2014</xref>). Intensity units were detected by the chemiluminescence using an ImageQuant LAS4000 Image Analyzer (GE Healthcare, Baie d'Urfe, QC, Canada) and analyzed with ImageQuant TL array analysis software (GE Healthcare). The relative quantity of each factor present in each media sample was normalized to the positive and negative controls included on the array. Mean relative concentration of each factor of treated and control groups were then calculated. Data was normalized to secretion of vehicle injected discs from the same donor spine.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Haglund and colleagues seeks to test the potential of senolytic drugs as a therapeutic strategy against intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) in humans. Using two senolytic compounds, o-Vanillin and RG-7112, the authors demonstrated their abilities to selectively kill senescent cells and to reduce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in a cell culture model of IDD, and discovered the gene regulatory networks that are common and distinct between the two drugs by transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, using ex vivo model of IDD, the authors showed similar senolytic effects to those found in in vitro model. The study presents a well-designed work, particularly in using the ex vivo model of IDD to demonstrate the physiological relevance and the potential of senolytics against IDD in humans, which will certainly be of general interest to the community of researchers studying the biology of aging. Both reviewers agreed that the study provides interesting insights into senescence and senolytics in IDD, and should be of broad interest. However, as detailed below, a number of concerns were also raised, relating in large part to insufficient clarity in the current version with respect to the authors' methods and the limitations of their approach and data presentation/interpretation, and the rationale behind the choice of drugs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rationale on the choice of two drugs should be clarified, as it seems that they are &quot;arbitrarily&quot; included together in the same manuscript. In particular, since the authors have already demonstrated the senolytic effects of o-Vanillin in in vitro IVD model, what was the rational for showing the effects of yet another drug, RG-7112, in a descriptive way rather than delving deeper into the mechanisms of o-Vanillin? Is one better than the other? Would they be expected to target fundamentally unique and complementary pathways? In light of the recent studies showing that the combination of senolytic drugs, e.g. dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), selectively targets a broader range of senescent cell types than alone (Xu et al., Nature Medicine, 2019), why not testing the potential of the combo treatment?</p><p>2) The relationship and rationale of comparing metabolic activities measured at day 4 of treatment vs. assessments of senescence measured at day 21 of treatment need to be clarified.</p><p>3) The descriptions on transcriptome data analysis are inadequate and need improvement as follows:</p><p>a) It needs more information as to how the transcriptome analysis was performed in the Materials and methods section. It is not even clear if it was genome-wide or candidate approach. Description of samples, materials, and basic workflows are needed, and information on data availability (GEO and accession number) should be provided.</p><p>b) It needs more reasoning and better interpretation to enhance readability to non-specialists in the field of cellular networks and bioinformatics.</p><p>c) While information on IVD samples are tabled, it would be important to provide a general logic and information on grouping of the different tissue/cell samples for each of the analysis. For examples, in each of the comparative analyses, were the same cells used in the control and tested experiments? If they were different, how would this affect the interpretation and statistical analyses? In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it is difficult to locate data generated from different sources and compared with n=6, 3 and 8, and the degenerative score of the cells and tissues etc.</p><p>d) The presentation of the genes and gene numbers from each of the treatments with RG-7112 or o-Vanillin were complex and the information provided is not easy to follow. The authors concluded that distinct senescence pathways are affected based on 8 genes affected by RG-7112 treatment and 40 genes by o-Vanillin, but only 2 genes common to both. They need to provide more information to better understand the results. For example, in Figure 2, a volcano plot and a venn diagram will be useful with statistical test to assess the overlaps. In Figure 2A, how are the genes in heat map ordered vertically; from hierarchical clustering or just shown as a dendrogram? Further, how was the clustering performed; using Spearman or Euclidean, and the linkage (average or complete)? The information provided in subsection “Bioinformatics Analysis” is too vague.</p><p>e) It was also unclear which gene sets were used for the IPA, the entire RNA-seq data or a selection that also included the differentially expressed genes. From the data and networks provided, the authors need to state clearly what the new insights, as they appear to be the expected pathways, were. The information provided in the Results section on the IPA pathways are superficial. IPA is very generic, it does not consider species, tissue, development stage, disease/control etc.; thus cautions need to be taken in not over-interpreting the IPA. Importantly, statistics is needed to support the conclusions. For example, what are the P-values of the networks in Figure 2 (B)-(E)? Are they the most significant ones? Were there others that you didn't show? The authors need to clarify these points in the Materials and methods.</p><p>f) Finally, it should be avoided to make conclusive statements when there is only a trend without statistical significance.</p><p>4) The descriptions on the SASP analysis need clarifications as follows:</p><p>a) Logic of the data presentation in Figure 3 is confusing and inconsistent. The authors should provide a clear picture as to the number of factors tested, affected, and chosen to be further followed-up and with proper statistical analysis. Please provide a scatter-plot of the SASPs' average changes per drug in Figure 3A, in order to show potential of co-linearity in the responses. Explain why the Luminex assay was used to reassess the 19 factors: Is this more accurate and quantitative, and how are the two assay correlated?</p><p>b) The heat map of the 19 gene panel in Figure 3B suggests similar and different patterns of change between the two treatments. Provide information on age, sex, degenerative score, and other IVD characteristics on the two individuals in the RG-7112 treatment that seem to be different. Are the same set of cells used for the respective control and treatments? Such information seem to be missing and nor discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>c) The gene information obtained seem not have contributed to additional analyses, as the authors then moved specifically to an analysis of SASPs which were not implicated in the network data. Since they indicate &quot;To verify the effect of RG-7112 and o-Vanillin on SASP factor release…&quot;, perhaps the authors could make some links here to SASP to present a better flow and logic. Again, please state whether the same cells were used in the control, RG7112 and o-Vanillin assessments. This would be important in the interpretation of the gene differences.</p><p>5) For the T1p-weighted MRI and disc matrix data, more description and clarity on the organ culture and data analysis need to be provided. For example, are the MRI and immunostaining data from a single injection? Further, were the medium collected from these discs for the measurement of SASP shown in Figure 5? Statistical analysis should be performed to support the conclusions made.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Senotherapeutic drugs for human intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The authors have made concerted effects to constructively address the concerns and criticisms raised by two reviewers who agree that the revised manuscript has improved. However, reviewer #2 still has questions and concerns which are mostly pertinent to gene expression analysis. Before publication, these should be addressed to further improve the clarity and transparency of the manuscript. I would like to encourage the authors to revise the manuscript to address the specific suggestions and questions raised by reviewer 2. My recommendation is as follows:</p><p>1) Clarify gene expression variability vs genetic variation: In the methodology under the &quot;bioinformatics analysis&quot;, the author indicated they &quot;conducted a gene association study that focus at the genetic variation associated with degenerate nucleus pulposus cell&quot;. This is not a genetic study but a study in gene expression?</p><p>2) Describe selection criteria and provide the full list of 91 genes in supplement: It is also stated that it is &quot;a pre-specified set of apoptotic and senescence-genes of interest&quot;. How were the 91 genes selected and a need to show the full list? As this are preselected, there would be a bias on the potential pathway networks, and thus the differentially expressed genes are confined within this gene set and one would expect specific pathways to be within this set. Therefore, it would be appropriate to disclose the existing pathways within this set of 91 genes, and estimate the selectivity of this pathway in the DEGs for RG-7112 or O-Vanillin.</p><p>3) Provide a line or two justification, e.g transcriptome analysis provides candidate gene sets and shorten the discussion around the DEGs: I do not think the transcriptome data added value but rather confusion as the gene set were pre-selected for apoptosis and senescence pathways, and the need to study SASP does not seem to be directly linked to this dataset. Therefore, I would be rather careful in placing a lot of weight on this data, as much of the discussion evolved around the DEGs.</p><p>4) Rephrase the sentences not to mislead: I still have concern that the authors continue to stretch the boundary of suggestive results that have not reach statistical significance. Suggesting a trend in the absence of statistical support is not scientific. Thus statements such as &quot;approaching significance&quot; and &quot;slightly non-significant increase&quot; should be avoided, as the data presented indicated there is not difference. Once can never predict how the values will changed with more data point.</p><p>5) Indicate that they were selected as candidates from the transcriptome analysis: In the main text, it is described as &quot;RNA-Seq analysis&quot;. This is not correct, as the authors should clearly indicate they are not testing RNA-Seq genome-wide, but only 91 selected genes. Very confusing.</p><p>6) Describe in the text the nature of the 4 overlapped genes and their directional impact: In Figure 2A, is the venn diagram included both up and down-regulated DEGs? May consider providing separate Venn diagrams, for up- and down-regulated genes. Also, need to provide an odds-ratio for the overlaps, and a p-value for the Chi-square test of co-occurrence. A crude estimate is that by chance alone, if you randomly sample 8 genes from 91, and another 40 from 91, you will get 8*40/91=3.51, and in reality you detect 4 genes in overlap, which is not much more than by chance. Further, should indicate the identity of these 4 overlapping genes.</p><p>7) Clarify if FDR or p values were used for cut-off for DEGs: It was indicated a p&lt;0.05 was used as cutoff for DEGs, &quot;Of the 91 genes tested, 44 were differentially expressed with a P&lt;0.05 in one or both treatments (Figure 2B)&quot;. But in Figure 2C, the author indicated using &quot;logFDR&quot;. Therefore, which measure was used for the cutoff?</p><p>8) In the figure legend, Y axis is indicated as log10 of the p-values while in the Figure 2C, log (FDR). Clarify which one: Remake the Figure 2C so that two drug effects can be easily differentiated: For the vertical axis in Figure 2C, is it log(FDR) or log10FDR ? as typically, &quot;log10FDR&quot; is used. In Figure 2C, genes can be better illustrated with different colours for gene with logFC &gt;0 and those &lt;0, and different shape for the drugs, or separate volcano plots. For insignificant genes, use grey. Further, this figure is problematic to me; as it does not seem to reflect a typical volcano plot. If FDR used, then many of the non-significant p-values would be 1.0, and the Log of 1 is zero. So, many more of the values should be around zero. Some explanation needed.</p><p>9) It is OK to leave as they are: For Figure 2(D) to (G), for each of these networks, how unusual is it to observe this? Given the bias, you are bound to have some networks, even by randomly selecting genes into IPA. Can the authors provide the p values or FDR to address this, and label them on the figures directly?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I have no further comments. The authors admirably addressed my concerns and should be commended for a careful and thorough revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript has improved in logic and additional information provided have addressed most of my concerns.

It is proposed that, the inflammatory environment triggered by senescent cells prevents adjacent cells from maintaining tissue homeostasis (1-3) and it is proposed to induce senescence in a paracrine manner thus exacerbating tissue deterioration (4). The rational for comparing the two drugs was to evaluate if natural senolytics with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties (like o-Vanillin) in addition to their senolytic effect further reduces inflammatory factors released by non-senescent cells thus enhancing the therapeutic effect (5-8). RG-7112, a pure senolytic without documented anti-inflammatory effects, was used for comparison. Another reason to test the two different drugs was to evaluate bioavailability to cells in their native environment. It was not known if either of the drugs could reach and kill senescent cells embedded in their native environment. A reason to select RG7112 instead of other available senolytic agents was that it is an analogue of UBX0101, a nutilin-3a inhibitor that also targets the p53/MDM2 interaction (9-10). UBX0101, is currently in clinical trials to treat knee osteoarthritis, it promotes clearance of senescent cells in cartilage from patients with knee osteoarthritis (9, 11). Articular cartilage and IVD tissue share many characteristics both at the environmental, cellular and molecular level and we hypothesized that a drug effective in articular cartilage would have a good chance of also working in the IVD. RG-7112 is an FDA approved drug (12) and was the first MDM2 inhibitor to be advanced into Phase I human clinical trials (NCT01164033, NCT01143740, NCT00623870, NCT00559533), to treat a wide range of cancers (13-16). Altogether, the similarities to UBX0101, the safety and promising clinical properties of RG-7112 as well as repurposing this approved drug may offer an efficient drug development pathway for treatments of intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain with few or no therapeutic options. We clarified the rationale for choosing the two drugs in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is one better than the other? Would they be expected to target fundamentally unique and complementary pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>The pathway affected by RG7112 was known while the mode of action was unknown for o-Vanillin. The two major pathways mediating cell-cycle arrest during disc degeneration are p53-p21-Rb and p16-Rb (17). Although both drugs activate cyclin-dependent-kinases (CDKs: cdk4 and cdk6) directing senescent cells to apoptosis and nonsenescent cells to proliferation, they act on two different upstream pathways. RG-7112 act on the MDM2-p53 interaction to reduce p21 accumulation leading to the suppression of its inhibitory effect of CDKs. This was confirmed in the pathway analysis. The data presented here is showing that o-Vanillin act by reducing p16 and suppressing the inhibitory effect on CDKs. Our findings suggest that the compounds result in a similar end result that can be explained by the activation of the same downstream effectors: CDKs-E2F-RB (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). At this level of the study, our first and most important goal was to determine that the drugs could reach the target cells and remove senescent cells and associated inflammatory factors in native intact human IVD tissue.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54693-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In light of the recent studies showing that the combination of senolytic drugs, e.g. dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), selectively targets a broader range of senescent cell types than alone (Xu et al., Nature Medicine, 2019), why not testing the potential of the combo treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that the combination would have a stronger effect. However, we found that the drugs removed both senescent NP and AF cells. Xu et al. used Dasatanib and Quercetin since the senescent cell associated pathways (SCAPs) of senescent preadipocytes differed considerably from those of senescent endothelial cells and that one drug could not remove both types (18). Similar navitoclax, a BCL‐2 prosurvival pathway inhibitor, lacks senolytic effect in adipose tissue, but displays a strong effect on senescent endothelial cells and fibroblasts (19-20). Combining drugs allowed targeting of heterogenous senescent cell populations in conditions where they are spread across multiple organs (6). For example, ongoing clinical trials using systemic administration of D+Q include diseases with senescent cells in multiple tissues such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney disease and hematopoietic stem cells. For local osteoarthritis treatment, a single drug, UBX0101, was used to target senescent chondrocytes (8). In our study we aimed to target localized natural occurring senescent disc cells using local administration of o-Vanillin or RG-7112. We chose to initially test them separately as the supply of live intact human IVDs are very limited. Further, single treatment may reduce side effects like those frequently reported for D+Q therapy, including respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal discomfort or heartburn (21). We agree that it will be important to evaluate the combination especially in vivo. Preclinical animal experiments will be performed to optimize frequency of treatment as well as to verify safety and tolerability, and determine specific, senolytic effects of single or combination treatments for intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relationship and rationale of comparing metabolic activities measured at day 4 of treatment vs. assessments of senescence measured at day 21 of treatment need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between metabolic activity and the assessments of senescence. No measure was performed at 4 days, both metabolic activity and assessments of senescence were performed at 21 days for disc cell cultured in pellet. Metabolic activity, measured in pellet cultures, was used to determine a safe dose without cytotoxicity to non-senescent cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We treated the cells for a four-day period. Cytotoxicity and senolytic effect of the treatment, was then evaluated at day 21 to allow for the drugs to take effect and also to verify a sustained effect Figure 1(A-D). In Monolayer culture, the rationale behind the comparison of the effect of the treatment in the cells from degenerate and non-degenerate discs is to confirm the senolytic activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) and the safety of RG-7112 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). We modified the text accordingly in the Results and the Materials and methods sections to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The descriptions on transcriptome data analysis are inadequate and need improvement as follows:</p><p>a) It needs more information as to how the transcriptome analysis was performed in the Materials and methods section. It is not even clear if it was genome-wide or candidate approach. Description of samples, materials, and basic workflows are needed, and information on data availability (GEO and accession number) should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the constructive comment. We have now further described the samples, materials and workflow in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript and in the legend of Figure 2. This small dataset of a candidate approach might not need GEO submission as all data related to Figure 2 is now available in the attached source data files of Figure 2: Figure 2—source-data 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source-data 1 and the Supplementary File 3 (a-d). In brief, we conducted a candidate gene association study to evaluate the variation in gene expression profiles associated with treated and non-treated cells within a pre-selected set of apoptotic and senescence-genes of interest. This approach offers the advantage that highly relevant genes can be identified and tested first. The candidate genes examined in this pathway approach allowed us also to identify the genes and aggregate of genes that together carry out the drug response of disc cells to the senolytic treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It needs more reasoning and better interpretation to enhance readability to non-specialists in the field of cellular networks and bioinformatics.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers comment and have modified the text in the Results section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) While information on IVD samples are tabled, it would be important to provide a general logic and information on grouping of the different tissue/cell samples for each of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this concern. In Table 2, we linked each result of the assays, cultures and cell type used as well as disc level and the donor from which the samples were obtained. To more precisely clarify the link between the tissue and cells used with the results, we indicated in Table 2 the degeneration score (according to Thompson grading scale) and state (degenerate and non-degenerate) of each of the intact discs. We evaluated cells from degenerate discs as well as intact degenerate disc as this would correspond with the tissue targeted for treatment. In addition, it would be difficult to evaluate an effect of removing senescent cells in non-degenerate discs as they have very few senescent cells (5). The effect of the two senolytics on cells from non-degenerate discs was done to confirms their safety for healthy cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). Also, we clarified the logic behind grouping different samples in the figure’s legends and our revised text and we added the donor ID number and gender for each of the heatmaps in Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 5C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1-A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For examples, in each of the comparative analyses, were the same cells used in the control and tested experiments? If they were different, how would this affect the interpretation and statistical analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>In the comparative analyses, we always used cells from the same donor for control and experimental conditions. the number (n) in each experiment represent the number of donors used to replicate the experiment with the same conditions (biological replicates).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it is difficult to locate data generated from different sources and compared with n=6, 3 and 8, and the degenerative score of the cells and tissues etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The data generated in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is obtained from independent experiments, using complementary assays, to demonstrate the senolytic activity of RG-7112. Thus, they cannot be directly compared. Figure 1—figure supplement 1A is verifying that the RG-7112 concentration selected from the literature (22-23) has no cytotoxic effect on human IVD cells. Metabolic activity is compared between RG7112 treated and untreated cells from 6 donors (Table 2). Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and 1C demonstrate the apoptotic effect RG-7112 in NP cells from 3 donors. Figure 1—figure supplement 1D illustrates the senolytic activity of RG-7112 by immunostaining, where apoptotic caspase 3 positive cells are also p16<italic><sup>ink4a</sup></italic> positive while proliferating ki-67 positive cells are not p16<italic><sup>ink4a</sup></italic> positive (NP cells from 3 different donors). Figure 1—figure supplement 1E confirm the apoptotic effect of RG-7112 observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and 1C by an increase of caspase3/7 activity in degenerate NP cells, where there are more senescent cells compared to non-degenerate cells. Figure 1—figure supplement 1F validate the safety of RG-7112 in both degenerate and non-degenerate cells by showing similar metabolic activity. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-1F, NP cells used were from 4 degenerate and 4 nondegenerate discs for a total number n = 8. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1G we used pellet culture media of NP and AF cells from 6 donors to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the treatment with RG-7112 on proteoglycan synthesis (sGAG release). The degenerative state for each disc used in each of the assays presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 are included in Table 2 in the revised manuscript. We modified the text accordingly in the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 1, the Results and the Materials and methods sections in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The presentation of the genes and gene numbers from each of the treatments with RG-7112 or o-Vanillin were complex and the information provided is not easy to follow. The authors concluded that distinct senescence pathways are affected based on 8 genes affected by RG-7112 treatment and 40 genes by o-Vanillin, but only 2 genes common to both. They need to provide more information to better understand the results. For example, in Figure 2, a volcano plot and a venn diagram will be useful with statistical test to assess the overlaps.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this request and accordingly we included new figures and tables to clarify the information provided. Please see Figure 2A, Figure 2C and the Supplementary File 3 (a-d). Better interpretation of the results is now included in the new version of the manuscript (please see response in 3. 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2A, how are the genes in heat map ordered vertically; from hierarchical clustering or just shown as a dendrogram? Further, how was the clustering performed; using Spearman or Euclidean, and the linkage (average or complete)? The information provided in subsection “Bioinformatics Analysis” is too vague.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2B, (Figure 2A in the previous version), the significant differentially expressed genes in the heat map were ordered vertically from hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance metric and complete linkage clustering method. The text of the Materials and methods section was modified accordingly in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) It was also unclear which gene sets were used for the IPA, the entire RNA-seq data or a selection that also included the differentially expressed genes. From the data and networks provided, the authors need to state clearly what the new insights, as they appear to be the expected pathways, were. The information provided in the Results section on the IPA pathways are superficial. IPA is very generic, it does not consider species, tissue, development stage, disease/control etc.; thus cautions need to be taken in not over-interpreting the IPA. Importantly, statistics is needed to support the conclusions. For example, what are the P-values of the networks in Figure 2 (B)-(E)? Are they the most significant ones? Were there others that you didn't show? The authors need to clarify these points in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully accept this as a valid comment. in Figure 2 (D)-(G) (B-E in the old version), only the differentially expressed genes (P &lt; 0.05) were included in the network analysis. We clarified the experimental procedures of signaling pathway analysis using IPA in the revised version of the manuscript. We also included new supplemental tables in the Supplementary File 3 (a-d) for the average fold change of all the genes (differentially and non-differentially expressed) in the o-Vanillin and RG-7112 treated NP pellets as well as their respective p values and tables in the Supplementary File 4 (a-b) for the significance scores, focus molecules used to reorder the networks and determine the possible physical function of each compound. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have modified the IPA results, legends and discussion in the new version of the manuscript to highlight the new insights and better interpret our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Finally, it should be avoided to make conclusive statements when there is only a trend without statistical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we modified the conclusive statements where statistical significance was not reached.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The descriptions on the SASP analysis need clarifications as follows:</p><p>a) Logic of the data presentation in Figure 3 is confusing and inconsistent. The authors should provide a clear picture as to the number of factors tested, affected, and chosen to be further followed-up and with proper statistical analysis. Please provide a scatter-plot of the SASPs' average changes per drug in Figure 3A, in order to show potential of co-linearity in the responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the reviewer’s comments. Therefore, we added in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, in our revised manuscript, a descriptive schematic to summarize the number of factors tested, factors detectable by the cytokine array and factors selected for Luminex assay. We modified the text accordingly in the new version of the manuscript to better describe the analysis and discuss the results. The complete list of the factors analyzed by cytokine array and Luminex assay in Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1are included in the corresponding source data files uploaded with the manuscript. As suggested, we revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and classified the SASP factors in 4 groups: cytokines, chemokines (CC and CXC series), growth and neurotrophic factors and we showed the most downregulated factors in each class. Also, to better visualize the average effect of the two drugs on SASPs release, a scatter plot representing the average change for 50 factors is included in the new version of the manuscript in Figure 3A (e) and subsection “RG-7112 and o-Vanillin reduced inflammatory factors”. Statistical analysis was performed for both cytokine array and Luminex analysis in pellets and discs cultures. Significances, is highlighted in the figures and their respective legends when applicable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explain why the Luminex assay was used to reassess the 19 factors: Is this more accurate and quantitative, and how are the two assay correlated?</p></disp-quote><p>Both used the same media from the same donors. Cytokine array was used to semi-quantitative screen 80 factors. Most factors were modulated by the two senolytics (in both pellets and intact disc). Luminex assay is more sensitive and it allowed us to measure the concentrations of selected factors in all conditions. The choice of the 19 factors were based on the cytokine array as follows: only factors detected in all conditions and in at least four donors were chosen. These factors were selected to represent a variety of SASP factors and to include the most variably expressed cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. A limitation in the number of factors we could measure was the incompatibility of some factors to be measured simultaneously (as indicated by the supplier). The Luminex analysis reproduced the overall changes observed by the cytokine array. However, more significant differences were measured in treated vs. untreated groups. Also, Luminex results allowed us to better visualize and correlate the observed similarities and differences in amplitude and significance between the two compounds for each factor analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The heat map of the 19 gene panel in Figure 3B suggests similar and different patterns of change between the two treatments. Provide information on age, sex, degenerative score, and other IVD characteristics on the two individuals in the RG-7112 treatment that seem to be different. Are the same set of cells used for the respective control and treatments? Such information seem to be missing and nor discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer comment on the variability pattern between the donors. This is expected due to the heterogenic nature of human patients including, age, sex, degeneration level, diseases, physical activity, cause of death…. However, it is important to highlight the similar average effect (downregulation of SASP factors) observed in Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C following RG-7112 and o-Vanillin treatment. Cells from the same donor were used for control and treatment, as now indicated by an ID number and the gender of each subject. Demographic and disc characteristics information for each donor used is provided in Table 1 and 2, and in the figure’s legends and the text of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The gene information obtained seem not have contributed to additional analyses, as the authors then moved specifically to an analysis of SASPs which were not implicated in the network data. Since they indicate &quot;To verify the effect of RG-7112 and o-Vanillin on SASP factor release…&quot;, perhaps the authors could make some links here to SASP to present a better flow and logic. Again, please state whether the same cells were used in the control, RG7112 and o-Vanillin assessments. This would be important in the interpretation of the gene differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The gene analysis was performed to verify the senolytic activity of the two compounds and the prediction of the potential pathway(s) activated. All the focus genes selected were senescence and cell cycle genes which explain the absence of SASP genes in the network data. However, the cytokine array analysis was performed to evaluate and measure, at the protein level, the effect the two compounds have on SASP factor release. In accordance with the reviewer’s request, we modified the Result and Materials and method sections in the revised version of the manuscript to better highlight the complementarity nature of the analysis. The media from the pellets used for cytokine array and Luminex assay in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 were the same pellets used for gene expression analysis as mentioned in the legend of Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the T1p-weighted MRI and disc matrix data, more description and clarity on the organ culture and data analysis need to be provided. For example, are the MRI and immunostaining data from a single injection? Further, were the medium collected from these discs for the measurement of SASP shown in Figure 5? Statistical analysis should be performed to support the conclusions made.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge these valid suggestions. Accordingly, we added Figure 4A to better describe the organ culture and data analysis. All the ex vivo analysis (in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) was performed on the discs, and their respective media, following a single injection of the senolytic drug or vehicle at day 4. The discs used for the 3 conditions (CTRL, o-Vanillin and RG-7112) were from the same donor and the experiment was performed on IVDs from four different donors (Table 3). We modified the ex vivo organ culture and MRI analysis section in the new version of the manuscript for more clarity. Statistical tests (two tailed student t-test to compare pre and post treatment groups and ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test with Turkey’s post hoc test was performed for multiple pairwise comparison between treated and untreated groups. This information is highlighted when applicable in the legends of the figures and in the Materials and methods.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have made concerted effects to constructively address the concerns and criticisms raised by two reviewers who agree that the revised manuscript has improved. However, reviewer #2 still has questions and concerns which are mostly pertinent to gene expression analysis. Before publication, these should be addressed to further improve the clarity and transparency of the manuscript. I would like to encourage the authors to revise the manuscript to address the specific suggestions and questions raised by reviewer 2. My recommendation is as follows:</p><p>1) Clarify gene expression variability vs genetic variation: In the methodology under the &quot;bioinformatics analysis&quot;, the author indicated they &quot;conducted a gene association study that focus at the genetic variation associated with degenerate nucleus pulposus cell&quot;. This is not a genetic study but a study in gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is a gene expression study. We modified the text of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Describe selection criteria and provide the full list of 91 genes in supplement: It is also stated that it is &quot;a pre-specified set of apoptotic and senescence-genes of interest&quot;. How were the 91 genes selected and a need to show the full list? As this are preselected, there would be a bias on the potential pathway networks, and thus the differentially expressed genes are confined within this gene set and one would expect specific pathways to be within this set. Therefore, it would be appropriate to disclose the existing pathways within this set of 91 genes, and estimate the selectivity of this pathway in the DEGs for RG-7112 or O-Vanillin.</p></disp-quote><p>A complete list of the genes is found in Supplementary File 1. The genes were provided in a configurable human TaqMan array for human cellular senescence, fast 96-well plate from Thermofisher scientific (Array ID: RPU62T7, Catalog number: 4413255). The plate selected was customized to also include recently described genes implicated in senescent cells anti- apoptotic pathways (SCAPs) (24). The assay includes 82 pre-selected genes involved in cellular senescence and 2 housekeeping genes (GAPDH and 18s). We selected an additional 12 SCAPs genes for a total of 96 gene. Out of the 96 genes analyzed, 91 were detectable and are represented in the results of Figure 2. The Assay ID is provided in the key resources table. We included this clarification in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The Network analysis feature in Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) suite is a broad analysis of interactions among identified proteins mined from various literature sources: The Ingenuity pathway knowledge base (IPKB). The program does not generate potential networks as it takes into account any possible combination of up or down regulated gene combinations. It is therefore not possible to disclose potentially existing pathways within the set. IPA is used to further analyze functional associations and networks of interconnected proteins. We agree that the discovered pathways are restricted to the set of 91 genes analyzed and they reflect the specific pattern of DEGs for each compound. Using IPA, we identified genes that fell within IPA-generated pathways at a higher frequency than those expected to occur for a randomly selected set of genes. This analysis identified three interacting networks for o-Vanillin and one for RG-7112 within the selected genes list. The number of networks obtained for each compound is correlated with their respective number of DEGs (8 DEGs were involved in one network for RG-7112 (Figure 2D) while 40 DEGs for o-Vanillin were involved in three networks (Figure 2 (E-G)). Interaction networks were limited to 35 molecules per network and 25 networks per analysis and excluded endogenous chemicals. We focused on algorithmically derived interaction networks, which are assigned a score on the basis of their relevance to the genes in the input dataset, the number of focus genes (i.e. dysregulated genes in our data that are in that network), and their connectivity (25). The score is calculated as –log<sub>10</sub>(p value), where p is generated using a Fisher’s exact test (26). Networks with a score ≥2 have at least 99% confidence that it is not generated by chance (27). Studies have found scores greater than 3 to be significant, with a score of 3 indicating a 1/1000 chance that the focus genes are in a network because of random chance (28-30). Other studies have opted to utilize more stringent criteria and higher scores to ensure that their discovered networks are highly significant (31-32); the network score for RG-7112 was 21 and for the three o-Vanillin networks were 37, 24 and 13. The score is not an indication of the quality or biological relevance of the network; it simply calculates the approximate &quot;fit&quot; between each network and our Network Eligible Molecules. Moreover, the single network pathway affected following the treatment with RG-7112 in disc cells validate the expected MDM2-p53 pathway previously reported in other cell types. The complete list of networks, their scores, the focus molecules and associated diseases and functions are provided in the Supplementary File 4. We modified the text in the revised version of the manuscript to disclose the obtained pathways within the selected set of 91 genes and estimate their selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide a line or two justification, e.g transcriptome analysis provides candidate gene sets and shorten the discussion around the DEGs: I do not think the transcriptome data added value but rather confusion as the gene set were pre-selected for apoptosis and senescence pathways, and the need to study SASP does not seem to be directly linked to this dataset. Therefore, I would be rather careful in placing a lot of weight on this data, as much of the discussion evolved around the DEGs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, gene expression analysis of known senescence associated genes was performed to determine how the compounds carry out their senolytic activity. We reduced the discussion around the DEGs in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Rephrase the sentences not to mislead: I still have concern that the authors continue to stretch the boundary of suggestive results that have not reach statistical significance. Suggesting a trend in the absence of statistical support is not scientific. Thus statements such as &quot;approaching significance&quot; and &quot;slightly non-significant increase&quot; should be avoided, as the data presented indicated there is not difference. Once can never predict how the values will changed with more data point</p></disp-quote><p>The higher variability between individual human specimens prompt us to report any trend in the results. However, we agree with the reviewer’s recommendation and modified the text of the revised manuscript to exclude any statements such as approaching significance /slightly non-significant for better scientific accuracy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Indicate that they were selected as candidates from the transcriptome analysis: In the main text, it is described as &quot;RNA-Seq analysis&quot;. This is not correct, as the authors should clearly indicate they are not testing RNA-Seq genome-wide, but only 91 selected genes. Very confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. We have now corrected in the revised manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Describe in the text the nature of the 4 overlapped genes and their directional impact: In Figure 2A, is the venn diagram included both up and down-regulated DEGs? May consider providing separate Venn diagrams, for up- and down-regulated genes. Also, need to provide an odds-ratio for the overlaps, and a p-value for the Chi-square test of co-occurrence. A crude estimate is that by chance alone, if you randomly sample 8 genes from 91, and another 40 from 91, you will get 8*40/91=3.51, and in reality you detect 4 genes in overlap, which is not much more than by chance. Further, should indicate the identity of these 4 overlapping genes.</p></disp-quote><p>The Venn diagram in Figure 2A of the previous version include both up- and down-regulated DEGs and the 4 overlapping genes are the 4 significantly DEGs: MAPK14, CDC25c, CCNB1 and CDKN2D (p19<italic><sup>ARF</sup></italic>) as mentioned in the Results. In the revised version of the manuscript, two separate Venn diagrams for up and down regulated DEGs is provided in Figure 2A viewer. The total number of overlapping genes is now three since CCNB1 is upregulated in RG-7112 and downregulated in o-Vanillin. In upregulated DEGs, the three overlapping genes between o-Vanillin and RG-7112 are MAPK14, CDC25c and CDKN2D (p19<italic><sup>ARF</sup></italic>). No down-regulated DEGs was shared between RG-7112 and o-Vanillin. Please see the modified legend and Results section. The detailed list of up- or down-regulated DEGs and their respective p values are provided in the Supplementary file 3. Odds ratios (33) and p values were calculated using Fisher exact test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Clarify if FDR or p values were used for cut-off for DEGs: It was indicated a p&lt;0.05 was used as cutoff for DEGs, &quot;Of the 91 genes tested, 44 were differentially expressed with a P&lt;0.05 in one or both treatments (Figure 2B)&quot;. But in Figure 2C, the author indicated using &quot;logFDR&quot;. Therefore, which measure was used for the cutoff?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this concern. p&lt;0.05 was used as a cut-off for DEGs in both Figure 2B and 2C. We corrected this mistake in the two new volcano plots of Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the figure legend, Y axis is indicated as log10 of the p-values while in the Figure 2C, log (FDR). Clarify which one: Remake the Figure 2C so that two drug effects can be easily differentiated: For the vertical axis in Figure 2C, is it log(FDR) or log10FDR ? as typically, &quot;log10FDR&quot; is used. In Figure 2C, genes can be better illustrated with different colours for gene with logFC &gt;0 and those &lt;0, and different shape for the drugs, or separate volcano plots. For insignificant genes, use grey. Further, this figure is problematic to me; as it does not seem to reflect a typical volcano plot. If FDR used, then many of the non-significant p-values would be 1.0, and the Log of 1 is zero. So, many more of the values should be around zero. Some explanation needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the negative log<sub>10</sub> (p values) in Figure 2C. We included in the revised version of the manuscript two separate volcano plots for each drug as recommended. We modified the respective legend accordingly. p values were used, and significance was set at 0.05. Significance in the volcano plots is indicated by a grey line that correspond to -log10 (0.05) = 1.3 in the new Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It is OK to leave as they are: For Figure 2(D) to (G), for each of these networks, how unusual is it to observe this? Given the bias, you are bound to have some networks, even by randomly selecting genes into IPA. Can the authors provide the p values or FDR to address this, and label them on the Figures directly?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response 2, the gene network identification in Figure 2D to 2G was based on each set of the differentially expressed genes observed between the treated and control groups. IPA used the Ingenuity Knowledge Base to screen for reported interactions involving these genes. The identified networks were scored based on the number of network eligible molecules they contain. The IPA network score for each gene network displayed as the negative log of the p-value of that specific network, gives the likelihood that the set of genes in this network could be explained by chance alone. Therefore, networks with a score ≥ 2 have at least 99% confidence that it is not generated by chance (27-30). Although a potential bias, the high network scores obtained for o-Vanillin (37, 24 and 13) and for RG-7112 (21) showed a strong degree of relevance to the Network Eligible Molecules in our dataset. The p-value, calculated using Fisher’s exact test, are typically quite low, it is visually easier to concentrate on the exponent and the p-score is defined as p-score = -log10(p-value). p scores (=network scores) are provided in Supplementary file 4. As recommended, we labeled the p scores of each network directly on the figures.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1) J.
