Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27ac. However, the methyltransferases responsible for H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive. Furthermore, how these enzymes function on enhancers to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression is unclear. In this study, we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase with partial functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of <italic>Mll4</italic> markedly decreases H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Mediator and Polymerase II levels on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Together, these findings identify MLL4 as a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01503.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01503.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01503.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost every cell in a human body carries the same genes, but not every cell will express all of these genes as proteins. As different types of cells, such as brain, liver, fat or muscle cells, develop, they will express different genes; or they will express the same genes, but at different times and in different amounts. Enhancers are short stretches of DNA that boost the amount of protein that is produced when a gene is expressed, and they are particularly important for those genes that are expressed differently between cell types.</p><p>Enhancers bolster expression of a gene by interacting with the DNA nearby. Even genes separated from enhancers by a long stretches of DNA can benefit because the way that DNA is tightly packed inside the nucleus means that two distant sequences can actually end up close together. Proteins called transcription factors will bind to enhancers and recruit the cell’s protein ‘machinery’ required to express nearby genes. Enhancers can be identified by specific chemical marks associated with their DNA, but little is known about the enzymes that leave these marks in mammals. Moreover, it is not clear which genes are influenced by these marks.</p><p>Now, by examining fat cells and muscle cells as they mature, Lee et al. have found that an enzyme called MLL4 is responsible for adding chemical marks to enhancers in both humans and mice. Further, MLL4 is required both to allow cells to specialize into different cell types, and to boost the expression of genes that are specific to each type of mature cells. Since faulty MLL4 has been implicated in several cancers and developmental defects, the findings of Lee et al. may lead to a better understanding of these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01503.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01503.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>enhancer chromatin modification</kwd><kwd>MLL4</kwd><kwd>H3K4me1</kwd><kwd>KMT2D</kwd><kwd>enhancer activation</kwd><kwd>H3K27ac</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADK075003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Ji-Eun</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chaochen</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shiliyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lifeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Lenan</given-names></name><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Weiqun</given-names></name><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAAR041126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Xuesong</given-names></name><name><surname>Sartorelli</surname><given-names>Vittorio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MLL4 (KMT2D) is a major mammalian H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase that is essential for enhancer activation, cell-type-specific gene expression, and cell differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enhancers are gene regulatory elements critical for cell-type-specific gene expression in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulger and Groudine, 2011</xref>). Lineage-determining or signal-dependent transcription factors (TFs) bind to enhancers and recruit chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes and the Mediator coactivator complex to initiate RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roeder, 2005</xref>). Recent genome-wide analyses of histone modifications, binding of transcription coactivators p300 and MED1 and lineage-determining TFs, coupled with functional assays of gene regulatory elements, have enabled the identification of enhancer chromatin signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lupien et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heintzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Visel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghisletti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to active promoters that are marked by H3K4me3, enhancers are marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 (H3K4me1/2) but little H3K4me3, and are often bound by cell-type-specific TFs. Active enhancers are further marked by histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300-mediated H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). H3K4me1 on enhancers often precedes H3K27ac and activation of enhancers. A large number of recent publications have validated the predictive power of such enhancer chromatin signatures in identification of novel enhancers critical for cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the Set1 complex is the sole H3K4 methyltransferase. Through the enzymatic subunit SET1, it is responsible for all mono-, di- and tri-methylations on H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>). In Drosophila, there are three Set1-like H3K4 methyltransferase complexes that use dSet1, Trithorax (Trx) and Trithorax-related (Trr) as the respective enzymatic subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). Mammals possess six Set1-like H3K4 methyltransferase complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the sequence homology of enzymatic subunits and the subunit compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vermeulen and Timmers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), they fall into three sub-groups: MLL1/MLL2 (also known as KMT2A and KMT2B, respectively), MLL3/MLL4 (MLL3 is also known as KMT2C; MLL4 is also known as KMT2D, ALR and sometimes MLL2), and SET1A/SET1B (also known as KMT2E and KMT2F, respectively), which correspond to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Trx, Trr and dSet1 complexes, respectively. dSet1 is responsible for the bulk of H3K4me3 in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardehali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, depletion of the unique CFP1 subunit of SET1A/SET1B complexes in mammalian cells markedly decreases global H3K4me3 level, suggesting that SET1A/SET1B are the major H3K4 tri-methyltransferases in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clouaire et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of Trr, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of MLL3/MLL4, decreases global H3K4me1 levels, indicating that Trr regulates H3K4me1 in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardehali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). However, the histone methyltransferases (HMTs) responsible for H3K4me1/2 on mammalian enhancers remain elusive. Further, the functions of these H3K4 mono-/di-methyltransferases on enhancers and in regulating cell-type-specific gene induction and cell differentiation are unclear. Finally, how these HMTs are recruited to enhancers needs to be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Adipogenesis and myogenesis are robust and synchronized models of cell differentiation. Differentiation of preadipocytes towards adipocytes, that is adipogenesis, is regulated by a network of sequentially expressed adipogenic TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>). Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ (PPARγ) is considered the master regulator of adipogenesis and controls adipocyte gene expression cooperatively with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefterova et al., 2008</xref>). The early adipogenic TF C/EBPβ marks a large number of TF ‘hotspots’ before induction of adipogenesis. C/EBPβ not only controls the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression but also acts as a pioneer factor to facilitate the genomic binding of PPARγ, C/EBPα and other adipogenic TFs during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siersbaek et al., 2011</xref>). Adipogenesis in cell culture is synchronized, with the vast majority of cells in the confluent population differentiating into adipocytes within 6–8 days, thus providing a robust model system for studying transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ge, 2012</xref>). Myogenesis is another robust model system for cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of the myogenic TF MyoD in fibroblasts and preadipocytes is sufficient to induce muscle differentiation program characterized by expression of myogenesis markers such as Myogenin (Myog) and Myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tapscott et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lassar et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, here we show MLL4 is partially redundant with MLL3 and is required for cell differentiation and cell-type-specific gene expression. By ChIP-Seq analyses, we observe cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding of MLL4. MLL4 is mainly localized on enhancers and co-localizes with lineage-determining TFs on active enhancers during differentiation. We demonstrate that MLL4 is partially redundant with MLL3 and is a major H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase in mouse and human cells. Furthermore, MLL4 is required for H3K4me1/2, H3K27ac, Mediator and Pol II levels on active enhancers, indicating that MLL4 is required for enhancer activation. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that lineage-determining TFs recruit and require MLL4 to establish cell-type-specific enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MLL4 is essential for adipogenesis and myogenesis</title><p>Among the six SET1-like H3K4 methyltransferases found in mammals, we initially knocked out <italic>Mll3</italic> and <italic>Mll4</italic> individually in mice using gene trap approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref> and data not shown). <italic>Mll3</italic> knockout (KO) mice died around birth with no obvious morphological abnormalities in embryonic development. <italic>Mll4</italic> KO mice showed early embryonic lethality around E9.5.

To exclude false-positive signals and identify bona fide MLL4 binding regions, we performed ChIP-Seq of MLL4 in both <italic>Mll3</italic> KO and <italic>Mll3/Mll4</italic> double KO cells. The results provide the direct evidence that MLL4 is a major H3K4me1/2 methyltransferase on enhancers during cell differentiation. More importantly, our data indicate that MLL4 is required for enhancer activation, which suggests that H3K4me1/2 may be important for enhancer activation. The partial functional redundancy between MLL3 and MLL4 in cells suggests that endogenous MLL3 is likely an H3K4me1/2 methyltransferase on enhancers and is likely involved in the activation of cell-type-specific enhancers.</p><p>Significant levels of H3K4me1/2 remain in <italic>Mll3/Mll4</italic> double KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that other H3K4 methyltransferases contribute to H3K4me1/2 in cells.

It was shown recently that knockdown of several H3K4 methyltransferases including MLL1, MLL3, MLL4 in macrophages led to significant decreases of H3K4me1/2 on latent enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>). Our data indicate that MLL4 is required for the activation of cell-type-specific enhancers during differentiation. Whether MLL4 is also required for the activation of latent enhancers remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lineage-determining TFs recruit MLL4 to establish cell type-specific enhancers</title><p>During adipogenesis and myogenesis, MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and co-localizes with lineage-determining TFs and H3K4me1/2 on active enhancers. Thus, MLL4 appears to mark lineage-determining enhancers during differentiation. It will be interesting to test whether MLL4 binding can predict enhancers in other cell types. Interestingly, MLL4-dependent H3K4me1/2 distribute well beyond the binding sites of lineage-determining TFs and MLL4. A similar observation can be made for p300 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>), where H3K27ac is distributed much broader than p300. We speculate that lineage-determining TFs along with MLL4 may induce physical proximity of neighboring nucleosomes to MLL4, which enables MLL4-mediated H3K4me1/2 over a much broader region.</p><p>C/EBPβ is a lineage-determining TF for adipogenesis. It can bind to relatively closed chromatin and thus behaves as a pioneer factor in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siersbaek et al., 2011</xref>). By ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in preadipocytes without inducing differentiation, we show that C/EBPβ recruits and requires MLL4 to establish a subset of adipogenic enhancers. Our data are consistent with earlier reports that genomic binding of the lineage-determining TF PU.1 leads to H3K4me1 in macrophages and B cells and that ectopic expression of PU.1 in non-hematopoietic fibroblasts induces H3K4me1 on macrophage-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghisletti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Although it remains to be determined whether MLL4 and/or MLL3 play a major role in establishing enhancers in macrophages, B cells and other cell types, the available results suggest that lineage-determining TFs recruit H3K4me1/2 methyltransferases to prime enhancer-like regions in a particular cell type.</p><p>Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in preadipocytes without differentiation only recovers a subset of endogenous C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup>MLL4<sup>+</sup> enhancers, indicating that the recruitment of MLL4 to enhancers during adipogenesis involves additional mechanisms and factors. Because differentiation-dependent phosphorylation of C/EBPβ increases its DNA binding activity, the optimal genomic binding of C/EBPβ and the subsequent recruitment of MLL4 are likely dependent on induction of adipogenesis. Similarly, the binding of MyoD to myogenic enhancers on <italic>Myog</italic> locus is differentiation-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The direct interaction between <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MLL3/4.com">MLL3/4.com</ext-link> and PPARγ and the genomic co-localization of MLL4 with PPARγ and C/EBPα suggest that PPARγ and C/EBPα also play critical roles in recruiting MLL4 to establish adipogenic enhancers.</p><p>Motif analyses of MLL4 binding sites during adipogenesis and myogenesis have identified motifs of additional lineage-determining TFs, such as adipogenic TFs EBFs, GR and NFIC and myogenic TFs TCF3, Runx1 and TEAD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Future ChIP-Seq analyses will tell whether these additional lineage-determining TFs can recruit MLL4 to regions that are not bound by C/EBPα/β, PPARγ or MyoD. On the other hand, MLL4 is absent from many genomic regions that are occupied by C/EBPα/β or PPARγ during adipogenesis or by MyoD in myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>), suggesting that lineage-determining TFs alone are not always sufficient for recruiting MLL4 to establish enhancers and that additional mechanisms and factors may be involved.</p><p>Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in preadipocytes partially mimics the early phase of adipogenesis when PPARγ and C/EBPα have not been induced yet.

The pioneer TF C/EBPβ recruits MLL4 to activate adipogenic enhancers on, and the subsequent induction of, <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Cebpa</italic> gene expression.

Collectively, our data suggest a stepwise model of enhancer activation during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Step 1, pioneer TF binding. Pioneer TFs such as C/EBPβ bind enhancer-like regions. Step 2, enhancer commissioning by MLL4. Lineage-determining TFs, such as C/EBPβ, PPARγ and C/EBPα, cooperatively recruit MLL4 to perform H3K4me1/2 on enhancer-like regions. Step 3, enhancer activation by H3K27 acetyltransferase p300, followed by Pol II recruitment, establishment of enhancer–promoter interaction, and activation of cell-type-specific gene expression. Thus, the enhancer-associated H3K4me1/2 methyltransferase MLL4 appears to perform the opposite function of LSD1, an H3K4me1/2 demethylase required for decommissioning of embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific enhancers during ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whyte et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>MLL3/MLL4 mutations in diseases</title><p>Frequent loss-of-function mutations in MLL4 (sometimes called MLL2) and its homolog MLL3 have been identified in developmental diseases such as Kabuki syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ng et al., 2010</xref>), congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>), and in cancers such as medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parsons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pugh et al., 2012</xref>), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pasqualucci et al., 2011</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2012</xref>), and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grasso et al., 2012</xref>).

On the other hand, 836 out of 2,774 up-regulated genes were MLL4-dependent. The significance of MLL4-dependency in upregulated genes was <italic>p</italic>&lt;1E−300 using hypergeometric test. GO studies were carried out using DAVID with the whole genome as background, and for each group of genes the GO terms with p≤10<sup>−7</sup> were listed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Identification of ChIP-enriched regions</title><p>To eliminate background noise in ChIP-Seq datasets, we determined ChIP-enriched regions for each ChIP-Seq sample using the SICER method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zang et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, to eliminate non-specific binding of MLL4 antibody, we compared MLL4 ChIP-Seq sample from MLL4-deficient (<italic>Mll3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>Mll4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) cells against that from control (<italic>Mll3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) cells, and kept only the identified MLL4 binding regions with enrichment level significantly higher in control cells than in the MLL4-deficient cells, with an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 10<sup>−15</sup>. The same FDR threshold was also applied to C/EBPα and C/EBPβ ChIP-Seq samples when analyzed against the input libraries. For PPARγ ChIP-Seq at D0 (day 0) and D2 (day 2) of brown adipogenesis, MLL4 ChIP-Seq in C/EBPβ over-expressing brown preadipocytes, and MLL4 and MyoD ChIP-Seq in myocytes, the FDR threshold was set to be 10<sup>−5</sup> due to the limited coverage of sequenced reads. For the ChIP-Seq datasets of histone modifications (H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27ac), the window size was chosen to be 200 bp and the FDR threshold was chosen to be 10<sup>−3</sup>. For the ChIP-Seq datasets of MLL4, Pol II, MyoD and adipogenic factors (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ), the window size was chosen to be 50 bp. Another required parameter in SICER, gap size, was chosen to be equal to 1 window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Genome-wide co-localization study</title><p>Specific MLL4-enriched regions identified at D0, D2, D7 (day 0, 2, 7) during adipogenesis as well as in myocytes were compared, and co-localization was defined as two regions overlapping for at least 1bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). All D0 MLL4 regions, D2 MLL4 regions that did not overlap with D0 regions, D7 MLL4 regions that didn’t overlap with either D0 or D2, and identified MLL4 peaks in myocytes but not in preadipocytes, were regarded as emergent MLL4 binding sites. Top 2,000 in each group as ranked by FDR against MLL4-deficient control were used later for GO and motif analyses. Each of the top 2,000 emergent MLL4 binding sites was assigned to its closest transcription start sites (TSS). The resulting gene list was imported into DAVID for GO analysis. The enriched GO terms in biological process with p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> were listed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The same top emergent MLL4 sites were used as input to SeqPos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2010</xref>) for motif search. All motifs found with calculated p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup> were listed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By the same 1bp-overlapping definition of co-localization, MLL4 binding sites at D2 were compared with C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ binding sites. Given the motif similarity and functional redundancy between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, we first calculated the union of their binding sites and regarded them as C/EBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The heat maps were generated with 50 bp resolution and ranked according to the intensity of MLL4 at the center of 400 bp window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using the same approach we checked co-localization between MLL4 and MyoD in myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>Identification of enhancers and promoters during adipogenesis</title><p>By definitions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we identified enhancers and promoters along the genome. The definitions were applied in a mutually exclusive way, that is, for each genomic region, we first checked whether it was promoter or enhancer (or others), then further pinned it down to active or silent ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The total length of the all active enhancers was 43% of total length of all enhancers and promoters. On the other hand, 9,642 of 11,948 (80.6%) MLL4 binding sites on enhancers and promoters were located on active enhancers. Therefore, the significance of MLL4 enrichment on active enhancers was p&lt;1E−300 using binomial test. Average profiles were plotted using the number of ChIP-Seq reads (normalized to the size of each library) in 5 bp bins from the center of each regulatory element to 10 kb on both sides. The centers of regulatory elements were defined as the corresponding TSSs for promoters and the centers of H3K4me1 enriched regions for enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, the active adipogenic enhancers were defined as C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ binding sites that were on active enhancers. Again C/EBP refers to the union of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ.</p><p>Genome-wide, out of the 26,348 C/EBP sites at D2, 8,235 (31.3%) were MLL4<sup>+</sup>. On the other hand, out of the 10,061 C/EBP sites on active enhancers, 5,762 (57.3%) were MLL4<sup>+</sup>. The significance for the preferential enrichment of the co-localization of MLL4 with C/EBP on active enhancers was p&lt;1E−300 using hypergeometric test. Similarly, genome-wide, out of the 6,148 PPARγ sites at D2, 3,461 (56.3%) were MLL4<sup>+</sup>. On the other hand, out of the 3,182 PPARγ sites on active enhancers, 2,544 (80.0%) were MLL4<sup>+</sup>. The significance for the preferential enrichment of co-localization of MLL4 with PPARγ on active enhancers was p&lt;1E−300 using hypergeometric test.</p><p>The heat maps were generated with 50 bp resolution and ranked according to the co-localization of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The 6,342 adipogenic enhancers that co-localize with MLL4 were used to profile various histone modifications, Pol II and MED1 in both control and MLL4-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Each active adipogenic enhancer was assigned to the nearest TSS within 1,000 kb, and the corresponding fraction of genes that were induced (fold change &gt; 2.5) at D2 of adipogenesis and gene expression fold change (in base 2 logarithm) in KO cells were plotted using box plot, with outliers not shown to highlight the majority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, we classified genes associated with adipogenic enhancers into three mutually exclusive groups: C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>−</sup>, C/EBP<sup>−</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>, or C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>. A gene might be simultaneously associated with adipogenic enhancers with different patterns of TF occupation (i.e., C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>−</sup>, C/EBP<sup>−</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>, or C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>), resulting in ambiguity in designation. To resolve this ambiguity, we adopted the following rule: a promoter (and the corresponding gene) was categorized as C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup> if at least one of its associated adipogenic enhancer was C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>. A promoter was categorized as C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>−</sup> or C/EBP<sup>−</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>, if none of the associated adipogenic enhancer was C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>, but at least one of them is C/EBP<sup>+</sup>PPARγ<sup>−</sup> or C/EBP<sup>−</sup>PPARγ<sup>+</sup>. Similarly, a promoter is categorized as MLL4<sup>−</sup> if none of the associated adipogenic enhancer is MLL4<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Identification of recovered C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup> active adipogenic enhancers in C/EBPβ over-expressing preadipocytes</title><p>Among the 4,965 C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup>MLL4<sup>+</sup> active enhancers identified at D2 of adipogenesis, we found 3,309 of them had C/EBPβ binding in C/EBPβ over-expressing preadipocytes. 666 of 3,309 had MLL4 binding as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). 591 of them also had H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enriched and were regarded as recovered C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup>MLL4<sup>+</sup> active enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Based on the MLL4 enrichment in vector-expressing preadipocytes, we grouped recovered C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup>MLL4<sup>+</sup> active enhancers into two categories, with MLL4 in vector-expressing preadipocytes (premarked) and without MLL4 in vector-expressing preadipocytes (de novo). We computed C/EBPβ, MLL4, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment intensities (as by normalized ChIP-Seq read count) in control and MLL4-deficient preadipocytes, with or without C/EBPβ over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We found that in both groups, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were induced in C/EBPβ over-expressing cells, and the induction was MLL4-dependent: in using MLL4-deficient cells, over 95% of H3K4me1 islands corresponding to the recovered C/EBPβ<sup>+</sup> active adipogenic enhancers exhibited significant (FDR &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>) decreased enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-8"><title>Identification of enhancers and promoters during myogenesis</title><p>By definitions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we identified enhancers and promoters along the genome.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Christopher Glass, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Ge and colleagues reports on the molecular functions of MLL4 and MLL3 in mouse models of adipogenesis and myogenesis. Using conditional <italic>MLL4</italic> x systemic <italic>MLL3</italic> KO cells, they demonstrate that MLL4 is responsible for a significant fraction of the deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at cell-specific enhancers required for adipogenesis and myogenesis. They further demonstrate that MLL4 localizes to these cell-specific enhancers, and that loss of MLL3/4 results in severe defects in cell-type specific gene expression and differentiation. They present evidence that MLL4 is recruited to enhancers required for adipogenesis by lineage determining factors C/EBP and PPARg. The authors conclude with a 3-step model of enhancer activation during adipogenesis.</p><p>All three reviewers found the work to be substantial and of high quality. There were some differences of opinion concerning novelty. One reviewer noted, “Many of these findings have already been investigated in previous studies. First, both MLL3 and MLL4 have been implicated in adipogenesis in a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al. 2008</xref> (PNAS). Second, as acknowledged by the authors, it has already been established in several published studies such as the recent studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al. 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al. 2013</xref> that the MLL family including MLL3 and MLL4 are preferentially H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 histone methyltransferases. In addition, this was very recently shown by Shilatifard and colleagues (Mol. Cell. Biol. doi:10.1128/MCB.01181-13.”) These points were discussed in the consultation session, with the conclusion being that the genome-wide findings related to the functional consequences of loss of MLL3/4 on enhancer activity and differentiation are novel and move the field forward significantly beyond the previous correlative findings.</p><p>Two major points would need to be addressed for the manuscript to be found acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) The three-step model of enhancer activation is not directly supported by the experiments because there is no evaluation of the intermediates in the model. All of the experiments evaluate two states: before and after differentiation. To establish evidence for the stepwise model, a time series is needed following initiation of the differentiation program that allows discrimination of the sequence of transcription factor binding, histone acetylation, H3K4me1/2, MLL4 binding, Pol II binding, etc. These studies could be performed using QT-PCR at informative loci.</p><p>2) More information is required to allow an assessment of data quality. The performance of ChIP-Seq for MLL4 in both WT and KO cells allays concerns as to possible false positives for this particular ChIP. However, the methods do not indicate whether biological replicates were performed for the sequencing based assays, raising questions regarding reproducibility. Since many of the analyses are based on overlaps defined by arbitrary thresholds, experimental variability could significantly affect quantitative aspects of the conclusions. If ChiP-Seq and RNA-Seq assays were only performed as single experiments, some form of independent validation of the key findings is required, , by QT-PCR of a representative set of informative genomic regions/RNAs. In addition, it would be helpful for the authors to provide a summary table for all of the sequencing experiments indicating the number of mapped reads that were used for analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01503.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All three reviewers found the work to be substantial and of high quality.

MLL4 has not been implicated in adipogenesis and neither of MLL3/4 has been implicated in myogenesis. Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we demonstrate that MLL3/4 function as H3K4me1/2 methyltransferases on enhancers to control cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation.</p><p>Second, while our manuscript was in preparation, Tang et al. and Wu et al. reported that MLL3/4 are preferentially H3K4me1/2 methyltransferases using in vitro HMT assays. Our data confirm their in vitro findings. More importantly, we demonstrate using <italic>MLL3/4</italic> KO human and mouse cells that MLL3/4 are major mammalian H3K4me1/2 methyltransferases in vivo.</p><p>Third, the Shilatifard lab submitted their manuscript to <italic>MCB</italic> in early September. We submitted our manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> also in early September.
