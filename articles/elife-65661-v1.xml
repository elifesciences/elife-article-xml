For example, social interactions often force an individual to weigh self-interest against norms favoring equity and other-regard. Similarly, dietary decisions often require weighing the immediate pleasure of consumption against personal standards or societal norms favoring healthy eating. Understanding when, why, and how people choose normatively preferred responses (e.g., generosity over selfishness, healthy over unhealthy eating, etc.) has represented a central goal of the decision sciences for decades. What neural and computational processes must be engaged to support more normative behavior? What makes such choices frequently feel so conflicted and effortful, and how can we make them easier? To what extent does following social or personal norms depend on activation in brain regions associated with inhibitory control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)?</p><p>Previous research has provided a wealth of evidence suggesting that dlPFC activation is associated with normative choices in both the social and non-social domain. For instance, compared to unhealthy food choices, healthier choices in successful dieters were accompanied by greater activation in a posterior region of the dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>). Greater dlPFC response in a similar region has also been observed when individuals make normatively favored choices in both social decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strombach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cutler and Campbell-Meiklejohn, 2019</xref>) and intertemporal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McClure et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, activation in the dlPFC increases when individuals explicitly focus on eating healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>) or on decreasing craving for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kober et al., 2010</xref>). Electrical disruption of this area also decreases patience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Figner et al., 2010</xref>) and reduces normative behavior in cooperative contexts like the Ultimatum game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruff et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these results have been taken to support the notion that the dlPFC may be recruited to modulate values or bias choices in favor of normative responses, perhaps especially when those responses conflict with default preferences. Such findings are also consistent with the notion that this region might play a more general role in inhibitory control.</p><p>Yet, a variety of results seem inconsistent with this view. For example, researchers often fail to observe increased dlPFC recruitment when individuals make pro-social or intertemporally normative choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaki and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magen et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, electrical disruption of the dlPFC has been observed both to <italic>decrease</italic> appetitive valuation of foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camus et al., 2009</xref>) and to <italic>increase</italic> generous behavior in altruistic choice tasks like the Dictator game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruff et al., 2013</xref>). Such findings conflict with the idea that this region consistently promotes normative concerns over immediate, hedonistic desires. Thus, it remains unclear how to predict whether and when one might observe a positive association between dlPFC response and choices typically associated with successful self-control.</p><p>Here, we propose a computational account of fMRI BOLD response in the dlPFC that may resolve many of these apparent inconsistencies. This account draws on prior research in both perceptual and value-based decision making, which consistently finds that the posterior dlPFC region associated with both normative ‘self-control success’ and inhibitory control tasks also activates during choices that are more difficult to discriminate in simple perceptual and value-based choices lacking a self-control conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noppeney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pedersen et al., 2015</xref>). Our account is also inspired by findings that the dlPFC may be one hub in a larger neural circuit – encompassing additional regions like the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], supplementary motor area, and inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula [IFG/aIns] – that selects actions for execution using a process of evidence accumulation toward a threshold for response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hare et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pisauro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this evidence, we developed a computational model of self-control dilemmas, rooted in the logic of evidence accumulation, that successfully predicts not only when an individual will choose in a normative rather than hedonistic (In the following results, we examine choices in two domains often associated with self-control:altruistic choice and healthy eating. We use the term ‘normative’ choices to describe generous and healthy decisions in these contexts, respectively. To contrast with normative choices, we refer to both selfish and unhealthy decisions using the term ‘hedonistic’ choices, although we acknowledge that decisions about money, even if selfish, would not be considered hedonistic in the classical sense of referring to sensory pleasure. Instead, we here use the term hedonistic in the sense of promoting immediate self-gratification. Similarly, we use the term ‘hedonic attribute’ to refer to attributes associated with immediate self-gratification (i.e., self-serving outcomes, food tastiness), whether or not they are directly linked to sensory pleasure.) fashion, but also when, why, and to what degree response in the dlPFC will be recruited during that process. We also note that we focus here on inhibitory control-related regions of the dlPFC rather than value-related dlPFC regions, which lie in somewhat more anterior areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>). Our model also applies in theory when observing similar relationships to other brain areas frequently associated with conflict and inhibitory control, including regions of the IFG/aIns and dACC.</p><p>Based on work examining simple perceptual and value-based choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milosavljevic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busemeyer et al., 2019</xref>), we assume that the brain makes decisions through a process of value-based attribute integration and evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). More specifically, choices are resolved by accumulating information about the value of choice-relevant information (attributes), weighted by their momentary goal relevance, until a critical threshold for choice is reached. Some of these attributes are associated with hedonism (e.g., self-regarding concerns in altruistic choice), and some are associated with social norms and standards for behavior (e.g., other-regarding concerns). For expository purposes, we refer to these respectively as hedonic and normative attributes. Intuitively, whether a process of value-based evidence accumulation results in a hedonistic or normative choice depends not only on the magnitude of hedonic and normative attributes, but also on their weight: higher weights on normative attributes lead to more norm-consistent responses.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Attribute-based drift diffusion model (DDM) of normative choice.</title><p><italic>Input</italic>. Each option’s hedonic and normative attributes (e.g., high tastiness and low healthiness for the sundae) are weighted by their current importance (e.g., w<sub>Taste</sub> [w<sub>T</sub>] and w<sub>Health</sub> [w<sub>H</sub>]) and summed to construct relative option values [V<sub>O1</sub> – V<sub>O2</sub>]. <italic>Model</italic>. In the computational model (upper right panel), these values, corrupted by momentary noise at time t [ε<sub>t</sub>], serve as the inputs to an evidence accumulation process (E<sub>t</sub>) representing the two options (Sunday vs. apple). This evidence accumulates over time, moving by an increment dE at each moment, until it hits one of two predefined thresholds, determining the simulated response time (RT), the simulated choice, and the simulated neural activity (the sum of the absolute value of the evidence from t=0 to t=RT). Choices are classified as normative if the option with higher normative attribute value is selected (in this example, higher healthiness, i.e., the apple in option 2). <italic>Simulation</italic>. Simulating this process thousands of times (lower right panel) allows distributions to be constructed for the expected frequency of hedonistic and normative choices, RTs, and average neural activity, mean(neural), for each type of choice.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-65661-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>What role does the dlPFC play in the process of choice? The observation of increased posterior dlPFC response when people choose consistently with normatively favored goals (e.g., healthy over unhealthy choices) has been taken to suggest that this region acts either to modulate the processing of attribute values or their weights in favor of normatively favored goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>), or to inhibit hedonistic reward-related responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heatherton and Wagner, 2011</xref>). In contrast, we propose that activity in this region reflects processes related to the <italic>evidence accumulation stage</italic> of decisions. This suggests that dlPFC response during normative choice represents a downstream consequence of valuation processes, rather than a direct causal influence upon them. To support this argument, we use a value-based drift diffusion model (DDM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to simulate when and why we might observe greater activity in the dlPFC (and regions with similar response profiles) when resolving a choice. As we describe below, these simulations suggest that normative choices should be associated with greater neural activation in the dlPFC only when two things are true: hedonic attribute values <italic>directly oppose</italic> normative attribute values, and hedonic attributes receive <italic>more weight</italic> as inputs to the evidence accumulation process. In contrast, when normative attributes receive more weight, <italic>hedonistic</italic> choices should produce greater activity in the dlPFC and other areas associated with response selection.</p><p>We then used these observations to make two predictions. First, if people by default favor hedonic over normative attributes, then most studies will observe greater dlPFC response when people choose the normatively favored option. This prediction does not strongly distinguish our account from alternatives. However, our model makes a second, more novel prediction: if a normally hedonistic decision maker focuses on normative goals, this should <italic>reduce</italic> activation in the dlPFC when choosing the normatively favored option. A straightforward reading of an attribute-weighting account predicts the opposite: a normally hedonistic individual who deliberately attempts to focus on normative responding should show <italic>increased</italic> activation in the dlPFC in order to alter attribute weighting in favor of normative goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). We test these two alternative predictions across three datasets and two canonical self-control contexts in which people frequently struggle to align their actual behaviors with normative goals: altruistic and dietary choices. In all cases, results supported the predictions of an evidence accumulation account. These findings raise new and important questions regarding the role of the dlPFC – and effortful self-control more generally – in promoting normative choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simulating the dilemma of self-control</title><p>Although self-control dilemmas can take a variety of forms, for expository purposes, we here take a single, typical self-control dilemma: a decision maker deciding whether to indulge in a decadent snack (e.g., an ice cream sundae) or opt for something healthier (e.g., an apple). This example allows us to capture two critical features: first, self-control dilemmas typically involve making decisions about options that vary in the magnitude or value of hedonic and normative attributes (e.g., tastiness and healthiness). Second, the decision maker must weigh these attributes based on goals that can vary in their relative strength at different times and in different contexts. At a nice restaurant, tastiness may be prioritized. When trying to lose weight, healthiness is prioritized. We used simulations to explicitly capture these two features.</p><p>Simulations were realized using a value-based DDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hare et al., 2011b</xref>) in which an evidence signal capturing hedonic and normative attributes, weighted by their current subjective importance, accumulates toward a choice-determining threshold (see Methods for details). This model generated predictions for how <italic>magnitudes</italic> and <italic>weights</italic> for hedonic and normative attributes influence the likelihood of a virtuous (i.e., healthy) choice, response time (RT), and neural response. These simulations yielded three key observations about behavior and neural response, which we describe in the context of food choice but apply in theory across any self-control dilemma that requires weighing hedonic rewards against normative values and goals.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Observation 1: The likelihood of a normative choice depends on the value of hedonic and normative attributes</title><p>To capture the idea that some choices (e.g., ice cream vs. Brussels sprouts) represent more of a self-control conflict than others (e.g., strawberries vs. lard), we simulated a single decision maker facing choices between hypothetical options that independently varied the relative value of normative and hedonic attributes (e.g., the foods’ relative healthiness and tastiness). In the context of food choice, we classified a simulated choice as normative (healthy) when the simulation selected the option with higher normative attribute values (higher healthiness). Choices were classified as hedonistic (unhealthy) otherwise. To determine the effect of current behavioral goals, we simulated the decision maker’s choices for a variety of different weights on healthiness (w<sub>Health</sub>) and tastiness (w<sub>Taste</sub>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> illustrates how variation in tastiness and healthiness of an option relative to the alternative affects a decision maker’s <italic>general</italic> propensity to make a healthy choice (i.e., averaging over different instances of w<sub>Taste</sub> and w<sub>Health</sub>). As can be seen, the magnitude and sign of the two attributes matter: she tends to choose more healthily when one option dominates on both healthiness and tastiness (no-conflict trials). She chooses less healthily when one option is tastier while the other is healthier (conflict trials). She is least likely to choose normatively when the difference in tastiness is large, and the difference in healthiness is small. Thus, our simulations make the commonsense prediction that attribute values matter in determining the overall likelihood that an individual makes a healthy/normative choice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simulating the dilemma of self-control.</title><p>An evidence accumulation model (drift diffusion model [DDM]) can be used to simulate decision making for any self-control context requiring an integration of normative and hedonistic considerations (dietary choices displayed, integrating relative tastiness and healthiness). Heat maps display simulated healthy/unhealthy choices for binary choices consisting of a proposed option vs. a default option. Both options are characterized by attribute values such as the perceived tastiness and healthiness of the two food options, with plot axes capturing the relative value difference in tastiness (x-axis) and healthiness (y-axis) of the proposal vs. the default. For example, for each heat map, the upper right-hand quadrant shows likelihood of a healthy choice when the proposed option was both tastier and healthier than the default. The upper left-hand quadrant illustrates the likelihood of a healthy choice when proposed foods were healthier but less tasty than the default and so forth. Warmer colors indicate a higher likelihood of choosing the healthier option. (<bold>a</bold>) On average across multiple different goals (i.e., different weights on different attributes), the likelihood of a healthy choice depends on the relative attribute values of one option vs. another. Healthy choices are less likely when tastiness and healthiness conflict (conflict trials: one option is clearly better on one attribute, but worse on the other). (<bold>b</bold>) Specific goals prioritizing tastiness or prioritizing healthiness alter the frequency of healthy choice, although it still depends on the relative values of both tastiness and healthiness. Four example decision makers with different weights on healthiness and tastiness (w<sub>Taste</sub>, w<sub>Health</sub>) are displayed for comparison. (<bold>c</bold>) The overall likelihood of a healthy choice (averaged separately for all combinations of conflict or no-conflict choices) depends on attribute weights. Goals prioritizing tastiness (darker bars) produce fewer healthy choices than goals prioritizing healthiness (lighter bars), but only when tastiness and healthiness conflict. (<bold>d</bold>) The drift diffusion model can also simulate expected neural activity (i.e., aggregate activity summed over decision time: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) when choosing healthy [H] or unhealthy [UH] options, as a function of relative attribute values of available options and different goals. Bars display the overall difference in neural activity for H compared to UH choices for goals prioritizing tastiness (darker bars) and healthiness (lighter bars), divided as a function of attribute conflict. In no-conflict trials, healthy choices elicit less activity regardless of goal (i.e., Activity <sub>H</sub> &lt; Activity <sub>UH</sub>). In conflict trials, however, healthy choices elicit more activity (i.e., Activity <sub>H</sub> &gt; Activity <sub>UH</sub>), but only when goals prioritize tastiness (dark gray bars). Identical results are obtained when substituting response time (RT) for neural response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We thus simulated the effects of different goal states by assuming different weights on hedonic and normative attributes (i.e., tastiness and healthiness). We show four example simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. Unsurprisingly, the decision maker chooses healthily less frequently when the weight on tastiness is higher than weight on healthiness. However, these differences are starkest in conflict trials, and essentially vanish for no-conflict trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Observation 3: Normative choices result in higher neural response only if attributes conflict and the decision maker weighs hedonic attributes more</title><p>The last and most important goal of our computational model simulations was to examine how neural response in a control region like the dlPFC (assuming its activity correlates with evidence accumulation) might depend on weights given to hedonic and normative attributes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We characterized this simulated response as the absolute value of the accumulated evidence at each time point, summed over the duration of the choice, as this is what should contribute to observable BOLD responses.</p><p>Comparing differences in simulated neural response for healthy and unhealthy choices yields two important conclusions. First, when options do not conflict on healthiness or tastiness (i.e., one option is better on both), healthy choices generally elicit <italic>less</italic> activity than unhealthy ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Notably, for no-conflict trials, this holds true irrespective of whether a decision maker is currently prioritizing tastiness or healthiness. Second, and more importantly, when attributes <italic>conflict</italic>, neural activity during healthy vs. unhealthy choices shows a striking dependence on an individual’s goals (i.e., the relative balance of w<sub>Health</sub> and w<sub>Taste</sub>). In conflict trials, hedonism-favoring goals (i.e., w<sub>Taste</sub> &gt; w<sub>Health</sub>) result in higher activity on average when choosing healthily. In contrast, when goals prioritize normative attributes like healthiness (i.e., w<sub>Health</sub> &gt; w<sub>Taste</sub>), simulated neural responses are <italic>lower</italic> on average for healthy compared to unhealthy choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Thus, the neural response is positively associated with normative choice (i.e., greater neural activity to choose normatively instead of hedonistically) only when the decision maker places a higher weight on hedonistic than normative attributes. The same is true of simulated RTs, which are often used as a proxy for both choice difficulty and the presence of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the logic of evidence accumulation models suggests that the observation that normative choices activate brain areas associated with cognitive control might simply indicate that hedonic attributes are currently weighed more highly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Testing computational predictions using fMRI data</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>The DDM accurately predicts dlPFC activity across a variety of contexts</title><p>It is currently unknown whether activity in the dlPFC region frequently associated with inhibition and self-control might reflect activation patterns in the DDM during self-control. Preliminary evidence suggests that at least one region of the dlPFC correlates with evidence accumulation signals in simple choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hare et al., 2011b</xref>). We thus began by verifying that trial-by-trial simulated neural activity in the DDM correlated with activity in this region for complex, multi-attribute choices typical of different real-world self-control dilemmas. To assess the generalizability of this finding, we examined this across different choice contexts. We also show in supplementary analyses that this result does not depend on the particular form of the computational model but applies using an alternate formulations of a basic process of evidence accumulation to a threshold (see Appendix 2 for the example of an attribute-based neural DDM (anDDM) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Note, however, that finding a correlation within this region could occur because the dlPFC performs the precise computations carried out by the DDM, or could occur if the dlPFC performs separate computational functions that activate proportionally to evidence accumulation activity (e.g., RT). In either case, we would expect the trial-by-trial activity of the dlPFC to correlate with predictions of the DDM.</p><p>Our analysis focused on three previously collected fMRI datasets. Dataset 1<sup>30</sup> (N=51) and Dataset 2<sup>22</sup> (N=49) utilized an Altruistic Choice Task trading off different monetary outcomes for self and an anonymous partner in a modified version of a Dictator game (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>, see Methods for details). Dataset 3 utilized a Food Choice Task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), collected on three separate samples of participants (Sample 3a<sup>22</sup> N=36; Sample 3b N=33<sup>6</sup>; Sample 3c<sup>31</sup> N=45, respectively), with different foods varying in tastiness and healthiness (see Methods for details). In Dataset 1 (altruistic choice), choices were made with the instruction to simply choose the most-preferred option (simulating natural choice contexts without experimentally manipulating goals/attribute weights). In Datasets 2 and 3, participants made choices in three separate conditions that manipulated goals/attribute weights by instructing participants to focus on different normative or hedonistic attributes (a point we return to below). All three datasets involved trials involving conflict between hedonic and normative attributes (conflict trials). Studies in Dataset 3 also included trials without such conflict, allowing us to test differential predictions of the computational model for conflict and no-conflict contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Because the three samples comprising Dataset 3 had an identical design, and neural results indicated no significant differences across the studies in regions of interest for the key analysis of normative vs. hedonistic choice, we report the results below collapsed across the samples (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for a comparison of results across samples).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>fMRI task designs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In Dataset 1, participants made choices involving tradeoffs between monetary payoff for another person ($Other; normative attribute) and for themselves ($Self; hedonic attribute) in an Altruistic Choice Task.

In particular, models suggesting that the dlPFC promotes normative choices or inhibits prepotent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heatherton and Wagner, 2011</xref>) imply that norm-consistent choices should be accompanied by greater activation in the dlPFC (as has been observed previously). Moreover, this should be especially true when people focus on normative goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kober et al., 2010</xref>), since those goals support norm-sensitive behavior and might require the override of default hedonistic preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2013</xref>). The DDM makes the opposite prediction. While neural activity in the model (and by extension the dlPFC) <italic>can</italic> be higher for normative compared to hedonistic choices, this should be true only when goals lead to a stronger weighting of hedonic attributes and attribute values conflict (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Thus, if a regulatory focus on normative attributes increases their weight in the evidence accumulation process, this should increase normative choices, but result in <italic>lower</italic>, not higher, neural activity for those choices. We tested these predictions by performing an ROI analysis in the dlPFC, examining the contrast of activity for normative compared to hedonistic choices in different contexts. In Dataset 1 (altruistic choice), this involved choices made only during natural, unregulated decision making. In Dataset 2 (altruistic choice) and Dataset 3 (food choice), we examined choices made under different regulatory goals that were designed to increase or decrease weights on hedonic and normative attributes (i.e., payoffs for self and other in altruistic choice, tastiness and healthiness in food choice). As described above, we focused on an area predictively associated with the term ‘inhibitory control’ using the meta-analytic tool NeuroQuery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dockès et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref> [blue] for an illustration of the ROI). Results were similar when using other definitions of this ROI (see Appendix 3, ‘Alternative ROI specifications’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>), as well as when focusing on other regions associated with the DDM at a whole-brain level (see Appendix 4 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">Appendix 4—figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Generous vs. selfish choices (Dataset 1</italic>). In Dataset 1, choices were defined as normative (i.e., generous) if the participant selected the option with less money for themselves and more money for their partner. Choices were defined as hedonistic (i.e., selfish) otherwise. Weights from the best-fitting model parameters indicated that subjects naturally placed more weight on their own outcomes (mean w<sub>Self</sub>=0.0043 ± 0.0011 s.d.) than the other person’s outcomes (mean w<sub>Other</sub> <italic>=</italic> 0.0018 ± 0.0018, paired-t<sub>50</sub>=14.465, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>) or on fairness (i.e., |Self – Other|, mean w<sub>Fairness</sub> <italic>=</italic> 0.0011 ± 0.0032, paired-t<sub>50</sub>=7.33, p=1.829 × 10<sup>–9</sup>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Given the higher weight on self-interest, a hedonic attribute, and the fact that all trials in this study involved conflict between normative and hedonic attributes, we predicted that we should observe greater neural response on average when people chose generously. We further predicted that individual differences in activation between generous and selfish choices should correlate <italic>negatively</italic> with individual differences in the relative weight on payoffs to other, a normative attribute, compared to payoffs for the self, a hedonic attribute. In other words, subjects who place more relative weight on the normative attribute should actually show <italic>less</italic> activation in the dlPFC during normative choice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> for both average simulated predictions and individual difference predictions based on the weights fitted to participants in Dataset 1). An ROI analysis of BOLD response for generous vs. selfish choices in the inhibitory control dlPFC ROI supported both predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). We observed a significant increase in average response during generous compared to selfish choices (paired-t<sub>43</sub>=2.13, p=0.04, Cohen’s d=0.32), confirming our prediction of higher dlPFC activity for normative choices. Moreover, for our primary dlPFC ROI, when correlating individual differences in weights on other vs. self (i.e., w<sub>Other</sub> – w<sub>Self</sub>) with differences in dlPFC BOLD response for generous vs. selfish choices, we observed a significant negative relationship of roughly the same magnitude as predicted by simulations (<italic>r</italic>=–0.31, p=0.04). A supplemental whole-brain analysis confirmed that this pattern was specific to the dlPFC, as well as regions of dACC and IFG/aIns that were also associated with the DDM, rather than a general property of neural activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for details).</p><p><italic>Regulatory effects on generous vs. selfish responding (Dataset 2</italic>). In Dataset 2 (also anonymous altruistic decision making and conflict trials only), we sought to replicate and extend these results. More specifically, we sought to test the DDM prediction that if regulatory goals increase the weight on normative attributes, this should result in <italic>decreased</italic> activation in the dlPFC when choosing normatively. Note that this prediction complements the negative correlation between dlPFC response and the balance of normative vs. hedonistic weights across subjects, but extends it to a within-subject prediction: even in participants who under normal circumstances might show greater activation in the dlPFC during generosity, interventions that shift weights in favor of normative attributes should reduce, rather than enhance, such differences. To manipulate weights on hedonic and normative attributes, we used an instructed cognitive regulation manipulation in which we asked participants on different trials either to ‘Respond Naturally’ (mirroring the natural preferences expressed by participants in Study 1) or to focus on one of two different goals (‘Focus on Ethics’ [Ethics], ‘Focus on your Partner’s Feelings’ [Partner]) that both emphasize normative attributes, but in different ways (see Methods for details). To confirm that the manipulation influenced attribute weights, we performed one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs with condition (Natural, Ethics, Partner) as a fixed effect and best-fitting attribute weight parameters w<sub>Self</sub>, w<sub>Other</sub>, and w<sub>Fairness</sub> as dependent variables. This analysis confirmed that our manipulation yielded significantly different weights on the attributes across the conditions (all F<sub>2,96</sub> &gt; 13.54, all p&lt;6.59 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, see Methods for details of model fitting). As expected, weights for self-interest (a hedonic attribute, w<sub>Self</sub>) were highest in the Natural condition (M<sub>Natural</sub> = 0.0073 ± 0.0035 s.d.), lower in the Ethics condition (M<sub>Ethics</sub> = 0.0061 ± 0.0047), and lowest in the Partner condition (M<sub>Partner</sub> = 0.0037 ± 0.0065). By contrast, weights on the partner’s outcomes and fairness (attributes related more strongly to social norms) increased with regulation (w<sub>Other</sub>: M<sub>Natural</sub> = 0.0010 ± 0.0038, M<sub>Ethics</sub> = 0.0041 ± 0.0045, M<sub>Partner</sub> = 0.0051 ± 0.0038; w<sub>Fairness</sub>: M<sub>Natural</sub> = 0.0017 ± 0.0033, M<sub>Ethics</sub> = 0.0053 ± 0.0046, M<sub>Partner</sub> = 0.0024 ± 0.0035) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>for more details on parameters).</p><p>Having confirmed that the regulatory focus manipulation altered weights on hedonic and normative attributes, we next asked if this manipulation affected BOLD response during generous vs. selfish choice in the dlPFC, consistent with predictions of the DDM. In particular, given that all trials involved conflict between normative and hedonic attributes, we predicted that in the Natural condition, where participants generally placed higher weight on self-interest (a hedonic attribute), <italic>generous</italic> choices should elicit higher activation. In contrast, in the Ethics and Partner conditions, which elicited more equal or even higher weight on normative attributes (i.e., other’s outcomes and fairness), this difference should disappear or even reverse. In other words, the model predicts that in some cases, <italic>selfish</italic> choices should elicit the greatest activity in the dlPFC. Predictions of the DDM given the specific attribute weights observed in this study are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>.</p><p>To test these predictions in the neural data, we performed one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs with condition (Natural, Ethics, Partner) as a fixed effect and average BOLD response in the dlPFC ROI for the contrast of generous vs. selfish choice as the dependent variable. This analysis revealed a significant effect of condition on dlPFC response (F<sub>2,96</sub> = 5.91, p=0.004). Post hoc planned comparisons confirmed that in the Natural condition, generous choices elicited significantly greater activity in the dlPFC than hedonic choices (t<sub>48</sub>=2.16, p=0.04, Cohen’s d=0.31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>), replicating the observed difference during Natural choices of Study 1. By contrast, in the Ethics and Partner focus conditions, generous choices no longer elicited significantly greater activation. Instead, <italic>selfish</italic> choices elicited <italic>greater</italic> activation, although the effect did not reach statistical significance. However, the key test of our predictions was confirmed: the difference in activation between generous vs. selfish choice in both the Partner and Ethics conditions differed significantly from the difference in the Natural condition (G vs. S, Partner vs. Natural: t<sub>48</sub>=2.57, p=0.01, Cohen’s d=0.36; G vs. S, Ethics vs. Natural: t<sub>48</sub>=3.13, p=0.003, Cohen’s d=0.45). Thus, in the same individuals, the association between generous choices and <italic>higher</italic> activation in the dlPFC depended on whether goals emphasized selfishness rather than social norms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Supplemental whole-brain analyses and examination of individual differences confirmed these findings (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and Appendix 5 for details).</p><p><italic>Regulatory effects on healthy vs. unhealthy choice (Dataset 3</italic>). In Dataset 3, we sought to replicate the finding that a regulatory focus on normative attributes reduces activation in the dlPFC in a different, non-social domain: healthy eating. During the Food Choice Task in Dataset 3, attribute weights were manipulated by instructing participants either to ‘Respond Naturally’, ‘Focus on Health’, or ‘Focus on Taste’ while making their choice. Normative (i.e., healthy) choices were defined as selecting the food with higher subjectively perceived healthiness (see Methods for details). Note that the ‘Focus on Health’ instruction aimed to increase the weight on healthiness (w<sub>Health</sub>), a normative attribute. Extending results in Dataset 2, the ‘Focus on Taste’ condition was designed to enhance the weight on tastiness (w<sub>Taste</sub>), the hedonic attribute, which should preserve or even enhance the difficulty of normative choices that we observed in natural choice settings in Datasets 1 and 2. This allowed us to verify that our findings are specifically driven by changes in weights, not simply because we asked participants to perform a cognitive task.</p><p>To confirm that the regulatory manipulation influenced attribute weights, we performed one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs, similar to Dataset 2, with condition (Natural, Taste, Health) as a fixed effect and estimated attribute weight parameters w<sub>Taste</sub> and w<sub>Health</sub> as dependent variables. Because Dataset 2 combined data from three individual participant samples (see Methods for details), we also included Study as an additional factor in the analysis. Here, we report the effect of the manipulation on attribute weights across all studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for results in each sample separately). This analysis confirmed that our manipulation yielded significantly different weights on the different attributes across the conditions (all <sub>F2,220</sub> &gt; 44.43, all p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). As expected, weights on tastiness (a hedonic attribute) were highest in the Taste and Natural conditions (M<sub>Taste</sub> = 0.0056 ± 0.0043, M<sub>Natural</sub> = 0.0058 ± 0.0036), and lowest in the Health condition (M<sub>Health</sub> = 0.0027 ± 0.0033). Weights on healthiness (a normative attribute) showed the opposite pattern, being lowest in the Taste condition (M<sub>Taste</sub> = 0.0002 ± 0.0022), similar though slightly higher in the Natural condition (M<sub>Natural</sub> = 0.0005 ± 0.0021), and highest in the Health condition (M<sub>Health</sub> = 0.0042 ± 0.0035).</p><p>Next, we generated predictions for the pattern of dlPFC response on the subset of trials involving conflict. For each condition, we used each individual’s best-fitting weights to simulate neural responses using the DDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). These simulations predicted that healthy compared to unhealthy choices should on average elicit the greatest activation in the dlPFC in the Taste and Natural conditions (though unexpectedly, the model predicted a non-significantly <italic>smaller</italic> difference in Taste trials). More importantly, the model predicted that this difference should be significantly smaller in the Health condition. Because observed weights on tastiness and healthiness in the Health condition were similar in strength, the within-condition comparison between healthy and unhealthy choices was not predicted to be significant. To test these predictions, we performed a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, similar to Dataset 2, with condition (Natural, Taste, Health) as a fixed effect and the average dlPFC BOLD response in the contrast of healthy vs. unhealthy choice (limited to trials with attribute conflict) as the dependent variable. We also included sample (i.e., Sample 3a, 3b, 3c) as a factor interacting with condition, but observed no differences in dlPFC activity as either a main effect of sample (F<sub>2,101</sub> = 2.15, p=0.12) or as a modifier of condition effects (F<sub>4,177</sub> = 1.52, p=0.19). We thus report results collapsed across studies (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for visualizations of results separated by study). As predicted by the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), this analysis revealed a significant effect of condition on dlPFC response (F<sub>2,177</sub> = 4.11, p=0.02). Follow-up t-tests confirmed the predicted direction of dlPFC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). BOLD response during healthy compared to unhealthy choices was significantly greater in the Natural condition for the dlPFC (paired-t<sub>100</sub>=2.35, p=0.02, Cohen’s d=0.24, within-condition comparison). As predicted, in the Health condition, healthy vs. unhealthy choices elicited comparable dlPFC responses (paired-t<sub>97</sub>=0.86, p=0.39, Cohen’s d=0.09, within-condition comparison) and even showed a trend toward greater activity for <italic>unhealthy</italic> choices. Importantly, the reduction of the difference in activity during healthy vs. unhealthy choices between Natural and Health conditions was significant (paired-t<sub>93</sub>=2.58, p=0.01, Cohen’s d=0.27). Response for healthy vs. unhealthy choice in the Taste condition lay in between these two extremes, as predicted by the model. While the comparison of healthy vs. unhealthy choices in the Health vs. Taste condition was not significant (paired-t<sub>97</sub>=1.35, p=0.18, Cohen’s d=0.15), we attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the Taste condition had very few healthy choices per individual. Thus, the comparison of healthy vs. unhealthy choices was significantly noisier to estimate, and based on a smaller number of subjects (N=84). Nevertheless, our primary hypothesis was confirmed: in the same individuals, healthy choices could be accompanied by <italic>higher</italic> activation in brain regions typically associated with cognitive control (when goals naturally emphasized hedonism), or <italic>matched</italic> or even <italic>lower</italic> activation (when goals emphasized health norms). Supplemental whole-brain analyses confirmed that this pattern of results was specific to the dlPFC and other regions associated with the DDM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for details).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Absence of regulatory effects in the absence of conflict (Dataset 3)</title><p>Our analyses so far focused on conflict trials, since simulations suggest that these trials show the biggest differences as a function of attribute weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The design of Dataset 3, which included a subset of trials with no attribute conflict, also allowed us to test one further prediction of the DDM. In Observation 3, we found that normative choices should be associated with increased neural activity <italic>when hedonic and normative attributes conflict</italic> but the reverse when they do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Moreover, the DDM suggests little to no differences in response across goal contexts favoring hedonism or health norms. This suggests that, in contrast to conflicted choices, there should be less effect of regulatory focus on dlPFC response during no-conflict choices.</p><p>To test this prediction, we first performed a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with condition (Natural, Taste, Health) as a fixed effect and the average BOLD in the dlPFC for the contrast of healthy vs. unhealthy choice as the dependent variable, focusing only on the subset of trials with no-conflict between tastiness and healthiness of a food (i.e., when the value of the option was positive or negative for both). As before, we also included sample (3a, 3b, 3c) as a factor in this analysis. Because we found a non-significant difference across studies in dlPFC response during unconflicted trials (F<sub>4,209</sub> = 2.26, p=0.06), we report the results for Dataset 3 below collapsed across samples. As predicted, when examining only non-conflict trials, there was no significant influence of regulatory condition on the difference in neural activity between healthy and unhealthy choice (F<sub>2,213</sub> = 0.357, p=0.7). Given this lack of effect across conditions, we averaged the three conditions together to analyze the main effect of healthy vs. unhealthy choice. This analysis indicated that healthy choices were accompanied by a non-significantly <italic>lower</italic> response in this region (paired-t<sub>104</sub>=0.21, p=0.84, Cohen’s d=0.02). In other words, as expected from model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), activation in the dlPFC for normative choices when normative and hedonic attributes did not conflict is generally low, and shows no significant effect of regulatory focus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>When and why do normative choices – which conform to abstract standards and social rules – recruit regions associated with cognitive control like the dlPFC? Simulated activity from an attribute-based DDM suggests a straightforward answer: normative behavior may only trigger the dlPFC when normative attributes conflict with hedonic ones, and the decision maker values hedonic attributes more. Across three separate fMRI datasets and two different choice domains (generosity and healthy eating), we show several results that confirm predictions of the DDM. First, we show that activation in the dlPFC correlates consistently with predicted neural responses of the DDM across all contexts examined. Second, we show that even in individuals who show a natural bias toward selfishness, regulatory instructions to focus on socially normative attributes increase generosity, but <italic>reduce</italic> dlPFC response when choosing generously. Third, this pattern replicated in the domain of healthy eating, suggesting a general principle that may apply across a variety of self-control dilemmas. Our results provide empirical support for recent theories positing that successful self-control – defined as choosing long-term or abstract benefits over hedonic, immediate gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duckworth, 2011</xref>) – depends importantly on value computations. They stand in contrast to the predictions of models of posterior dlPFC function suggesting that the strength with which the dlPFC activates during choice determines whether prepotent hedonistic responses are resisted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofmann et al., 2009</xref>). Our results point to a modified conceptualization of the role played by the dlPFC in promoting normative choice.</p><p>A large literature, generally consistent with models that assume normative behavior requires controlled processing, suggests that the dlPFC activates when prepotent responses conflict with desired normative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garavan et al., 1999</xref>). The neural activity in the DDM, which arises from evidence accumulation signals, is in some ways consistent with such an interpretation. However, it calls into question assumptions that prepotency equates to hedonism, or even to automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargh, 1994</xref>) more generally. Instead, our model suggests that the ‘prepotent response’ may correspond, at least in the realm of value-based decision making, to choices consistent with the choice attribute that is currently receiving higher weight, <italic>regardless of the source of that weight</italic>. In other words, even when higher weights on normative attributes derive primarily from a deliberative, regulatory focus, as in our final two datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>), this yields <italic>reduced</italic> activity in the dlPFC when making normative choices. Mechanistically, these patterns result from the fact that higher weights on normative attributes reduce the computation required for neural accumulation signals to trigger a normative response. Thus, while virtuous choices associated with successful self-control may sometimes recruit the posterior dlPFC, manipulations that increase the weight on normative attributes, either by making it more salient in the exogenous environment or focusing endogenous attention toward it, should both promote normative behavior and make it <italic>easier</italic> to accomplish.</p><p>This observation may help to explain why some researchers have found evidence consistent with greater response in the dlPFC promoting normative choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cutler and Campbell-Meiklejohn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hakimi and Hare, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>), while others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zaki and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magen et al., 2014</xref>). Variations that influence the weight on normative attributes – whether across individuals, goal contexts, or paradigms – will tend to reduce statistical significance and increase heterogeneity in the link between neural activation in the dlPFC and normative choice. Fortunately, our model provides a way to predict both <italic>when</italic> and <italic>why</italic> dlPFC activity will be observed. For example, in the domain of intertemporal choice, our model predicts that making future outcomes more salient should amplify their weight in the choice process, promoting patience while <italic>decreasing</italic> dlPFC activation. This is exactly what is observed empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, researchers would do well to interpret activation of the dlPFC for a particular kind of choice (be it generous or selfish, healthy or unhealthy, patient or impatient) with caution. Such a pattern may say less about whether the dlPFC (and by extension, cognitive control more generally) is <italic>required</italic> to inhibit instinctual responses and preferences, and more about what kinds of attributes are most salient or valuable at the moment.</p><p>Our results have important implications for theories of self-control suggesting that the dlPFC promotes self-control by modulating attribute weights in the choice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rudorf and Hare, 2014</xref>). The region of dlPFC that correlated with the DDM in our datasets is nearly identical to areas previously found when dieters made healthy compared to unhealthy choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>), and when participants were required to recompute values based on contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rudorf and Hare, 2014</xref>). Yet, we find that the relationship between self-control ‘success’ and ‘failure’ in this region attenuates when participants actively focus on health: dlPFC now responds non-significantly more strongly to <italic>unhealthy</italic> choices. These results thus seem incongruent with the notion that this area down-regulates weight on norm-inconsistent considerations and up-regulates norm-consistent ones, since we observed <italic>decreased</italic> responses in this area in the context of <italic>increased</italic> normative choice and <italic>increased</italic> weight on normative attributes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>). Instead, this region appeared to correlate with the evidence accumulation stage of decisions, rather than with the evidence construction stage, responding during decision conflict generally, regardless of whether that conflict derived from greater weighting of hedonic or normative attributes.</p><p>We emphasize, however, that our results and conclusions apply narrowly to the area of dlPFC examined here. The evidence accumulation-related dlPFC region in this study, which also corresponds to the area identified by the meta-analytic ‘inhibitory control’, lies posterior and dorsal to another dlPFC area that we have observed, in these same datasets, to track hedonistic and normative attributes in a goal-consistent manner and to serve as a candidate for mediating regulation-induced changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, gray matter volume in this more anterior dlPFC area, but not in the posterior dlPFC region identified here, correlates with regulatory success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, while some areas of the dlPFC may indeed play an important role in promoting self-regulation and normative behavior by altering attribute weights in decision value, we suspect that they are anatomically and computationally distinct from the region of the posterior dlPFC sometimes assumed to serve this role. Future work will be needed to better delineate subregions of the dlPFC, and to determine the unique role each one plays in promoting normative choices.</p><p>The correspondence between predictions of the DDM and activation patterns in the dlPFC makes it tempting to conclude that this region performs this computational function. While this hypothesis is consistent with results from single-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), we also acknowledge that the dlPFC has been associated with many computational functions and roles, not all of which are mutually incompatible. Thus, it is possible that the dlPFC region observed here performs some sort of process that is correlated with, but not identical to, the neuronal computations of the DDM. Indeed, although we found that dlPFC responses mostly conformed to predictions of the DDM, we also found a few notable divergences. For example, during unconflicted trials, the DDM predicts that <italic>hedonistic</italic> choices should be strongly associated with greater activity than normative choices. While we observed a weak effect in this direction in Dataset 3 (the only dataset in which this prediction could be tested), it was not significant. Similarly, in Dataset 2, the DDM predicted that the comparison of generous vs. selfish choices should be lower when focused on one’s partner compared to when focusing on ethics, while the empirical data showed no difference. While some of these discrepancies could be due simply to the noisiness inherent to fMRI (especially in studies that were originally designed to address other questions), it is also possible that they serve as clues that the computational function of the dlPFC may be strongly correlated with, but importantly distinct from, the evidence accumulation process itself. Future work, including computational modifications or additions to the DDM, and recordings from other modalities like EEG or intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>), may help to elucidate the precise computational functions served by this area and the ways in which it promotes adaptive choice and normative behavior. Our work serves to highlight the value of computational models for understanding the neural and psychological computations involved in self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tusche and Bas, 2021</xref>). Work extending these findings to other domains of normative choice, such as moral decision making or intertemporal choice, may also help to identify the commonalities and differences across different self-control dilemmas.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational model simulations</title><p>Our attribute value-based DDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) assumes that brain areas involved in decision making (particularly those that convert preferences into action) demonstrate activity that correlates with an evidence accumulation process shaped by the weighted value of attributes on each trial.

In our simulations, we assumed two independent attributes: one related to hedonism (e.g., tastiness of a food) and one related to norms and standards (e.g., healthiness), although in principle any number and type of attribute could occur. Using these equations allowed us to simulate the dynamically evolving evidence accumulation signal, and to derive distributions of both RTs and neural response, which we assumed was proportional to the total accumulated evidence summed over the time of the decision (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). We label the final output (i.e., choice) of the system as ‘normative’ if it results in selecting the option with the higher unweighted value for the normative attribute (e.g., the option with higher healthiness).</p><p>To simulate everyday self-control dilemmas using this framework, we simulated choices between two options representing different combinations of hedonistic and normative attributes, allowing the relative value difference between an option and its alternative on a given attribute to vary independently in the arbitrarily chosen range [-3,–2, …+2,+3]. This permitted us to explore how the likelihood of a normative choice changes depending on how much better or worse one of the two options is along hedonic and normative attribute dimensions, as well as what happens when the relative values of the two attributes conflict (i.e., take opposite signs) or do not.</p><p>Our simulations also sought to capture the notion that a decision maker can vary from moment to moment in their commitment to and desire for hedonistic vs. normative goals. For example, a dieter may begin to relax the importance they place on norm-consistent attributes like healthiness once they reach their target weight, resulting in more unhealthy choices. In the main text (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we describe simulations for four different goal contexts with different asymmetric combinations of weights: two had higher weights on tastiness, a hedonic attribute (i.e., w<sub>T</sub> = 0.05, w<sub>H</sub> = 0.02, and w<sub>T</sub> = 0.04, w<sub>H</sub> = 0.03) and two with higher weights on healthiness, a normative attribute (w<sub>T</sub> = 0.03, w<sub>H</sub> = 0.04, and w<sub>T</sub> = 0.02, w<sub>H</sub> = 0.05). For simplicity, we assumed that all choices used a choice-determining threshold ±B = 0.15, selected to produce RTs in the range typically observed in human subjects. Thus, for illustration purposes, we simulated a decision maker in four different contexts with different weights on the two attributes, facing 49 distinct choices representing different combinations of attribute values. To ensure that our conclusions held across a variety of weights, we also simulated an additional 32 different goal contexts, fully covering the factorial combination of weights on w<sub>T</sub> and w<sub>H</sub> in the range of 0–0.05 (0.01 increments). Using these values and weights, we simulated hedonistic and normative choice frequencies, total neural activation, and RTs for each of the different hypothetical option pairs/attribute combinations, probing the effects of attribute weights, attribute magnitudes, and attribute conflict (i.e., match or mismatch between the signs of normative and hedonic attribute).

We examined self-control dilemmas pitting self-interest against generosity using an Altruistic Choice Task for Datasets 1 and 2. On every trial in the fMRI scanner, the participant chose between a proposed pair of monetary prizes for herself and a real but anonymous partner, or a constant default prize-pair for both ($50 in Dataset 1, $20 in Dataset 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>). Proposed prizes in the prize-pair varied from $0 to $100 in Dataset 1 and $0 to $40 in Dataset 2, and always involved one individual receiving an amount less than or equal to the default, while the other individual received more. Thus, on every trial, the participant had to choose between generous behavior (benefitting the other at a cost to oneself) and selfish behavior (benefitting oneself at a cost to the other).</p><p>Upon presentation of the proposal, participants had up to four seconds to indicate their choice using a 4-point scale (Strong No, No, Yes, Strong Yes), allowing us to simultaneously measure both their decision and strength of preference at the time of choice. The direction of increasing preference (right-to-left or left-to-right) varied for each round of the task in Dataset 1, and across participants in Dataset 2. If the subject did not respond within 4 s, both individuals received $0 for that trial.</p><p>To increase the anonymity of choices, the participant’s choice was implemented probabilistically: in 60% of trials, she received his chosen option, while in 40% of trials, her choice was reversed and she received the alternative, non-chosen option. This reversal meant that while it was always in the participant’s best interest to choose according to her true preferences, her partner could never be sure about the actual choice made. Probabilistic implementation does not strongly influence the choices participants make (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>), but permits more plausible anonymity, increasing the self-control challenge involved in choosing generously. The participants were informed that the passive partners were aware of the probabilistic implementation, and the outcome was revealed on every trial 2–4 s following the response. At the end of the task, one trial was randomly selected and implemented according to the participant’s choice in the selected trial.</p><p>Dataset 1 included 180 trials total, with no specific instructions for how to respond. Dataset 2 included 270 trials, 90 each in three instructed focus conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Sample 3a was collected in our laboratory and completed on a subset of participants from Dataset 2. Samples 3b and 3c were collected in other research labs, but had nearly identical structure. We thus describe common elements among all tasks, highlighting minor differences where relevant.</p><p>Prior to the main choice task, participants rated a set of different foods for their healthiness and tastiness (200 foods in Study 3a, 180 in Studies 3b and 3c). For Study 3a, these ratings were used to select a pool of 90 foods that covered a range of health and taste ratings. For all three studies, they were used to select a neutral reference food rated as neutral on both health and taste. This neutral food served as individuals’ default option for each choice (similar to the monetary default option in the Altruistic Choice Task).</p><p>On each trial in the fMRI scanner (270 trials in Study 3a, 180 in Studies 3b–c), participants saw one selected food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and had to decide whether they would prefer to eat the displayed food or the reference food. As in the Altruistic Choice Task, participants had up to 4 s in Study 3a and 3 s in Studies 3b–c to indicate their choice using a 4-point scale (Strong No, No, Yes, Strong Yes). If the subject did not respond within the time limit, one of the foods was selected randomly. To match the instructed goal manipulation used in the Altruistic Choice Task, participants completed trials each in one of three instructed focus conditions (90 trials per condition in Study 3a, 60 trials per condition in Studies 3b–c). See the <italic>Manipulating normative goals (Datasets 2 and 3</italic>) section below for details. In all three studies, one trial was randomly selected at the end and implemented.</p><p>In Study 3a, to match the probabilistic outcome used in the Altruistic Choice Task, the participant’s choice was also implemented probabilistically in the Food Choice Task. In 60% of trials, participants received the chosen option, while in 40% of trials the choice was reversed and she received the alternative, non-chosen option. To reduce the length of the task, participants did not see this outcome on every trial. Instead, three trials were selected randomly at the end of each scan, and participants viewed their choice as well as the probabilistic outcome on that trial. In Studies 3b–c participants simply received their choice on a randomly chosen trial at the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Manipulating normative goals (Datasets 2 and 3)</title><p>Our computational model simulations suggested that the extent to which normative choices are associated with greater neural response depends to a large extent on the priority or weight given to normative vs. hedonic attributes.

However, participants knew that they would receive the outcome of one of their choices and were told that they should choose according to their preferences regardless of the instruction, thus encouraging participants to choose in a way that reflected their current decision value for the item.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Defining normative choice</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Behavioral definition of generosity</title><p>All choices involved a tradeoff between maximizing outcomes for the self or the other. We therefore label specific decisions as normative (i.e., generous) if the participant accepted a proposal when $Self &lt; $Other or rejected one when $Self &gt; $Other.

In both cases, we label specific decisions as normative (i.e., healthy) if the participant either accepted a healthy food or rejected an unhealthy food. All other choices were labeled as hedonistic (i.e., unhealthy).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Computational model fitting</title><p>We used a Bayesian model-fitting approach to identify the best-fitting model parameters of the DDM (i.e., attribute-specific weight parameters W, a drift constant C, threshold B, and non-decision time ndt) to account for choices and RTs, separately for each participant in each study and each condition in Datasets 2 and 3. More specifically, we obtained estimates of the posterior distribution of each parameter using the differentially evolving Monte-Carlo Markov chain sampling method and MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MATLAB, 2016</xref>) code developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holmes and Trueblood, 2018</xref>. This method uses the DDM described above (computational model simulations) to simulate the likelihood of the observed data (i.e., choices and RTs) given a specific combination of parameters. We then used this likelihood to construct a Bayesian estimate of the posterior distribution of the likelihood of the parameters given the data.</p><p>For each individual fit, we used 3 × N chains, where N is the number of free parameters (6 in Datasets 1 and 2, 5 in Dataset 3), using uninformative, uniformly distributed priors and constraining parameter values as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>) and theoretical bounds. To construct the estimated posterior distributions of each parameter, we sampled 1500 iterations per chain after an initial burn-in period of 500 samples. Best-fitting values of each parameter were computed as the mean over the posterior distribution for that parameter. These parameter values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were used to simulate trial-by-trial neural activation for use in the GLMs described below. Importantly, parameter values identified by this fitting procedure suggested that the model provided a good fit to behavior across all three datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The analysis of the values of individual chains using the Gelman-Rubin statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelman and Rubin, 1992</xref>) indicated good convergence to the posterior distribution for each parameter (all <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neuroimaging analyses</title><p><italic>GLM 1a: Neural Correlates of the DDM (Dataset 1</italic>). We used GLM 1a to identify brain regions where activation varied parametrically according to the predictions of the DDM in Dataset 1 (Altruistic Choice Task). We hypothesized that this analysis would identify brain areas such as the dlPFC commonly associated with cognitive control and provide further data-driven support for the independent dlPFC-ROI. For each trial, we determined the BOLD approximation of the DDM as the value consisting of the sum total of the simulated neural response, averaged over all simulations terminating in the observed choice on that trial within ±250 ms of the observed RT. This estimate was then used as a parametric regressor, modulating a boxcar function with onset at the beginning of the choice period and having a duration of the RT on that trial (see Appendix 1 for further detail on selecting the best regressor). To simulate expected DDM activation on each trial, we generated 10,000 simulations using the best-fitting parameters for each participant and the estimated value of the proposal and default on each trial (i.e., w<sub>Self</sub>*$Self + w<sub>Other</sub>*$Other + w<sub>Fairness</sub>*|$Self − $Other|+C).</p><p>Then, for each subject, we estimated a GLM with AR(1) and the following regressors of interest: (R1) A boxcar function for the choice period on all trials (duration = RT on that trial). (R2) R1 modulated by the subject’s stated preference on that trial (1=Strong No, 4=Strong Yes). (R3) R1 modulated by the estimated activation of the DDM on that trial. (R4) A boxcar function of 3 s specifying the outcome period on each trial. (R5) R4 modulated by the outcome for the self on each trial. (R6) R4 modulated by the outcome for the partner on each trial. (R7) A boxcar function (duration = 4 s) specifying missed trials. Parametric modulators were orthogonalized to each other in SPM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>). Regressors of non-interest included six motion regressors as well as session constants.</p><p>We then computed subject-level contrasts of the DDM parametric modulator (R3) against an implicit baseline. Finally, to test the hypothesis that DDM responses might correlate with activation in the dlPFC at the group level, we subjected this contrast to a one-sample t-test against zero (as implemented in SPM), thresholded at a whole-brain cluster-corrected value of p&lt;0.05, using a cluster-defining threshold of p&lt;0.001.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>GLM 1b: Neural correlates of the DDM (Dataset 2)</title><p>GLM1b was similar to GLM1a, except that we estimated regressors for each goal condition separately.

R2, R5, and R8 modulated R1, R4, and R7 with the decision value on that trial. R3, R6, and R9 modulated R1, R4, and R7 using the estimated activation of the DDM on that trial. A single contrast representing neural correlates of the DDM was constructed by combining R3, R6, and R9 at the subject-level and performing a one-sample t-test against zero.

R2, R5, and R8 were parametric modulators representing the decision value on that trial, and R3, R6, and R9 were modulators consisting of the estimated DDM activity on that trial.

We used GLM 2a to test predictions about neural activation on trials in which subjects chose generously or selfishly. The analysis was carried out in two steps.</p><p>First, for each subject, we estimated a GLM with AR(1) and the following regressors of interest: (R1) A boxcar function for the choice period on trials when the subject chose selfishly. (R2) R1 modulated by the decision value of their 4-point preference response (i.e., Strong No to Strong Yes) at the time of choice. (R3) A boxcar function for the choice period on trials when the subject chose generously. (R4) R3 modulated by the decision value on that trial. Regressors of non-interest included six motion regressors as well as session constants.</p><p>Second, we computed the subject-level contrast image [R3 – R1], which identified brain regions with differential responses for generous compared to selfish choices. Seven subjects were excluded from this analysis for having fewer than 4 generous choices over the 180 trials. To test predictions of the DDM in regions previously associated with self-control, we conducted analyses of this contrast [Generous – Selfish] in several independently selected ROIs (see <italic>Independently defined ROIs</italic> section below). Independent ROIs helped avoid circular analysis and ‘double-dipping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). We also report the results of these contrasts for two other brain areas (dACC, IFG/anIns) identified as correlating with predictions of the DDM at the whole-brain level across all three datasets (see Appendix 4 and Figure 4—figure supplements 5–6).</p><p>Finally, as a supplementary analysis, we examined if any voxels beyond the ROI regions demonstrated a significant effect in any condition, using a whole-brain analysis thresholded at p&lt;0.001, uncorrected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>GLM 2b: Generous vs. Selfish decisions in Altruistic Choice (Dataset 2</italic>). We used GLM 2b to test predictions about activation on trials in which the subject chose generously or selfishly in Dataset 2, and to compare how instructed attention altered these responses. GLM2b was similar to GLM2a, except that we estimated regressors for each goal condition separately. All unreported details match GLM2a. Regressors of interest consisted of the following: (R1) A boxcar function for the choice period on trials when the subject chose selfishly in <italic>Natural Focus</italic> trials. (R2) R1 modulated by the decision value of 4-point preference response (i.e., Strong No to Strong Yes) expressed at the time of choice. (R3) A boxcar function for the choice period on trials when the subject chose generously in <italic>Natural Focus</italic> trials. (R4) R3 modulated by the decision value. (R5–8) Analogous regressors for generous and selfish choices during <italic>Ethics Focus</italic> trials. (R9–12) Analogous regressors for generous and selfish choices during <italic>Partner Focus</italic> trials. (R13–15) A boxcar function of 3 s duration signaling the outcome period for <italic>Natural, Ethics,</italic> or <italic>Partner Focus</italic> trials. (R16–18) R13–15 modulated by the amount received by the subject at the outcome phase for <italic>Natural, Ethics,</italic> or <italic>Partner Focus</italic> trials. (R19–21) R13–15 modulated by the amount received by the partner at the outcome phase for <italic>Natural, Ethics,</italic> or <italic>Partner Focus</italic> trials.</p><p>We then computed the subject-level contrast images [R3 – R1], [R7 – R5], and [R11 – R9], which identified regions with differential responses for generous compared to selfish choices in each goal condition. We computed the average value of each of these contrasts within the same ROIs specified above for GLM2a. As a supplementary analysis, we also asked whether any voxels beyond these regions demonstrated a significant effect in any condition, using a whole-brain analysis thresholded at p&lt;0.001, uncorrected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>GLM 2c: Healthy vs. Unhealthy decisions in the Food Choice Task (Dataset 3</italic>). GLM 2c was analogous to GLM 2b but examined healthy vs. unhealthy choices in the Dietary Choice Task, separately for conflicted trials (i.e., healthy but not tasty foods, or tasty but unhealthy foods) and for unconflicted trials (i.e., healthy and tasty foods, or unhealthy and not tasty foods). It included the following regressors of interest: (R1) A boxcar function for the choice period when the subject made a healthy choice in <italic>Natural Focus</italic> trials with conflict. (R2) R1 modulated by the decision value of behaviorally expressed preference at the time of choice. (R3) A boxcar function for the choice period when the subject made an unhealthy choice in <italic>Natural</italic> trials with conflict. (R4) R3 modulated by the decision value on that trial. (R5–8) Analogous regressors for healthy and unhealthy choices during conflicted <italic>Taste Focus</italic> trials. (R9–12) Analogous regressors for healthy and unhealthy choices during conflicted <italic>Health Focus</italic> trials. (R13) Healthy choices on unconflicted <italic>Natural Focus</italic> trials. (R14) Unhealthy choices on unconflicted <italic>Natural Focus</italic> trials. (R15–16) R13 and R14 modulated by preference. (R17–20) Analogous regressors for healthy and unhealthy choice on unconflicted <italic>Health Focus</italic> trials. (R21–24) Analogous regressors for healthy and unhealthy choice on unconflicted <italic>Taste Focus</italic> trials. Subject-level contrast images of healthy vs. unhealthy choices, in each condition separately and separately for conflicted vs. unconflicted trials, were computed in a manner identical to GLM2b. We analyzed activation for these contrasts specifically within the independently defined ROIs described below. As a supplementary analysis, we also report results at the whole-brain level at p&lt;0.001, uncorrected, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

Although our DDM neural results at the whole-brain level confirmed that activation in the dlPFC correlated with the DDM, we sought to avoid circularity by testing our primary predictions about dlPFC activation in ROIs defined independently of the main contrast. Toward this end, we tested activation in three ROIs. As our primary ROI, we created a left dlPFC ROI by defining a region associated with the term ‘inhibitory control’ in the meta-analytic database NeuroQuery, thresholded at Z=5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, top panel, blue region). To examine the specificity of our dlPFC results for the right vs. left hemisphere, in a supplemental analysis (see Appendix 3), we flipped our dlPFC-ROI over the left-right axis (creating a second, bilaterally matched ROI). Finally, to provide further evidence for the robustness of our main results, we used a third independent-identified left dlPFC-ROI functionally defined by the contrast of healthy vs. unhealthy choice in a seminal fMRI study of dieters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hare et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All human subjects provided informed consent, including the consent to publish.

This raises a question about the appropriate way to model this signal in the hemodynamic response, which evolves more slowly over 5–10 s. To determine the appropriate regressor for GLMs 1a, b, and c, we simulated 5000 instantiations of the DDM for every subject and trial in Dataset 2, using a time step of 5 ms. For each subject, we then averaged the 5000 simulations at each time point to produce a single time course of total activity for a given set of trials. We convolved this simulated time course with the canonical form of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to construct an expected BOLD time series given the inputs. We refer to this as the <italic>ideal BOLD</italic>. We then compared the shape of the ideal BOLD to two different possible instantiations within a traditional GLM analysis in SPM. Version 1 consisted of a parametric modulator of a stick function placed at the onset of the trial, consisting of the total activity in the DDM for each trial, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> . Version 2 consisted of a parametric modulator identical to Version 1, but modulating a boxcar function placed at the onset of the trial with a duration equal to RT for that trial. Each of these regressors was convolved with the canonical form of the HRF and correlated with the ideal time series to determine the one providing the closest match.</p><p>Results suggested that version 2 provided a closer match (Pearson’s r ranging from 0.90 to 0.99, average = 0.95) compared to version 1 (Pearson’s r ranging from 0.64 to 0.93, average = 0.82). Importantly, a parametric regressor consisting simply of the observed RT on each trial modulating a boxcar of duration equal to the RT also provided an excellent, and even slightly better, match (Pearson’s r ranging from 0.93 to 0.99, average = 0.97). We thus suspect that it might be difficult in practice to distinguish between computations related solely to the DDM from those related to RT. Note also that the inclusion of the unmodulated boxcar function with a duration equal to the RT on each trial controls for non-specific activation related to RTs that does not build over time in the manner expected based on the DDM, although this unmodulated regressor is itself highly correlated with the predicted BOLD signal from the DDM (average r=0.96). Despite this high correlation, simulations suggested that both the mean-centered DDM parametric modulator and the mean-centered RT parametric modulator continue to show a significant association with the DDM-related BOLD signal even after including the unmodulated boxcar regressor in the model (both p&lt;0.0001). Thus, we think that these two parametric modulators provide good markers of candidate regions for the evidence accumulation function.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simulating the dilemma of self-control using the attribute-based neural drift diffusion model (anDDM).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) An evidence accumulation model (anDDM) can be used to simulate decision making for any self-control context requiring an integration of normative and hedonistic considerations (dietary choices displayed, integrating relative tastiness, and healthiness). (<bold>b</bold>) On average across multiple different goals, the likelihood of a healthy choice depends on the relative attribute values of one option vs. another, and is less likely when tastiness and healthiness conflict. Warmer colors indicate a higher likelihood of choosing the healthier option. (<bold>c</bold>) As with the DDM, specific goals prioritizing tastiness or prioritizing healthiness alter the frequency of healthy choice, although it still depends on the relative values of both tastiness and healthiness. Four example, decision makers with different weights on healthiness and tastiness are displayed for comparison. (<bold>d</bold>) The overall likelihood of a healthy choice (averaged separately for all combinations of conflict or no-conflict choices) depends on weights. Goals prioritizing tastiness (darker bars) produce fewer healthy choices than goals prioritizing healthiness (lighter bars), but only when tastiness and healthiness conflict. (<bold>e</bold>) The computational model can also simulate expected neural activity (i.e., aggregate activity in the two neuronal pools, summed over decision time: ) when choosing healthy [H] or unhealthy [UH] options, as a function of relative option values and different goals. Bars display the overall difference in neural activity for H compared to UH choices for goals prioritizing tastiness (darker bars) and healthiness (lighter bars), divided as a function of attribute conflict. In no-conflict trials, healthy choices elicit less activity regardless of the goal (i.e., Activity H Activity UH), but only when goals prioritize tastiness.

However, other work( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hare et al., 2011b</xref>) by Hare and colleagues has proposed that accumulator activity is best described by a variant of this model, which we hereafter refer to as an anDDM. The anDDM reported on by Hare and colleagues has the advantage of being more neurobiologically plausible. However, because initial efforts to fit choices using this alternative specification of the choice process indicated relatively poorer convergence of key computational parameters (as measured by the Gelman-Rubin statistic, i.e., R-hat &gt; 1.1 for several parameters), as well as issues in properly identifying the values of some of the parameters in this model, we opted in favor of describing results in terms of the simpler DDM in the main text. However, here, we show that results are similar for all key analyses if this more neurally plausible model is used instead.</p><p>Similar to the DDM, the anDDM assumes that the brain makes decisions through a process of value-based attribute integration and competition. However, in contrast to the DDM, which uses a single, one-dimensional evidence accumulation process, in the anDDM choices are resolved via evidence accumulation in two spatially intermingled populations of neurons representing the options under consideration (here denoted as Option 1 and Option 2), with instantaneous firing rates (FR) at time t of FR<sub>1</sub>(t) and FR<sub>2</sub>(t). At the beginning of the choice period FR<sub>1</sub>(0)=FR<sub>2</sub>(0)=0. In the version of this model reported on here, firing rates in each population evolve dynamically from the onset of choice based on the sum total of excitatory inputs (detailed below). A choice results at time t<italic>’</italic>, the first moment at which the firing rate of one of the two populations exceeds a predetermined threshold or barrier B. The total RT is t<italic>’</italic> plus a constant non-decision time (ndt) that accounts for perceptual and motor delays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>Firing rates in the two pools evolve noisily over time according to the following two equations:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mtable rowspacing="4pt" columnspacing="1em"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo movablelimits="true" form="prefix">max</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo movablelimits="true" form="prefix">max</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where the noise terms <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are normally distributed ~ N(0,.1), and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> represent external inputs proportional to the overall values of Options 1 and 2, determined by the weighted sum of their choice-relevant attribute values:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mtable rowspacing="4pt" columnspacing="1em"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, each pool’s activity receives an external input proportional to its value relative to the other option. We also tested several variants of this basic neural model, including lateral inhibition between the two neuronal pools, recurrent excitation/inhibition of each pool onto itself, and raw rather than relative values (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> rather than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> − <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) as inputs to each neuronal pool. However, model-fitting exercises generally indicated that the simpler model, with no lateral inhibition or recurrent excitation, provided the most parsimonious fit to the data, and that the values of parameters related to lateral inhibition and recurrent excitation showed poor identifiability. We thus proceeded with simulations of neural activity using the simple model with two independently evolving accumulators.</p><p>In our simulations, we assumed that value inputs to the accumulators depend on two independent attributes: one related to hedonism (e.g., tastiness of a food) and one related to norms and standards (e.g., healthiness), although in principle, any number and type of attribute could occur. Using these equations allowed us to simulate the dynamically evolving activation across the two neuronal populations, and to derive distributions of both response times (RTs) and neural response. As with the DDM, we label the final output (i.e., choice) of the system as ‘normative’ if it results in selecting the option with the higher unweighted value for the normative attribute (e.g., the option with higher healthiness).</p><p>To establish comparability between the predictions of the DDM and the anDDM, we focus here on two results described in the main text using the DDM: behavioral predictions and the neural prediction that activity in the dlPFC is associated with predicted response. To establish that the anDDM made similar behavioral predictions, we engaged in a similar set of simulation exercises as in the main text, but substituting the anDDM model described above for the DDM. As expected, we observed nearly identical predictions of the anDDM regarding the relationship between choices, RTs, neural response, and the weights on hedonistic vs. virtuous attributes. To illustrate this comparability, we recreated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of the main manuscript (which shows predictions of the DDM) using the anDDM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b-e</xref>).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the close correspondence of predictions, we found similar results both behaviorally and neurally when using the anDDM instead of the DDM to examine responses. When fitting the anDDM to choices, we found that weights on attributes correlated highly with weights identified using the DDM (r values ranging from 0.98 to 0.99). Furthermore, we found highly similar regions of the dlPFC in Datasets 1, 2, and 3 when using the anDDM’s predicted activity instead of the DDM in GLMs that were otherwise identical to GLMs 1a–c reported in the main text (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Thus, our conclusions are robust to alternative model specifications, and likely represent a general principle of decision making via evidence accumulation.</p><fig id="app2fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>BOLD responses in a left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) region associated with self-control in dieters.</title><p>Top (dlPFC): Trial-by-trial BOLD response in the dlPFC correlates significantly with predicted activity of the drift diffusion model (DDM) across three separate datasets.

This ROI has the advantage of being based on activation across hundreds of studies and thousands of participants covering a variety of domains, as well as being linguistically associated with one of the key terms of interest from self-control (i.e., inhibitory control). However, alternative specifications of the dlPFC are possible. Here, we report the results of a second, alternative ROI, based on the results of a comparison of healthy vs. unhealthy food choices (thresholded at a voxel-level p=0.001, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, green ROI) in a seminal study examining self-control success vs. failure (i.e., healthy vs. unhealthy choice) in dieters (N=37<sup>1</sup>).

We also ran supplemental whole-brain analyses to identify other brain areas whose activity correlated with the DDM across all three datasets. In addition to the dlPFC, we identified two other regions in this data-driven analysis approach: the dACC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>) and right IFG/aIns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">Appendix 4—figure 2</xref>) whose activity correlated with the DDM across all three datasets (p&lt;0.001, FWE cluster corrected at p&lt;0.05 within each of the three datasets). Here, we report analogous results on measures of BOLD response in these regions during normative vs. hedonistic choice, for the sake of completeness. Note that, these key tests of our theory are technically independent of the ROI definition (i.e., ROIs are defined by parametric correlation with evidence accumulation across multiple contexts and studies, not the contrast between normative and hedonistic choices). However, we acknowledge that there is conceptual overlap, and thus some concern about analytical circularity. We thus present these results for illustrative purposes only to supplement and extend the findings we observe in our fully independent dlPFC ROI.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One concern is about potential circularity in the analyses of the dlPFC activity. Given that the ROI is identified via a model-based fMRI analysis with the anDDM predicted activity, isn't the current strategy of testing choice-related activity in this region (GLM2 analyses like Figure 4 d-f) a case of circular-analysis /double dipping (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009)? Wouldn't this bias the subsequent tests in this region of whether activity is higher for normative (generous, healthy) versus non-normative (selfish, tasty) choices towards the predictions of the anDDM? In this case, a stronger and more convincing test might be to show that these results hold in a region defined a priori based on previous studies arguing that dlPFC modulates attribute weights (e.g., Hare's work).</p><p>2) A second concern is how well the model is recoverable. It would be helpful for the authors to demonstrate parameter recovery, or point the reader to where those results can be found, if they were shown in prior work. (Regarding modeling quality control, the authors may want to consult the guidelines of Wilson and Collins, 2019).</p><p>(a) On a specific note, there is skepticism about the need for both input inhibition (v1-v2) as well as inhibition between the accumulators (zeta). How well is this zeta parameter recovered, particularly under minor to major misspecification of the drift rate function v? For instance, if v is in reality non-linear, or has an intercept (see above), might the currently mis-specified drift rate function result in what looks like a non-zero zeta?</p><p>(b) There is also a specific question of why the authors constrain zeta and γ in the model fits. By doing so they essentially guarantee concluding that there is self-excitation and mutual inhibition. Constraining parameter values shouldn't be necessary (though constraining the starting values of the search makes sense). All it does, potentially, is to turn a zero mean, high variance distribution into one with less variance but a biased mean.</p><p>3) A third question concerns the uniqueness of the neural predictions of the anDDM model. This should be clarified in the revision, specifically with regard to:</p><p>(a) Do the predictions of the anDDM differ from those based on a simpler notion of preference strength (e.g. Utility chosen option – utility unchosen option)? What about a conceptualization based in terms of default option/framing (Lopez-Persem et al., 2016)? Or would a model that focuses on conflict/choice difficulty/inverse confidence (Shenhav et al., 2014) make similar predictions? The authors may want to consider a more comprehensive model-comparison/model falsification approach (Palminteri et al., 2017) to validate their computational proposition at both the behavioral and neural activity levels.</p><p>(b) Do the predictions depend on specific modeling choices in the anDDM? For example, does a simpler attribute-weighted drift diffusion model (without the self-excitation and mutual inhibition components of the neural model) make similar predictions or not? Do the predictions depend on the specific linking function between model output and neural activity, since alternative formulations could be envisioned here (e.g. sum of the difference -rather than sum- of activity between the 2 neuron pools over time)?</p><p>(c) What about a simple account based on reaction time? What would happen, e.g. if RT is added as a parametric regressor (to the boxcar) and competed with the anDDM predictions?</p><p>(4) A fourth concern is about the strength of the neural evidence. The evidence on balance favors evidence accumulation, but perhaps not as strongly as one might hope. Where the evidence accumulation and attribute weighting/inhibition hypotheses make different predictions are in the conditions where regulatory focus is on normative goals – attribute weighting would predict greater activity for normative choices while evidence accumulation would predict greater activity for non-normative choices. Only one of the three tests here (health focus in food choice) provides straightforward support in one direction (favoring the evidence accumulation account). The other two tests (ethics and partner focus in altruistic choice) show no difference in activity, which isn't supportive of the attribute weighting account, but seems only weak evidence in favor of the evidence accumulation account. The test of whether regulatory instructions increase or decrease activity in dlPFC is similarly ambiguous, hardly supportive of the attribute weighting account, but only weakly supportive of the predictions of the evidence accumulation account. Furthermore, about half of the ROI critical tests (in Figure 4 e-f) are quite borderline (non-)significant (between P = 0.02 and 0.07). Overall, the strength of the neuroimaging evidence in favor of the proposed theory seems moderate at best.</p><p>(a) One response would be the authors to simply acknowledge these issues and temper their claims accordingly.</p><p>(b) Alternatively, multiple reviewers wondered if the authors could exploit individual differences to gather further support for their claims. For instance, for Study 3, in the Natural condition, could the authors only analyze subjects who overwhelmingly preferred tasty foods? Or, if the sample is large enough, the authors could look for brain-behavior correlations? Do subjects who show a larger behavioral weight asymmetry also show a larger DLPFC asymmetry?</p><p>5) Finally, the authors should address two specific critiques that might be raised regarding their manipulations in Studies 2 and 3. Several possibilities for how to address these were suggested, but beyond these specific suggestions, the essential thing is that authors somehow consider these critiques in the manuscript and rebut them.</p><p>(a) One potential critique of Study 2 is that subjects in the instructed conditions (focus on ethics, focus on partner) might take the instructions too literally and essentially be solving math problems rather than truly valuing the outcomes. This would make it less of a value-based decision-making task and more of a perceptual one. Presumably this would disengage the DLPFC, and the other regions. Could the authors comment on whether the standard &quot;reward&quot; regions, e.g. VMPFC, striatum, were active during these conditions? Is there similar evidence that the DLPFC, dorsal ACC, and insula reflect accumulated evidence in perceptual decisions? Are the absolute levels of activity (shown in Figure 4e) meaningful, in terms of saying whether the DLPFC was still engaged in these conditions? Another thing that would make the results from this study more compelling would be if the authors found a significant difference-in-differences between &quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;Partner&quot; conditions in DLPFC or other areas. This would help to alleviate concerns that brain activity is just noisier in the &quot;Ethics&quot; and &quot;Partner&quot; conditions.</p><p>(b) A potential critique of Study 3 is that the DLPFC is simply responding to disobeying the experimenters' instructions. Is there any way that the authors can rule this out? Could the authors use a more continuous analysis to show that decisions with a subjective value difference of zero show the most activity in DLPFC, while those with large subjective value differences, in either direction, show less activity? One particular reason for this concern is the lack of correspondence between the behavioral and fMRI data. The naDDM reveals nearly identical behavioral weights in the Natural and Taste conditions, and yet the DLPFC are very different.

They looked into parameter recovery and ultimately decided to go with a simpler model that yields similar conclusions. They also added a couple of datasets to Study 3 to help bolster those results.</p><p>My overall impression of the paper is fairly positive, though some of my previous reservations remain. To really convincingly make their point, the authors would have ideally shown a dataset where DLPFC activity is significantly higher for the hedonistic choice – an actual reversal of the phenomenon, rather than just elimination of it. This weakness is somewhat mitigated by the individual difference results, though I think that should be expanded on in the paper, since right now they only report it for Dataset 1, and they don't fully report the statistics for Datasets 2 &amp; 3 in their replies.</p><p>I also thought that the very last section of the Results section was weak and could, maybe should, be removed. I think the authors have already demonstrated by this point in the paper that the activity in DLPFC is not simply responding to the condition. It's strange to report these main effects but then immediately dismiss them as likely being due to evidence accumulation. For that matter, the lack of effect in Dataset 2 could also be spuriously due to evidence accumulation canceling out an actual main effect. This last section is just messy and I don't see why it's helpful.</p><p>I thought that the reference list could be improved, given the focus of the paper. There are multiple mentions of value DDM and fMRI investigations of this, and yet there were no references to the value DDM work by Milosavljevic and Krajbich (2010) or the older work by Busemeyer and colleagues.

The dependent variable is %healthy choice, so you would think the axes would be the difference in tastiness and healthiness between the healthy and unhealthy options. However, both of those differences go from -3 to +3, indicating that that's not the case – the healthy option can't be less healthy than the unhealthy option. It seems to me that there should only be the top half of each of these figures. It's also unclear why these figures are mostly red, indicating a preference for healthy options, even when the weight on taste is higher. Is this due to the intercept in the model? If so, that would be useful to clarify. Finally, is panel d upside down? The y-axis says H-UH choice, and that should be most positive for the highest percentage of healthy choices, which should be for the light gray bar, not the black one, right?</p><p>Figure 4 – panels d and g need labels on the x-axis.</p><p>Appendix Figure 5 – to my eye this looks more like insula than IFG, but perhaps I'm mistaken.</p><p>Finally, I think it is important to include the Q-P plots in the supplements at least, just to make it clear that the model fits could be improved. I don't think this is critical to the paper, which doesn't really rely on the specific model, but the misfits are noticeable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65661.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One concern is about potential circularity in the analyses of the dlPFC activity. Given that the ROI is identified via a model-based fMRI analysis with the anDDM predicted activity, isn't the current strategy of testing choice-related activity in this region (GLM2 analyses like Figure 4 d-f) a case of circular-analysis /double dipping (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009)? Wouldn't this bias the subsequent tests in this region of whether activity is higher for normative (generous, healthy) versus non-normative (selfish, tasty) choices towards the predictions of the anDDM? In this case, a stronger and more convincing test might be to show that these results hold in a region defined a priori based on previous studies arguing that dlPFC modulates attribute weights (e.g., Hare's work).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to demonstrate that the predicted pattern holds in independently defined ROIs that have been previously argued to be associated with self-control. Thus, we have replaced the original, circular analyses with a new set of analyses. In the main paper, we focus on an independent, functionally defined ROI in the left dlPFC based on a meta-analysis of the term ‘inhibitory control’ using the meta-analytic database NeuroQuery<sup>1</sup> which has the advantage of using an ROI defined by hundreds of studies examining a particular term. Following suggestions of the reviewers and editorial team, we also report the same set of analyses in the supplemental materials in an ROI based on Hare’s seminal work. Specifically, we show results for a cluster in the left dlPFC region associated with healthy vs. unhealthy choices in dieters<sup>2</sup>. From each of these ROIs, we extracted the contrast of generous vs. selfish choice in Dataset 1 and 2, and the contrast of healthy vs. unhealthy choice during conflicted and unconflicted choices in Dataset 3.</p><p>The results confirmed the predictions of an evidence accumulation account, albeit with a small amount of heterogeneity across studies and ROIs. To give the reviewers a sense of this heterogeneity, we here give a high-level summary of results from each of these analyses. In Dataset 1 (Natural focus condition only), we found a significant increase in response in the dlPFC for generous vs. selfish choices in both ROIs (both <italic>P</italic> &lt;.05). In Dataset 2 (Natural and Regulatory focus conditions), we found both a significant increase during generous vs. selfish choices in the Natural focus condition in both ROIs (both <italic>P</italic> &lt;.04), as well as the predicted difference among conditions in ethics and other-focused conditions in both ROIs (both <italic>P</italic> &lt;.004). In Dataset 3 (Natural and Regulatory focus conditions), we have now added in data from two additional dietary self-regulation studies for increased power (see below for further details). Here, we also found a significant increase in BOLD response during Natural trials in both ROIs (both P &lt;.02). We also found a significant effect of condition on this difference in the NeuroQuery ROI (P = .02), as well as a marginal effect in the Hare ROI (P = .099). In both ROIs, this was driven by a significantly smaller difference between healthy and unhealthy choices in the Health Focus condition compared to the Natural Focus condition (P = .02 in the NeuroQuery ROI, P = .05 in the Hare ROI).</p><p>For full disclosure, we also note here that in our previous Study 3 (which is now part of Dataset 3), as we were performing these analyses, we found a small error in the coding of contrast images. Correction of this error changed some of the statistics and effects in our original Study 3 sample slightly, although it did not change the main conclusion. We have now double- and triple-checked all analyses to ensure that there are no further errors. To assure ourselves that our results were robust, we also sought to gain additional power by adding in data from two additional previously collected datasets on dietary self-regulation that had a nearly identical paradigm. Adding in these studies has strengthened some of the results, and reassured us that results are largely similar across samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second concern is how well the model is recoverable. It would be helpful for the authors to demonstrate parameter recovery, or point the reader to where those results can be found, if they were shown in prior work. (Regarding modeling quality control, the authors may want to consult the guidelines of Wilson and Collins, 2019).</p><p>(a) On a specific note, there is skepticism about the need for both input inhibition (v1-v2) as well as inhibition between the accumulators (zeta). How well is this zeta parameter recovered, particularly under minor to major misspecification of the drift rate function v? For instance, if v is in reality non-linear, or has an intercept (see above), might the currently mis-specified drift rate function result in what looks like a non-zero zeta?</p><p>(b) There is also a specific question of why the authors constrain zeta and γ in the model fits. By doing so they essentially guarantee concluding that there is self-excitation and mutual inhibition. Constraining parameter values shouldn't be necessary (though constraining the starting values of the search makes sense). All it does, potentially, is to turn a zero mean, high variance distribution into one with less variance but a biased mean.</p><p>3) A third question concerns the uniqueness of the neural predictions of the anDDM model. This should be clarified in the revision, specifically with regard to:</p><p>(a) Do the predictions of the anDDM differ from those based on a simpler notion of preference strength (e.g. Utility chosen option – utility unchosen option)? What about a conceptualization based in terms of default option/framing (Lopez-Persem et al., 2016)? Or would a model that focuses on conflict/choice difficulty/inverse confidence (Shenhav et al., 2014) make similar predictions? The authors may want to consider a more comprehensive model-comparison/model falsification approach (Palminteri et al., 2017) to validate their computational proposition at both the behavioral and neural activity levels.</p><p>(b) Do the predictions depend on specific modeling choices in the anDDM? For example, does a simpler attribute-weighted drift diffusion model (without the self-excitation and mutual inhibition components of the neural model) make similar predictions or not? Do the predictions depend on the specific linking function between model output and neural activity, since alternative formulations could be envisioned here (e.g. sum of the difference -rather than sum- of activity between the 2 neuron pools over time)?</p></disp-quote><p>We address this set of points together because in addressing Point 2 (regarding model quality control), we also addressed a number of the issues raised in Point 3 (i.e., do predictions differ in a simpler attribute-weighted DDM?).</p><p>First, because we had based our original anDDM on a model from a previously-published paper (Hare et al., 2011), we did not originally do the kind of model verification analyses that the reviewers very rightly pointed out are important to do. We have now conducted a number of analyses to assess the extent to which specific model parameters are identifiable/recoverable, as well as the extent to which our predictions depend on the specific choice of model (e.g. neural network DDM vs. a more canonical DDM, see point 3b). In doing so, we found that, while parameters related to more traditional measures common to both a DDM and a neural DDM (i.e., attribute weighting, threshold, non-decision time) showed excellent identifiability, the parameters related to lateral inhibition and auto-excitation did not. Below, we summarize these results, before discussing our approach to this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Parameter identifiability</p><p>To address model recovery questions, we performed model recovery exercises on a superset anDDM model that includes several changes suggested by the reviewers, including adding a constant (intercept) term to the drift rate, allowing for three distinct attributes to influence value (as this is the maximum used for Datasets 1 and 2, while Dataset 3 has only two distinct attributes) and allowing recurrent inputs to take on both positive and negative values. Thus, we estimated 8 separate parameters.</p><p>Note that we did not allow mutual excitation (as suggested by the reviewers) as we found that doing so made the model estimates extremely unstable, and, as elaborated below, we think this does not make sense theoretically or conceptually. We then simulated 150 datasets with random values of parameters, and then computed the correlation between the estimated parameters and the true values. This in general showed high correlations with the fitted parameters of interest, which relate to weights on attributes. Recovery of each of three distinct attributes was excellent, with Pearson’s correlation coefficients ranging from r = .87 to r = .96. We also observed reasonably decent recovery of the drift constant, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of r = .62. Recovery of threshold value (r = .75) and non-decision times (r = .76) were also acceptable. However, we did not observe clean recovery of the recurrence and inhibition parameters (r = .14 and r = -.1129) respectively. This suggests that these parameters may not actually have been necessary for model fits. We thus turned to model comparison exercises to more formally assess this possibility.</p><p>Model comparison</p><p>We undertook a thorough set of analyses, based on suggested alternatives by reviewers, to determine which model provided the best fit to the data. Because of the time-consuming nature of model-fitting, and because of some issues identified in this process as well as the exercises described above on parameter recovery, we performed these exercises only in Dataset 3a (food choice with regulation) rather than in all datasets. We acknowledge that this is not a full test of the model in all datasets, and of course would be happy to finish these estimations and report them in greater detail in the supplements if the editor or reviewers think this would strengthen the work.</p><p>For selecting the best anDDM, we estimated models both with and without auto excitation, with and without lateral inhibition, and with either relative values as inputs to the two neuronal pools, or raw values as inputs. We also estimated a canonical DDM. All models fit a constant intercept in the drift, specifying a default preference towards or away from accepting the proposal.</p><p>On point 2b regarding constraints on parameters: while we agree with the reviewers that a constraint on the auto-excitation parameter should not be necessary, we believe there are good conceptual reasons not to allow the lateral inhibition parameter to take on values that entail excitation rather than inhibition. In particular, the distinction between a pool that favors one response and a pool that favors a competing response is lost if the two pools mutually excite each other, and we know of no extant models in the literature that have ever suggested mutual excitation of neuronal populations for competing responses. Thus, in the models reported below, we opted to retain constraints on this parameter when performing model-fitting exercises.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> summarizes the average AIC/BIC value across participants for each model.

Models with raw inputs into the accumulators consistently performed worse than their relative value counterparts. Thus, for purposes of the paper, we now report results of Model 4 of the anDDM (no lateral inhibition, no recurrence) in the supplemental material.</p><p>However, examining model convergence using the Gelman-Rubin r-hat statistic suggested that although Model 4 generally had the lowest AIC/BIC, it also occasionally failed to converge on a stable set of parameters for a fraction of subjects (on average ~6% across the conditions), as evidenced by R-hat values &gt; 1.1, the conventional threshold for assessing good model convergence. The standard DDM showed no such issues, with all parameters for all subjects showing excellent convergence (all R-hat values &lt; 1.003). Moreover, in general, the canonical DDM had AIC/BIC values similar to, though generally slightly higher than, the best-fitting neural DDM. The DDM was the 2<sup>nd</sup>-best fit according to both AIC and BIC in two conditions, and third-best fit in the third.</p><p>Given these issues with model convergence and parameter recovery, and the fact that the canonical DDM ran a close second in terms of model BIC values, we turned to this version and asked whether it would account for the same findings as the anDDM, as suggested by the reviewers and editor (point 3b). In brief, we found that a simple DDM reproduces all of the key predictions made by the anDDM regarding activity during normative vs. hedonistic choice, and identifies similar neural areas in all three studies (see our main paper for these results). Importantly, we also found that the attribute weighting parameters of the DDM correlated quite highly with the attribute weighting parameters of the best-fitting anDDM (Model 4, all r &gt;.97), giving us confidence that inferences about how these weights change with attention, and how these weights correlate with neural and behavioral responses, are robust to alternative model specifications.</p><p>We thus have opted to revise our paper to focus on the DDM as a canonical evidence accumulation model. This has the advantage of making the paper more accessible to a readership who might be more familiar with the DDM, and requiring less description to introduce details of the model. We believe this move significantly streamlines the paper, while leaving our core message intact. However, we also included the winning anDDM results as a supplemental analysis to show that results are not specific to any precise instantiation of an evidence accumulation account. To further emphasize this, we revised wording of the introduction and discussion of the paper to make clearer that we think it is a general principle of evidence accumulation models, rather than any specific model, which produces the relationship we observe here between asymmetry in weighting of hedonic and normative attributes and differences in response on hedonistic vs. normative choices. We thus thank the reviewers for making these suggestions and encouraging us to take a more careful look at our modeling approach, as it has resulted in a much cleaner and clearer exposition of our logic and theory.</p><p>Alternative model specifications for the neural data</p><p>Regarding the questions raised in part 3a (alternative specifications to an evidence accumulation model, defined either as the DDM or anDDM), we have undertaken several additional analyses to address the reviewer’s suggestions. We performed these analyses only in Dataset 2 (altruistic choice with regulation), since our initial analysis even in this single dataset suggested that none of these alternative suggestions capture activation in the left dlPFC at even extremely low thresholds (P &lt;.01, uncorrected). We elaborate on this conclusion below.</p><p>First, as suggested, we asked whether the utility of the chosen option – utility of the unchosen option provided a similar and/or better account of neural activity in the dlPFC or other regions. To do this we computed the utility of each option based on its integrated weighted attribute value (using estimated weights from the DDM). We then computed the chosen – unchosen value as a parametric regressor and estimated neural response correlated with this regressor. However, we failed to find any evidence that this regressor explained activation in the left dlPFC, even at a fairly liberal P &lt;.01, uncorrected. We did observe some hints that Unchosen – Chosen activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex at liberal thresholds (P &lt;.01, uncorrected), as has sometimes been reported in the literature, but this regressor was not as powerful a predictor as the DDM, which predicted activation in the dmPFC at whole-brain cluster corrected levels.</p><p>Second, we asked whether activity in these regions correlated with confidence (coded as the absolute value of the behavioral preference coded from strong yes to strong no, i.e. both strong yes and strong no indicated high confidence, weak yes and weak no indicated low confidence). Although we did observe a correlation with confidence in the occipital cortex and areas of motor cortex, this analysis also failed to identify any activation in the dlPFC or other key areas of interest even at P &lt;.01, uncorrected.</p><p>Unfortunately, our experimental designs were not set up to directly address the question of whether a default option/framing explanation might account for the data. In our studies, the same default option was presented across all trials in all studies. Thus, we cannot fit neural activity that varies as a function of the value of the default option, as was done in Persem-Lopez (2016). However, we think it is unlikely that our results in the dlPFC are explained by a default bias. First, it is unclear why a default bias would be stronger on trials predicted by the DDM to require more vs. less evidence accumulation, so it is unclear how such an account would predict variation in the dlPFC of the sort that we see. Second, in Persem-Lopez et al. (2016), the areas sensitive to the default value lay outside the dlPFC area that we here associate with predictions of the DDM. Thus, we think that an evidence accumulation account is currently the best explanation of the results we see in the dlPFC. To reduce the working memory burden on the reader, we have opted not to include these additional analyses in the current version of the paper, which already has a larger number of results. However, we would be happy to add these results if the editor or reviewers feel it would substantially improve the paper. We also note an advantage of <italic>eLife</italic> over other journals, which is that the response to reviews is accessible to the public, so readers can if they desire find this information here in our response letter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) What about a simple account based on reaction time? What would happen, e.g. if RT is added as a parametric regressor (to the boxcar) and competed with the anDDM predictions?</p></disp-quote><p>A model in which RT is included as a parametric modulator and allowed to compete with the DDM does indeed provide an excellent account of neural activity in several areas, including the left dlPFC area that we focus on in this paper, in part because the correlation between RT and predicted DDM activity is generally &gt;.95. Indeed, we observe a three-way conjunction of activation correlated with RT in the left dlPFC, which overlaps to a large extent with the area identified in Hare et al. (2009)<sup>2</sup> and our NeuroQuery ROI, when each individual study map is thresholded at P &lt;.005, uncorrected. Activity associated with the DDM in the dlPFC generally does not continue to be significant after controlling for RT. However, we point out that the DDM regressor that we use will necessarily be a rough estimate of expected neural activity, because it is the average over multiple simulated trials with multiple RTs ranging around but not necessarily identical to the RT on the trial. RT, in contrast, is a single number that captures the time it took for the evidence accumulation process to actually cross the threshold on <italic>that</italic> trial. Thus, RT might in some cases be more strongly correlated with the neural activity than a rough estimate of that activity based on the DDM. It thus should not be wholly surprising that it provides as good or better accounts of activity in these regions.</p><p>Moreover, our basic point (that the dlPFC area often associated with self-control might be more reflective of evidence accumulation-related mechanisms than of value modulation) stands regardless of whether the precise computational function of this region is strictly related to evidence accumulation or instead related to RT. Indeed, our simulations show that RT should show the same pattern as neural response (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and in fact might even better reflect the actual evidence accumulation process than averaged DDM response over multiple trials (see Supplemental Analyses, bottom of pg. 2 to top of pg. 3). Regardless, then, of the precise computation served by the dlPFC, we should observe the changes in normative vs. hedonistic response patterns that are predicted by our model. We include a brief discussion of this issue in the main paper on pg. 11, Lines 206-210: “Note, however, that finding a correlation within this region could occur because the dlPFC performs the precise computations carried out by the DDM, or could occur if the dlPFC performs separate computational functions that activate proportionally to evidence accumulation activity (e.g., response time). In either case, we would expect the trial-by-trial activity of the dlPFC to correlate with predictions of the DDM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A fourth concern is about the strength of the neural evidence. The evidence on balance favors evidence accumulation, but perhaps not as strongly as one might hope. Where the evidence accumulation and attribute weighting/inhibition hypotheses make different predictions are in the conditions where regulatory focus is on normative goals – attribute weighting would predict greater activity for normative choices while evidence accumulation would predict greater activity for non-normative choices. Only one of the three tests here (health focus in food choice) provides straightforward support in one direction (favoring the evidence accumulation account). The other two tests (ethics and partner focus in altruistic choice) show no difference in activity, which isn't supportive of the attribute weighting account, but seems only weak evidence in favor of the evidence accumulation account. The test of whether regulatory instructions increase or decrease activity in dlPFC is similarly ambiguous, hardly supportive of the attribute weighting account, but only weakly supportive of the predictions of the evidence accumulation account. Furthermore, about half of the ROI critical tests (in Figure 4 e-f) are quite borderline (non-)significant (between P = 0.02 and 0.07). Overall, the strength of the neuroimaging evidence in favor of the proposed theory seems moderate at best.</p><p>(a) One response would be the authors to simply acknowledge these issues and temper their claims accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken several approaches to address this point. First, to increase statistical power in Dataset 3 (where some of our previously-report P-values were more modest), we have added in results from two studies with nearly identical design to our own, first testing that results are not significantly different across studies, and then combining them to analyze aggregate responses. This has resulted in P-values for the critical tests in our ROI ranging from P = .004 to P = .02 in the revised version of the manuscript. Second, we now also focus on the difference-of-differences comparison (i.e., the <italic>change</italic> in the contrast of normative vs. hedonistic choices across conditions, as suggested in a comment below), which we view as the more critical test of our model (consistent with reviewer suggestions in point 5a). In particular, we show it is not always clear based on the actual weights on normative and hedonic parameters that participants achieved whether one would expect a full reversal of effects in normatively-focused conditions (i.e., a significantly greater response for hedonistic compared to normative choice). Instead, our much stronger prediction (and one that is born out in <italic>all</italic> datasets at conventional P-values in our region-of-interest) is that a normative focus should significantly <italic>decrease</italic> this difference, compared to typical or hedonically focused choice contexts. This is the critical test that distinguishes our model from models of self-control that argue that going against default preferences should make normative choices <italic>harder</italic> and thus should activate the dlPFC <italic>more</italic> (assuming it represents an effortful self-control mechanism). The test of difference-of-differences is also significant at conventional P-values in all three datasets. Thus, while we agree with the reviewer and editors that our statistical evidence varies in its strength from study to study, we believe that the consistency of effects across all three datasets nevertheless provides relatively strong evidence <italic>against</italic> previous models, and moderate to robust evidence <italic>for</italic> an evidence accumulation account.</p><p>Moreover, we further emphasize that none of our three paradigms was directly designed to address precisely the question we examine here, and thus each has some issues that, on their own, likely reduce the statistical significance of our effects and add noise to observed response. We hope, however, that replication of our effects over three different paradigms and two different choice contexts with a combined total of over 200 subjects helps to allay worries that any individual test of our hypothesis either does or does not meet an arbitrarily defined threshold for significance of P &lt;.05.</p><p>We also now seek to quantify more rigorously what the predictions of the DDM actually are, by running simulated activity for normative vs. hedonistic choices in each study for each individual, given the fitted parameters. These generally show that the predictions of our model correspond to observed activity. There are, however, a few cases where this is not true. One is the prediction that the Focus on Partner condition should evoke a full reversal of activation differences on generous vs. selfish choices in the dlPFC, and should be significantly different from the Ethics condition. We acknowledge that our results do not find this predicted effect, although it is somewhat difficult to know whether this might be due to noise, since the Focus on Partner condition evoked extremely high levels of generosity in some subjects, and thus reduced the number of selfish choice trials.</p><p>Nevertheless, we think it important to acknowledge these limitations, and appreciate the opportunity/suggestion from the reviewers and editors to take this approach. We now more directly address these issues on pg. 28-29 of the revised manuscript, writing, “The correspondence between predictions of the DDM and activation patterns in the dlPFC makes it tempting to conclude that this region performs this computational function. While this hypothesis is consistent with results from single-cell recordings, we also acknowledge that the dlPFC has been associated with many computational functions and roles, not all of which are mutually incompatible. Thus, it is possible that the dlPFC region observed here performs some sort of process that is correlated with, but not identical to, the neuronal computations of the DDM. Indeed, although we found that dlPFC responses mostly conformed to predictions of the DDM, we also found a few notable divergences. For example, during unconflicted trials, the DDM predicts that <italic>hedonistic</italic> choices should be strongly associated with greater activity than normative choices. While we observed a weak effect in this direction in Dataset 3 (the only dataset in which this prediction could be tested), it was not significant. Similarly, in Dataset 2, the DDM predicted that the comparison of generous vs. selfish choices should be lower when focused on one’s partner compared to when focusing on ethics, while the empirical data showed no difference. While some of these discrepancies could be due simply to the noisiness inherent to fMRI (especially in studies that were originally designed to address other questions), it is also possible that they serve as clues that the computational function of the dlPFC may be strongly correlated with, but importantly distinct from, the evidence accumulation process itself. Future work, including computational modifications or additions to the DDM, and recordings from other modalities like EEG or intracranial recording, may help to elucidate the precise computational functions served by this area and the ways in which it promotes adaptive choice and normative behavior.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Alternatively, multiple reviewers wondered if the authors could exploit individual differences to gather further support for their claims. For instance, for Study 3, in the Natural condition, could the authors only analyze subjects who overwhelmingly preferred tasty foods? Or, if the sample is large enough, the authors could look for brain-behavior correlations? Do subjects who show a larger behavioral weight asymmetry also show a larger DLPFC asymmetry?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion, as the DDM does predict that individual differences in the asymmetry between hedonic and normative attributes should correlate with the difference between hedonistic and normative choice. Indeed, we find some evidence for the predicted effects across individuals. In Dataset 1 (previously Study 1), the difference in dlPFC response on generous vs. selfish choices is correlated <italic>negatively</italic> with the asymmetry between weight on other vs. weight on self in the NeuroQuery ROI (<italic>r =</italic> -.31, <italic>P</italic> = .04). We observed similar results in Dataset 2 and 3. In Dataset 2 (previously Study 2), a mixed effects regression with BOLD response on generous vs. selfish trials in the NeuroQuery ROI as the dependent variable, the difference in weight on other vs. weight on self in each condition as a fixed effect, and participant as a random intercept revealed a significant negative association (<italic>P</italic> = .02), although this dropped to non-significance when the effect of condition as a main effect was also included. In Dataset 3, a mixed effects regression with BOLD response on healthy vs. unhealthy choices as the dependent variable, the difference in weights on health vs. weights on taste as a fixed effect, and participant as a random intercept likewise revealed a significant negative association (<italic>P</italic> = .01). Unlike in Dataset 2, there was no significant effect of condition after accounting for weights on taste and health. Thus, we think evidence from individual difference analyses across all three studies largely supports our theory. We do note that Dataset 2 showed the weakest evidence for our cases, since the effect of individual differences across participants and conditions was non-significant after accounting for condition. However, we also note that Dataset 2 was the only study in which we gave each participant different offers, designed to achieve roughly similar amounts of generosity across all participants. This would have the effect of weakening the effect of individual differences in this study. Due to these complexities, we have currently opted only to report individual difference results for Dataset 1 in the revised manuscript, which has the cleanest design and interpretation for studying the relationship between inherent preference weights and observed BOLD response (see pg. 15, lines 292-294). We can include similar analyses for Dataset 2 and 3, either in the main manuscript or in supplemental analyses, if the editor or reviewers believe it is important to do so, and thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Finally, the authors should address two specific critiques that might be raised regarding their manipulations in Studies 2 and 3. Several possibilities for how to address these were suggested, but beyond these specific suggestions, the essential thing is that authors somehow consider these critiques in the manuscript and rebut them.</p><p>(a) One potential critique of Study 2 is that subjects in the instructed conditions (focus on ethics, focus on partner) might take the instructions too literally and essentially be solving math problems rather than truly valuing the outcomes. This would make it less of a value-based decision-making task and more of a perceptual one. Presumably this would disengage the DLPFC, and the other regions. Could the authors comment on whether the standard &quot;reward&quot; regions, e.g. VMPFC, striatum, were active during these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We concur that it is important to know whether participants are simply solving math problems in Datasets 2 and 3, or instead are actually calculating values. We have several lines of evidence to support the idea that they are actually computing values rather than simply performing abstract cognitive operations. First, we have previously reported that we observe multivariate encoding of attribute values for <italic>all</italic> attributes in both tasks (i.e., $Self, $Other, and inequality in Dataset 2, Healthiness and Tastiness in Study 3a of Dataset 3) and the integrated decision value in an area of the vmPFC typically thought to encode values<sup>3</sup>. Second, we also observe a univariate correlation with overall decision value (i.e. Strong No to Strong Yes) in the vmPFC in all three conditions for Dataset 2 (P &lt;.05, uncorrected within each condition) and in Dataset 3 (P &lt;.05, uncorrected within each condition). Taken together, we think this indicates that participants are indeed computing values, as opposed to simply solving math problems.</p><p>We now include a footnote in the Discussion section that references our prior results in the discussion and addresses this critique on pg. 27: “An objection could be raised that the results in Datasets 2 and 3 do not arise from changes in evidence accumulation of value-related signals, but are due instead to demand effects that result in disengagement of typical valuation circuitry during choice, and thus disengagement of the dlPFC. Yet previous analyses on these datasets<sup>1,19</sup> suggest that the vmPFC and other value-related regions, including a value-coding region of the dlPFC, continue to encode both individual attribute values and integrated values in both regulated and unregulated conditions. This suggests that our results are not simply due to disengagement of value computations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there similar evidence that the DLPFC, dorsal ACC, and insula reflect accumulated evidence in perceptual decisions?</p></disp-quote><p>There is some evidence that the dlPFC in particular might be important for accumulating evidence in perceptual decisions. For example, regions of the dlPFC that are nearly identical to the region we observe here correlating with our value-based DDM predictions (as well as areas of ACC and insula/inferior frontal gyrus) are also more active on hard compared to easy trials in perceptual decision-making tasks, consistent with an evidence accumulation account<sup>4-6</sup>, although we were not able to find any studies that specifically model the trial-by-trial predicted activity of a DDM to identify the dlPFC in a perceptual task. We have included these additional references in the introduction of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the absolute levels of activity (shown in Figure 4e) meaningful, in terms of saying whether the DLPFC was still engaged in these conditions? Another thing that would make the results from this study more compelling would be if the authors found a significant difference-in-differences between &quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;Partner&quot; conditions in DLPFC or other areas. This would help to alleviate concerns that brain activity is just noisier in the &quot;Ethics&quot; and &quot;Partner&quot; conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the difference in activity between normative vs. hedonistic choice may be more informative than the absolute levels. We thus have revised Figure 4 to show the differences between normative and hedonistic choices, and to highlight the “difference of differences” effects that are most important for our theory. We have also highlighted these differences in the main text. As can be seen from both the main text and the figure, it is these difference-in-differences which is significantly different across conditions, more so than the differences in absolute overall values. Thus, we confirm that there is a significant difference-in-differences between Natural and Partner (and Natural and Ethics) in the altruistic choice task, and a significant difference-in-differences between Natural and Health Focus conditions in the dietary decision-making task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) A potential critique of Study 3 is that the DLPFC is simply responding to disobeying the experimenters' instructions. Is there any way that the authors can rule this out? Could the authors use a more continuous analysis to show that decisions with a subjective value difference of zero show the most activity in DLPFC, while those with large subjective value differences, in either direction, show less activity? One particular reason for this concern is the lack of correspondence between the behavioral and fMRI data. The naDDM reveals nearly identical behavioral weights in the Natural and Taste conditions, and yet the DLPFC are very different. How can we make sense of this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are some puzzling divergences between the observed dlPFC response and the expected predictions of the DDM (and anDDM), although the stark difference between the natural and taste conditions has now disappeared after adding in additional data and correcting a small error in the coding of contrast images. We also think it unlikely that the dlPFC is simply responding to disobeying the experimenter’s instructions, since this would not predict different patterns of results for conflicted vs. unconflicted trials (a pattern we observe in the data).</p><p>We also note that the analysis requested by the reviewer (showing that decisions with a subjective value difference of zero show the most activity in the dlPFC) is essentially what we already show in our parametric analysis, showing the dlPFC correlates parametrically with predictions of the DDM, which has higher predicted activity for less extreme values regardless of sign, and lower predicted activity for more extreme values.</p><p>However, to more thoroughly address this concern, we also sought other ways to understand the predictions of the model, which we now report in the paper. In particular, we now explicitly use the model to make predictions about how activation in different regulatory conditions should compare, taking into account differences not only in attribute weights, but also overall drift and threshold differences. We show that in some cases counterintuitive predictions results (i.e., the difference between healthy and unhealthy choices in the taste condition is actually predicted by simulation to be somewhat <italic>lower</italic> than in the natural condition, which is also what is observed in our data after combining several datasets).</p><p>References</p><p>1.

They looked into parameter recovery and ultimately decided to go with a simpler model that yields similar conclusions. They also added a couple of datasets to Study 3 to help bolster those results.</p><p>My overall impression of the paper is fairly positive, though some of my previous reservations remain. To really convincingly make their point, the authors would have ideally shown a dataset where DLPFC activity is significantly higher for the hedonistic choice – an actual reversal of the phenomenon, rather than just elimination of it. This weakness is somewhat mitigated by the individual difference results, though I think that should be expanded on in the paper, since right now they only report it for Dataset 1, and they don't fully report the statistics for Datasets 2 &amp; 3 in their replies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of the changes that we have made, and their continued suggestions for improvement. We fully agree that it would have been more compelling to show a complete and significant reversal of effects, as we point out in the discussion in lines 603-618. We hope that our discussion of why we might observe divergences from some model predictions will spur further research on this topic.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that including a little more detail on the individual difference analyses for Studies 2 and 3 is potentially useful, although, as we pointed out in our response to the previous round of reviews (and elaborate further on in the new supplementary Results section), we do think there are some important caveats to being able to fully interpret these results. Thus, we have opted to present these results in a supplementary analysis in Appendix 5, focusing primarily on individual differences in Natural trials (as suggested by Reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also thought that the very last section of the Results section was weak and could, maybe should, be removed. I think the authors have already demonstrated by this point in the paper that the activity in DLPFC is not simply responding to the condition. It's strange to report these main effects but then immediately dismiss them as likely being due to evidence accumulation. For that matter, the lack of effect in Dataset 2 could also be spuriously due to evidence accumulation canceling out an actual main effect. This last section is just messy and I don't see why it's helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this issue. We have now removed this section from the paper and references to it in the discussion. We believe that these revisions have increased clarity and streamlined the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I thought that the reference list could be improved, given the focus of the paper. There are multiple mentions of value DDM and fMRI investigations of this, and yet there were no references to the value DDM work by Milosavljevic and Krajbich (2010) or the older work by Busemeyer and colleagues. There were also no references to the fMRI studies on value DDM by Gluth et al. (2012), Rodriguez et al. (2015), Pisauro et al. (2017), etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should have included these references in the paper, since they are important and help to inform both the model and the kinds of regions we might expect to correlate with evidence accumulation. We now include references to the papers/work mentioned by the reviewer where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also had some issues with a couple of the figures.</p><p>Figure 2 – I do not understand how the axes are coded. The dependent variable is %healthy choice, so you would think the axes would be the difference in tastiness and healthiness between the healthy and unhealthy options. However, both of those differences go from -3 to +3, indicating that that's not the case – the healthy option can't be less healthy than the unhealthy option. It seems to me that there should only be the top half of each of these figures. It's also unclear why these figures are mostly red, indicating a preference for healthy options, even when the weight on taste is higher. Is this due to the intercept in the model? If so, that would be useful to clarify. Finally, is panel d upside down? The y-axis says H-UH choice, and that should be most positive for the highest percentage of healthy choices, which should be for the light gray bar, not the black one, right?</p></disp-quote><p>The axes represent the difference in healthiness/tastiness between the proposed option and the default option, not between the healthy and unhealthy option. So, it is possible for the proposed option to be both more or less healthy, and more or less tasty, than the default. This is also why the colors are largely red for two of the quadrants: when the proposed option is both healthier <italic>and</italic> tastier than the default (upper right-hand quadrant), the model almost always chooses it (i.e., makes the healthier choice). Similarly, when the proposed option is both less healthy <italic>and</italic> less tasty (lower left-hand quadrant), the model almost always rejects it (also the healthier choice). We have clarified this by adding the following text to the figure caption:</p><p>“Heat maps display simulated healthy/unhealthy choices for binary choices consisting of a proposed option vs. a default option. Both options are characterized by attribute values such as the perceived tastiness and healthiness of the two food options, with plot axes capturing the relative value difference in tastiness (x-axis) and healthiness (y-axis) of the proposal vs. the default. For example, for each heat map, the upper right-hand quadrant shows likelihood of a healthy choice when the proposed option was both tastier and healthier than the default. The upper left-hand quadrant illustrates the likelihood of a healthy choice when proposed foods were healthier but less tasty than the default and so forth. Warmer colors indicate a higher likelihood of choosing the healthier option.”</p><p>We also note that panel d’s axis is not upside down. This figure displays the predicted difference in activity of the accumulator for healthy vs. unhealthy choices when tastiness and healthiness do <italic>not</italic> conflict (left bars) vs. when they do (right bars). In cases of no attribute conflict (upper right-hand quadrant and lower left-hand quadrant in Figure 2 a), the model predicts that healthy choices (compared to unhealthy choices) should result in <italic>lower</italic> accumulator response. We have thus opted not to alter the figure or figure caption, since we have described this important result in both the main text and the figure caption. However, if the reviewer or editor feels additional text would help clarify this, we would be very happy to take suggestions!</p></body></sub-article></article>
