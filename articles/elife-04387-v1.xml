In alkaliphilic prokaryotes, high external pH activates voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub>), which allows Na<sup>+</sup> to enter and be used as substrate for cation/proton antiporters responsible for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis. Here, we describe a new member of the prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel family (NsvBa; <underline>N</underline>on-<underline>s</underline>elective <underline>v</underline>oltage-gated, <italic><underline>B</underline>acillus <underline>a</underline>lcalophilus</italic>) that is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Mutations in NsvBa can convert the nonselective filter into one that discriminates for Na<sup>+</sup> or divalent cations. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrate the portability of ion selectivity with filter mutations to other <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Increasing pH and temperature shifts their activation threshold towards their native resting membrane potential. Furthermore, we find drugs that target <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels also block the growth of the bacteria. This work identifies some of the adaptations to achieve ion discrimination and gating in <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04387.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04387.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04387.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life essentially runs on electricity: electrical signals cause nerve cells to fire, heart muscles to contract and allow organisms to sense the world around them. These signals are triggered by the movement of positively-charged ions—such as sodium, potassium and calcium—moving into a cell through special ion channels in the cell membrane, which can open and close in response to changes in the voltage across the cell membrane.</p><p>With few exceptions, voltage sensitive ion channels usually only let one type of ion pass into the cell. But how do ion channels discriminate amongst ions and how did they acquire this ability during evolution? To address these questions, researchers have studied a family of sodium channels from bacteria for the past decade. Here DeCaen et al. describe a new member from this ion channel family from a bacterium called <italic>Bacillus alcalophilus</italic>. This ion channel does not discriminate between positively-charged ions and <italic>B. alcalophilus</italic> needs this ion channel for it to dwell in environments that have high levels of potassium or sodium. DeCaen et al. demonstrate that these ion channels can be made selective for sodium or calcium with as little as two small changes in the gene that encodes the ion channel. Furthermore, making similar genetic mutations in related ion channel genes from other <italic>Bacillus</italic> species has the same effect. DeCaen et al. suggest that <italic>Bacillus</italic> ion channel genes are easily adapted to function in a variety of environmental conditions with different levels of positively-charged ions. Thus it is easier for <italic>Bacillus</italic> channels to evolve to be selective for different ions.</p><p><italic>Bacillus</italic> bacteria divide rapidly in warm to hot temperatures and under alkaline pH. DeCaen et al. demonstrate that both of these conditions make <italic>Bacillus</italic> ion channels easier to open in response to voltage. In addition, DeCaen et al. demonstrate that <italic>Bacillus</italic> ion channels can be targeted by drugs that impair the ability of the bacteria to grow. These findings—together with other work that revealed where drug molecules bind to ion channels—could potentially guide efforts to develop treatments for illnesses caused by other <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains, which include anthrax and some forms of food poisoning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04387.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04387.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion selectivity</kwd><kwd>bacteria physiology</kwd><kwd>pharmacology</kwd><kwd>biochemical adaptation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM028454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krulwich</surname><given-names>Terry A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL007572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeCaen</surname><given-names>Paul G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24117005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>Masahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Not all members of the bacteria sodium channel family are sodium channels - those found in <italic>Bacillus</italic> are highly adaptable and can be converted into many selectivity types.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ion selectivity is a defining feature of ion channels. While the structural and biophysical determinants of K<sup>+</sup> selectivity are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>), those of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are unresolved. To fill this knowledge gap, the voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>v</sub> channels) from bacteria have been extensively studied by structural biologists. To date, two full-length (NavAb and NavRh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and three pore-only (NavMs, NavAe and NavCt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McCusker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shaya et al., 2014</xref>) prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channel crystal structures have been solved. The full-length structures demonstrate that four identical subunits, each containing 6-transmembrane segments, assemble together to form a functional channel. The first four transmembrane segments form the voltage sensor (S1–S4) while the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments (S5, S6) form the pore domain. The selectivity filter, which forms critical interactions with the permeating hydrated ions, defines the pore and is scaffolded by two pore helices (P1 and P2) from each subunit. The dipole created by the helices, and an acidic residue from each subunit, create an electronegative region that attracts cations. However, the molecular arrangement that enables Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity in prokaryotes might differ from mammalian voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, it is not clear if structural features that determine ion selectivity in homotetrameric prokaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> reflect the functionally heterotetrameric eukaryotic sodium channels.</p><p>The first prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel, cloned from <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic> C-125, was called NaChBac (<underline>Na</underline><sup>+</sup> <underline>Ch</underline>annel of <underline>Bac</underline>teria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ren et al., 2001</xref>). Since then, Na<sub>V</sub> channels from at least 9 bacterial species have been functionally characterized. All full-length channels exhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koishi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Irie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ulmschneider et al., 2013</xref>). Most bacteria require the ion-motive forces provided by H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions that move through the MotAB or MotPS stator to power the rotary motor proteins to drive the motion of the flagella, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujinami et al., 2009</xref>). In soda lakes and other extremely H<sup>+</sup>-poor (pH 9–12; 1 nM—1 pM [H<sup>+</sup>]) and Na<sup>+</sup>-rich environments (up to 500 mM), alkaliphilic prokaryotes couple motility and ion transporters to Na<sup>+</sup> rather than H<sup>+</sup>. Growth and motility of the alkaliphilic bacterium <italic>Bacillus alcalophilus</italic> AV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vedder, 1934</xref>) are better supported in K<sup>+</sup> rather than Na<sup>+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Terahara et al., 2012</xref>). In alkaliphilic <italic>Bacillus</italic>, either ion can drive the flagellar motor, and a single mutation in the MotS protein was identified that converted the naturally nonselective MotPS (Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) stator into a Na<sup>+</sup>-selective stator. Presumably, bacterial Nav channels provide a source of Na<sup>+</sup> ions that drives the stators and maintains ion homeostasis. However, it is unclear what condition or stimulus would open these channels at the very hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials (Ψ<sub>rest</sub> ≈ −180 mV) found in bacteria.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04387.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The alkaliphilic <italic>Bacillus</italic> cation cycle and the relationship between bacteria Na<sub>v</sub> homologs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram depicting the membrane proteins involved in the Na<sup>+</sup> cycle of <italic>Bacillus alcalophilus</italic>.

While related to members of the Na<sub>v</sub> superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), NsvBa is nonselective among cations. Using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the nonselective filter from NsvBa can be converted into one that is more selective for Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that these features can be conferred onto the NaChBac filter. In addition to selectivity, we characterize the voltage-, pH- and temperature-dependence of <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels.

We cloned NsvBa and generated plasmids for mammalian cell expression to enable measurement by patch clamp methods. Currents from NsvBa-transfected HEK293T cells were robust (≈119 pA/pF in 150 mM extracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>]) with voltage-dependent activation and inactivation similar to NaChBac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The time constant of NsvBa Na<sup>+</sup> current inactivation (τ<sub>inact</sub>) measured at 0 mV was 42 ms, ∼2 times faster than NaChBac (78 ms) but ∼6 times slower than NavMs (7 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The sequence TLESWxxG is conserved in the selectivity filters of prokaryotic Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the sequence of NsvBa is homologous to other prokaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> channels, the selectivity filter sequence (TLDSWGSG) deviates at the high field-strength site (Site<sub>HFS</sub> most extracellular site; see Discussion) with an aspartate residue replacing glutamate (D186) and a flexible glycine at an extracellular position (G189). When aligned, G189 and G191 form a ‘GxG motif’ commonly found in K<sup>+</sup>-selective (Kv) and nonselective ion channels (<italic>e.g.</italic>, TRP and CNG channels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine the selectivity of the NsvBa channel, we patch clamped transiently-transfected HEK cells and measured voltage-dependent currents in the presence of monovalent alkali ions (Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>) or divalent alkaline earth metals (Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

These changes conferred Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity onto the channel and abrogated all other monovalent and divalent conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). When tested separately, the single mutation D186E was sufficient for Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), whereas the single mutation of G189A substantially reduced, but did not entirely abolish, the permeability of K<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, the G189A mutant channel still conducted Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> divalent ions, whereas the D186E mutation did not. These data suggest that a glutamate at Site<sub>HFS</sub> selects Na<sup>+</sup> among other cations while the ‘GxG motif’ likely provides an extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or Rb<sup>+</sup> ion coordination site, possibly involving the glycine backbone carbonyls as found in the selectivity filter of the potassium and NaK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam and Jiang, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam and Jiang 2009b</xref>).

Our findings demonstrate that this family of prokaryotic voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels are not exclusively Na<sup>+</sup>-selective and that the filter sequence that controls passage of cations into the bacteria are transferable within the <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus. Through a series of mutations, we showed that the selectivity of <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels can be converted from nonselective, to relatively higher Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity, suggesting that the filter is readily mutable in evolution to adapt to ionic conditions. These highly adaptable selectivity filters are critical for the <italic>Bacillus</italic> alkaliphiles, allowing for the habitation of various cation-rich environments in which they presumably evolved. It is anticipated that the ion-specificity of at least some antiporters will parallel that of the major coupling ions for the voltage-gated channels that provide a significant amount of their cytoplasmic substrate.</p><p>Although no Na<sup>+</sup> ions reside within the filter of the wild type NavAb crystal structures, 3 Na<sup>+</sup> coordinating sites were proposed: glutamate side chains form a high-field-strength site (Site<sub>HFS</sub>) near the extracellular end of the filter, while backbone carbonyls of Leu and Thr comprise central (Site<sub>CEN</sub>) and inner sites (Site<sub>IN</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>). In the CavAb structure, 3 hydrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were found coordinated within the filter and 3 sites (Sites 1–3) proposed within the filter. Site 1, the one closest to the extracellular surface, is formed by 4 Asp carboxyl side chains, equivalent to positions Ser 196 in NaChBac and Ser 190 in NsvBa. Site 2 (equivalent to Site<sub>HFS</sub> in the wt NavAb crystal structure) is formed by four side chain carboxyls and four backbone carbonyls from equivalent residues of Glu 192 in NaChBac and Asp 186 in NsvBa. Our data suggest that the shorter side chain of the NsvBa Asp acidic residue at site 2 is correlated with decreased Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity, but Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity can be artificially endowed when replaced by a Glu (D186E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with this interpretation, a recent report demonstrates that when the longer side chain Glu 192 is mutated to the shorter Asp in NaChBac (E192D), the channel becomes less selective for Na<sup>+</sup> among Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finol-Urdaneta et al., 2014</xref>). The full-length bacteria Na<sub>V</sub> from marine α-proteobacterium <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> HIMB114 (NavRh) was crystallized containing the selectivity filter TLSSWET-. Although the NavRh channel did not function when heterologously expressed in mammalian and insect cells, the filter was found to be Na<sup>+</sup>-selective when grafted into the NaChBac channel. It is surprising that although the glutamates within the NavRh and NavAb filters originate at distinct positions (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the carboxyl side chains from both channels occupy the same positions in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is likely that selectivity for Na<sup>+</sup> over other cations is partly achieved by the geometry of the arrangement of the carboxylates at Site 2 (Site<sub>HFS</sub>) within the filter of bacterial Na<sup>+</sup> channels. High-resolution crystal structures of Na<sub>v</sub> channels in which sodium ions are resolved are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Among all sequenced living species, naturally occurring nonselective voltage-gated ion channels are rare. It is not clear whether cation-selective or nonselective filters arose first within prokaryotes. Analysis comparing domains of bacteria and mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels indicate that Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity was independently acquired in these channels families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liebeskind et al., 2013</xref>). Bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels are functionally more related to homotetrameric CatSper and Kv channels and thus may not be direct ancestors of mammalian Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Our results are consistent with this interpretation. Not surprisingly, we were not able convert <italic>Bacillus</italic> Na<sub>v</sub> channels to K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels by mutating the filter sequence, presumably since the pore architecture between Kv and bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels (e.g. lumen size, filter length and number of pore helices) are structurally divergent. Our results suggest that the ‘GxG motif’ found in the NsvBa filter evolved convergently within the bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> family and is only distantly related to K<sup>+</sup>-selective Kv channels. A recent report on the expression and characterization of Na<sup>+</sup> channel homologs from the invertebrate sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (NvNa<sub>V</sub>2.1), revealed a heterotetrameric Na<sup>+</sup> channels bearing noncanonical selectivity site (DEEA) that was not selective among K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gur Barzilai et al., 2012</xref>). Thus it appears that the homomeric prokaryotic NsvBa and functionally-heteromeric eukaryotic NvNa<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels are examples of evolution of Na<sup>+</sup>-selectivity to non-selectivity that occurred independently within prokaryotes and metazoans.</p><p>In excitable eukaryotic tissues such as nerves and muscle, the half-activation threshold (V<sub>1/2</sub>) of voltage-gated sodium channels is within ∼80 mV of their cellular resting membrane potential (Ψ<sub>rest</sub> ∼ -60 to −90 mV). At first glance, this appears to contrast with the 140 mV difference between the Ψ<sub>rest</sub> and V<sub>1/2</sub> of alkaliphilic <italic>Bacillus</italic>. But as we have shown, increasing alkalinity and temperature shift bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> V<sub>1/2</sub>'s to approximately −100 mV. At temperatures approaching 40°C, our patch recordings became unstable, thus limiting the temperature range we tested to &lt;37°C. If the sodium current sensitivity is extrapolated to 60°C, the voltage dependence would likely be well within 80 mV of the most negative bacterial resting membrane potential. Since bacterial Ψ<sub>rest</sub> is a function of metabolic state (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pumping) and bacteria occupy more variable ionic environments than neurons, the larger difference between ‘optimal’ a Ψ<sub>rest</sub> and V<sub>1/2</sub> makes physiological sense. The high temperature and pH sensitivity of bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels is similar to TRP and some Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Patapoutian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang and Zheng, 2014</xref>), and is not shared by vertebrate Na<sub>v</sub> channels. We suspect that the fidelity of neuronal firing in metazoans, which depend on their Na<sub>V</sub> channels, led to evolution of less sensitivity to pH and temperature, perhaps by selection of the residues that become exposed to waters within the voltage-sensing S4 and selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, we propose that alkaliphilic bacteria, which dwell in high temperature (35–60°C) and high pH (9–11) environments, employ homomeric Na<sub>v</sub> channels for an entirely different purpose, that of rapidly adjusting internal sodium concentration for metabolic control. This would thus impact growth rates of these <italic>Bacillus</italic> species as we have observed.</p><p>Concentrations of lidocaine, nifedipine, and tamoxifen that inhibit heterologously-expressed bacterial Na<sub>v</sub> channels (NavBp and NsvBa) also block the growth of native <italic>Bacillus species</italic> (<italic>B. pseudofirmus</italic> and <italic>B. alcalophilus</italic>). Although all three drugs affected motility for <italic>B. pseudofirmus</italic>, only tamoxifen and nifedipine increased tumbling frequency of <italic>B. alcalophilus</italic>. These results suggest that in <italic>B. alcalophilus</italic> there may be other transporters or channels besides NsvBa that provide a cation source to drive flagellar motion. These finding demonstrate that block of Na<sup>+</sup> entry via Na<sub>v</sub>, which disrupts the sodium cycle, can impair <italic>Bacillus</italic> motility and growth. The prokaryotic Na<sub>v</sub> from <italic>Magnetococcus marinus</italic> (NavMs), was recently crystalized with a brominated drugs bound and the proposed binding site validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagneris et al., 2014</xref>). Thus voltage-gated channels found in pathogenic <italic>Bacillus</italic> (e.g. <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and <italic>anthracis</italic>) could potentially be antimicrobial targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments</title><p>HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with mammalian cell expression plasmid pTracer CMV2 containing either NsvBa or NaChBac genes.

In this study, DeCaen et al. describe a new member of this family that lacks the selectivity of the canonical prokaryotic sodium channels. They determined the permeation and gating properties of NsvBa and demonstrated that the channel is nonselective among Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Based on the filter sequence difference between NsvBa and other Na<sup>+</sup> selective prokaryotic Nav channels, the authors performed mutagenesis and demonstrate that the nonselective filter from NsvBa can be converted into one that is selective for Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that these features can be conferred onto the NaChBac filter. The authors also characterized the voltage-, pH- and temperature-dependence of several Nav channels from several Bacillus species and demonstrated that a combination of higher temperature and pH are required to reduce the activation threshold of channel opening in these alkaliphilic Bacillus bacteria. This lends credence to their claim that these channels are involved in transport of sodium and other alkali metal ions at highly hyperpolarized potentials which is also the resting membrane potential of this bacterial host. In addition, the authors also characterized the pharmacological properties of Bacillus Nav channels using various Nav channel antagonists and demonstrated that these drugs inhibit the cell growth likely due to the block of Na influx through Nav channels.</p><p>Like this group's previous studies on several prokaryotic Na channels, including the cloning and characterization of the 1st prokaryotic Nav channel (NaChBac) also from a Bacillus species, the characterization of NsvBa presented here is systematic and provide important insights into the selectivity and gating of the Nav channel family. In addition, this group's discovery and characterization of several members of prokaryotic homo-tetrameric Nav channel family have provided excellent model systems for structural studies of Na/Ca channels. This work is well done and nicely presented.</p><p>The only substantive concern is regarding the claim that these channels are non-selective for sodium. All the selectivity data shown here is based on experiments at neutral pH and 22 degree Celsius. We would like to see if this non-selectivity is maintained at higher temperatures and at alkaline pHs. If these channels remain truly non-selective under those conditions, then one wonders what is the role of sodium selective voltage-gated channels?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04387.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The only substantive concern is regarding the claim that these channels are non-selective for sodium.

These are exceptionally difficult conditions, as whole cell patches become very unstable when held at -140 mV for five to ten minutes. The differences in E<sub>rev</sub>’s measured at neutral pH/22⁰C and basic pH/34⁰C are not different for Na<sup>+</sup> conditions but do increase slightly (≤ 5 mV) in the K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. This translates to a 2-3 fold increase the relative permeability for K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is interesting but does not achieve the level of selectivity found in Ca<sub>v</sub>s or Kv channels. Thus, we are confident in our conclusion that NsvBa is a non-selective channel, as there will always be slight differences of ion preference within this selectivity classification.</p><p>Additional data added to the manuscript:</p><p>We added data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> (lidocaine and tamoxifen effects in bacteria motility assays), which was not available at the time of submission. These drugs inhibit swim speed and increase tumble frequency for B. pseudofirmus but the results are mixed for B. alcalophilus. Our interpretation is that B. alcalophilus may have other transporters or channels besides NsvBa that provide a cation source to drive flagellar motion. We have discussed the result in the text.</p><p>Additional edits to the manuscript:</p><p>1) Included references (Yang et al ; Chaudhury et al.) to Kv channel temperature sensitivities that were published during review.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, bringing the total of main text figures to 7.</p><p>3) The NCBI Genbank number for NsvBa was added to the Methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
