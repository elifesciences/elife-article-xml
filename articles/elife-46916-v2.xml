HIV-1 infects multiple BM cell types, but virus dissemination within BM has been poorly understood. We used light microscopy and electron tomography to elucidate mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination within BM of HIV-1–infected BM/liver/thymus (BLT) mice. Tissue clearing combined with confocal and light sheet fluorescence microscopy revealed distinct populations of HIV-1 p24-producing cells in BM early after infection, and quantification of these populations identified macrophages as the principal subset of virus-producing cells in BM over time. Electron tomography demonstrated three modes of HIV-1 dissemination in BM: (<italic>i</italic>) semi-synchronous budding from T-cell and macrophage membranes, (<italic>ii</italic>) mature virus association with virus-producing T-cell uropods contacting putative target cells, and (<italic>iii</italic>) macrophages engulfing HIV-1–producing T-cells and producing virus within enclosed intracellular compartments that fused to invaginations with access to the extracellular space. These results illustrate mechanisms by which the specialized environment of the BM can promote virus spread locally and to distant lymphoid tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>humanized mouse</kwd><kwd>electron tomography</kwd><kwd>tissue clearing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI100652-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>An</surname><given-names>Dong Sung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI028697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>An</surname><given-names>Dong Sung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2 P50 GM082545-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005192</institution-id><institution>California HIV/AIDS Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID15-CT-017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006961</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rosalind W.

Bone marrow (BM) within the spongy matrix of long bones functions as both a primary and secondary lymphoid organ and is the main site for hematopoiesis of immune cells destined for tissues throughout the body. It contains cells commonly associated with HIV-1 pathogenesis (e.g., CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) and BM-specific cells such as megakaryocytes and committed lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells that are also permissive to HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexaki and Wigdahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Dexter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Folks et al., 1988</xref>). HIV-1 infection leads to abnormalities in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Redd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thiebot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamakami et al., 2004</xref>), and virus replication can be detected in the BM of SIV-infected non-human primates (NHPs) within days after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandell et al., 1995</xref>). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in BM can differentiate into multiple HIV-1 permissive cell types that retain the capacity to enter the bloodstream and travel to distant tissue sites in a controlled fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geissmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pabst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pittet et al., 2014</xref>), a process that could facilitate systemic virus dissemination. The presence of varied BM cell types permissive to HIV-1 infection, the ability of BM cells to migrate systemically, and the proposed implication of HSCs and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as cell types that contribute to the virus reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>), make BM an important, but poorly understood, tissue for probing biological mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination and pathogenesis.</p><p>Humanized mice (hu-mice) are a cost-effective model for imaging HIV-1 within tissues and the only HIV-1 infection from which one can routinely obtain BM from long bone samples. Studies in HIV-1–infected hu-mice have recapitulated and advanced important observations of HIV-1 disease, including acute spread and systemic dissemination, latency, and target cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marsden and Zack, 2017</xref>). Several hu-mouse models have been used to study HIV-1 pathogenesis, with BM, liver, thymus (BLT) hu-mice arguably containing the most complete repertoire of human immune cells of hu-mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denton and Garcia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marsden and Zack, 2015</xref>). BLT mice are individually created by transplanting human liver and thymus tissues together with autologous CD34+ HSCs into NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null (NSG) mice. Importantly, BM from HIV-1–infected BLT hu-mice includes human immune cells that produce virus transcripts during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nixon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy can be used to survey specific cell populations within tissues of BLT hu-mice and other models of HIV-1 infection. Larger volume imaging (mm<sup>3</sup>-cm<sup>3</sup>) is possible using tissue clearing methods, which render samples effectively transparent by removing lipids and other biomolecules to enhance light penetration into the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Treweek and Gradinaru, 2016</xref>). Combining tissue clearing with light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allows in situ interrogation of large tissue volumes with single cell resolution and rapid generation of quantifiable spatial information that would be difficult to achieve with traditional immunohistochemistry techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tainaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Tissue clearing has allowed imaging of brain connectivity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>), whole-body metastasis in mouse models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guldner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kubota et al., 2017</xref>), and the distribution of HIV-1–infected cells within gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kieffer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>). Although the inherent density of bone prevents adequate clarification using many tissue clearing techniques, BM imaging is possible using Bone CLARITY, which was developed to clear mouse femurs in order to address the spatial distribution of specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenbaum et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Lymphoid tissues can be imaged at higher resolution using electron microscopy (EM), with electron tomography (ET) allowing 3D visualization of tissue volumes at ultrastructural resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McIntosh et al., 2005</xref>). We previously reported ET studies of HIV-1 dissemination in hu-mouse GALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>) and a longitudinal study of HIV-1 in hu-mouse GALT and spleen during acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>). After using immuno-EM to verify the identity of virions in tissue as HIV-1, we used ET of optimally-preserved tissues to distinguish, characterize and quantify free mature virions, free immature virions, and budding virions within 3D tissue volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). These studies revealed 3D profiles of free and budding HIV-1 virions and documented large pools of extracellular cell-free virions localized between cells and occasional instances of virological synapses, supporting roles for both cell-free and cell-to-cell virus dissemination in these hu-mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, our ET studies of murine leukemia virus (MLV) in secondary lymphoid mouse tissues showed extensive zones of contact between infected macrophages and B-cells, virions in the cell-cell interface (virological synapses), and transfer of virions from infected donor cells to uninfected target cells via uropod extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). The potential roles of cell-free versus cell-associated virus transmission via cellular structures for HIV-1 in BM remain unexplored.</p><p>To address mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination in BM, we employed a multiscale imaging approach: Bone CLARITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenbaum et al., 2017</xref>) combined with IF, confocal, and LSFM to quantify the distributions of specific cell types associated with HIV-1 within intact volumes of BM; and ET to detect individual virions and virion-producing cells to characterize aspects of HIV-1 infection at the subcellular level. These imaging studies allowed visualization of HIV-1 distribution within larger volumes of tissue from a hu-mouse model and revealed distinct mechanisms of virus dissemination within BM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of HIV-1–infected BLT mice</title><p>To investigate mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination in BM, BLT hu-mice were generated by transplantation of human fetal liver-derived CD34+ HSPCs via retro-orbital vein plexus injection and transplantation of pieces of human liver and thymus under the mouse kidney capsule in 8-week-old irradiated NSG mice. Human multi-lineage hematopoietic cell populations (hCD45+ hematopoietic, hCD3+ T-cell, hCD19+ B-cell, hCD4+ T-cell and hCD8+ T-cell) were reconstituted in peripheral blood at 13 weeks post transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). BLT hu-mice were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1<sub>NFNSX</sub> at a dose of 200 ng of p24 gag via retro-orbital vein plexus at 14 weeks. Animals were euthanized and sternums and femurs were harvested to investigate HIV-1 dissemination in BM at 5 days (n = 1), 10 days (n = 2), 63 days (n = 1) and 92 days (n = 1) post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The hCD4/CD8 ratios in peripheral blood were unaltered at 5 and 10 days post-infection and subsequently declined to low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Accordingly, the HIV-1 viral load in peripheral blood was low at 0 (m410) and 5 (m419) days post-infection, but rapidly reached greater than 1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> copies of HIV-1 RNA/mL for all later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IF surveys of BM cell distributions from HIV-1-infected hu-mice</title><p>Sternums and femurs from HIV-1–infected BLT hu-mice were fixed and cleared by Bone CLARITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenbaum et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).~1–2 mm regions of cleared sternum containing a central channel of BM were imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy after immunostaining for cell nuclei, HIV-1 p24, human CD4 (hCD4)-expressing cells, and human CD68 (hCD68)-expressing macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

We therefore used intact BM tissue taken from HIV-1–infected BLT mice after dissection and removal from long bones for ET.

In addition, the location of the bands within the bud neck is consistent with their identification as components of ESCRT-III, which transiently polymerize into spirals at the necks of budding virions to facilitate plasma membrane abscission and virus release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The bands were not present when the bud neck was larger or smaller than that ratio, corresponding to earlier or later budding stages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although ET of tissue samples produces a series of static images, we can use surveys of budding profiles to deduce aspects of a dynamic process such as budding. For example, the observation that the putative ESCRT-III densities are only present on buds that have relatively thick necks suggests that the presence of ESCRT-III spirals connotes a transient, and specific, temporal stage in the HIV-1 budding process. This suggestion is consistent with recent TIRF microscopy studies of individual budding viruses showing ESCRT-III accumulation at a specific stage of HIV-1 Gag accumulation and membrane closure prior to membrane constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Virus-producing T-cells in BM often showed numerous nascent virions budding from multiple sites along the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Because our ET images represent snapshots of specific time points in the budding process captured by rapid fixation, we infer that the nascent virions represent simultaneous budding events. In such cases, ET showed that all buds on a given cell had similar neck diameters, and that all either showed or did not show presumptive ESCRT-III bands. For example, a virus-producing BM T-cell was found to have six budding profiles on its surface within a 400 nm thick section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). ET of each bud showed a similar neck diameter and presumptive ESCRT-III bands circumscribing each bud neck. Nascent virions of different neck diameters or that did not include presumptive ESCRT-III bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, outer panels) were not observed on this cell. These observations suggest that all virions budding from this cell were at a similar stage of egress at the time the BM sample was fixed, supporting the hypothesis that release of virus from virus-producing T-cells in BM occurs in a coordinated or synchronous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>); that is we infer that if all of the buds present on a region of the cell are showing ESCRT bands, they are all at roughly the same point in the budding process. Furthermore, the absence of buds with ESCRT bands within that same region of the cell implies that the budding events were initiated and proceeded at multiple points within roughly the same definable time window.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dissemination mechanism #2: Cell-to-cell transmission of virions attached to T-cell uropods</title><p>HIV-1 virions were found associated with, and budding from, the plasma membranes of large uropods that projected from T-cells and contacted nearby cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). One or two uropods were typically seen per cell. Uropod plasma membranes usually displayed numerous caveolae-like invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), implying that uropods are an active zone for endocytosis and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng and Nichols, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sánchez-Madrid and Serrador, 2009</xref>).

Classification of free virions as mature or immature was based upon the presence of a cone-shaped core (mature) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>; upper right inset) or incomplete ‘C-shaped’ core (immature) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; lower left inset). Virions were also found in early endosomal compartments adjacent to and/or continuous with the phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), suggesting a pathway for transfer of HIV-1 from ingested T-cells into a macrophage.</p><p>Previous studies of cultured macrophages and cells within GALT described intracellular virus-containing compartments, but these were continuous with thin channels that allowed direct access to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deneka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, this current study detected a class of compartments that were fully enclosed and showed no steady-state continuity with extracellular space. Tomography and 3D modeling of these compartments and the adjacent cellular volume demonstrated a clearly-distinguishable continuous membrane surrounding the compartment in all dimensions, with no association with other structures that linked them to extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). HIV-1 virions were observed assembling at, budding into, and maturing within these compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Enclosed compartments containing virions were distinguished from pleomorphic surface invaginations by the electron densities of their respective lumens because the content of the enclosed compartments was denser and thereby appeared darker by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). By contrast, the lumens of invaginations were mostly devoid of electron dense content and appeared comparatively lighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). The increased density of enclosed compartments likely resulted from retained biomolecules that were otherwise lost by fluid exchange from compartments with access to the extracellular space during tissue fixation. Tomography of BM macrophages confirmed that compartments with lighter lumens were continuous with the cell periphery and therefore open to extracellular space (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>).</p><p>Although virions were observed budding from the plasma membranes of BM macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), ET more frequently revealed examples of virions budding into completely-enclosed compartments with dark lumens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results contrast with previous studies in cultured cells demonstrating that HIV-1 buds into internal regions of membrane contiguous with the plasma membrane rather than into endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaudin et al., 2013</xref>). The discovery of virions budding into completely enclosed intracellular compartments of BM macrophages raises the question of whether budding into an enclosed compartment represents a dead end for a nascent virion. In an example demonstrating that budding into an enclosed intracellular compartment could result in eventual virus release from a macrophage, an enclosed compartment with a dark lumen containing a mature virus particle was observed in the process of fusing with a surface-accessible compartment with a lighter lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>), suggesting a pathway by which intracellular viruses can access and subsequently disseminate into extracellular space.</p><p>In order to classify HIV-1 virions associated with enclosed compartments, a large volume of a polymorphonuclear BM macrophage (5.5 μm x 5.5 μm x 1.5 μm) was imaged by ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Within this volume, we classified virions as either budding into enclosed compartments, free immature virions in enclosed compartments, mature virions in enclosed compartments, or mature virions in surface invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). This volume revealed 357 virions (budding, immature, and mature) located within intracellular locations of a virus producing macrophage. The large number (98) of observed budding virions suggested prolific budding into enclosed compartments. The number of free mature virions within enclosed compartments outnumbered free immature virions (216 versus 17), suggesting rapid maturation. Relatively few mature virions (8) were found within surface-accessible invaginations, suggesting that the transfer of virions by fusion of enclosed compartments with surface invaginations is infrequent and slow.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Light and electron microscopy of HIV-1–infected cultured cells have revealed important insights into the HIV-1 life cycle and mechanisms of virus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracq et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deneka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Folks et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sougrat et al., 2007</xref>), but cultured cells cannot replicate complex interactions encountered in vivo by viruses in the context of functioning immune cell populations within tissues. Imaging of HIV-1–infected lymphoid tissues is establishing the importance of tissues in virus dissemination, with each tissue providing insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kieffer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Law et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murooka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reinhart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). HIV-1 infection of BM cells can cause hematopoietic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexaki and Wigdahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Dexter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Folks et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Redd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thiebot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamakami et al., 2004</xref>), yet relatively little is known about mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination in BM and their influence on downstream aspects of disease. Here we utilized a multiscale 3D tissue imaging approach to probe mechanisms of virus dissemination in BM from HIV-1-infected BLT hu-mice using IF of large volumes of clarified tissue and ET of smaller tissue volumes at higher resolution.</p><p>Although directly-comparative imaging of infected human or NHP BM would be an informative addition to our study, we note that the high-resolution ET imaging studies described here required extraction of BM by direct removal from a long bone (see Materials and methods), which is not a possible sample preparation method from living humans or NHPs. BM can be extracted from living subjects using needle aspiration, but in direct comparisons of macaque BM extracted by needle aspiration versus removal from a long bone, we could not locate physiologically-relevant regions that were distinct from mature red blood cells in the needle aspiration samples because they contained contaminating blood from the vasculature introduced during the procedure (M.S.L and P.J.B., unpublished observations). Nonetheless, the imaging studies in BLT hu-mouse BM provided structural insights into mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination in BM and potentially other tissues including: (<italic>i</italic>) virus release from the plasma membrane into extracellular space, (<italic>ii</italic>) cell-associated transmission of virions attached to T-cell uropods, and (<italic>iii</italic>) transfer of virus into macrophages from ingested virus-producing T-cells.</p><p>Many cell types permissive to HIV-1 reside in BM, including CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexaki and Wigdahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Dexter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Folks et al., 1988</xref>). CD4+ T-cells make up the largest lymphocyte subset in human BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oetjen et al., 2018</xref>), and reduction of CD4+ T-cell levels in BM is associated with many infections and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Rosa and Pabst, 2005</xref>). Monocyte/macrophages also make up a substantial cellular component of human BM and are integral for tissue homeostasis, HSC maintenance, and immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaur et al., 2017</xref>). We detected virus-producing T-cells and macrophages in HIV-1–infected BLT hu-mouse BM as early as 5–10 days PI by IF and EM, a timeframe similar to that detected in NHP BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandell et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, light microscopy of BM from HIV-1–infected hu-mice revealed hCD4+ T-cell depletion over time. These results are consistent with NHP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoang et al., 2019</xref>) and human patients with AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 1990</xref>), which together support the use of hu-mice as a model to probe mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination in BM. Vascularization supporting migration of cells to and from BM (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), combined with trafficking of HIV-1–permissive cells, could be responsible for the rapid seeding of this tissue with virus-producing cells detected by ET. Because many immune cell types in BM are permissive to HIV-1 and can potentially migrate to other lymphoid tissues to take up permanent tissue residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexaki and Wigdahl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorantla et al., 2006</xref>), we speculate that migration of HIV-1–infected cells to and from BM is a potential mechanism for virus dissemination to lymphoid tissues throughout the body. Studies in NHPs showed increased levels of monocyte/macrophages released from bone marrow upon infection with SIV/SHIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hasegawa et al., 2009</xref>). This scenario would allow seeding of distant lymphoid tissue sites with virus-producing cells to enhance virus production and systemic spread early during HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Although virus-producing cells were detected in BM within 5 days after infection, fewer such cells were found in BM throughout the duration of the infection as compared to virus-producing cells from infected hu-mouse GALT at similar time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). This could be due to the lower reported density of T-cells in BM (1–3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonomo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monteiro et al., 2005</xref>) as compared with that of GALT of hu-mice (~6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>) or of human patients (~13%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElrath et al., 2013</xref>). IF and EM analysis of BM revealed hCD68+ macrophages as a major cell population producing HIV-1 p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) which parallels NHP studies showing monocytes/macrophages to be an early and important target of SIV in BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kitagawa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandell et al., 1995</xref>). IF revealed a sizeable population of p24+ cells that did not stain as hCD68+ or hCD4+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with CD4 downregulation by HIV-1–infected T-cells, or cell-free viruses. An additional possibility is this cell population represents CD4-/CD68- BM myeloid suppressor cells, which were shown to be infected by SIV in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sui et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>HIV-1 can be transmitted through infection by cell-free virus or through cell-to-cell contact, with the latter mechanism being more efficient in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimitrov et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phillips, 1994</xref>). In tissues, the prevalence and efficiency of these two mechanisms of virus transmission is less well understood, partly because of the complex and dynamic environment that HIV-1 encounters the presence of an immune system and multiple cell types organized into tissues (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchil et al., 2019</xref>). Intravital imaging studies revealed cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 in tissues of hu-mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murooka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sewald et al., 2012</xref>); however, the resolution of LM makes it difficult to definitively assign virion fluorescence as representing cell-free versus cell-associated virions. In this study, we used ET to directly visualize cell-associated and cell-free virions within BM during active HIV-1 infection in hu-mice. One important observation from ET of BM was that examples of both cell-free and cell-associated virions were readily detected, suggesting that HIV-1 transmission in vivo can occur by both mechanisms.</p><p>In previous ET studies of more densely-packed cells in hu-mouse tissues such as GALT and spleen, we found examples of potential cell-to-cell spread of virions as well as abundant free virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). Because the overall cell density in BM is reduced compared to other lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we speculate that virus-producing cells contacting other cells are more rare in BM than in densely-packed tissues, but potentially more directed due to the lower density of cells. Furthermore, in contrast to our previous ET studies of HIV-1-infected BLT hu-mouse GALT, which revealed hundreds of mature virions localizing between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>), we detected fewer cell-free virions in hu-mouse BM. One interpretation for this difference is that the lower cell density of BM compared with other tissues allows cell-free virus to more rapidly disseminate from virus-producing cells as opposed to being trapped in pools between densely-intercalated cells in GALT or spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). These contrasting results highlight the importance of tissue-specific characteristics (e.g., cell densities, cell populations, architecture, function) influencing HIV-1 transmission in different lymphoid tissues and that HIV-1 transmission does not occur by a singular mechanism in all tissues.</p><p>ET analysis allowed identification of different stages of virus egress by characterizing thin bands of electron density circumscribing virus bud necks. These presumably represent components of the host ESCRT-III machinery that are involved virus budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as previously demonstrated by immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). We detected examples of budding virions from individual cells that were all at similar stages of egress as indicated by the putative ESCRT bands and by bud necks widths that were ~50–80% the diameter of the nascent virion itself. Budding virions with larger or smaller ratios of neck-to-virus diameter, corresponding to earlier or later stages of budding, respectively, did not show these bands, suggesting transient formation of this structure at a specific stage of virus release. These observations are consistent with TIRF microscopy studies of individual budding virions that showed ESCRT-III accumulation at a specific stage of HIV-1 Gag accumulation and membrane curvature prior to membrane constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these results support a model of synchronized release of virions from a cell in which spirals of ESCRT-III transiently polymerize at the necks of budding virions at a specific stage of Gag accumulation and membrane curvature to facilitate plasma membrane abscission and virus release.</p><p>A striking observation revealed by ET was the prevalence of BM macrophages engulfing virus-producing cells, with examples at different stages of engulfment and degradation, demonstrating containment of intact, virus-producing cells in addition to individual virions within intracellular macrophage compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">3</xref>. These results suggested that macrophages in BM actively engulfed and degraded T-cells that were producing virus and could represent an example in lymphoid tissue similar to results in cultured macrophages describing removal of virus-producing T-cells via efferocytosis (phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2018</xref>) and to reports of macaque macrophages containing phagocytosed SIV-infected CD4+ T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiNapoli et al., 2017</xref>). Our results also address in vitro fluorescence microscopy and EM studies of HIV-1–infected human CD4+ T-cells cultured with uninfected human macrophages that showed fusion of infected T-cells and macrophages to form multinucleated giant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracq et al., 2017</xref>); similar phenomena were also reported through EM analysis of human patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orenstein and Wahl, 1999</xref>). By contrast, we did not observe examples of macrophage–T-cell fusion, although we found many examples of macrophages ingesting cells resembling T-cells in BM. In addition, we showed by 3D imaging that macrophages that appeared to include multiple nuclei in individual IF optical sections or EM projection images actually contained single, polymorphous nuclei with connections between individual nuclear lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, EM of macrophages in the process of engulfing cell(s) included the additional nuclei from the ingested cell itself, and ET showed these nuclei to be physically separated from the nucleus and cytoplasm of the macrophage by a membrane-enclosed space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows a macrophage that completely engulfed two other cells, each delineated by intact membranes or phagosomes. By light microscopy this could be interpreted as a single cell containing multiple distinct nuclei within the cytoplasm.</p><p>We detected BM macrophages producing and harboring large numbers of virions within intracellular locations. In one example, 357 virions were detected within a 5.5 μm x 5.5 μm x 1.5 μm volume of a BM macrophage. Macrophages are larger than T-cells and extrapolating these results to the approximate volume of the macrophage imaged (~2800 um<sup>3</sup>) and subtracting half of the volume as nucleus not containing virions (~1400 um<sup>3</sup>), an individual BM macrophage could harbor &gt;11,000 virions. These virions could represent a potential virus reservoir as macrophages are long-lived, motile, and frequently interact with target cells. Virus-containing intracellular compartments have been observed in cultured macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deneka et al., 2007</xref>) and in cells from GALT and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kieffer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ladinsky et al., 2014</xref>). However, in previous cases, the apparently intracellular compartments were directly continuous with the extracellular space by means of thin channels. Here, we found examples of virus-containing intracellular compartments that were enclosed with no continuity with the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). HIV-1 was observed budding into these compartments and at different stages of maturation within them, suggesting that they serve as sites for virus assembly and associated host-cell derived budding machinery. The completely-enclosed compartments in BM macrophages typically contained only 1–3 virions in the form of nascent buds, immature free virions, or mature free virions. This result contrasts with virus-containing compartments in cultured macrophages and in cells within GALT and spleen tissue, which contained ≥20 (GALT and spleen) and ≥50 (cultured cells) virions. Budding into a completely-enclosed intracellular compartment seems unproductive for a virus; however, we observed examples of fusion between a completely-enclosed compartment and a compartment with access to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>), supporting a route by which viruses could be produced, stored, and released by macrophages in tissues.</p><p>Cumulatively, our studies reveal macrophages to be actively involved HIV-1 dissemination in BM, suggesting the intriguing possibility that virus-producing BM macrophages could support systemic virus spread to distant tissue locations as they differentiate into tissue-resident macrophages and migrate to distant lymphoid sites. The ability of BM macrophages to produce and harbor virus early after infection could function as a virus reservoir with the potential to promote virus dissemination to distant tissue locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjl</sup></italic>/SzJ <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NSG</td><td valign="top">UCLA CFAR Humanized Mouse Core laboratory</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">NFNSX <break/>(<italic>HIV-1</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NFNSX</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Brien et al., 1990</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human fetal thymus and liver</td><td valign="top">Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from de-identified human fetus</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD34+ (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Miltenyi Biotec</td><td valign="top">Catalog # <break/>130-100-453</td><td valign="top">FACS (100 µL for up to 1e8 cells.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD45-eFluor 450 (mouse monoclonal, clone HI30)</td><td valign="top">eBiosciences</td><td valign="top">Catalog # <break/>48-0459-42</td><td valign="top">5 µL (0.5 µg)/test</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD3-APC H7 (mouse monoclonal, clone SK7)</td><td valign="top">BD Pharmingen</td><td valign="top">Cat# 340440</td><td valign="top">10 µL / 100 µL test</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD4-APC (mouse monoclonal, clone OKT4)</td><td valign="top">eBiosciences</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 17-0048-42</td><td valign="top">5 µL (0.06 µg)/test</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD8-PerCP Cy5.5 (mouse monoclonal, clone SK1)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 344710</td><td valign="top">5 µl per million cells in 100 µl</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-human CD19-Brilliant Violet 605 (mouse monoclonal, clone HIB19)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 302244</td><td valign="top">5 µl per million cells in 100 µl</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-mouse FcR (CD16/32);

Femur samples were cut into two pieces and pierced with a 33-gauge insulin syringe (Millipore-Sigma) in 5–10 locations along the length of the sample to promote antibody penetration. Cleared samples were rinsed 3 times in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min each, blocked overnight in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 4% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.01% sodium azide, and a 1:100 dilution of rat anti-mouse FcR (CD16/32; Biolegend). Samples were incubated for 3–5 days in blocking buffer (lacking rat anti-mouse FcR antibody for the remaining protocol) containing primary antibodies diluted 1:200. Samples were washed five times with wash solution (0.1% Tween-20% and 0.01% sodium azide in 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4) over the course of one day and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. In certain instances, primary antibodies were conjugated to a fluorophore using antibody labeling kits (Biotium Inc), and the secondary antibody staining step was omitted. After immunostaining, samples were washed five times in wash buffer over one day, stained with DAPI in wash buffer for 10 min, and washed 3 times for 10 min prior to immersion in RIMS overnight for sample mounting and imaging.

They combine state of the art light and electron microscopy techniques to characterize 3 mechanisms of virus spread among human bone marrow cells the BLT mice: (i) virus budding from T cell and macrophage membranes, (ii) virus producing T-cells directly contacting target cells, and (iii) macrophages engulfing HIV-1-producing cells and virus budding within intracellular compartments that fused to invaginations with access to the extracellular space. Their evidence for cell-cell spread along a viral synapse supports previous models based on viral spread in cell culture models.

HIV positive cells in bone marrow could be detected within the first few days of infection in this model. These studies suggest that virions originate from T cells and macrophages and these budding virions were often in proximity to the ESCRT machinery consistent with the role for these pathways in HIV egress. They further showed evidence for cell-cell spread along a viral synapse, which has been proposed as a key mechanism of viral spread in cell culture models. They further showed a novel mechanism of virus budding within macrophages. Macrophages were a major infected cell type in bone marrow in this model and they participated in uptake of infected cells.</p><p>Overall, these studies advance some of what we know from cell culture to the more complex setting of the humanized mouse, where the role of interactions between cells in HIV spread can be more readily examined. While it is unclear whether this model predicts the events that occur in HIV infected humans, the same can certainly be said for cell culture models and for NHP studies and this model has distinct advantages – both in studying infected human cells in human tissue and in the ability to visualize events. The findings of evidence of cell-cell spread adds to an important debate in the field as to whether cell-free of cell-cell spread is most important in HIV, although this study does not go particularly far in this aspect.</p><p>I am not well positioned to comment on the technical aspects and will leave that to the other reviewers.

The application of tissue clearing approaches and electron tomography within this compartment and using the BLT model is novel and presents interesting images of what is possible within this system. There are however, significant limitations of the study which should be addressed. Often, the authors overinterpret aspects of the data and state their imprecations as fact. There is also limited comparisons with non-infected or human BM comparators to allow one to say what might be specific to HIV infected BM. I discuss these limitations further below.</p><p>A limitation of the data as it presented here is how to place this into context with a human bone marrow. Something that would help would be to try to place the data into context with respect to how well this compartment serves as a model for human bone marrow. Perhaps some comparative data with conventional pathology images, bone marrow smears, flow cytometry, would help to define the system in comparison with normal and/or HIV infected human BM. It would be nice to assess the overall architecture already with regards to cellular density and the representation of the different cell types.</p><p>Many of the images are certainly intriguing, and of high quality, however, the conclusions made from them infer activity that one cannot establish with fixed images. Some of the nomenclature and descriptions and cell calling methods appear to use a best guess approach.</p><p>1) RE: Dissemination mechanism #1. It is not fair to say synchronous as this implies the speed with which the viral release has occurred. Figure 3B, authors speculate that it is interesting that the HIV bud is so close to the nucleus, but it could be that when the bud formed it was not in close proximity to the nucleus. The morphology of HIV infected cells is highly dynamic, so it may not be so surprising that a bud is close to or far away from any cellular structure.</p><p>2) RE: Dissemination mechanism 2. RE: Virions attached to uropods. While it is an interesting hypothesis that the structures are uropods, uropods are defined largely by the morphology of migrating cell and are difficult to define in a static image without surface molecules. It may be a leap to call these cellular extensions uropods. Figure 4F, It is unclear how the authors define the features of a synapse. How does one define synapse in their approach?</p><p>3) RE: Dissemination mechanism 3. Macrophages phagocytosis. It would be nice to characterize the frequency with which one sees phagocytosis of infected cells, versus non-infected cells. How unique or specific is this to HIV infected scenarios? Figure 5C the cell is referred to as a polymorphonuclear macrophage, could this be a neutrophil with few granules?</p><p>There appear to be large spaces between the cells which may be artifact of the fixation process which may affect conclusions about what cells are physically interacting or not. The authors should comment on how reflective the spaces are of natural state of the BM and how this may impact their conclusions about cell-cell interactions.</p><p>Overall, while the imaging modalities are innovative and of high quality in general, the novelty of the observations is modest. Some of the conclusions made and discussion infer temporal relationships which are not well supported, and the naming process seems a little arbitrary, how does one truly distinguish the different cell types. Additional comparison with what is normal in both the uninfected BLT mouse as well as in human BM would help to put the observations in a greater context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46916.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed that the images are interesting and that this is a unique approach and model.

We wish to highlight that we were able to detect examples of both cell-free and cell-associated virions by EM, supporting the idea that both forms of HIV-1 transmission do occur in tissue.

We believe that experiments to address this question would likely involve generation of a novel mouse model, which would require months, if not years, and is outside of our field of expertise.

Flow Cytometry of normal human BM (Figure 2 in Ozcivici et al. (2010). <italic>PLoS One 5: e11178</italic>).</p><p>Regarding whether we could conduct comparable imaging studies of human BM, we point out that for our electron tomography imaging, intact BM tissue was taken from HIV-infected BLT mice by means of dissection and direct removal from long bones, rather than by needle aspiration. We did this to obtain suitable amounts of tissue and to reduce disruption of cells and their structural organization. Specifically, BM tissues for our EM studies were obtained by removing ~1 cm of the sternum bone immediately after the mouse was sacrificed and then placing it in a fixative to allow biosafe transport from UCLA to Caltech and for biosafety during processing. After preservation with fixative, the sternum was opened and intact BM was removed without disruption of the underlying tissue structure.</p><p>However, for histological studies and transplant procedures, BM is typically extracted from human patients by needle aspiration from long bones. To evaluate if we can successfully image human BM extracted by needle aspiration, we processed BM obtained by needle aspiration from living macaques for EM, but found the method unsatisfactory due to overwhelming amounts of contaminating blood from the vasculature introduced into the samples during the procedure as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (i.e., we could not find physiologically-relevant regions of BM that were distinct from contaminating mature red blood cells at the EM level). Conversely, we successfully imaged BM from euthanized NHPs when intact BM was prepared from bone samples as described above for the submitted BLT humanized mouse study. Notably, the NHP BM appeared similar to BLT mouse BM, another indication of the physiological relevance of the BLT mouse model for BM studies. Unfortunately, due to the larger size of NHPs compared with mice and discrepancies in viral load and length of infection, we were unable to observe virus particles or infected cells in these samples. We have also been unable to obtain the larger number of NHP bone samples we would require to systematically search for SIV or SHIV infection in NHP BM, likely because the high cost of NHPs for research precludes sacrificing animals to extract the samples we would require for the sort of systematic study we conducted in HIV-infected humanized mice. As mentioned in our manuscript, macrophages were previously found as early and important targets of SIV infection in NHP (Kitagawa et al., 1991). Our current HIV-infected BLT mouse studies support these previous findings and our use of the BLT mouse model to study mechanisms of virus dissemination within BM. Finally, our findings that intact bone samples are required for high resolution EM imaging of both BLT mouse and NHP BM suggests that imaging of human BM would require bone samples from living HIV-infected patients, which we cannot obtain.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of macaque BM extracted by needle aspiration vs. direct removal from a long bone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EM overview of a typical field of macaque BM, extracted from femur by needle aspiration.

We do not know of a source of such samples. Even if we could obtain these samples, we would need to extract the BM within minutes to hours post-mortem and process the samples for EM within a day after extraction for reliable imaging. To illustrate the problem with degradation when samples are not immediately processed, we processed BLT mouse BM after waiting for longer than a day after its original extraction and found that the degradation was too severe for reliable interpretation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of freshly prepared BLT mouse BM vs. similar sample prepared after longer than one day.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of BM from a sample processed within 1 day of extraction.

Although difficult to discern at the histological level, degradation at the cellular level is obvious when observed at the ~7 nm resolution of EM tomography. As such, tissue samples that have gone unprocessed for even 24 hours following collection and initial fixation are typically of questionable quality for EM tomographic studies. In addition, most or all human tissues available from tissue banks have been preserved in ways that render them inappropriate for high-resolution electron tomography imaging. Although not a problem for histological imaging, the fixatives commonly used in tissue repositories (e.g., paraformaldehyde, formalin, and freshfrozen) are known to distort cellular features at the EM ultrastructural level, and such samples would not be suitable for reliable electron tomography studies in which we need to ascertain, e.g., whether an HIV-containing compartment is located entirely within a cell and/or has access to the extracelluar space through narrow channels (as we did in the paper submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> for infected BLT mouse BM). The fact that most or all human tissues, especially HIV-infected tissues, that are available from tissue banks or similar collection and storage facilities have been preserved for specific tests and/or held in aldehyde fixatives for many months or even years renders this source of human tissue impossible for our EM studies.</p><p>In summary, it is unlikely that BM from an HIV-infected human subject could be obtained and prepared in a manner that would allow a direct imaging comparison with our BLT mouse studies because (<italic>i</italic>) bone removal and dissection from a living subject is neither ethical nor practical, (<italic>ii</italic>) obtaining suitably “fresh” samples from a deceased infected subject is equally improbable for many of the same reasons as well as logistical ones, and (<italic>iii</italic>) HIV-infected BM samples obtained from tissue repositories are not preserved using protocols that can generate sufficient ultrastructural resolution by electron tomography or tissue clearing and IF. And in all of these cases, there is effectively no likelihood that a human BM sample could be matched with our BLT mouse samples in terms of viral load or stage of infection. For these reasons, we cannot conduct direct EM comparisons of HIV-infected human BM (or SIV/SHIV-infected NHP BM) with HIV-infected BLT mouse BM to address whether the HIV dissemination mechanisms we interpreted from our EM studies of BLT mouse BM occur in other sources of infected BM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the images are certainly intriguing, and of high quality, however, the conclusions made from them infer activity that one cannot establish with fixed images. Some of the nomenclature and descriptions and cell calling methods appear to use a best guess approach.</p></disp-quote><p>A limitation of samples for electron tomography is that when they are preserved in a way to allow the recording of the highest resolution ultrastructural details, it is not possible to use the same sections for immuno-EM. However, as described in the text, many of the cells in BM can be identified by morphology. In addition to the current descriptions of morphology, we added text explaining that the same samples cannot be used for both high resolution tomography and immuno-EM and describing in greater detail the rationale for identification of each cell type based on its morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) RE: Dissemination mechanism #1. It is not fair to say synchronous as this implies the speed with which the viral release has occurred. Figure 3B, authors speculate that it is interesting that the HIV bud is so close to the nucleus, but it could be that when the bud formed it was not in close proximity to the nucleus. The morphology of HIV infected cells is highly dynamic, so it may not be so surprising that a bud is close to or far away from any cellular structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out what is likely mostly a problem with how we described our results. Perhaps our choice of terminology caused confusion. We chose the term “semisynchronous” to denote that the virions are at a similar stage of egress. Our use of the term “synchronized” was intended to imply multiple events happening at the same time. In the case of HIV budding from a T-cell, we are suggesting that multiple buds form within a particular time period (consistent with finding multiple buds at similar states of egress after rapid fixation), and a portion of that time period is defined as when ESCRT bands are present on the necks of the nascent virions. Since the entire budding process may take minutes and the accumulation/function of ESCRT takes a subset of those minutes, we can infer that if all of the buds present on a region of the cell are showing ESCRT bands, they are all more-or-less at the same point in the budding process. Further, the absence of buds with ESCRT bands within that same region of the cell implies that the budding event in toto is initiated and proceeds at multiple points and within roughly the same definable time window. We have re-worded the text in order to make this description more clear and specific.</p><p>Regarding the description of the HIV bud near the nucleus, the reviewer correctly points out that the bud may have formed further from the nucleus. We revised the text to address this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) RE: Dissemination mechanism 2. RE: Virions attached to uropods. While it is an interesting hypothesis that the structures are uropods, uropods are defined largely by the morphology of migrating cell and are difficult to define in a static image without surface molecules. It may be a leap to call these cellular extensions uropods.</p></disp-quote><p>We use the same definition for a uropod as in Sewald et al., Science. 2015 Oct 30; 2015 Oct 1. PMID: 26429886, where it says, “We identified numerous complex membranous protrusions to which many viral particles were localized. These protrusions were often long and formed contacts between both neighbouring and distally located cells. These membrane-rich protrusions originated from a donor cell and were as long as ~10 μm—a structure that was also occasionally observed by intravital imaging. These protrusions were rich in intracellular vesicles and mitochondria, indicating that they represent uropods.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4F, It is unclear how the authors define the features of a synapse. How does one define synapse in their approach?</p></disp-quote><p>As clarified in the revised text, we define a synapse in our studies as a region of close proximity between a donor cell and a potential target cell, often including zones of direct contact, which facilitates transfer of material from the donor cell only to the target cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RE: Dissemination mechanism 3. Macrophages phagocytosis. It would be nice to characterize the frequency with which one sees phagocytosis of infected cells, versus non-infected cells. How unique or specific is this to HIV infected scenarios?</p></disp-quote><p>Macrophages actively phagocytose many types of cells, including but not limited to cells infected with viruses, oncogenically-transformed cells, and dead/dying cells. In our current BM studies, we can qualitatively say that uninfected cells (i.e., cells with no visible associated virus) outnumbered cells associated with virus by ~20:1. We included this observation in the revised manuscript in subsection “Dissemination mechanism #3: Macrophage phagocytosis of virus-producing T-cells and release of intracellular virions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C the cell is referred to as a polymorphonuclear macrophage, could this be a neutrophil with few granules?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid point that we previously considered. Neutrophils in BM from BLT hu-mice are indeed polymorphonuclear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 3</xref>), but they are easily distinguished from macrophages by their smaller size and populations of large, evenly dense granules. Neutrophils from BLT hu-mice were morphologically comparable to human neutrophils (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> with figure 1 from Brinkmann and Zychlinsky (2012). <italic>J. Cell Biol 198:773-783</italic>). Furthermore, neutrophils lack extensive, pleomorphic surface invaginations that are common to macrophages. Such invaginations appear electron-lucent in BM macrophages (see Figure 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 from our submitted manuscript). For these reasons, we are confident that the cells we identify as macrophages are not neutrophils with few granules.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Electron microscopy of neutrophils.</title><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophil from HIV-infected BLT mouse BM.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46916-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There appear to be large spaces between the cells which may be artifact of the fixation process which may affect conclusions about what cells are physically interacting or not.

Note there are spaces between individual cells in all methods of fixation and analysis. Because our tissues for EM were fixed intact (i.e., entire sternums or femurs placed into fixative) and then high pressure frozen, the potential for disruption of BM architecture was minimized as compared to a technique such as needle biopsy to obtain extracted BM. Therefore our fixation protocols should maintain the overall BM architecture equivalently, if not better, than other methods of tissue fixation.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>EM of BM.</title><p>EM overview of BLT hu-mouse BM.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46916-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In previous papers cited in the submitted paper (Ladinsky et al., 2014 and Kieffer et al., 2017), we found examples of potential cell-to-cell spread of virions in tissues with closely-packed cells (gut, spleen) as well as an abundance of free virus. Because the overall cell density in BM is reduced compared to other lymphoid tissues, we speculate that virus-producing cells contacting other cells were more rare in this tissue, but potentially more directed due to the lower density of total cells in addition to potential target cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, while the imaging modalities are innovative and of high quality in general, the novelty of the observations is modest. Some of the conclusions made and discussion infer temporal relationships which are not well supported, and the naming process seems a little arbitrary, how does one truly distinguish the different cell types.

Regarding temporal relationships, please see our response to point #1. Regarding novelty, we know of no other studies in tissues during early stages of infection that show macrophage ingestion of virus-producing T-cells and presents a plausible mechanism by which virus can then be released from the macrophage. We also know of no other study that conclusively documents macrophages assembling and releasing HIV into completely enclosed intracellular compartments, a topic of interest to HIV researchers as evidenced by previous controversies in the literature on this topic that are described in studies cited in our paper. As described above and in the revised text, we explained how we identified cells based on morphology, further clarified our discussion of temporal events in HIV budding, and discussed our results in the context of published results in human BM. Regarding comparisons with uninfected BM, below we show an EM image of uninfected BLT mouse BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>).
