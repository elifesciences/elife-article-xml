is evolving. However, environments are rarely constant or predictable. When an organism well adapted to one environment finds itself in another, pleiotropic effects of mutations that made it well adapted to its former environment will affect its success. To better understand such pleiotropic effects, we evolved both haploid and diploid barcoded budding yeast populations in multiple environments, isolated adaptive clones, and then determined the fitness effects of adaptive mutations in ‘non-home’ environments in which they were not selected. We find that pleiotropy is common, with most adaptive evolved lineages showing fitness effects in non-home environments. Consistent with other studies, we find that these pleiotropic effects are unpredictable: they are beneficial in some environments and deleterious in others. However, we do find that lineages with adaptive mutations in the same genes tend to show similar pleiotropic effects. We also find that ploidy influences the observed adaptive mutational spectra in a condition-specific fashion. In some conditions, haploids and diploids are selected with adaptive mutations in identical genes, while in others they accumulate mutations in almost completely disjoint sets of genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>trade-offs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

Some will be beneficial, some will be neutral and have no effects, while others will even be deleterious and be selected against. But <italic>when</italic> and <italic>where</italic> such mutations arise may be just as important at shaping their fate as the mutations themselves. Real-world environments are constantly changing, in both somewhat predictable ways (e.g. diurnal rhythms, seasonal fluctuations) and unpredictable ways (e.g. local weather) that can affect temperature, light, the availability of nutrients and water, salinity, pH, and many other environmental variables. Importantly, such environmental changes can influence adaptive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 2022</xref>). One approach for investigating how changing environments can affect the fate of mutations, and thus evolutionary outcomes, is to determine whether populations adapted to a particular environment are well- or maladapted to others. That is, <italic>how conditional is adaptation?,</italic> and <italic>what are the pleiotropic consequences?</italic> – that is <italic>how do genotypes well adapted to one environment fare in others</italic>? Do they show trade-offs, suggesting that they are specialists for their adaptive environment, or are they fit across many environments, suggesting instead that they may be generalists. Classically, pleiotropy is defined as when a gene influences two or more traits. However, it is often unclear what the traits influenced by a gene are. Thus, in this work we instead define a mutation’s <italic>pleiotropic profile</italic> as its vector of fitnesses across a set of environments, and determine the presence of pleiotropy predicated on non-neutral fitness in one or more non-home environments.</p><p>The idea of a genotype resulting in different fitnesses in different environments has its roots in early botany experiments, first carried out a century ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turesson, 1922</xref>, who noted that <italic>ecotypes</italic> of a species seemed best adapted to their native environment. This concept was later extended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clausen et al., 1948</xref>, whose now classic reciprocal transplant experiments showed that plants that are adapted to a particular environment were more fit in that environment than those adapted elsewhere, and vice versa. The development of new technologies, such as the gene deletion collection in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> has enabled the measurement of the fitness of thousands of defined genotypes across multiple environments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinmetz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deutschbauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giaever and Nislow, 2014</xref> for review), including different drug treatments and nutrient deprivations. These studies revealed that many gene deletions show pleiotropic effects and are often beneficial in some environments yet deleterious in others. However, the deletion collection consists of gene knock-outs instead of mutations acquired through evolution; thus, it has limited power to reveal how adaptive mutations selected in a particular environment fare in another.</p><p>Experimental microbial evolution combined with high-throughput sequencing and barcoded lineage tracking provides a powerful approach for testing evolutionary theory and has yielded substantial insights into the evolutionary process.

Early work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper and Lenski, 2000</xref>) showed that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> evolved for 20,000 generations often lost various catabolic functions, though it was unclear whether such loss was due to pleiotropy of adaptive mutations, or instead was the result of additional non-adaptive mutations due to mutation accumulation. Subsequent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Lenski, 2007</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> evolved at 20°C often, but not always, showed reduced fitness at 37°C, suggesting that the adaptive mutations resulted in trade-offs, yet confoundingly that such trade-offs did not always manifest. More recently, using pooled fitness measurement with barcoded lineages, trade-offs have been demonstrated even between different phases of the yeast growth cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref>), likely in large part due to the existence of Pareto optimality fronts (which prevent performance in two traits to be maximized simultaneously) constraining performance between different pairs of growth cycle traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2019</xref>). A detailed analysis of barcoded yeast adaptive mutants, selected for improved fitness in glucose limited medium, showed that adaptive mutants selected in one environment frequently showed trade-offs in other environments, suggesting that pleiotropy may be global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinsler et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Two recent papers have sought to directly and systematically address the pleiotropy and trade-offs of adaptive mutations, both in yeast. The first showed that when haploid populations were independently evolved in many different environments, the fitness consequences in environments in which they were not evolved were largely unpredictable – that is, whether a population evolved specialists or a generalist phenotype was largely due to chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>). The second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakerlee et al., 2021</xref>) showed that replicate populations evolving independently displayed very similar pleiotropic profiles within the first few hundred generations, but that variability in pleiotropic effects tended to increase among populations over evolutionary time with the extent of that variability depending on the evolution environment. However, these studies focused on populations over time, and many mutations accumulated in those populations. Follow-up work on specific individual mutations that arose in such populations and what their pleiotropic effects are is currently lacking.</p><p>To characterize the trade-offs and pleiotropic effects of specific individual adaptive mutations, we experimentally evolved both haploid and diploid barcoded <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> populations in multiple environments, identified adaptive mutations via whole-genome sequencing, then performed pooled fitness remeasurement assays in 12 environments across a broad range of perturbations such as change in temperature, pH, and antifungal drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These data allowed us to observe how ploidy and environment influence the observed adaptive mutational spectrum and how the evolution (‘home’) environment influences the dynamics of adaptation and pleiotropic effects of specific adaptive mutations in novel (‘non-home’) environments. We find that ploidy influences the observed adaptive mutational spectra in a condition-specific fashion. In some conditions, haploids and diploids are selected with adaptive mutations in identical genes, while in others they accumulate mutations in almost completely disjoint sets of genes. We also find that pleiotropy is common, with most adaptive evolved lineages showing fitness effects in non-home environments, and that these effects are beneficial in some environments and deleterious in others. Consistent with other studies, we find that pleiotropic effects are unpredictable, although we do find that lineages with specific individual adaptive mutations in the same genes tend to show similar pleiotropic effects.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Environmental conditions used in this study.</title><p>Evolution conditions used in this study,

reader, we first provide an overview of the entire set of experiments, then in subsequent sections describe each part in detail. To investigate adaptation and its pleiotropic consequences, we designed a double barcode system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), in which one barcode is intended to encode the environment within which a lineage will be evolved and the other is used for lineage tracking within each evolving population (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). This approach was devised such that we could pool evolved lineages from multiple evolutionary conditions, and use their barcodes to measure fitness across multiple conditions and not be concerned about DNA barcode sequence collisions between adaptive clones isolated from different evolution conditions. We generated double barcoded populations of both haploid and diploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> such that we had sufficient barcode complexity to track hundreds of thousands of lineages evolving in each condition. We evolved both haploid and diploid barcoded yeast populations in 12 conditions in duplicate. We chose the evolution environments with the goal of spanning a wide variety of conditions that had varying timescales of adaptation, different environmental or chemical perturbations, or alternative carbon sources (see Methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For each evolution condition (‘home’ environment), we tracked the frequency of barcodes by amplicon sequencing for one or both of the replicates every 8–24 generations, allowing us to observe the extent of adaptation and to estimate which lineages were likely to contain beneficial mutations. From each evolution condition, we isolated barcoded lineages from a timepoint at which we determined, if possible, that there was substantial adaptation (see Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and whole-genome sequenced lineages to identify the mutations that arose during the evolution. We then conducted a bulk fitness assay (BFA) in which we pooled the isolated lineages into three different pools and measured their fitness in up to 10 of the original evolution conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy et al., 2015</xref>), capturing their fitness effects in their evolution (‘home’) environment, as well as the pleiotropic consequences of those mutations in other ‘non-home’ environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA double-barcoding strategy enables massively parallel bulk ‘common garden’ fitness remeasurements across many environments.</title><p>For both ploidies (1N and 2N) 12 pools of singly barcoded yeast were generated. A second, high complexity barcode was then introduced into each pool, creating 24 (12 haploid and 12 diploid) pools of uniquely double barcoded yeast. Each pool was evolved in a specific environment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) for up to 440 generations (55 transfers). Evolved strains were isolated from each pool and whole-genome sequenced to identify any mutations that arose. Strains were pooled for bulk fitness assays in the same environments used for the evolutions, in duplicate or triplicate.

Based on barcode lineage tracking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we decided to focus on adaptive clones isolated from three of the conditions, from each of which we were able to isolate more than 30 lineages with identifiable mutations from both haploid and diploid evolutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Similarly, in the fluconazole evolution (fluconazole), both the diploid and haploid populations showed rapid adaptation, though the most abundant lineages that took over the population did so more slowly than in the clotrimazole evolutions, suggesting that at these drug concentrations the selective pressure is stronger in clotrimazole. By contrast, the diploid population evolved in glycerol/ethanol evolved more slowly than those in the presence of azole drugs, with the most abundant lineage only exceeding 1% frequency by generation 160. Finally, in the haploid population evolved in glycerol/ethanol, we observed a single lineage grow to ~50% of the population by generation 150, though several lineages exceeded 1% in frequency. Similar to the diploid population evolving in glycerol/ethanol, these data suggest that adaptation to glycerol/ethanol (2% glycerol + 2% ethanol) is a relatively weak selection compared to evolution in the presence of an antifungal drug.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The beneficial mutational spectrum can be ploidy dependent</title><p>To determine the adaptive mutational spectra for each of the six focal populations (three environments and two ploidies per environment), we isolated clones from the timepoints indicated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and performed whole-genome sequencing and variant calling (see Methods); the types of mutational changes that occurred in diploids or haploids evolved in the same condition appeared similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).

For example, in clotrimazole, we observed only two adaptive gene targets, <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>PDR3</italic>, both of which acquired numerous missense mutations irrespective of ploidy, suggesting that these mutations are likely hypermorphic and either dominant or co-dominant. Both <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>PDR3</italic> are known targets for multidrug resistance and such resistance is typically acquired by single missense mutations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ksiezopolska et al., 2021</xref>). However, in fluconazole and glycerol/ethanol conditions, we observed adaptive targets common to both ploidies as well as numerous genes whose mutation was ploidy specific. For example, in glycerol/ethanol, genes in the Ras/cAMP pathway were targets in both haploids and diploids, such as <italic>IRA1</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic>, which are also known targets of adaptation in glucose limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venkataram et al., 2016</xref>), where they exert a substantial fraction of their fitness benefit during the respiration phase of the growth cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref>); by contrast, genes involved in heme biosynthesis (<italic>HEM2</italic>, <italic>HEM3</italic>) and sensing (<italic>HAP1</italic>) are adaptive targets only in diploids. These patterns reveal that although many gene targets are shared between haploid and diploid populations there are gene targets whose fitness effects differ by ploidy.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Haploid and diploid mutational spectra.</title><p>For each focal condition, the mutations are grouped by the ploidy they were identified in: blue (haploids), yellow (diploids).

One pool solely contained lineages that arose in <underline>d</underline>iploids (dBFA), the second pool solely contained lineages that arose in <underline>h</underline>aploids (hBFA), and the third pool contained a <underline>c</underline>ombination of both haploid and diploid evolved lineages (cBFA) that are also shared with dBFA and hBFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We measured, in triplicate for dBFA and cBFA, and duplicate for hBFA, the fitness of the lineages within each pool in the 12 environments listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, including in their original evolution condition. The fitnesses were estimated using the frequency trajectories of each barcoded lineage (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>) and fitnesses for each replicate of a pool correlate well with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). The lineages adapted to clotrimazole rapidly took over the BFA populations grown in the clotrimazole containing fitness remeasurement experiment such that it was not possible to obtain a reliable fitness estimate for lineages in the BFAs grown in clotrimazole. Nonetheless, lineages with different barcodes but with identical mutations have similar fitness estimates in each condition. For example, multiple lineages with distinct barcodes from the glycerol and ethanol condition that carry the same mutation, <italic>GPB2-Q602*</italic>, have very similar fitnesses across all of the test environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Thus, the fitness estimates are reproducible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Pleiotropy is common, strong, and variable</title><p>To characterize pleiotropy, we examined the fitness profiles for each lineage isolated from the three focal conditions: clotrimazole (2 mg/L), fluconazole (4 mg/L), and alternative carbon source of 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol. Analysis of the fitness data for the lineages isolated from these three conditions revealed several different modes of adaptation with a variety of pleiotropic effects. We examined these pleiotropic effects through pairwise comparisons between mutant lineages’ fitnesses in their home environment and their fitnesses in all non-home environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We find that a majority of lineages are not neutral in non-home environments when grown in the BFA, suggesting that pleiotropy is common. For example, for haploid lineages evolved in glycerol/ethanol, the vast majority of lineages have either a positive or negative fitness in at least one other environment in which their fitness was remeasured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Not only is pleiotropy common, but it is also strong. We defined pleiotropy as present when a mutation has some fitness effect (fitness ≠ 0) in non-home environments and absent when a mutation has no fitness effect (fitness = 0, within the bounds of measurement noise) in any non-home environments. In our BFAs, we observed lineages that have high fitnesses in both home and some non-home environments. For example, some diploid lineages evolved in glycerol/ethanol when remeasured in fluconazole had fitnesses comparable to diploid lineages evolved in fluconazole with the top 10% highest fitnesses in fluconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>). We also observed lineages that have high fitness in the home environment, with a deleterious fitness in one or more non-home environments. For example, haploid and diploid lineages adapted in glycerol/ethanol have a negative fitness in pH 7.3. The strength of the pleiotropic effects is environment-dependent and adaptive mutations can be beneficial, neutral, or deleterious in non-home environments.</p><p>Lastly, we also observed that pleiotropy can vary greatly. For some environments, we observed that all mutations that arose from the same evolution, regardless of gene, have similar patterns of pleiotropy. Such a pattern is observed in the diploid mutant lineages that arose in clotrimazole, which all had strong positive fitness effects in clotrimazole and fluconazole yet were mostly neutral/slightly deleterious in all other environments. However, we also observe instances in which mutations selected for in a given home environment, even in the same gene, do not have the same pleiotropic profiles. For example, in haploid populations evolved in fluconazole, mutations in <italic>CSG2</italic> have similar profiles except when remeasured in 37°C and glycerol/ethanol. <italic>CSG2-G258C</italic> is deleterious at 37°C, and has neutral fitness in glycerol/ethanol, while the other <italic>CSG2</italic> mutations, <italic>CSG2-E234D</italic> and <italic>CSG2-S28F</italic>, have neutral fitness at 37°C and positive fitness in glycerol/ethanol. We see similar fitness variability in the mutations observed in <italic>HAP1</italic> and <italic>SUR1</italic>. Overall, we observe that mutations in the same gene, that arose in the same evolution environment, tend to have more similar pleiotropic effects to one another than to mutations in different genes that also arose in the same environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). Pleiotropic effects are environment dependent – what is adaptive in one environment may be adaptive in some environments but also maladaptive in others.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Adaptation can be cost-free</title><p>While adaptation can lead to pleiotropic effects that are common, strong, and variable, such adaptation can even be cost-free, at least in the conditions in which we measured fitness. To further examine pleiotropy, we generated fitness profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) containing each lineage’s fitness estimate across environments. We observed that diploid lineages evolved in clotrimazole containing a <italic>PDR1</italic> mutation are highly fit (fitness &gt;0.2) in both the home environment and fluconazole, yet have a deleterious fitness (fitness &lt;–0.018) in pH 7.3. On the other hand, <italic>PDR3</italic> mutant lineages evolved in clotrimazole are also highly fit (fitness &gt;0.2) in both the home environment and fluconazole but instead are less deleterious in pH 7.3. There are two exceptions to the <italic>PDR1</italic> lineages, <italic>PDR1-L278V</italic> and <italic>PDR1-C862Y+</italic>, both of which are more like the <italic>PDR3</italic> mutant lineages in their fitnesses. Adaptive haploid lineages evolved in clotrimazole all show positive fitness in fluconazole, which is a very similar condition to clotrimazole. Many of these lineages also have mutations in <italic>PDR1</italic> and similarly show a trade-off in the pH 7.3 condition. Similar to the diploid evolutions, there are several haploid lineages with mutations in <italic>PDR3</italic> that show mild positive fitness in fluconazole yet near neutral fitness in all other environments, suggesting cost-free adaptation. However, not all lineages with <italic>PDR3</italic> mutations have such cost-free adaptation. Similarly, in the haploid lineages that evolved in fluconazole treatment, two <italic>CSG2</italic> mutations result in cost-free adaptation, with both <italic>CSG2-S26F</italic> and <italic>CSG2-E234D</italic> either being near neutral or conferring a small benefit in the non-home environments. Finally, we see a similar pattern with the <italic>HAP1-V1471</italic> insertion haploid mutant, which is fit in its home environment (fluconazole), almost equally as fit in glycerol/ethanol, and has either positive or near neutral fitness in all other environments. These examples reveal that cost-free adaptation across a range of substantially dissimilar environments is possible, at least across the conditions in which we remeasured fitness. It is of course possible that such mutations result in fitness costs in environments in which we did not remeasure fitness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Heatmaps representing pleiotropic profiles of adaptive mutant lineages from populations evolved in fluconazole.</title><p>Each heatmap shows the lineages evolved in a particular condition and their fitness remeasurements in a specific bulk fitness assay.

For example, haploid lineages adapted in glycerol/ethanol with mutations in <italic>IRA1</italic> show the same pattern of fitness effects across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, lineages with mutations in <italic>IRA1’s</italic> paralog, <italic>IRA2</italic>, show the same pattern of fitness effects. Both <italic>IRA1</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic> participate in the Ras pathway suggesting that this pattern may hold true for all genes that participate in this pathway. However, we instead see that lineages with mutations in <italic>GPB2</italic>, another gene in the Ras pathway, have a distinct pattern compared to the lineages with mutations in <italic>IRA1</italic> or <italic>IRA2</italic>, which was also seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinsler et al., 2020</xref>. This suggests that pleiotropic patterns can be gene specific. If lineages isolated from the same home environment have similar pleiotropic profiles, this might suggest that the selection pressure of the environment is the main driver leading to a specific profile. However, if all the adaptive lineages for a given environment do not have similar profiles, this would instead suggest that pleiotropy is influenced by other factors. Here, we see that even lineages adapted to the same home environment and with mutations in genes that participate in the same biological pathway (Ras pathway) can have different pleiotropic profiles, suggesting that the environment is not the main driving force of pleiotropy, but instead that pleiotropy varies according to target genes and not environment alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To characterize the various factors that influence pleiotropy, we evolved both diploid and haploid yeast populations in multiple different environments and then assayed the fitness of the adaptive lineages in up to 12 different environments. We characterized mutant lineages by their pleiotropic profiles – the vector of fitnesses from a broad range of non-home environments. Consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>), we observed variability in the pleiotropic effects that could be attributed to many factors, including the evolving ‘home’ environment, the strength of selection, ploidy, and even chance.</p><p>While work has been done to study the factors that influence pleiotropy, these studies have yet to investigate ploidy as a potential source of variation. We found that ploidy affects the genes in which mutations are selected during evolution, as seen in the different mutational spectra between haploid and diploid populations evolved in glycerol/ethanol and fluconazole (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We also see different trade-offs between haploid and diploid populations evolved in the same environment. For example, in glycerol/ethanol, the haploid adapted lineages have a trade-off at 37°C but the diploid adapted lineages do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5E, F</xref>). However, for clotrimazole treatment, this is not the case: we see the same genes targeted in both haploid and diploid populations evolved in clotrimazole, and we observe that ploidy does not necessarily affect pleiotropy. The mutation <italic>PDR1-Y864H,</italic> which arose in both haploid and diploid populations evolved in clotrimazole, showed similar pleiotropic profiles in both ploidies. The haploid and diploid lineages with <italic>PDR1-Y864H</italic> both show positive fitness in fluconazole and clotrimazole (if fitness is available) and negative or close to zero fitness in all other measured environments. However, the haploid lineage shows an observably more negative fitness in pH 7.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>).</p><p>We also identified several genes that were mutated only in diploid evolutions, such as those in <italic>HEM2</italic>, <italic>HEM3</italic>, and <italic>HAP1</italic>, which are not observed in haploids evolved in glycerol/ethanol. We hypothesize that such mutations may be recessively lethal and thus overdominant, such that the heterozygous mutant is more fit than either homozygote. Although additional experiments will be required to determine how often adaptive mutations arise in diploid populations result in overdominance, prior work suggests that it is a common outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sellis et al., 2016</xref>). Change in copy number and expression of <italic>HXT6/7</italic> is an adaptation observed in glucose limitation that was found to be overdominant. Other work reconstructed mutants to be heterozygous for different combinations of accumulated mutations and found such mutants to also be overdominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggeli et al., 2022</xref>). Our study highlights the importance of ploidy, the need to identify individual mutations, and how it is unclear what role ploidy plays in determining evolutionary outcomes and pleiotropic effects.</p><p>Our work also touches upon how similar evolutionary environments may result in different mutational targets and pleiotropic effects as seen in evolutions grown in clotrimazole and fluconazole. Both of these antifungal drugs are azoles that target the synthesis of ergosterol, a cholesterol-like component essential to cell membranes in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottom and McPhee, 2022</xref>). Despite their similar antifungal mechanisms of action, they vary in their strength of selection and adaptive mutational spectra. It is unknown whether different concentrations of each drug as a means of tuning selection strength will result in different mutational targets and pleiotropic profiles. This suggests that growing mutant lineages that arose in one drug concentration in a variety of different drug concentrations could be used to form a pleiotropic profile based solely on strength of selection. Such studies will provide insight to how strength of selection influences pleiotropy.</p><p>While our approach of combining experimental evolution and barcode lineage tracking is powerful, there are nonetheless several limitations to our study. The conducted evolutions were short, such that sufficient adaptive mutations were identified in only three of the environments (though this reduced the number of neutral hitchhiking mutations and thus it was easier to identify adaptive mutations). Longer evolutions would provide more adaptive mutations in more environments, though disentangling neutral hitchhiking mutations from adaptive driver mutations will be more difficult. Furthermore, the number of potential home environments is much larger than 12 (in theory infinite) and thus our study is limited by the number of environments in which we measured fitness. Tuning environments by concentration of drug or stepwise changes in pH or nutrient levels will likely provide higher resolution to how the strength of selection influences pleiotropy.</p><p>Empirical data capturing how different adaptive mutations alter fitness in conditions in which they were not selected will be valuable for predicting how populations evolve in changing environments. Such predictions may be important for understanding how populations may evolve in drug cycling regimes, or even how they may adapt to something as global as climate change. Our results suggest that pleiotropy is influenced not only by home environments, but also by several other factors such as ploidy, target genes, and other factors yet to be determined, possibly including strength of selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast barcode library construction</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>General approach</title><p>The DNA barcoding system developed in Levy et al. allows for the use of two distinct DNA barcodes – one in the landing pad itself, introduced via homologous recombination, and a second, which is introduced via a Cre-lox-mediated recombination.

Chimeric barcode pairs, which arise from sequencing or PCR issues, occur at a low rate in our reads.

We suspect these biases arise during PCR and are more pronounced in some timepoints due to slight differences in DNA extraction and PCR conditions. Thus, for barcodes with regions with very low GC-content, our frequency measurements are unreliable. We measured this bias by finding the minimum GC-content of a 26 bp sliding window measured across the barcode region, and we excluded barcodes from analysis that had a minimum value of less than 4 GC bases in a 26 bp region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref> shows these biases in sets of putatively neutral barcodes in each assay. For a small subset of timepoints, these biases are strong enough to affect a large number of barcodes.

We also excluded two timepoints with apparent library-prep cross contamination.

Briefly, we measured the slope of the natural log of frequency of each barcode at each pair of consecutive valid timepoints in the assay, divided by the number of generations between the two timepoints (valid timepoints are those in which the barcode has at least 10 reads). We use this generation-scaled fitness rather than per-cycle fitness (as used, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2018</xref>) to allow easy comparisons to results from previous microbial evolution experiments. We then scaled these fitness measurements at each pair of timepoints by subtracting the corresponding median measured log-frequency-slope of a set of putatively neutral barcodes. In the first two BFAs, we identified these putatively neutral barcodes after preliminary analyses showed that clones from one environment all had similar fitness and preliminary lineage tracking data showed that very little adaptation had occurred at the sampled timepoint. For hBFA, we used haploid clones from YPD as our putatively neutral class, and for cBFA we used diploid clones from clotrimazole. In dBFA, we included a set of clones isolated from timepoint 0 of the diploid YPD evolution as our putatively neutral class. Note that since we use the median log-frequency-slope, a small number of clones with non-neutral fitness will not affect this procedure. In assays performed in antifungal environments, we sometimes have cases where the putatively neutral barcodes go extinct early in the experiment. To obtain a measure of ancestral fitness in these cases, we iteratively merge the counts from pairs of putatively neutral barcodes together until we have at least three lineages with at least 10 reads at a pair of timepoints. We note that the absolute fitness values in these cases are likely to be noisy, but that the variation in fitness between antifungal-resistant and antifungal-sensitive lineages is easily captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We measured the fitness for a barcode and the standard error of that fitness for a single replicate by taking the mean and standard error, respectively, of these scaled fitness measurements at each pair of consecutive valid timepoints.

Thus, the non-coding variants were annotated as either the upstream or downstream of the nearest genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-7"><title>Filtering SNPs, small indels, and structural variants</title><p>First, mitochondrial variants were discarded. Second, any variants in genes <italic>FLO1</italic> and <italic>FLO9</italic> were filtered out due to poor alignment in both genomic regions. Third, diploids with an average coverage lower than 15 and haploids with an average coverage lower than 10 were discarded. Fourth, background variants were removed. If a variant is present in &gt;~12% of clones isolated from the same evolutionary condition, this variant was considered as a background variant and discarded. Fifth, variants with a quality score smaller than 150 were filtered out. Note that if a variant was present in multiple clones, the alignment of this variant was manually checked regardless of its quality score and a decision was made based on all clones carrying this variant. Thus, a variant with a quality score &lt;150 may not be filtered out if the same variant contained in other clones was proven to be authentic. Similarly, a variant with a quality score &gt;150 may be filtered out if the same variant was proven to be spurious in other clones.</p><p>Furthermore, all variants were further verified by manually checking the BAM files after alignment. By doing this, variants within repetitive regions and regions with a poor alignment were filtered out. More importantly, due to mishandling, sequencing data used here were contaminated by other yeast species/isolates at a low frequency (0–30%). While this low-frequency contamination did not pose a substantial problem for variant calling in haploids, it led to excessive miscalling of heterozygous variants in diploids. These miscalled heterozygous variants are caused by genetic variations between S288C (the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain used in this study) and the contaminating yeast source and often appear in a ‘patch’ (multiple variants within a small region, e.g. 4 variants within 100 bp), which is unlikely given the short-period evolutionary time. To remove false positive variants caused by this contamination, we manually checked alignments through BAM files and removed heterozygous variants appearing in such patches. In addition, the ratio of ref:alt was used to assist the removal of false variants. Variants with Ref:Alt &gt;3:1 are very likely to be a result of low-frequency contamination. Lastly, ambiguous variants were checked using blast. Variants that are not present in other yeast species/isolates were considered as de novo mutations arising during the course of evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-8"><title>Clone barcode extraction</title><p>To connect our mutation data to our BFA data, we identified the barcodes associated with each sequenced clone. We extracted barcode sequences from our whole-genome sequencing data using the same regular expressions as above. We then used a simplified version of the deletion-neighborhood clustering algorithm to match extracted barcodes to barcodes observed in our BFAs: we error-corrected an extracted barcode to a known barcode if they shared any single-base deletions (representing a single error in sequencing, for example). This resulted in a list of known barcodes and their read counts. For each barcode locus, we assigned a known barcode to a clone if it had at least 2 reads supporting it, and if that barcode had at least three times more reads supporting it compared to any other detected barcode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-9"><title>Identifying adaptive mutations</title><p>To classify which mutations observed in the whole-genome sequencing were adaptive, we first, for each condition, grouped the mutations by which genes they were found in. We then selected the genes that had acquired distinct mutations in more than one barcode lineage in that condition. We then selected genes in which the median fitness of the lineages carrying mutations on those genes in the original home condition was greater than 0. Next, we removed any genes that acquired mutations only in non-coding regions. Lastly, the list of genes was curated based on those genes’ interactions with other identified genes or pathways known to be involved in the adaptation of that specific condition from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venkataram et al., 2016</xref>). For example, genes involved in the Ras or TOR pathways, the HOG pathway, or known to be involved in drug resistance (for the two drug conditions) were identified as candidate beneficial mutations. A vast majority of the clones had only a single candidate beneficial mutation, though 4 of the ~200 adaptive lineages had two candidate beneficial mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Materials availability</title><p>Individual strains are available from the Sherlock lab upon request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing -

We believe the manuscript is improved as a result, and hope that the reviewers agree that it is now suitable for publication. Below with provide a point-by-point reply that explains what revisions we have made. Reviewers’ comments are italicized, while our responses are highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>It would be interesting have an idea of the global mutation rates and spectra in the diploid and haploid lineages across the conditions as well. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutational spectrum has been shown to be dependent on the environment and genetic background to an extent but not ploidy. Ploidies differ in terms of just the frequency. How similar/ dissimilar are the overall mutational spectra here? Were there any homozygous mutations in the diploids?</p></disp-quote><p>We have plotted the mutation types in the diploid and haploid lineages across the conditions to compare the frequencies of each type of mutation between ploidies, which is now presented as Appendix 1-figure 1. The mutation types between ploidies for each of the conditions look similar. Homozygous diploids are indicated in Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fitness gains and losses can happen without trade-offs if neutral home mutations are non-neutral in non-home conditions. Can the authors comment on that in this context. Physico-chemically, how different are the home/ non-home environments? How do the fitness effects correlate across the environments in the absence of these adaptive mutations? It would also be useful to know the extent of fitness variance of the populations in the home and away environments, this would aid the reader better grasp the significance of fitness gains/loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that trade-offs could occur as a result of mutations that are neutral in the home condition showing trade-offs in the non-home conditions. However, in the newly added Supplementary File 3, it is clear that most lineages have several passenger mutations, yet for lineages carrying the mutations in the same candidate beneficial mutation, they have largely similar pleiotropic profiles, suggesting that the influence of neutral mutations that arise in the home environment do not play a large role in determining fitness in other environments, at least for those tested. We have not generated strains that only contain the passenger mutations – while that would empirically test the fitness effects of the passenger mutations, it would be extremely time consuming to generate such strains, and the results would be unlikely to change our claims in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A summary table of the pleiotropic effects would be very useful as in Bakerlee et al. 2021.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a summary table (Supplementary File 4) of the pleiotropic effects as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>The major conclusion of the manuscript state that &quot;mutations in the same genes tend to produce similar pleiotropic effects&quot;, suggesting that a number of times this does not occur. For instance, the authors comment on the case of PDR3, which does not always produce 'cost-free' adaptation across environments. I believe that, to strengthen and better define their conclusion, the authors should develop a quantitative analysis of the reproducibility of pleiotropic profiles (that considers how many times genes have been found mutated). The heatmaps provided are compelling, but make it hard to generalize on how often, and to what extent, the gene mutated can predict pleiotropy across various environments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have calculated pairwise correlations between pleiotropic profiles for mutations that arose in the same environment either in the same gene, or in different genes, and added this Appendix 1-figure 8. These data show that by and large, correlations between mutations in the same gene are higher than those for different genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the concluding sentence of the discussion, it is unclear whether the authors are speculating about a role of the strength of selection in determining pleiotropy based on their results, or if that only represents a suggested hypothesis to test in future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the concluding sentence to clarify its meaning (it was a suggested hypothesis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The method used to identify putative adaptive mutations should be described in more detail. For instance, I seem to understand that only one mutation per lineage is considered 'adaptive'. However, many lineages seem to have more than one mutation. Based on what reported in the method section, the adaptive mutations have been hand-picked based on previous knowledge of selection in the environments of choice (&quot;the list of genes was curated based on those genes' interactions with other identified genes or pathways known to be involved in the adaptation of that specific condition from previous work&quot;). If this assumption is correct, the criteria for such a curation should be specified in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further clarified our criteria in the text; note, there was not a requirement for there to be only a single beneficial mutation per lineage, though very few lineages had two candidate beneficial mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term 'Pareto front' is technical and left undefined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the meaning of Pareto front.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section ' adaptation can be cost-free' only refer to figure 4, (with adaptive mutant lineages from populations evolved in fluconazole), while it comments extensively on mutation isolated in clotrimazole (reported in Sup. Fig10, not mentioned in the section).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting our oversight – we have also now referenced the supplementary figure too (now Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could clearly provide information on the zygosity of the evolved mutations, as the presence of mutations in homozygous or heterozygous states can impact the results of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added zygosity information to the genotypes in the text and in Table 2, Summary of Adaptive Mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do any of the evolved lineages have multiple adaptive mutations or other potentially adaptive mutations? If so, it would be great if the authors could provide a table listing these lineages and mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Supplementary file 1, which enumerates the adaptive and passenger mutations found in each lineage. Candidate adaptive mutations are in highlighted in red. Of the ~200 adaptive lineages, 4 have two candidate adaptive mutations, while the rest have only one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Pooling of the Isolated Clones section of the Methods, the ancestor and subject pools were mixed in different ratios for different types of pools. While not strictly necessary, it would be helpful to provide a brief explanation for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a brief explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conditions listed in Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 2 do not seem to match perfectly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected Supplemental Figure 2 (now Figure 2—figure supplement 1) such that it matches Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 6 demonstrates reproducible fitness estimates across lineages with the same mutations but distinct barcodes, supporting the authors' inference of adaptive mutations. However, it also appears to show no evidence of interactions among these mutations. Can the authors clarify if this is due to the absence of lineages with multiple mutations or if no observable interactions were found?</p></disp-quote><p>See response above – there are very few lineages with more than one candidate beneficial mutation. The remaining passenger mutations are thus likely neutral.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Pleiotropy is common, strong and variable section of the results, all three conditions were noted to have their evolved lineages tested in other conditions and presented in Supplementary Figure 5. However, due to the rapid dominance of lineages evolved in clotrimazole, there is no comparison data for them in Supplementary Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to generate robust fitness remeasurements in the clotrimazole condition, due to the rapid takeover by lineages that were evolved in that condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Results section on cost-free adaptation, it would be beneficial to include any compositional differences, such as pH, between the two drugs used that could have contributed to the fitness effects of the evolved lineages in pH 7.3.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any such differences – we did not pH any of the media other than the media with a specific pH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results – Adaptation can be cost-free: While the authors did state &quot;at least across the conditions in which we remeasured fitness&quot; at the end of the paragraph, it may be prudent to exercise caution when stating &quot;cost-free adaptation&quot; as only a few conditions were tested. For instance, an all-beneficial or all-deleterious result can sometimes be obtained solely based on the chosen conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional caution in the text based on the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Colormaps in Figure 4, Supplemental Figure 6, 10, and 11: The colors for values below -0.2 are uniform, whereas the heatmaps exhibit darker blues.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the color scales on Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures 6, 10, and 11 (now Appendix 1-figures 4, Figure4—figure supplement 1, and Appendix 1-figure 9) such that the scales are uniform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results – Pleiotropy varies according to the mutated gene: &quot;For example, haploid lineages adapted in glycerol/ethanol with mutations in IRA1 show the same pattern of fitness effects across conditions (Supplemental Figure 6).&quot; I believe the authors are referring to Supplemental Figure 11.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct – we have fixed this reference to what is now Appendix 1-figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the topic of IRA1, IRA2, and GPB2 in the section &quot;Pleiotropy varies according to mutated gene&quot; in the Results: Although IRA1 mutants exhibit highly similar patterns, it is challenging to ascertain which of the two genes, GPB2 or IRA2, has a more similar pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created a new supplemental figure showing the correlation between mutations in the same gene and mutations in different genes for lineages evolved in the same condition – see response to Reviewer #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results – Pleiotropy varies according to mutated gene: From &quot;If lineages isolated from the same home environment have similar pleiotropic profiles…&quot; to the end of that paragraph. While it is true that &quot;pleiotropy varies according to target genes and not environment alone,&quot; it may be premature to suggest that the environment is the &quot;main driving force&quot; of pleiotropy without some form of statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to suggest that environment is the main driving force – that section was somewhat poorly worded. We have modified the wording to make that clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion – line 5, paragraph 2: &quot;For example, in glycerol/ethanol, the haploid adapted lineages have a trade off at 37{degree sign}C but the diploid adapted lineages do not (Supplemental Figure 11).&quot; I believe the authors are referring to Supplemental Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this and have fixed the figure reference.</p></body></sub-article></article>
