way. Yet, in mammalian embryos, concentrations change rapidly compared to the time for making cell fate decisions. Here, we use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to address how changing morphogen levels influence differentiation, focusing on how BMP4 and Nodal signaling govern the cell-fate decisions associated with gastrulation. We show that BMP4 response is concentration dependent, but that expression of many Nodal targets depends on rate of concentration change. Moreover, in a self-organized stem cell model for human gastrulation, expression of these genes follows rapid changes in endogenous Nodal signaling. Our study shows a striking contrast between the specific ways ligand dynamics are interpreted by two closely related signaling pathways, highlighting both the subtlety and importance of morphogen dynamics for understanding mammalian embryogenesis and designing optimized protocols for directed stem cell differentiation.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

However, in the vertebrate embryo, expression patterns of these morphogens change rapidly, simultaneous with large-scale cell movements, and therefore individual cells experience substantial changes in morphogen levels during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Boxtel et al., 2015</xref>). Duration of ligand exposure must logically be a relevant parameter, as was confirmed in a number of contexts, including Activin/Nodal signaling in early Zebrafish development and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the mouse neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sako et al., 2016</xref>). However, duration is only one of a large number of features of a dynamic signal. It is unknown whether the precise time course of ligand exposure plays a role in cell fate decisions, and if so, whether different pathways interpret signaling histories differently. In analogy with human speech, which enables sophisticated communication by relying on temporal modulation of a single mode of signaling (sound), it is possible that complex information is encoded in developmental signals by temporal modulation to enable a range of different responses to a single pathway. In addition to ligand concentration and duration (‘integral’), cells may also be sensitive to ligand rates of change (‘derivative’), and it has been suggested that adaptive signaling pathways allow cells to perform this derivative computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yi et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>These concepts have begun to be explored in mammalian cell culture systems. For the Nκfb pathway, an intricate relation between ligand dynamics, signaling response and target gene activation was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kellogg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</xref>). Further demonstrating the importance of changing ligand concentrations, a class of ERK target genes was recently shown to be activated more efficiently by pulses than sustained signaling in 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>), and we have shown that the response to TGFβ in C2C12 mouse myoblasts reflects ligand rate of increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warmflash et al., 2012</xref>). However, these ideas have not been applied to mammalian development or differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, and their relevance to developmental patterning remains unexplored.</p><p>Gastrulation is the first differentiation event of the embryo proper, when the germ layers are formed and the body axes are established. Nodal and BMP4 are morphogens crucial for gastrulation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>). In the early mammalian embryo, BMP4 is required for both initiating gastrulation and specifying the dorsal-ventral axis, while Nodal maintains the pluripotent epiblast and is subsequently required for mesoderm and endoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conlon et al., 1994</xref>). Each pathway has distinct receptor complexes that phosphorylate specific signal transducers, known as receptor-Smads, which then complex with the shared cofactor Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus to activate target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zinski et al., 2018</xref>). Both Nodal and BMP4 have been claimed to act in a concentration-dependent manner based on classic Xenopus experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurdon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson et al., 1997</xref>). However, those experiments allow alternative interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heemskerk and Warmflash, 2016</xref>), and the role of BMP4 and Nodal ligand dynamics has not been investigated.</p><p>Micropatterned human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) self-organize into reproducible spatial domains corresponding to each of the germ layers and were recently established as a method to recapitulate human gastrulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). This system can be easily manipulated and observed. Further, in contrast to the micropatterned colonies, when hESCs are grown more sparsely, their response to exogenous signals is uniform and not dependent on secondary signals, allowing for dissection of the dynamics of response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nemashkalo et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the response of cells to dynamic signals can be systematically investigated in sparse culture, and this information can be used to unravel the complexity of self-organized pattern formation in micropatterned colonies. In this study, we take this approach and use hESCs to evaluate the role of changing concentrations of BMP4 and Activin/Nodal in cell-fate decisions associated with gastrulation. Unexpectedly, we find an important role for rapid concentration changes in Nodal pathway response, while the BMP pathway responds to concentration and duration of ligand exposure more directly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SMAD4 signaling response of hESCs to BMP4 is sustained but to Activin is adaptive</title><p>To investigate how sudden increases in BMP4 and Nodal levels are interpreted by hESCs, we performed live imaging of hESCs with GFP:SMAD4 in the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nemashkalo et al., 2017</xref>), and quantified signaling strength as the ratio of nuclear and cytoplasmic SMAD4 intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We found that a sudden increase in BMP4 leads to sustained SMAD4 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,d</xref>), consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nemashkalo et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the response to addition of Nodal and its substitute Activin is strongly adaptive, that is transient, and returns to a signaling baseline of around 20% of the response peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i, j</xref>), similar to the previously observed response to TGFβ in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warmflash et al., 2012</xref>). The response to recombinant Nodal was weak at all doses, likely reflecting the low quality of recombinant Nodal. To elicit a response in Nodal required 2 μg/ml of recombinant protein, whereas the response to Activin was saturated by 5 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i, j</xref>). However, when the responses to Nodal and Activin were normalized to their respective maxima, their dynamics were identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1j</xref>). Given our focus on the dynamics of signaling, the extremely similar dynamics in response to Nodal and Activin, and the impracticality of performing experiments with Nodal given the concentrations required, we used Activin in all further experiments. The peak and baseline signaling levels, but not the timescale of adaptation, depended on the Activin dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). For BMP4, there was a sharp response so that even low doses gave a nearly full initial response, however, the dose affected the duration of signaling in a way consistent with ligand depletion at low doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, Appendix 1). Immunofluorescence staining for receptor-Smads revealed that SMAD1/5/8 activation mirrors the SMAD4 response to BMP4, while in response to Activin, SMAD2/3 nuclear localization adapts less than SMAD4 to about 60% of peak response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,g,h</xref>). In each case, the response was due to the added ligand and not to induced secondary signaling through the other pathway, as addition of the BMP inhibitor Noggin had no effect on the dynamics in response to Activin, while addition of the Activin inhibitor SB431542 slightly increased the response to BMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>). Thus, endogenous BMP has no effect on the Nodal response, while Nodal signaling has a repressive effect on BMP. We note that some target genes may respond to SMAD2/3 without SMAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levy and Hill, 2005</xref>), and that since the dynamics of SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 are different, care is required in interpreting the dynamics of individual genes. Hereafter, when we refer to Nodal signaling as reflected by the SMAD4 reporter, we mean ‘SMAD4-dependent Nodal signaling’.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40526.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SMAD4 signaling response of hESCs to BMP4 is sustained while that to Activin is adaptive.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) BMP and Nodal pathways share the signal transducer Smad4.

A previous attempt to uncover relevant genes through a genome-wide siRNA screen uncovered a large number of potential regulators of signaling, but none of the knockdowns completely blocked adaptation, suggesting redundancy in adaptation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deglincerti et al., 2015</xref>). As an alternative approach, we used FRAP at different times after Activin treatment to better understand how cells modulate nuclear SMAD4 levels over the course of the signaling response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). In particular, we performed measurements before ligand treatment, after 1 hr of treatment when signaling peaks, and after 6 hr when signaling has adapted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In all cases, we observed recovery on a timescale of minutes following nuclear photobleaching, which confirmed that SMAD4 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm even in the absence of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We also observed a reduced recovery rate after 1 hr of Activin treatment, consistent with previous work on TGFβ signaling which suggested that nuclear accumulation of SMAD4 is caused by reduced nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicolás et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmierer and Hill, 2005</xref>). Importantly, however, we found that the recovery rate is not restored during adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), showing that cells do not revert to a pre-signaling state. This excludes upstream mechanisms of adaptation as might be caused by secretion of extracellular feedback inhibitors or depletion of receptors or R-Smads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vizán et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, mathematical modeling showed that if adaptation is caused by depletion of an upstream component such as receptors, then the magnitude of adaptation is governed by the ratio of the degradation rates of active and inactive receptors (Appendix 1). These degradation rates also control the timescales for adaptation and recovery so that strong adaptation necessitates a large difference in timescales. However, we do not see these different time scales in our pulse experiments below (see Figure 5), which show that the refractory period after ligand exposure is similar to the time scale of adaptation. In contrast, models with negative feedback causing inhibition of downstream signaling are capable of explaining all features of our data including the observed time scales (Appendix 1).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40526.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Adaptive Activin response is not a return to the pre-stimulus state and is explained by a model that includes sequestered SMAD4 populations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photobleaching and recovery of nuclear Smad4 at 2 hr after Activin treatment.

In this case, bleaching reduces the total pool of observable GFP-SMAD4 molecules but the nuclear to cytoplasmic intensity ratio depends only on the kinetic constants, and therefore would recover to the same value following bleaching. However, we observed that this ratio systematically decreases after nuclear bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). This suggests a more general model that includes sequestered SMAD4, which may move within but not between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Because production and degradation are slow compared to shuttling, recovery from bleaching comes only from redistribution of unbleached molecules. The nuclear sequestered population is not exported to the cytoplasm, while the cytoplasmic sequestered population is unavailable to enter the nucleus and replenish the population of unbleached molecules there, leading to a reduced nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio after equilibration of the free dark and fluorescent molecules through exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h</xref>, Appendix 1). The parameters obtained from fitting this model to our data suggest that initial accumulation of SMAD4 in the nucleus reflects both a lower export rate and a reduction in cytoplasmic sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,j</xref>). Adaptation, however, does not result from altering shuttling kinetics, but instead reflects reduced nuclear sequestration and increased cytoplasmic sequestration. Thus, taken together, our FRAP data and mathematical modeling suggest a mechanism of adaptation that relies on negative feedback and acts by modulating sequestration rather than nuclear exchange rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptional dynamics of differentiation targets follows SMAD4 dynamics</title><p>Next, we evaluated transcriptional dynamics downstream of BMP4 and Activin using qPCR, which showed that BMP targets are stably induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), while differentiation targets of Nodal show adaptive transcription on a timescale consistent with SMAD4 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Nodal signaling is required for the formation of mesoderm and endoderm within these colonies, and both small molecule inhibition and genetic knockout of Nodal drastically reduce mesendoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chhabra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Warmflash et al., 2014</xref>). For the dynamics described here to be relevant, Nodal signaling should evolve rapidly compared to the timescale for adaptation, and we should observe rapidly changing signaling patterns with the GFP:SMAD4 reporter. In contrast, if cells read a stable gradient of Nodal protein during patterning, as posited by classic models, we would expect correspondingly stable patterns in signaling and the adaptive dynamics would not be relevant.</p><p>To distinguish these hypotheses, we used live imaging to observe SMAD4 signaling in micropatterned colonies during the 42 hr in which these patterns form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>a-c). The cells initially respond uniformly to the BMP4 treatment. The response then is restricted to the colony edge by approximately 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>), and this pattern is maintained until approximately 25 hr. Beginning at 25 hr, a wave of increased nuclear SMAD4 spreads inward again from the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,c</xref>). SMAD4 convolves the BMP and Nodal responses, and we hypothesized that the stable response at the edge of the colony represents BMP signaling while the inward moving wave results from Nodal signaling. To test this, we looked at the pathway specific SMAD1 and SMAD2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>d-g). These confirmed that the BMP-specific active SMAD1 signaling remains restricted to the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), while the Nodal transducer SMAD2/3 activity spreads rapidly inward from the colony edge between 24 and 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>e). The SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 signal transducers reveal a rapidly evolving Nodal distribution with a wavefront that moves through the colony at approximately one-cell diameter (10 μm) per hour. The velocity of the Nodal wavefront suggests that individual cells see Nodal levels increase rapidly in 1 hr, consistent with the time scale of ligand increase required for strong response to exogenous ligand in the previous experiments. Importantly, this wave of signaling activates Bra expression in its wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>).

Adaptive signaling could serve to restrict the response to a narrow competence window or to separate the multiple roles of a single morphogen by using distinct dynamics to selectively activate different target genes, effectively expanding the information content of the morphogen gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</xref>). It is currently unclear whether adaptive signaling is an intrinsic feature of the Activin/Nodal pathway or is context dependent. A recent study found that Activin target genes are induced more stably when cells are also treated with Wnt, but that the dynamics of Smad2 translocation were not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoney et al., 2018</xref>). For Wnt, costimulation with Activin or BMP switches the dynamics of Wnt signaling from transient to sustained, and it will be interesting to determine whether Activin/Nodal signaling is sustained in some contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Massey et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Activin and Nodal are generally thought of as text-book morphogens acting in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert, 2014</xref>). This is based on experiments in which an artificial gradient is created by placing an Activin-soaked bead in an intact animal cap or in which dissociated Xenopus animal cap cells are exposed to a range of Activin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurdon et al., 1994</xref>). It is important to note that these experiments are not inconsistent with our findings. In both cases, the highest concentration corresponds to the highest rate of concentration increase, and our results also show the peak of the transient signaling response induced by a step increase is dose-dependent. This fact could underlie the differences in cell fates observed in dissociated animal cap cells.</p><p>Our results are in contrast to those for another well-characterized system, the patterning of the neural tube by Shh, which has also been shown to be adaptive and regulates cell fate decisions through a described gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>). In that case, adaptation depends on upstream inhibition and results in a relatively constant integrated signaling output in which time and duration can be interchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>). This interchangeability between concentration and duration can be achieved by upstream feedback such as degradation of activated receptors. Intuitively, increasing ligand concentration increases the response but also leads to more rapid degradation of receptors limiting the response in time.</p><p>Several lines of reasoning argue that adaptation in Activin/Nodal signaling follows a different mechanism, with consequences for cell fate. The signaling behavior of our system is qualitatively different, as there is no tradeoff between concentration and duration of strong signaling. Longer exposure to ligand does not increase the duration of signaling because the system has already adapted, and reactivating the pathway can only be achieved by pulsing rather than extending the duration of ligand exposure. Interestingly, there is a low level of baseline signaling following adaptation which is maintained by continued ligand exposure. Given the distinct classes of target genes we found responding to each aspect of the signal (baseline and adaptive pulse), this may demonstrate the principle that dynamic signals relay more information through a single pathway, with one set of target genes responding to signal duration, and another to rapid signal increase.</p><p>In addition to the qualitative behavior being inconsistent with a system that integrates signal, like the neural tube, our quantitative data and mathematical modeling rule out the mechanism that would most naturally implement such a behavior, namely adaptation through degradation. First, our FRAP measurements show that the adapted state is kinetically distinct from the pre-signaling state, while the degradation model would predict a return to the same state. Second, we show analytically in Appendix 1 that a model based on upstream feedback cannot account for our dynamic measurements because in order to adapt through receptor degradation, the timescale for recovery must be slower than that for adaptation, which is not what we find in our pulsing experiments. It will be interesting to elucidate the genetic network that interprets adaptive Nodal signaling and to compare it with the one that interprets Shh.</p><p>Our conclusions regarding signaling dynamics rely on nuclear localization of Smads as a proxy for signaling activity. The validity of this measure is supported by strong correlation between SMAD2 nuclear localization and pSMAD2 levels, as well as the fact that transcriptional activity of a number of direct targets mirrors nuclear SMAD4 both in this paper and in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warmflash et al., 2012</xref>). Although some target genes do not follow this time course, it is important to note that target gene dynamics represent those of signaling filtered through a specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>). For example, a promoter with high affinity for the signal transducer will saturate at low levels and will not reflect fluctuations in signaling that remain above these levels. Although it was shown that blocking nuclear export of Smad4 does not interfere with function of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biondi et al., 2007</xref>), this does not invalidate our conclusions, as blocking nuclear export of Smad4 destroys the strong correlation between pathway activity and nuclear localization by artificially keeping Smad4 in the nucleus following the termination of transcription.</p><p>Although relatively unexplored in the context of development, adaptive signaling is a common feature of biological systems. Well-studied examples in bacteria include the chemotactic response where adaptive signaling allows cells to sense the rate of change and move to areas of higher nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Block et al., 1983</xref>), and the σ<sub>b</sub> response where it allows cells to sense the rate of increase of environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Young et al., 2013</xref>). In mammalian cells, stimulation with TNFα leads to a transient pulse of NFκB signaling, followed by a low, sustained baseline, and this has been suggested to allow specificity in target gene activation with different targets responding to different features of the dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, DNA damage has been shown to give rise to stereotyped pulses of p53 signaling due to negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lahav et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It will be important to understand how our results fit with current protocols for directed stem cell differentiation which typically perform a single media change per day and therefore do not take advantage of potential enhancements resulting from optimizing ligand dynamics. Routinely, ranges of ligand concentration are explored to optimize differentiation protocols. Our results suggest a different approach that starts with characterizing the signaling dynamics during each cell fate decision and then optimizing the relevant dynamics of ligand presentation. As such, we believe the results presented here will serve as a basis for a dynamic understanding of embryonic patterning and stem cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ESI017</td><td valign="top">ESIBIO</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_B85">CVCL_B85</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RUES2</td><td valign="top">Ali Brivanlou (Rockefeller)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_B810">CVCL_B810</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat polyclonal anti-Brachyury</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2200235">AB_2200235</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal anti-Sox2</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technologies</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1904142">AB_1904142</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-Nanog</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1645598">AB_1645598</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-Smad2/3</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_398162">AB_398162</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal anti-pSmad1</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technologies</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2493181">AB_2493181</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Image processing and data analysis code</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/idse/stemcells/">https://github.com/idse/stemcells/</ext-link> commit a5ee164</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>The cell lines used were ESI017 and RUES2 GFP:Smad4 RFP:H2B.

section we extend the purely kinematic model of the previous section to a dynamic model; that is, we explore the predictions of different models for the mechanism of adaptation. In the section titled 'Receptor degradation cannot explain Activin/Nodal signaling dynamics', we show that models where adaptive signaling is caused by depletion of upstream pathway components are not only inconsistent with our FRAP measurements, as noted in the main text, but are also inconsistent with the approximately equal timescales of adaptation and recovery that we observed in our pulse experiments. In contrast, we show in the section titled 'Feedback and feed-forward models are consistent with observed Activin/Nodal signaling dynamics', that either negative feedback or incoherent feed-forward models can account for all observed features of the signaling response. Finally, we show in the section titled 'Ligand degradation is sufficient to explain BMP dose response', that the BMP4 signaling response can be accounted for by ligand degradation.</p><sec id="s7-2-1"><title>Minimal model</title><p>We consider models for signaling in which a signal transducer can be localized to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm.

Previous work by Warmflash and colleagues in cultured C2C12 cells suggested that TGFβ signaling is transient (i.e., cells respond to TGFβ ligands only for several hours) and adaptive (i.e., cells do not sense the absolute concentration of TGFβ ligands but rather they sense the rate of change, with large and sudden changes in TGFβ concentrations leading to the strongest responses) (Warmflash et al., 2012 and Sorre et al., 2014). However, whether C2C12 cells are a physiological model is questionable. In recent work with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) it seems that a closely related signaling pathway, BMP, shows quite different dynamics: BMP4 treatment of hESCs leads to sustained (not transient) BMP signaling for many hours (Nemashkalo et al., 2017).</p><p>In the present submission, Heemskerk et al. perform a side-by-side comparison of the temporal dynamics of TGFβ and BMP signaling in hESCs. Monitoring nuclear translocation of SMAD4 by live imaging, they confirm that BMP4 treatment leads to sustained SMAD4 nuclear translocation in hESCs (thus reproducing their prior results reported in Nemashkalo et al., 2017) whereas ACTIVIN treatment leads to transient SMAD4 nuclear localization (Figure 1B-D). Indeed, many BMP target genes show sustained upregulation in response to BMP4, whereas TGFβ target genes show a mixed pattern of either transient or sustained upregulation in response to ACTIVIN (Figure 2). Using sophisticated microfluidic methods to control the rate of ligand delivery, they suggest that TGFβ (but not BMP) signaling relies on the change of ligand concentration (i.e., its time-derivative but necessarily the absolute concentration; Figure 3) and further that there is a traveling wave of TGFβ activity in BMP4-treated hESC colonies of defined sizes (Figure 4). By virtue of the transient and adaptive nature of TGFβ signaling, the authors conclude by suggesting that temporal pulses of ACTIVIN treatment might be best to efficiently upregulate BRACHYURY (Figure 4D).</p><p>Overall, the suggestion that TGFβ and BMP signaling kinetics (on the scale of hours) could be quite different is intriguing. The Discussion is excellently written, and appropriately emphasizes that a mechanistic understanding of the kinetics with which these pathways signal could greatly enrich both stem cell and developmental biology.</p><p>Major critiques:</p><p>1) SMAD4. The authors measure the activity of the TGFβ as well as BMP pathways by principally assessing a single metric: SMAD4 nuclear localization. However it is controversial whether SMAD4 localization as a single metric can accurately describe the total levels of TGFβ and BMP pathway activity. There are some reports that only a subset of TGFβ target genes require SMAD4 (e.g., Levy and Hill, 2005). If there is SMAD4-independent TGFβ signaling, it is therefore plausible that certain TGFβ target genes could still be transcribed (i.e., the TGFβ pathway is activated) in the window of time when SMAD4 is not in the nucleus (i.e., in the &quot;adaptation&quot; phase that the authors identify). If so, SMAD4 nuclear localization might only partially readout TGFβ signaling, which could therefore complicate the interpretation of the authors' data. Indeed, the authors show that upon ACTIVIN exposure for 5 hours (a timepoint by which SMAD4 has largely vacated the nucleus; Figure 1D), a number of TGFβ target genes (LEFTY1, NODAL, CER1 and WNT3) still continue to be transcribed (Figure 2D), indicating the possibility that SMAD4 nuclear localization does not completely reflect the degree/extent of TGFβ signaling. Could the authors perform luciferase reporter assays of ACTIVIN-treated hESCs to examine whether TGFβ transcriptional responses are truly transient? It would be preferable for the authors to perform live imaging of endogenously-expressed, labeled SMAD2/3 or SMAD1/5/8 proteins to examine their subcellular localization upon ACTIVIN or BMP treatment, respectively, but this is unreasonable to ask the authors to conduct in a short span of time. Barring those experiments, the authors might want to confine their conclusions to refer to &quot;SMAD4-dependent TGFβ and BMP signaling&quot; as opposed to &quot;TGFβ and BMP signaling&quot;. For instance, would it be more accurate to specifically say that SMAD4-dependent TGFβ signaling (as opposed to TGFβ signaling altogether) is transient and adaptive?</p><p>2) SMAD4 signal-to-noise ratio. Their live imaging data suggests that upon ligand stimulation, the increase in nuclear SMAD4 is modest (2-fold or less; Figure 1D). This is rather surprising, because one might anticipate a massive change in SMAD4 levels is needed to drive large transcriptional changes. The modest SMAD4 signal-to-noise ratio also raises questions about the authors' subsequent and quite detailed analysis of temporal dynamics, adaptation and so on. Why is the signal-to-noise ratio so modest? One possibility is that there are high nuclear SMAD4 levels in the steady-state (i.e., there is high SMAD4 background), perhaps because the authors' hESCs are grown in mTeSR1 (Materials and methods), which contains 2 ng/mL of TGFβ1 (Ludwig et al., 2006; Nature Cell Biology), and would be expected to lead to some level of basal nuclear SMAD4. What if the authors transiently pulsed their hESCs with a TGFβ inhibitor before performing the various ACTIVIN and BMP stimulations, would this reduce their background and thus enhance the signal-to-noise ratio?</p><p>Minor critiques:</p><p>1) Figure 1H-J should be more clearly labeled and explained.</p><p>2) &quot;Error bars&quot; erroneously merged into 1 word (Figure Legends).</p><p>3) Data in the Nemashkalo et al., 2017, paper (by the same authors) seems to already suggest that BMP4 leads to sustained SMAD4 signaling, therefore it seems appropriate for Heemskerk et al. to cite this earlier work, as their Figure 1 seems to be confirming-and extending beyond-this earlier paper.</p><p>4) There seem to be some strange artifacts in certain subpanels. For instance why does the orange line in Figure 3B (reflecting nuclear SMAD4 localization after sudden exposure to high BMP) jitter at regular intervals? It makes sense that the blue lines in Figure 3B,E would jitter (as they might correlate with each step of the ligand concentration increase) but not the orange line in Figure 3B.</p><p>5) Similarly, in Figure 4B (red line: pulses), there seem to be discontinuous spikes in SMAD4 whenever the media is changed.</p><p>6) The authors conclude that BMP4 induces sustained, whereas ACTIVIN induces transient, SMAD4 signaling, yet in Figure 4 they suggest that BMP4 might induce endogenous TGFβ signaling. One alternate interpretation of the authors' data is that maybe BMP4 itself induces a transient SMAD4 response, but that by secondarily inducing TGFβ signaling, this latter wave of TGFβ might lead to sustained SMAD4.</p><p>7) Another oddity is in Figure 3C. If hESCs sense the absolute concentration of BMP4 ligand, one would expect that at low levels of BMP, they would respond weakly and at higher levels of BMP, they would respond strongly. Yet in Figure 3C, at the 2-3 hr timepoint, the &quot;ramp&quot; cells (blue line, exposed to low BMP4 at that point in time) express HAND1 mRNA almost as highly as the &quot;step&quot; cells (orange line, exposed to high BMP4 at that point in time). The only other interpretation I can think of is that maybe the low BMP4 levels in the blue line (at 2-3 hrs) are super-threshold already.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Heemskerk et al. provide evidence for adaptive responses of the TGF-β pathway to Nodal/Activin morphogens. The authors elegantly measured dynamics of an endogenously tagged Smad4 fluorescent reporter that transduces both BMP and Nodal/Activin input signals, and demonstrate that at sparse densities hESCs can sense the rate of change of ligand concentration. Using mathematical models and experimental measurements of endogenously tagged Smad4, they rule out some mechanisms of pathway adaptation, and propose that Nodal/Activin adaptation occurs through reduced nuclear sequestration and/or increased cytoplasmic sequestration. Under sparse growth conditions, they also find that endogenous target genes can selectively respond to pulsatile and sustained modes of Smad4 activation resulting from Activin and BMP inputs, respectively. The authors suggest that sensing the rate of change of ligand concentration, demonstrated in sparse cultures, could be used by the mammalian embryo during mesodermal patterning, and use an in vitro model of human gastrulation to test this hypothesis. In this system, they correlate a moving front of Smad4 nuclear localization with the timing and spatial position of Brachyury expression, a transcription factor involved in mesodermal differentiation.</p><p>Overall, this study brings a quantitative perspective to a central developmental pathway, and should help to further strengthen a growing sense that dynamics are critically important in the behavior of many developmental signaling pathways. It suggests that controlling ligand dynamics could facilitate directed differentiation protocols. It should therefore be of broad interest, and we support publication.</p><p>Below, we describe several issues that could be addressed to strengthen the work in a revised manuscript:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Figures 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F together show that BMP4 triggers a more stable nuclear localization of BMP-responsive Smad1, while activin results in adaptive nuclear localization of Nodal-responsive Smad2/3. However, the cross-pathway dynamics are unclear. Does BMP4 affect Smad2/3 and does Activin/Nodal affect Smad1, and if so, with what dynamics? This control is important to support the authors claim that the difference in dynamics results from distinct pathway-specific transducers.</p><p>Figure 2, B and D, present gene sets that show qualitatively different dynamic response to Activin. The authors suggest the interesting possibility that these sets have different sensitivities to Smad4. However, an alternative explanation could be a difference in RNA half-lives, with the monotonic responses in Figure 2D resulting from stable mRNAs that accumulate over time, effectively integrating the response. Is it possible to discriminate between these explanations (e.g. by examining nascent or intronic RNA), or at least discuss these two possibilities?</p><p>Figure 3 presents an elegant comparison between ramps (staircases) and steps of BMP and Activin. The results are striking. However, two issues complicate interpretation. First, the ramp and step differ in total integrated signaling over time, making it difficult, from this single experiment, to disentangle the roles of ligand concentration and dynamics. The simplest way to address this might be to also include a step of half the amplitude, or to do a ramp at double the slope. Second, based on Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C, which shows dose-dependent responses to BMP concentration, we would expect the ramp response in Figure 3B to depend on ligand dose and therefore to grow slowly over time. Why does it step up so rapidly?</p><p>In Figure 3, rate responsive behavior is demonstrated by comparing a step to a ramp. Does the Nodal pathway act as a quantitative sensor of the rate of increase of Activin, or does it exhibit some kind of rate threshold? This could be answered by showing how response depends quantitatively on the ramp slope. A mathematical model of the adaptation process could help to provide insight into the expected behavior here.</p><p>Rate-responsiveness in other systems. Work in bacteria (Young et al., 2013) showed similar rate-responsive behavior in the sigB stress response system, where two kinds of stresses activate sigB in different ways, with one input showing rate-responsive behavior, assayed by temporal &quot;ramps&quot; of different slopes. In that system the mechanism of rate responsiveness has been determined. It would be interesting to discuss the similarity (and differences) in signal processing behaviors between these very different biological systems.</p><p>In Figure 4, the authors suggest that during development the moving Smad4 signaling front is responsible for the activation of Brachyury expression. Although strong evidence for adaptative and rate sensing responses to Nodal/ActivinA ligands is provided for sparse hESCs cultures, the micropattern experiment cannot distinguish between a rate sensing mechanism and a pure concentration sensing mechanism. Even though Brachyury responds with higher expression to Activin pulses in sparse hESC cultures, these two experimental conditions differ in both the time scales and the number of pulses cells could perceive (i.e. in sparse culture cells are exposed to multiple Activin pulses separated by ~4.5 hours, whereas in micropattern the data is consistent with only one wave of pSmad2/3, one wave of pSmad1 and one front of Smad4 moving at 1 cell diameter (10µm) per hour, and traveling at least 150 µm to fully cover the spatial domain of brachyury expression. Since no data on dynamics of endogenous Nodal expression is provided, it remains unknown if, over time, ligand concentration is locally increasing (or oscillating) on a timescale relevant to Brachyury induction. As result, in the micropattern, in which responses to BMP and endogenous Nodal co-occur, it is unclear if cells are sensing absolute ligand concentration and/or a rapid increase in ligand concentration. Experimentally determining Nodal dynamics in micropatterns remains difficult, and perturbing its dynamics would require significant cell line engineering. Thus, an alternative avenue to support the claim that in the gastrulating human embryo expression of fate determinants results from rate sensing of ligand increments could be to computationally compare whether patterning triggered by adaptation to Nodal achieved by rate sensing rate qualitatively or quantitatively differs from patterning the mesoderm through sensing absolute ligand concentrations. What new or different emergent properties result from sensing rates as opposed to just concentrations?</p><p>Relation to other dynamic encoding systems: This study provides an important advance in understanding the role of dynamics in core mammalian signaling systems. But the relationship to other work on dynamic signal encoding in signaling pathways, as reviewed for example in Purvis and Lahav (2013), Behar and Hoffmann (2010), etc. is minimal. Specifically, it would be useful to know which aspects of the Nodal system in hES resemble or differ from phenomena observed in other pathways or other cell types. For example, different target programs are activated by sustained vs pulsatile activation of p53 and Notch, among other pathways. Also, a recent report (Frick et al., 2017 PNAS) studied the response of C2C12 cells to TGFb ligands, which belong to the Activin/Nodal family and are also transduced by Smads2/3, and showed that the pathway senses fold changes. How does this fold change detection relate to the adaptive rate-responsive behavior observed here? Discussion of these issues would help to connect this study to the broader literature and unify results from multiple studies.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>In Figure 2, please include the base of the log on the y axis: is it 2, e, or something else?</p><p>In Figure 1E there is an orange line near the y-axis. It remains unclear if this line represents the fact that after photobleaching Smad4 fluorescence does not recover to the original amplitude.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Idse et al. includes fantastic work by the authors to explore fundamental properties of mammalian signaling in an interesting developmental context using an innovative experimental system.</p><p>I am very happy to participate in this &quot;peer-review trial in which the authors decide how to respond to the peer-review comments.&quot; and to learn that &quot;the article will almost certainly be published&quot;.</p><p>I do not have any additional experiment to suggest, the authors did a good job providing the adequate controls and I have little doubt in the correctness of the results they present.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest suggestion I can make with regards to the work is that it is a bit too dense and hard to grasp. Overall the work follows three parts: 1) An analysis of mechanism for adaptation using innovative combination of FRAP and parameter identification of ODE model. 2) analysis of gene expression dynamics response to dynamic SMAD4, and 3) implication of the differences in response dynamics on overall self-organization patterns in the in-vitro gastrulation model. I will refer to these as parts 1-3 below for brevity.</p><p>I am not sure why the authors restricted themselves to only four figures, although I can make an educated guess;). To make the paper easier to follow I strongly recommend to take advantage of <italic>eLife</italic> lack of restriction on length and number of figures and use the space to elaborate much more about the work.</p><p>In part 1 the author only use two paragraphs on main text to explain a lot of stuff. To understand the adaptation and the FRAP experiments one has to think about two different math models that use a parameter fitting procedure to identify underlying mechanisms. The material is mostly in the supp text, but supp text should not replace main text rather provide more details for completeness. I recommend to move some of the material from supp mat to the main text, explain the FRAP procedure, show the alternative fits for different parameters etc. This part can easily take 2-3 figures.</p><p>Similarly, part II seemed rushed. The authors show how some genes follow SMAD4 dynamics and some do not. But the sparse text doesn't allow them to go into details, what is different about these genes? Is it RNA halflife? Even without additional experiments, few simple models would be very helpful to understand Figure 2A-D. I am not sure I got the point of panels 2EF, so either explain that in more details or remove those. The different gene expression response to different stimuli regimes (Figure 3) is very nice with its demonstration of the role of SMAD4 dynamics.</p><p>Finally, the last part is very short and descriptive, The author measure different SMADs over space and time, show that there are different responses and that these change gene expression. I was left a bit confused as to why these differences arise? What aspect of self-organization is in play to cause these patterns. The fact that all these results are described in a single paragraphs of 322 words might be part of the problem.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) The use of SMAD4 signaling in figure titles should be replaced with y-axis label saying SMAD4_{nuc}</p><p>2) The cartoon in Figure 2I is confusing, why don't all the no sequestered dots recover?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40526.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, the suggestion that TGFβ and BMP signaling kinetics (on the scale of hours) could be quite different is intriguing.

We have attempted to perform luciferase assays using two different TGFb responsive promoters described in the literature (3TP and CAGA), however, neither showed a strong response to Activin treatment in hESCs, indicating that there are likely cell-type specific cofactors necessary for these promoters. In agreement with this, we found by qPCR that the PAI1 gene, from which the 3TP promoter was derived, is also not induced by Activin treatment in hESCs. We agree with the reviewer that this is an important issue. We believe there are two possible, not mutually exclusive, interpretations of the gene expression data. (1) Most transcription is Smad4 dependent but low levels of Smad4 are sufficient for some genes. These genes are maintained by the baseline in Smad4 following adaptation and yield sustained transcription. (2) Only a subset of genes are Smad4 dependent, while others can be induced by Smad2 alone. Since Smad2 is more sustained, these genes are sustained. Of course, one of the explanations may be true for some genes and the other for other genes. We attempted to distinguish between these possibilities by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out Smad4 but we found that we were unable to maintain pluripotent Smad4-KO cells. We believe that the dataset presented accurately captures the fact that there are multiple different kinetic behaviors of downstream target genes. We have expanded our discussion to better reflect the different possible explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be preferable for the authors to perform live imaging of endogenously-expressed, labeled SMAD2/3 or SMAD1/5/8 proteins to examine their subcellular localization upon ACTIVIN or BMP treatment, respectively, but this is unreasonable to ask the authors to conduct in a short span of time.

As suggested, we also now explicitly clarify at the beginning of the results that we are referring to SMAD4-dependent TGFb and BMP signaling, but as this language is cumbersome, we use the shorthand “TGFb and BMP signaling” throughout. Finally, we believe that the discussion we incorporated on the dynamics of Smad2 vs Smad4 (see previous answer) also highlights this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) SMAD4 signal-to-noise ratio. Their live imaging data suggests that upon ligand stimulation, the increase in nuclear SMAD4 is modest (2-fold or less; Figure 1D). This is rather surprising, because one might anticipate a massive change in SMAD4 levels is needed to drive large transcriptional changes. The modest SMAD4 signal-to-noise ratio also raises questions about the authors' subsequent and quite detailed analysis of temporal dynamics, adaptation and so on. Why is the signal-to-noise ratio so modest? One possibility is that there are high nuclear SMAD4 levels in the steady-state (i.e., there is high SMAD4 background), perhaps because the authors' hESCs are grown in mTeSR1 (Materials and methods), which contains 2 ng/mL of TGFβ1 (Ludwig et al., 2006; Nature Cell Biology), and would be expected to lead to some level of basal nuclear SMAD4. What if the authors transiently pulsed their hESCs with a TGFβ inhibitor before performing the various ACTIVIN and BMP stimulations, would this reduce their background and thus enhance the signal-to-noise ratio?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the measured changes in Smad4 are likely smaller than the increase in the active Smad complexes which mediate transcription. Background stimulation from the TGFb1 in mTeSR1 does not explain the small change as adding the Activin inhibitor reduced the baseline Smad2 levels but not those of Smad4. This can be seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, where the data are scaled so that the levels with SB are 1. The higher levels of SMAD2 compared to SMAD4 prior to Activin treatment show that SB reduces these baseline levels. We believe that the relatively small increase in nuclear Smad4 results from the fact that Smads are present in the nucleus even in the absence of stimulation, as under all conditions Smads shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. So that even when the pathway is inactive, there is some Smad in the nucleus (see Schmierer, 2005). Also, background fluorescence which is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm will tend to bring the ratios closer to 1 both before and after stimulation, resulting in reduced fold changes. In any event, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio will be a monotonically increasing function of the total Smad4 in the nucleus, and so is a suitable reporter for Smad levels. We chose to use this ratio instead of absolute levels as it tends to remove noise associated with variations in Smad expression, cell size, and imaging artifacts, and we have found empirically that it is a more reliable and reproducible metric for signaling. We point out that the peak to baseline signaling ratio is not the same thing as signal to noise, which would be either of those levels relative to the standard deviation around that level. The significance of the difference between the two signaling states would be best captured by a statistical test such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the differences before and after stimulation are highly significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor critiques:</p><p>1) Figure 1H-J should be more clearly labeled and explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially expanded the discussion of the FRAP experiments and split these off into a separate figure in order to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;Error bars&quot; erroneously merged into 1 word (Figure Legends).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data in the Nemashkalo et al., 2017, paper (by the same authors) seems to already suggest that BMP4 leads to sustained SMAD4 signaling, therefore it seems appropriate for Heemskerk et al. to cite this earlier work, as their Figure 1 seems to be confirming-and extending beyond-this earlier paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There seem to be some strange artifacts in certain subpanels.

This slower ramp does show a slightly slower increase, particularly in the SMAD4 signaling. Nonetheless, the reviewer is correct that the ramp reaches the levels of the step quickly. The explanation for this is that the BMP dose response (now in Figure 1E) shows that there is a relatively sharp threshold in BMP signaling over which full activation is achieved. This agrees with our previous data (Nemashkalo et al., 2017), as well as from other labs who have suggested that BMP responses are close to binary (Etoc et al. Dev Cell 2016). Thus, it only takes a few steps in the ramp to reach full activation of the pathway. We note that the dose of BMP will have a graded effect on integrated signaling due to the decay in time of signaling at low doses (Figure 1E). We have revised our discussion of this experiment to reflect this, and of the BMP dose-response to better highlight the sharp transition between off and on.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, this study brings a quantitative perspective to a central developmental pathway, and should help to further strengthen a growing sense that dynamics are critically important in the behavior of many developmental signaling pathways.

These data support our conclusion that the time-derivative of concentration is the key determinant of the response rather than the integrated signal and are now presented in Figure 4G,H. We also point out that signaling responses are coincident by the end of the experiment, so that integrated signaling response to the ramp will never catch up with integrated signaling response to step, even if it were allowed to run longer to get to the same integrated ligand exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, based on Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C, which shows dose-dependent responses to BMP concentration, we would expect the ramp response in Figure 3B to depend on ligand dose and therefore to grow slowly over time. Why does it step up so rapidly?</p></disp-quote><p>The BMP dose response (now in Figure 1E) shows that there is a relatively sharp threshold in BMP signaling over which full activation is achieved. This agrees with our previous data (Nemashkalo et al., 2017), as well as from other labs who have suggested that BMP responses are close to binary (Etoc et al., Dev Cell 2016). Thus, it only takes a few steps in the ramp to reach full activation of the pathway. We have revised our discussion of this experiment to reflect this, and of the BMP dose-response to better highlight the sharp transition between off and on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, rate responsive behavior is demonstrated by comparing a step to a ramp. Does the Nodal pathway act as a quantitative sensor of the rate of increase of Activin, or does it exhibit some kind of rate threshold? This could be answered by showing how response depends quantitatively on the ramp slope. A mathematical model of the adaptation process could help to provide insight into the expected behavior here.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data showing intermediate rates of increase which yield intermediate responses in the Smad4 signaling (Figure 4G,H). We also note that the supplement includes a model of the adaptation process that generates behavior consistent with these experiments (Supplemental text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rate-responsiveness in other systems. Work in bacteria (Young et al., 2013) showed similar rate-responsive behavior in the sigB stress response system, where two kinds of stresses activate sigB in different ways, with one input showing rate-responsive behavior, assayed by temporal &quot;ramps&quot; of different slopes. In that system the mechanism of rate responsiveness has been determined. It would be interesting to discuss the similarity (and differences) in signal processing behaviors between these very different biological systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite this paper in the discussion, however, as our focus is on adaptation in developmental signaling, we feel a detailed discussion of this paper is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the authors suggest that during development the moving Smad4 signaling front is responsible for the activation of Brachyury expression. Although strong evidence for adaptative and rate sensing responses to Nodal/ActivinA ligands is provided for sparse hESCs cultures, the micropattern experiment cannot distinguish between a rate sensing mechanism and a pure concentration sensing mechanism. Even though Brachyury responds with higher expression to Activin pulses in sparse hESC cultures, these two experimental conditions differ in both the time scales and the number of pulses cells could perceive (i.e. in sparse culture cells are exposed to multiple Activin pulses separated by ~4.5 hours, whereas in micropattern the data is consistent with only one wave of pSmad2/3, one wave of pSmad1 and one front of Smad4 moving at 1 cell diameter (10µm) per hour, and traveling at least 150 µm to fully cover the spatial domain of brachyury expression. Since no data on dynamics of endogenous Nodal expression is provided, it remains unknown if, over time, ligand concentration is locally increasing (or oscillating) on a timescale relevant to Brachyury induction. As result, in the micropattern, in which responses to BMP and endogenous Nodal co-occur, it is unclear if cells are sensing absolute ligand concentration and/or a rapid increase in ligand concentration. Experimentally determining Nodal dynamics in micropatterns remains difficult, and perturbing its dynamics would require significant cell line engineering. Thus, an alternative avenue to support the claim that in the gastrulating human embryo expression of fate determinants results from rate sensing of ligand increments could be to computationally compare whether patterning triggered by adaptation to Nodal achieved by rate sensing rate qualitatively or quantitatively differs from patterning the mesoderm through sensing absolute ligand concentrations. What new or different emergent properties result from sensing rates as opposed to just concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree in principle that these data in isolation are also consistent with sensing ligand concentration, we note that this experiment does provide an important test, and could have resulted in data disproving our model. The most straightforward hypothesis would be that a static gradient of Nodal signaling is formed, peaks in the region of future mesendoderm, and cells read this gradient. Had this been true, it would have shown that the rate of increase is not relevant to the patterning that occurs. Our data disproved this hypothesis. The fact that there is a rapidly moving wave of signal activation in micropatterned colonies together with our experiments in Figures 1 – 3 (now 1 – 5) that demonstrate that cells respond to the rate of Activin/Nodal increase strongly suggest that cells in micropatterning colonies are also responding to the rate of increase. We agree that direct demonstration would require measurement of Nodal protein dynamics but believe this to be beyond the scope of this manuscript. We also note that the consequences of reading rate of increase during patterning were modeled theoretically in Sorre et al., 2014.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relation to other dynamic encoding systems: This study provides an important advance in understanding the role of dynamics in core mammalian signaling systems. But the relationship to other work on dynamic signal encoding in signaling pathways, as reviewed for example in Purvis and Lahav (2013), Behar and Hoffmann (2010), etc. is minimal. Specifically, it would be useful to know which aspects of the Nodal system in hES resemble or differ from phenomena observed in other pathways or other cell types. For example, different target programs are activated by sustained vs pulsatile activation of p53 and Notch, among other pathways. Also, a recent report (Frick et al., 2017 PNAS) studied the response of C2C12 cells to TGFb ligands, which belong to the Activin/Nodal family and are also transduced by Smads2/3, and showed that the pathway senses fold changes. How does this fold change detection relate to the adaptive rate-responsive behavior observed here? Discussion of these issues would help to connect this study to the broader literature and unify results from multiple studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite and briefly discuss the work on p53 and NFkB mentioned above, however, as our focus is on adaptation in developmental signaling, we feel a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of our manuscript. Our results on ramps and pulses are not consistent with fold change detection and so we do not discuss this in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>In Figure 2, please include the base of the log on the y axis: is it 2, E, or something else?</p></disp-quote><p>It is base 2. We have now clarified this in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1E there is an orange line near the y-axis. It remains unclear if this line represents the fact that after photobleaching Smad4 fluorescence does not recover to the original amplitude.</p></disp-quote><p>The orange line represents data from the photobleaching experiment. The drop near the y-axis is the actual bleaching event. We have now clarified this point in the figure legend.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Perhaps the biggest suggestion I can make with regards to the work is that it is a bit too dense and hard to grasp. Overall the work follows three parts: 1) An analysis of mechanism for adaptation using innovative combination of FRAP and parameter identification of ODE model. 2) analysis of gene expression dynamics response to dynamic SMAD4, and 3) implication of the differences in response dynamics on overall self-organization patterns in the in-vitro gastrulation model. I will refer to these as parts 1-3 below for brevity.</p><p>I am not sure why the authors restricted themselves to only four figures, although I can make an educated guess;). To make the paper easier to follow I strongly recommend to take advantage of eLife lack of restriction on length and number of figures and use the space to elaborate much more about the work.</p><p>In part 1 the author only use two paragraphs on main text to explain a lot of stuff. To understand the adaptation and the FRAP experiments one has to think about two different math models that use a parameter fitting procedure to identify underlying mechanisms. The material is mostly in the supp text, but supp text should not replace main text rather provide more details for completeness. I recommend to move some of the material from supp mat to the main text, explain the FRAP procedure, show the alternative fits for different parameters etc. This part can easily take 2-3 figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have now expanded the paper to 6 figures, including expanding the discussion in the FRAP section with material from the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, part II seemed rushed. The authors show how some genes follow SMAD4 dynamics and some do not. But the sparse text doesn't allow them to go into details, what is different about these genes? Is it RNA halflife? Even without additional experiments, few simple models would be very helpful to understand Figure 2A-D. I am not sure I got the point of panels 2EF, so either explain that in more details or remove those. The different gene expression response to different stimuli regimes (Figure 3) is very nice with its demonstration of the role of SMAD4 dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional data on gene expression that rule out differences in RNA half-life (see response to reviewer 2 above). We have also expanded the discussion to better explain the gene expression data in Figures 2EF (now Figure 3EF).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the last part is very short and descriptive, The author measure different SMADs over space and time, show that there are different responses and that these change gene expression. I was left a bit confused as to why these differences arise? What aspect of self-organization is in play to cause these patterns. The fact that all these results are described in a single paragraphs of 322 words might be part of the problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now split this into two figures and expanded the explanation. We hope it is clearer now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) The use of SMAD4 signaling in figure titles should be replaced with y-axis label saying SMAD4_{nuc}</p></disp-quote><p>We now use the label Smad4 (N:C) throughout to indicate that what we are measuring the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic Smad4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The cartoon in Figure 2 is confusing, why don't all the no sequestered dots recover?</p></disp-quote><p>Fluorescent proteins which have been bleached never recover regardless of sequestration. In the cartoon, the non-sequestered fluorescent dots simply re-equilibrate between the nucleus and cytoplasm while the sequestered ones remain in place. We have expanded the discussion of this figure and hope it is now clearer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
