excitability in human volunteers. Yet, TBS suffers from a high variability across subjects. A better knowledge about how TBS affects neural activity in vivo could uncover its mechanisms of action and ultimately allow its mainstream use in basic science and clinical applications. To address this issue, we applied continuous TBS (cTBS, 300 pulses) in awake behaving rhesus monkeys and quantified its after-effects on neuronal activity. Overall, we observed a pronounced, long-lasting, and highly reproducible reduction in neuronal excitability after cTBS in individual parietal neurons, with some neurons also exhibiting periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. These results provide the first experimental evidence of the effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys, shedding new light on the reasons underlying cTBS variability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>parietal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0007.12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0C51.13N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davare</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PFV10/008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14/18/100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving monkeys show the first evidence of the effect of continuous theta-burst stimulation, a widely used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol, at the level of single neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols, such as continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), represent a non-invasive way to reduce cortical excitability in human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) and to explore neuroplasticity in several patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suppa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Munneke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Opie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suppa et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Suppa et al., 2014b</xref>). However, a number of major hurdles prevent its widespread application in basic research and in clinical care. For example, despite more than 10 years of studies in human volunteers, it is still unclear how neural activity changes in the cortex after cTBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pitcher et al., 2021</xref>). It is generally assumed that the reduction in neuronal excitability may resemble the changes observed in long-term depression (LTD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thut and Pascual-Leone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vlachos et al., 2012</xref>), but no study has ever tested in vivo whether this is true. The reduction in the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) after cTBS also grows over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), which does not resemble the immediate reduction in neuronal excitability after conditioning observed in LTD. Moreover and more importantly, the physiological effects of cTBS are notoriously variable, with inhibitory effects in some subjects and facilitatory effects in other subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hamada et al., 2013</xref>). Several factors could contribute to this variability (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suppa et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic variation, differences in the intracortical network activated by the TMS pulses (measured in the so-called late I-waves), previous levels of activity, circadian effects, and differences in the brain state may all contribute to the inter- and intra-individual variability reported in cTBS studies.</p><p>We sought answers to the aforementioned questions by recording single-neuron activity before and after cTBS in parietal cortex of awake behaving rhesus monkeys. We probed the neuronal excitability using single-pulse TMS (sTMS), and measured how this excitability changed up to 2 hr after cTBS. To the extent possible, we standardized the factors potentially contributing to the known variability associated with cTBS: the positioning of the coil on the skull, the level of ongoing motor activity, the stimulation hour, and the brain state were equalized as much as possible across sessions and animals. We observed highly reproducible changes in neuronal excitability, in which individual neurons would progress through phases of hypo- and hyperexcitability, in some cases followed by recovery. At the population level, the reduction in neuronal excitability grew over time, reaching its maximum 30–40 min after cTBS, consistent with studies in humans. Thus, in a standardized experimental setting, cTBS induced reproducible and long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded single-unit activity in parietal area PFG of two monkeys during sTMS in 90 experimental sessions.

The first example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) generated a brief burst of action potentials almost immediately after sTMS (top row) but did not respond to light onset in the absence of sTMS. After 20 s of cTBS, however, the excitability of this neuron was markedly reduced (second row, sTMS-evoked response pre- compared to post-cTBS: z=3.88, p=1.06 e−04, r=0.60; Wilcoxon test). Indeed, in the first 10 min post- CTBS, the activity in high-stimulation trials did not differ anymore from the activity in no-stimulation trials (z=1.81, p=0.07, r=0.17). Over the subsequent time intervals, the excitability of this neuron gradually recovered (no-stimulation compared to stimulation trials; 20 min post-cTBS: z=4.99, p=6.01e−07, r=0.46; 30 min post-cTBS: z=6.58, p=4.57e−11, r=0.60; 40 min post-cTBS: z=5.27, p=1.35e−07, r=0.48; 50 min post-cTBS: z=4.74, p=2.17e−06, r=0.43), but only after 60 min did the excitability of the neuron return to the pre-cTBS level (sTMS-evoked response pre- compared to 60 min post-cTBS: z=1.63, p=0.103, r=0.26). Thus, cTBS caused a marked and immediate reduction in excitability in this parietal example neuron, which recovered over the course of 1 hr.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of cTBS on neuronal excitability: example neurons with recovery.</title><p>We tested the excitability of each neuron using single-pulse TMS (sTMS) administered before and after cTBS.

Only in the 20 and 30 min intervals after cTBS, this neuron’s excitability dropped considerably (no significant difference between stimulation and no-stimulation trials at 20 min post-cTBS: z=–0.84, p=0.399, r=–0.07, and at 30 min post-cTBS: z=–0.20, p=0.839, r=–0.02), although its visual response (to light onset: baseline vs. post-light onset activity in no-stimulation trials; z=–4.72, p=2.32e−06, r=–0.32) remained. Surprisingly, in the 40 and 50 min intervals, the excitability of this neuron temporarily increased significantly (sTMS-evoked response pre-compared to post-cTBS at 40 min post-cTBS: z=–2.24, p=0.025, r=–0.355 and at 50 min post-cTBS: z=–2.68, p=0.007, r=–0.42). Only in the 60 min interval did the neuron return to its pre-cTBS excitability level (z=–2.61, p=0.08, r=–0.41, pre-compared to 60 min post-cTBS in the first 40 ms after TMS onset). A third example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) showed yet another pattern of excitability changes after cTBS. The strong burst of activity evoked by sTMS was immediately reduced after cTBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare top panel with second panel: z=3.64, p=2.741e–04, r=0.68). However, this reduction in excitability grew markedly over time and reached its peak only after 50 min. At the end of our standard 60 min recording epoch, the neuron did not respond anymore to sTMS, without any sign of recovery, although we could still sporadically detect spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition to the growing suppression of the sTMS response in the first hour after cTBS, we also observed a significant reduction in the baseline activity in this neuron (by 91%, pre-compared to 40 min post-cTBS: z=3.64, p=1.251e–05, r=0.65). Because the activity of the neuron was extremely reduced, we verified that the neuron was not lost during the recording session by comparing the spike waveforms recorded before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper panel) and 60 min after cTBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). The firing rate of this neuron in the 60 min post-cTBS interval was reduced to barely 4 spikes/s, but the spike waveform was virtually identical compared to the pre-cTBS epoch, which confirms that we still recorded from the same neuron. Notice also a very weak response to sTMS at 60 min post-cTBS. Overall, cTBS induced a compelling reduction in the excitability of parietal neurons, with highly variable onset time and recovery.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of cTBS on neuronal excitability: example neuron without recovery.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spike rate of an example neuron with immediate reduced excitability after cTBS (rows 2–4).

In the first 10 min post-cTBS, almost half of the PFG neurons (43%; 39% in monkey Y and 49% in monkey A) showed a significant (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test p&lt;0.05) change in their sTMS response (either hypo- or hyperexcitability). However, the proportion of neurons in which cTBS affected the sTMS response gradually increased over time, such that in the 60 min post-cTBS interval, virtually all neurons (85/86) were significantly affected by cTBS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; with Bonferroni correction, the proportions of affected neurons grew from 24% at 10 min post-cTBS to 62% at 60 min post-cTBS). Similarly, cTBS induced an immediate and significant change in the baseline activity (i.e., the spike rate before sTMS) in about one third of the neurons (34%, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test p&lt;0.05), which reached its maximum 1 hr post-cTBS (93% of the neurons, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The large majority of these neurons (91%) were initially less excitable followed by an epoch of hyperexcitability, as the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

Despite the absence of a grasping movement, a subset of the neurons we recorded in PFG showed significant task-related activity (i.e., object responses) after light onset (N=18). The presence of object responses allowed us to test the effect of cTBS on neuronal excitability without applying sTMS. To capture all task-related responses, we tested the effect of cTBS in two intervals, an early (0–80 ms after light onset) and a late interval (100–500 ms after light onset) and analyzed the response difference in the 40 ms around the maximal response. The later task-related activity (100–500 ms after light onset) differed significantly compared to the pre-cTBS epoch in every epoch from 30 to 60 min post-cTBS, whereas the early interval after light onset did not show a significant difference in any epoch post-cTBS (Wilcoxon signed rank test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Even 90 min after cTBS, most neurons (18/34, 53%) showed significantly reduced sTMS responses compared to pre-cTBS, and the average normalized sTMS-evoked response was significantly reduced at this late time period post-cTBS (z=1.99, p=0.02, r=0.24).

This reduced excitability of individual neurons grew over time, consistent with previous studies in humans, but some neurons exhibited periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. These results provide the first experimental evidence on the neural effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys. Importantly, while we did not control for remote or network cTBS effects as per scope of this study, our findings that cTBS did not systematically lead to inhibition of neuronal firing rate, that hypo- and hyperexcitability periods occurred at different time points in different neurons and that neuronal activity recovered to baseline, pre-cTBS levels, on average an hour post-cTBS, allow us to argue against nonspecific effect of the cTBS intervention. Moreover, in our previous work investigating the behavioral effects of cTBS on monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>), we showed the differential effect of effective versus sham cTBS on motor performance, providing indirect evidence about the specificity of the underlying neural cTBS effects found in this study.</p><p>Our basic findings, both at the single-cell level and at the behavioral level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>), are remarkably consistent with the known effects of cTBS over primary motor cortex in human volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). The average amplitude of the MEP—a measure of neuronal excitability in the primary motor cortex—is unaltered in the first minutes after cTBS, then gradually declines and recovers 25 (after 20 s cTBS) or 60 min (after 40 s cTBS) later. In parallel, the reaction time significantly increases 10 min after cTBS over primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). The time course of the neural effects we measured after 20 s of cTBS in monkeys seems to be more similar to the 40 s cTBS protocol in humans, possibly due to the thinner skull of monkeys. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that we applied cTBS over parietal cortex, whereas most cTBS studies in humans have targeted primary motor cortex (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davare et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the consistency of our findings with the human literature strongly suggests that single-cell recordings after cTBS in awake macaque monkeys represent a valid approach to understanding the neural effects of cTBS.</p><p>The crucial advantage of our approach is that we can measure the wide range of changes in excitability in individual neurons, while the MEP amplitude represents an excitability measure of a large population of neurons. In addition, we could demonstrate that the inhibitory influence of cTBS progressively recruits more neurons over time, even neurons that were initially unaffected. Finally, we showed that cTBS induces a general reduction in neuronal excitability, which appears in changes in baseline firing rate, sTMS-evoked responses, low-frequency oscillatory activity, and task-related activity. It is noteworthy that the neuronal object responses we measured here in PFG were relatively slower and longer-lasting, compared to neighboring area AIP (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular recordings do not easily allow determining the cell type of the unit that is being recorded based on the spike waveform (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2012</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vigneswaran et al., 2011</xref>), nor the cortical layer in which these units were recorded. In general, we recorded from neurons located immediately under the TMS coil and generated large spike waveforms, that we could monitor for more than 1 hr and up to 2 hr post-cTBS. However, the large range of effects we observed in our population of neurons may suggest that cTBS exerts specific effects on different cell types, on neurons in different layers, and in a different orientation and/or location with respect to the TMS coil. In nonhuman primates, future studies could address these questions with advanced techniques such as calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ikezoe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that cTBS may induce LTD-like effects on cortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). LTD, a widespread phenomenon driving synaptic plasticity both in subcortical structures and in the cortex, is typically induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS; at 1 Hz), and its underlying molecular mechanisms may be very diverse depending on brain area and developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Massey and Bashir, 2007</xref>). In visual cortex, 15 min of 1 Hz stimulation induces LTD of synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirkwood and Bear, 1994</xref>). However, the LTD effect studied in cortical slices appears immediately after the end of LFS and remains constant for up to half an hour. In contrast, the reduction in neuronal excitability we observed after cTBS grew gradually and reached its maximum 30–50 min after cTBS, similar to the reduction in the amplitude of the MEP observed after cTBS in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Almost half of the neurons in our sample were not affected at all in the first epoch post-cTBS, but became less excitable in the hour following cTBS. Therefore, the time course of the cTBS effect we measured does not seem to be compatible with a pure LTD effect. Instead, the gradual reduction in neuronal excitability seems more consistent with an increase in the local concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which may slowly spread in the cortical area under the TMS coil. It is noteworthy that magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated an increase in GABA in human motor cortex after cTBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stagg et al., 2009</xref>). In the nonhuman primate model, future studies will be able to investigate in more detail which molecular mechanisms are responsible for the effect of cTBS.</p><p>Unexpectedly, some neurons also showed a period of hyperexcitability after an initial phase of reduced excitability caused by cTBS. We interpret these findings as evidence that nearby inhibitory interneurons showed a different time course of recovery after cTBS, such that at some point post-cTBS the neuronal excitability had recovered while the normal inhibitory inputs to the neuron were still less active. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Romero et al., 2019</xref>), we also observed that TMS affects both large pyramidal neurons and small (inhibitory) interneurons. The temporary hyperexcitability in our data may also be related to the rare occurrence of seizures after TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lerner et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Because we concentrated on measuring the changes in neuronal excitability after cTBS, we did not map the area of cortex under the coil that was affected by cTBS. sTMS affects a surprisingly small volume of cortex, which we estimated to be not larger than 2 by 2 by 2 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Romero et al., 2019</xref>). If our hypothesis of the spreading of GABA is correct, we expect that a slightly larger volume of cortex will be affected by cTBS. Furthermore, our previous observation that sTMS affects a very small volume of cortex explains why a control site was not necessary in the current study: we assessed neuronal excitability by means of sTMS, and therefore moving the TMS coil to a different location would have made this assessment impossible. In theory, the possibility exists that the reduced neuronal excitability we measured under the TMS coil was an indirect effect caused by inactivation of an input area of PFG (e.g., neighboring area AIP or 7a). Even the inclusion of a remote control site would not entirely rule out this possibility because this control site would most likely not be connected to PFG and therefore would not cause any effect in PFG. We believe this theoretical possibility is unlikely because the induced electric field was maximal immediately under the coil where we recorded neuronal activity, and therefore this mechanism would imply the recruitment of another cortical area with a lower electric field. Nevertheless, cTBS and other reversible inactivation methods certainly evoke effects on connected remote areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davare et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bestmann et al., 2015</xref>), sometimes even far away from the inactivation site (see, fe.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Dromme et al., 2016</xref> for effects in inferior temporal cortex after reversible inactivation of AIP).</p><p>It is important to note that we can rule out nonspecific factors influencing the neurons under the TMS coil. For example, cutaneous stimulation could not drive our effects since the TMS coil was positioned on the implant of the animal which was composed of dental acrylic. Moreover, we could measure the reduction in neuronal excitability 30–60 min after the administration of cTBS in task-related neurons in the absence of sTMS. It is highly unlikely that these late effects of cTBS would have resulted from cutaneous stimulation or other nonspecific factors. Note also that we previously observed highly grasp-specific effects of cTBS in line with the role of PFG in processing object properties for grasping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our results were robust (around 30% reduction in response) and highly reproducible in two animals, which is the standard in monkey electrophysiology experiments. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref> also reported highly similar behavioral results in two different animals. However, future studies will have to determine to what extent the effects of cTBS are variable in a larger number of monkeys. Although the neural effects of cTBS were highly similar in the two animals we used, the effects of cTBS in human volunteers are notoriously variable across subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hamada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hordacre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jannati et al., 2017</xref>). The reproducibility of our results was most likely related to the very controlled conditions in which we applied cTBS. In our setup, the TMS coil was rigidly anchored to the head implant of the animal, so that we kept both the position and the orientation of the coil similar across sessions. Also, another possibility is that monkeys become highly overtrained in the grasping task, which may partially explain the similar behavioral effects of cTBS we reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>. It is therefore plausible to assume that the larger variability inherent to human behavior is one reason underlying the variability of cTBS effects in humans, since stimulation is applied over a brain area in subjects at different levels of learning stages and behavioral performance, ultimately impacting on the susceptibility of that brain area to cTBS and increasing the inter-individual variability of the technique.</p><p>The critical advantage of the macaque monkey model is that we can measure single-cell activity and behavioral performance before and after cTBS. In a subset of neurons that we could record for more than 1 hr, we did not observe any recovery of the excitability even after 2 hr. Consistent with this observation, the behavioral effect of cTBS also lasted at least 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, our cTBS paradigm in monkeys may have caused longer-lasting effects than in human volunteers, possibly due to the thinner skull of the monkey, which could induce a stronger effect in parietal cortex. We did not observe any effect on the neuronal excitability on consecutive days, since we could always record single-unit activity over several weeks of recordings.</p><p>Investigating the neural effects of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques requires adequate animal models, so that behavioral measurements and detailed recordings of individual neurons can be combined with neuromodulation. In future studies, other stimulation protocols such as intermittent theta-burst stimulation and other neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation can be investigated and optimized in animal models using a similar approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and surgical procedures</title><p>Two adult male rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; monkey Y, 12 kg; monkey A, 8 kg) were trained to sit in a primate chair. A head post (Crist Instruments) was then implanted on the skull with ceramic screws and dental acrylic. For this and all other surgical protocols, monkeys were kept under propofol anesthesia (10 mg/kg/hr) and strict aseptic conditions. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the EU Directive 2010/63/EU, and approved by the Ethical Committee at KU Leuven (project number P220/2014). Intensive training in passive fixation and visually guided grasping (VGG) began after 6 weeks of recovery. Once the monkeys had achieved an adequate level of performance, a craniotomy was made, guided by anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), over area PFG of the right hemisphere. An exhaustive description of this protocol has been detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Romero et al., 2019</xref>). The recording chamber was implanted at a 45° angle with respect to the vertical, allowing oblique penetrations into the parietal convexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm the recording positions, glass capillaries were filled with a 2% copper sulfate solution and inserted into a recording grid at five different locations during structural MRI (slice thickness: 0.6 mm). Two guiding rods were precisely fixed to the skull with dental acrylic based on the calculated stereotactic coordinates, allowing a highly reproducible positioning of the TMS coil across sessions. With these rods in place, the coil was kept at an angle of approximately 90° with respect to the recording chamber, inducing a posterior-anterior (PA) current over PFG. To estimate the center of stimulation, we used anatomical MRI and computed tomography (CT scan) to build 3D printed models of the skull and implant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on the MR-CT co-registered images, we calculated that the TMS coil was placed approximately at a distance of 15 mm from (above) the parietal convexity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimulation protocol</title><p>For this study, we combined two different TMS protocols: sTMS and cTBS. We performed extracellular recordings before and after cTBS to investigate the changes in neuronal excitability, assessed with sTMS during passive fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>cTBS effect on individual neurons: electrophysiological recordings</title><p>To optimize the stability of the recordings (total duration 1–3 hr per neuron), the animals performed a passive fixation task while sitting upright with their head fixed. With this setup, a single object (large sphere; diameter: 35 mm) was placed on a frontal plate, located 30 cm away from the animal. In the beginning of the trial, the monkeys remained in total darkness for a variable time period (intertrial interval: 2000–3000). Next, a red laser was projected at the base of the object, indicating the fixation point. If the animal maintained fixation inside an electronically-defined window (±2.5° around the fixation point) for 500 ms, the object was illuminated (light onset) until the end of the trial (1300 ms). Whenever the monkey maintained a stable eye fixation, it received a drop of juice as reward.</p><p>Prior to the study, we determined the resting motor threshold (rMT) for each animal in a single session as the lowest stimulus intensity at which TMS applied over primary motor cortex (M1) produced a slight contralateral finger twitch 5 times out of 10 while the monkey held its hand in the resting position. For this measurement, the TMS coil (55 mm external diameter figure-of-eight, Magstim D25 branding iron style coil, with 25 mm windings ) was handheld over M1, at a distance of approximately 15 mm from the surface of the brain, reproducing the coil distance adopted during the experiments. The rMT was identical in the two animals (59% of the maximum stimulator output).</p><p>In each recording session, the coil was placed over the guiding rods, tangential to the skull and in contact with the implant, staying firmly anchored to the chair by means of an adjustable metal arm. We applied sTMS at 120% of the rMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), aligned to light onset and randomly interleaved with no-stimulation trials, while advancing the electrode and searching for well-isolated units (Phase 1). We used a Magstim Rapid Stimulator (first generation stimulator, Magstim, UK), which applied biphasic pulses (100 µs rise time, 250 µs duration; 120% rMT corresponded to 70% of maximum stimulator output, for both monkeys) by means of a 55 mm figure-of-eight coil (Magstim D25 branding iron style coil). Note that the maximum stimulator output of first generation Magstim rapid stimulators is weaker and corresponds to 65% of that of a standard monophasic single-pulse Magstim stimulator (Magstim communication). As for previous experiments in our group, we employed this protocol to localize the center of stimulation, which was determined as the region under the center of the coil showing a significant sTMS-evoked effect in single neurons. With our technique, we isolated individual PFG neurons and stabilized the recordings to guarantee a reliable long-lasting monitoring of their activity. In each recording session, we first waited for a variable amount of time (40–60 min) to acquire the highest possible level of stability in the recorded signal and then measured the baseline neuronal activity and the sTMS-evoked response for 20 min. In order to prevent a possible overheating of the coil during this period, a gel-filled cool pack was placed around the handle, embracing the figure-of-eight-shaped head of the coil (Nexcare; 3M Company, MN). Next (Phase 2), we applied cTBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) following the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>. In our cTBS paradigm, 50 Hz triplets were delivered at 200 ms intervals (300 pulses in total) for 20 s at 80% of the rMT (which corresponded to 47% of the maximum stimulator output intensity, for both monkeys). It is noteworthy to consider that our measured rMT intensity is likely to be underestimated, due to the monkeys not being entirely at rest during motor threshold definition procedures. Therefore, we assumed that our 80% rMT intensity should be comparable to the 70% rMT intensity used for cTBS in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goldsworthy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To prevent coil overheating during this phase, the gel-filled cool pack was now substituted by two round cool bags containing dry ice and placed over the loop ends of the coil. Phase three started immediately after cTBS, and consisted of a second period of combined sTMS and electrophysiological recordings, at 120% rMT for up to 2 hr post-cTBS to measure changes in neuronal excitability. For the entire duration of the experiments, none of the animals showed any noticeable side-effect to cTBS, performing their task without signs of distress.</p><p>We verified that the stimulation intensity we used was appropriate (i.e., sufficient to evoke behavioral effects but not too high) in two other rhesus monkeys in a VGG task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merken et al., 2021</xref>). We measured significant increases in grasping time in both animals (53 and 41 ms on average in the interval between 20 and 120 min after cTBS), which were comparable in magnitude (approximately 15% increase in grasping time) to the effects of highly localized reversible inactivation experiments using muscimol in ventral premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caprara and Janssen, 2021</xref>). For comparison, reversible inactivation of primary motor cortex prolongs the grasping time by 43%. Therefore, the stimulation intensity we used for cTBS was sufficient to induce behavioral effects but did not induce a severe impairment in grasping.</p><p>We recorded single-unit activity in PFG using tungsten microelectrodes (impedance: 1 MΩ at 1 kHz; FHC, USA) inserted through the dura by means of a 23-gauge stainless steel guide tube and a hydraulic microdrive (FHC). Following the artifact reduction strategy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>, we used diodes and serial low-gain amplification to clip the artifact generated by the magnetic pulses, which prevented amplifier saturation. For this, we modified a regular BAK Electronics preamplifier (Model A-1; BAK Electronics, USA) by connecting two leakage diodes (BAS45A) anti-parallel between the signal lines and ground before each stage of amplification. The initial front-end of the headstage remained unmodified to maintain the high-input impedance. With these settings, the duration of the evoked TMS artifact in our signal ranged from 8 to 12 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Romero et al., 2019</xref>). Neural activity was amplified and filtered (300–5000 Hz) following a standard recording protocol for spike detection. Using a dual time-window discriminator (LabVIEW and custom-built software), we isolated individual neurons and the TMS artifact, which was detected online and subtracted from the neural data. In addition, we recorded the entire raw signal (after filtering) for further analyses. Finally, we monitored the right eye position using an infrared-based camera system (Eye Link II, SR Research, Canada) sampling the pupil position at 500 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks, MA; code availability: DRYAD database). For the high- and low-stimulation trials of experiment 1, the neural activity was aligned on the sTMS pulse delivered at light onset. Also, for comparison, the no-stimulation trials were aligned on the same time bin. Net neural responses were then calculated as the average firing rate recorded after sTMS minus the baseline (spike rate calculated from the mean activity of the cell in the 800 ms interval preceding TMS).</p><p>We created line plots comparing the average response (spikes/s) of every cell during no-stimulation and stimulation (sTMS) trials recorded in the pre-cTBS epoch. The same analyses were then repeated in 10 min epochs post-cTBS, in order to assess in detail how the response of PFG neurons to sTMS—our measure of neuronal excitability—changed after cTBS. Since we expected that cTBS would induce cortical inhibition, we searched for PFG neurons showing excitatory responses to sTMS.</p><p>To determine the significance of the sTMS-evoked effect on individual neurons, we compared the cell responses observed in the first 40 ms after light onset in the stimulation condition to those in the no-stimulation condition (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). To identify neurons with task-related activity, we ran a Wilcoxon signed rank test comparing the pre- and post-light onset responses in two different intervals (early task activity: 0–80 ms post-stimulus; later task activity: 100–500 ms post-stimulus) in the no-stimulation condition. Finally, to assess the effect of cTBS on neuronal excitability, we compared the average net sTMS-evoked response in every 10 min epoch after cTBS with the same response pre-cTBS (baseline sTMS net response, two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test). For all neurons recorded for more than 1 hr, we compared the raw traces to verify (with visual inspection of the waveforms) that the neuron was not lost during the recordings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was approved by the Committee on animal experiments of KU Leuven with number P220/2014.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-65536-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are publicly available on Dryad <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ns1rn8pvr">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ns1rn8pvr</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pita</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Merken</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Davare</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Neural effects of continuous theta-burst stimulation in macaque parietal neurons</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.ns1rn8pvr</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen (Odysseus grants G.0007.12 and G.0C51.13N), Program Financing (PFV10/008) and KU Leuven grant C14/18/100.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An issue identified by the reviewers was the lack of an adequate control condition for both experiments. Comparing no-stimulation to stimulation (Exp 1) and high vs low stimulus intensity (Exp 2) severely limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the data as presented. Absent an active control condition, it is unclear whether the results presented are specific to the site of stimulation and whether any behavioral effects of stimulation might be due to other non-specific effects of stimulation (e.g. somatosensory sensations).</p><p>2) All the reviewers agreed that the link between the single-unit recording experiment and the behavioral experiment was tenuous given they were recorded with different animals at different times with different protocols/conditions. Reviewers did not see the value of including the second experiment and suggested removing it.</p><p>3) There was substantial concern about the reporting and execution of the specific statistical analyses used. A re-analysis using methods that could be used to generalize to new animals/subjects is required as is a fuller reporting of the statistics (see reviewer comments below).</p><p>4) The exact stimulation intensities used and their relationship to the motor threshold of the different animals was unclear. There needs to be clarification of: the number of stimulation sessions, when motor thresholds were determined, the stimulation intensity used for each animal, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This interesting work is a challenging study documenting at neuronal level the effect of rTMS in the excitability of neurons in the parietal cortex of the monkey. The study has been conducted in a rigorous way, with challenging techniques. All the data have been adequately shared and statistically treated. All conclusions are supported by the experimental data.</p><p>The paper sheds light on the foundations of a technique largely used in human volunteers to study neuronal circuits. They perform continuous theta burst stimulation over area PFG of the lateral parietal cortex to check the effect on neural excitability. This represents a technical advance in the field. The results represent the first demonstration of the effects of such widely used brain stimulation at individual neuronal level and will inform future clinical and basic research.</p><p>The study is performed in 4 monkeys, 2 studied in a fixation task and 2 in a grasping task. In the fixation task they show the time course of hypoexcitability, hyperexcitability and recovery time at individual neuronal level and at population level. A huge variability is demonstrated both in terms of time and of level of activation/depression.</p><p>In the grasping task, behavioural effects are shown, such as a long-lasting increase in the grasping time after TMS. The link between the 2 experiments is not straightforward, moreover the animals are not the same. Considering this and that the behavioural effects are part of Romero et al., 2019 and of another publication on the way, I strongly suggest to remove the grasping part from this manuscript. This would not reduce the large breath of this study. Indeed the neuronal effects shown in the first 2 animals are really foundational and complete. Alternatively, authors should better highlight the relationship between the two groups of results.</p><p>Another main suggestion is related to the exact site of TMS delivery. A very precise way to exactly reproduce the positioning of the coil has been set in place. This is really positive. I consider important to see the exact positioning of the coil. However in figure 1A, only a generic scheme is furnished. Please provide MRI with the reference for coil positioning, at least in this individual, better for both subjects.</p><p>Specific points to address:</p><p>1) Methods, how many recording sessions have been performed? was the rmt calculated before each experimental session? please clarify.</p><p>2) How the comparison between different waveform has been performed? By visual inspection or by applying some statistical methods?</p><p>3) Results, figure 5: how many neurons showed significant correlation coefficients in a given epoch?</p><p>It seems that the % of neurons with significant correlations increases over time. Please add data and a comment on this.</p><p>Then, authors should show the correlation coefficient in each plot in the figure, and propose a more interesting and convincing interpretation of the change of the correlation coefficient over time.</p><p>4) Results, figure 7. Authors should briefly comment the long-lasting duration of the response to object observation shown in figure 7.</p><p>5) Discussion, page 19. The various neural effects shown could be the explanation of the different and variable effects obtained in humans in theta-burst experiments. However, could it be that the different effects in humans could be related to the variability in kinematics across subjects, whereas the constant effect on monkey grasping time could be due to the stereotyped behavior of an overtrained monkey?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural effects of continuous theta-burst stimulation in macaque parietal neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The lack of a control condition has not been adequately dealt with. At present it is not possible to determine whether the effects were specifically due to cTBS over parietal cortex. An active control condition with stimulation of another site would provide a comparison for how the cTBS protocol in general affects neuronal responses to spTMS. For example, how can the authors rule out that cutaneous stimulation (rather than the specific stimulation of neurons under the coil) is driving the changes in excitability? This is a major limitation of the study and should be clearly discussed and acknowledged.</p><p>2) Please provide more clarity on the stimulation intensity used. It is reported that both monkeys were stimulated at 47% MSO corresponding with 80% RMT. Was RMT calculated in each animal separately and they had the exact same RMT? Was an average RMT between the two animals used? Was there any measurement of the level of movement for each animal during thresholding? It would be helpful to be able to draw a clearer link between the stimulation intensity used here and the standard intensity used in humans.</p><p>3) Some of the statistical concerns raised by Reviewer #2 remain issues that need to be addressed. For each statistical test, all parameters (e.g. test statistic, degrees of freedom, effect size, etc) need to be reported rather than just the p-values. Please only report corrected statistics. There is still concern regarding the ANOVAs and degrees of freedom reported. It is not appropriate to pool measurements across both animals as if they were a single population of neurons nor should statistical tests be conducted across trials. This will require a reanalysis appropriate to the data collected.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural effects of continuous theta-burst stimulation in macaque parietal neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please explicitly acknowledge and discuss the problem of the specificity of the TMS effects. Although the current revision points to previous work describing the focality of single pulse TMS, the reviewers and I are still concerned with the specificity of the cTBS effect. Even if cutaneous stimulation could be ruled out, it cannot be determined from the present data whether the results of cTBS to that particular site or if similar results would have been obtained if cTBS is applied anywhere else in the brain. Regional specificity of the cTBS effect cannot be claimed as there is no comparison with a cTBS effect at a distal site.</p><p>2) Please explicitly acknowledge and discuss the limitations of the statistical analysis (see reviewer comments below).</p><p>3) Please clarify the characteristics of the TMS coil used (see reviewer comments below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The problem of specificity has not been answered, aside from referring to another publication. The problem, for example, of skin stimulation is poorly dealt with. Figure 1A indicates clearly that the distance of the cortex from the coil is the same as the distance of the coil from the nearest cutaneous flap, so the presence of the resin support does not guarantee absence of cutaneous stimulation.</p><p>2) Regarding the problem of statistical analysis, the authors did not reply fully to the original question. I acknowledge that in neurophysiology it is customary to treat single neurons as subjects, but this procedure should be carefully explained. I understand the difficulty of training non-human primates and the invaluable insight of single neuron recordings, but the authors should also acknowledge the limitations of the interpretation of the data. I repeat myself in saying that the authors adopted a fixed effect analysis at group-level. Subjects (monkeys) are not treated as a random factor, so the level of inference is at the level of the group and cannot be extended to the population. An ANOVA with almost 5000 degrees of freedom and a very weak effect size (eta squared ranges from 0=no effect to 1=strong effect is reported to be = 0.01) should be reported cautiously in a generalist journal.</p><p>I propose to explicitly ask the authors to point out that the current statistics do not allow inference to the population.</p><p>In addition, I have a further comment on how the methods are reported:</p><p>3) The description of the coil characteristics is incorrect, and this ambiguity led to several misinterpretations. The coil is described in the methods as a 55 mm figure of eight coil. However, it is a universal convention in TMS to describe figure of eight coils by the outer diameter of each of the windings. Here it was used to describe the width of the whole coil. One realizes this only after taking the time to check the manufacturer's specifications. To confirm this, the legend of figure 1 reports the correct description, as a double 25 mm coil. This imprecision led to several misunderstandings (obviously a double 55 mm coil is too big for focality in a monkey brain, as I pointed out in my first review). I would suggest the authors be consistent in describing their methods and stick to international conventions. The problem of focality still persists, the intensity of stimulation indicated here are still very high, even with a small double 25 mm coil.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65536.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An issue identified by the reviewers was the lack of an adequate control condition for both experiments.

Our main motivation was to show that the intensity of stimulation was not exaggerated for monkeys (see also comment 1 of reviewer 2). Therefore, we now merely mention the behavioral effects in the Methods on page 6 without discussing it further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‘We verified that the stimulation intensity we used was appropriate (i.e. sufficient to evoke behavioral effects but not too high) in two other rhesus monkeys in a visually-guided grasping task. We measured significant increases in grasping time in both animals (53 ms and 41 ms on average in the interval between 20 and 120 min after cTBS), which were comparable in magnitude (approximately 15% increase in grasping time) to the effects of highly localized reversible inactivation experiments using muscimol in ventral premotor cortex (Caprara and Janssen, 2021). For comparison, reversible inactivation of primary motor cortex prolongs the grasping time by 43%. Therefore, the stimulation intensity we used for cTBS was sufficient to induce behavioral effects but did not induce a severe impairment in grasping.’</p><p>Another main suggestion is related to the exact site of TMS delivery.

This is a major limitation of the study and should be clearly discussed and acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph on page 16 in the discussion on this issue. We acknowledge that we did not control for remote or network effects of cTBS (p.13). However, we know from our previous study (Romero et al., 2019, Nat Comm) that single pulse TMS (sTMS) effects are highly focal. Since, in the present study, we assessed the effect of cTBS with sTMS, we would not have been able to assess the changes in neuronal excitability if we had moved the TMS coil to another location. This would have resulted in simply replicating our Nat Comm study. It is also important to mention that our study is not a behavioral study (where control sites are necessary to determine the specificity of the effect), and that we recorded from neurons located immediately under the TMS coil, where we know the effects of TMS are the strongest (see Romero et al., 2019 Nat Comm). Obviously, the cTBS we applied over parietal cortex may also have induced effects in remote areas (anatomically connected to the stimulated area), but this will not have influenced our recordings. We also clearly state that cutaneous stimulation could not be a factor in our experiments because the TMS coil was positioned on the implant of the animal (which is composed of dental acrylic). Therefore, we are entirely confident that the neural effects we measured immediately under the TMS coil were indeed specifically due to cTBS over parietal cortex. Finally, it is important to note that we showed clear dose-response effects in our previous behavioral paper (Merken et al., 2021, Scientific Reports) with different behavioral effects for no-stimulation, low-stimulation and high-stimulation, further showing the specificity of our cTBS effects.</p><p>p.16: ‘Furthermore, our previous observation that single-pulse TMS affects a very small volume of cortex explains why a control site was not necessary in the current study: we assessed neuronal excitability by means of single-pulse TMS, and therefore moving the TMS coil to a different location would have made this assessment impossible. It is important to note that we can rule out non-specific factors influencing the neurons under the TMS coil. For example, cutaneous stimulation could not drive our effects since the TMS coil was positioned on the implant of the animal which was composed of dental acrylic.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide more clarity on the stimulation intensity used.

References to standard protocols used in humans are also made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the statistical concerns raised by Reviewer #2 remain issues that need to be addressed.

We have also added a sentence (on p. 11) explaining that we pooled all neurons because the results were highly similar (as we do in all other non-human primate studies), but that we also provide all statistics for the two animals separately (see also Figure 4 supplement 1 for data of the two animals separately).</p><p>In addition, we have re-analyzed and replotted the data averaged across neurons instead of across trials. This did not change the main results (see for example the effects beyond one hour on p. 13).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The problem of specificity has not been answered, aside from referring to another publication.

However, we also acknowledge that cTBS and other neuromodulation techniques evoke network effects.</p><p>‘In theory, the possibility exists that the reduced neuronal excitability we measured under the TMS coil was an indirect effect caused by inactivation of an input area of PFG (e.g., neighboring area AIP or 7a). Even the inclusion of a remote control site would not entirely rule out this possibility because this control site would most likely not be connected to PFG and therefore would not cause any effect in PFG. We believe this theoretical possibility is unlikely because the induced electric field was maximal immediately under the coil where we recorded neuronal activity, and therefore this mechanism would imply recruitment of another cortical area with a lower electric field. Nevertheless, cTBS and other reversible inactivation methods certainly evoke effects on connected remote areas (Davare et al., 2010; Bestman paper), sometimes even far away from the inactivation site (see for example Van Dromme et al. (2016) for effects in inferior temporal cortex after reversible inactivation of AIP).’</p><p>In addition, we have clarified the issue of potential nonspecific factors contributing to our effects on p 17. Even if we would have evoked cutaneous effects with cTBS, it is extremely unlikely that we would be able to observe a reduction in neuronal excitability 30 min later (as in the task-related neurons). For the reviewer, we also include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, a picture of the setup to illustrate the positioning of the TMS coil.</p><p>‘It is important to note that we can rule out non-specific factors influencing the neurons under the TMS coil. For example, cutaneous stimulation could not drive our effects since the TMS coil was positioned on the implant of the animal which was composed of dental acrylic. Moreover, we could measure the reduction in neuronal excitability 30-60 min after the administration of cTBS in task-related neurons in the absence of sTMS. It is highly unlikely that these late effects of cTBS would have resulted from cutaneous stimulation or other nonspecific factors. Note also that we previously observed highly grasp-specific effects of cTBS in line with the role of PFG in processing object properties for grasping (Merken et al., 2021).’</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-65536-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the problem of statistical analysis, the authors did not reply fully to the original question. I acknowledge that in neurophysiology it is customary to treat single neurons as subjects, but this procedure should be carefully explained. I understand the difficulty of training non-human primates and the invaluable insight of single neuron recordings, but the authors should also acknowledge the limitations of the interpretation of the data. I repeat myself in saying that the authors adopted a fixed effect analysis at group-level. Subjects (monkeys) are not treated as a random factor, so the level of inference is at the level of the group and cannot be extended to the population. An ANOVA with almost 5000 degrees of freedom and a very weak effect size (eta squared ranges from 0=no effect to 1=strong effect is reported to be = 0.01) should be reported cautiously in a generalist journal.</p><p>I propose to explicitly ask the authors to point out that the current statistics do not allow inference to the population.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this issue (which is inherent to almost every NHP study in our domain) in the discussion (p.17).

The coil is described in the methods as a 55 mm figure of eight coil. However, it is a universal convention in TMS to describe figure of eight coils by the outer diameter of each of the windings. Here it was used to describe the width of the whole coil. One realizes this only after taking the time to check the manufacturer's specifications. To confirm this, the legend of figure 1 reports the correct description, as a double 25 mm coil. This imprecision led to several misunderstandings (obviously a double 55 mm coil is too big for focality in a monkey brain, as I pointed out in my first review). I would suggest the authors be consistent in describing their methods and stick to international conventions. The problem of focality still persists, the intensity of stimulation indicated here are still very high, even with a small double 25 mm coil.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this now on page 4.</p><p>‘…the TMS coil (55 mm external diameter figure-of-eight, Magstim D25 branding iron style coil<bold>,</bold> with 25 mm windings )’.</p></body></sub-article></article>
