They consist of an integral membrane S-component (that binds substrate) and ECF module (that powers transport by ATP hydrolysis). It has been proposed that different S-components compete for docking onto the same ECF module, but a minimal liposome-reconstituted system, required to substantiate this idea, is lacking. Here, we co-reconstituted ECF transporters for folate (ECF-FolT2) and pantothenate (ECF-PanT) into proteoliposomes, and assayed for crosstalk during active transport. The kinetics of transport showed that exchange of S-components is part of the transport mechanism. Competition experiments suggest much slower substrate association with FolT2 than with PanT. Comparison of a crystal structure of ECF-PanT with previously determined structures of ECF-FolT2 revealed larger conformational changes upon binding of folate than pantothenate, which could explain the kinetic differences. Our work shows that a minimal in vitro system with two reconstituted transporters recapitulates intricate kinetics behaviour observed in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>vitamin uptake</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TOP grant 714.018.003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slotboom</surname><given-names>Dirk J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pardon</surname><given-names>Els</given-names></name><name><surname>Steyaert</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 731005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steyaert</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Instruct-ERIC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID 6357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guskov</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><name><surname>Slotboom</surname><given-names>Dirk J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integral membrane subunits of energy-coupling factor transporters associate with and dissociate from each other as part of the transport mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane protein complexes that mediate translocation of molecules across the bilayer fuelled by ATP hydrolysis. All ABC transporters contain two ATPase domains or subunits (also called Nucleotide Binding Domains, NBDs) that share highly conserved motifs, and two transmembrane subunits or domains (TMDs) (for reviews, see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">ter Beek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>). In prokaryotes three major classes of ABC transporters involved in import have been distinguished based on the fold of the transmembrane domains. In two of these classes (named Type I and Type II ABC transporters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>), extracellular or periplasmic proteins are required for substrate binding and delivery to the transporter, called substrate-binding proteins or domains (SBPs or SBDs).</p><p>The third class (Type III ABC transporters) consists of energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters. Like all ABC transporters, ECF transporters contain two cytosolic ATPases (often a heterodimer of EcfA and EcfA’) and two transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>), the latter with unique architectures. In ECF-type ABC transporters, the two membrane subunits are not related in structure, and only one transmembrane protein (EcfT) interacts with the NBDs via two long coupling helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>). The single membrane subunit EcfT and the two ATPases together form the so-called energy-coupling factor or ECF module. In contrast, in Type I and Type II ABC transporters, the membrane subunits are homologous or identical and both contain a coupling helix to transmit conformational changes from the NBDs to the transmembrane part of transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oldham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Locher et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Substrate binding in ECF transporters is mediated by the second integral membrane subunit, termed S-component. Despite their highly diverse amino acid sequences, all structurally-characterised S-components share a conserved core fold of six α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berntsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). It has been proposed that the association of the S-component with and dissociation from the ECF module are steps of the transport mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson et al., 1979a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpowich et al., 2015</xref>). In the solitary state, the α-helices of S-components adopt a classical transmembrane orientation (approximately perpendicular to the membrane plane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faustino et al., 2020</xref>), and the proteins invariably exhibit high affinity for their specific substrates, with low- to subnanomolar K<sub>D</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berntsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Slotboom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jochim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erkens et al., 2012</xref>). The high affinity allows them to scavenge scarce substrates from the environment. Association with the ECF complex has two consequences: First, the S-component topples over in the membrane, thereby moving the bound substrate across the membrane with some of the α-helical segments eventually orienting themselves parallel to the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>). Such a mechanism has been classified as ‘elevator-type’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garaeva and Slotboom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). Second, the substrate-binding site is disrupted, leading to facilitated release into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santos et al., 2018</xref>). While in ‘group I’ ECF transporters the ECF module is dedicated for interaction with a single S-component, in group II ECF transporters, the same ECF module can associate with different S-components, and hence be used to assist the transport of different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>). Organisms using group II ECF transporters produce the S-components according to the need for a particular substrate, which forces them to compete for the limiting amount of ECF modules for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henderson et al., 1979b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majsnerowska et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The unusual transport mechanism of group II transporters with a shared ECF module was hypothesised first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson et al., 1979a</xref>, who showed that transport of one vitamin in cells of <italic>Lactocbacillus casei</italic> is inhibited by other vitamins with complex inhibition kinetics. More recently, investigations in a heterologous expression system revealed that indeed different S-components can compete for a shared ECF module in a substrate-concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majsnerowska et al., 2015</xref>). In detergent solution, biochemical and structural studies have provided insight in the shared use of the ECF module and revealed a common interaction surface of different S-components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). The available data indicate that association and dissociation of S-components take place as a part of transport cycle, but a minimal experimental in vitro system with multiple ECF transporters reconstituted in proteoliposomes, is necessary to substantiate the observations.</p><p>Here, we used two purified group II ECF transporters from <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> (the folate transporter ECF-FolT2 and the pantothenate transporter ECF-PanT), which we reconstituted in liposomes to test whether competition between S-components is intrinsic to the proteins, or that it might be dependent on unidentified interaction partners present in the cellular environment. We chose to perform these studies on purified proteins in proteoliposomes instead of detergent solution because the detergent micelle could affect S-component dissociation and association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpowich et al., 2015</xref>). We also decided not to use membrane-mimicking systems such as lipid nanodiscs for the experiments, because they suffer from a limited size of the bilayer, which prevents reconstitution of multiple proteins, and may affect their association dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finkenwirth et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, lack of compartmentalisation in detergent or nanodiscs environment makes it impossible to assay vectorial transport. Using the proteoliposomes system we show that the subunit composition of ECF transporters is dynamic, with the S-components FolT2 and PanT associating with, and dissociating from the same ECF module. Moreover, while these integral membrane proteins compete for the same interaction site on the ECF module, the kinetics of competition differs for the two substrates. We conclude that dissociation of the S-component from ECF- transporter complex and subsequent association of the same or different S-component is a part of transport cycle. Because of the recurring association and dissociation of S-components, ECF transporters are a potential model for studying more general properties of membrane protein interactions in the lipid bilayers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> contains eight different S-components that make use of the same ECF module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Overbeek et al., 2005</xref>). To study the association with and dissociation from the ECF module we selected two S-components, namely FolT2, which is specific for folate and PanT, which is predicted to bind pantothenate. We overproduced and purified the complete complexes ECF-FolT2 and ECF-PanT each containing four subunits. In addition, we were able to purify large amounts of the solitary S-component FolT2 (in the absence of the ECF module) in a stable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). Solitary PanT was marginally stable in detergent solution in all tested conditions, and only small quantities of purified protein could be produced. Therefore, we designed our experiments in such a way that PanT was always purified in complex with the ECF module, but was allowed to dissociate from ECF module once reconstituted in the liposomes (see below). Only for a few crucial control experiments we used purified, solitary PanT.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>PanT and FolT2 form a functional transport complex with the same ECF module</title><p>The purified ECF-transporter complexes ECF-FolT2 and ECF-PanT were both active when reconstituted into proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and mediated ATP-dependent uptake of folate and pantothenate, respectively. The accumulation of radiolabelled substrate in the proteoliposomes’ lumen was strictly dependent on the presence of lumenal Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Transport of folate and pantothenate was possible only in the presence of a dedicated S-component. We could not detect transport of pantothenate by ECF-FolT2 or folate transport by ECF-PanT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), confirming that the substrate specificity of the ECF transporters is determined entirely by the specific S-components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transport of [<sup>3</sup>H]pantothenate and [<sup>3</sup>H]folate into proteoliposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yellow and white circles: Pantothenate uptake by ECF-PanT into proteoliposomes containing 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP or Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP in the lumen, respectively; Yellow squares: Pantothenate uptake by ECF-FolT2 into proteoliposomes containing 10 mM Mg-ATP in the lumen.

The apparent K<sub>m</sub> values for pantothenate and folate transport were in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2ab</xref>), consistent with the notion that ECF transporters are high-affinity scavengers of micronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodionov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rempel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duurkens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erkens and Slotboom, 2010</xref>). The dependence of the transport rates on the vitamin concentrations were hyperbolic, both for pantothenate and folate transport, indicating that there was no cooperativity, consistent with a single binding site in the S-component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). We also determined the dependence of the transport rates on the concentration of ATP, and found K<sub>m</sub> values in the mM range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2cd</xref>), in line with K<sub>m</sub> values reported for other ABC transporters. The dependence of the transport rates on the ATP concentration was sigmoidal, showing that there is cooperativity between the ATP binding sites. It is noteworthy that previous assays for ATPase instead of transport activity revealed hyperbolic relations between the ATP concentration and the hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karpowich et al., 2015</xref>). This observation underlines that care needs to be taken when using ATPase assays to obtain insight in the transport mechanism. While K<sub>m</sub> values and Hill coefficients were very similar for folate and pantothenate transport, the apparent maximal rates of transport differed somewhat for the two substrates, which may suggest intrinsic differences between transport mediated by FolT2 and PanT, but it must be noted that unequal activity losses during purification and reconstitution could also account for these differences. Moreover, both protein complexes can orient either in the right-side-out or inside-out orientation in the liposomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the apparent V<sub>max</sub> values are likely underestimations. In contrast, a mixed orientation does not affect the K<sub>m</sub> because the use of different chemical compositions in the lumenal and external solutions (ATP, transported substrate) allowed us to probe the uptake activity of proteins in the right-side-out orientation, with the proteins in the other orientation remaining ‘invisible’.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Determination of apparent K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values for pantothenate and folate transport.</title><p>(<bold>A,C</bold>) Initial rates of pantothenate transport by ECF-PanT into proteoliposomes as function of the pantothenate concentration (panel A, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP concentration 5 mM) or the ATP concentration (panel C, pantothenate concentration 100 nM).

Reconstitution of the solitary S-component FolT2 (Mw ~21 kDa) at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:250 (w/w), was expected to yield 26 protein molecules in each liposome.

The difference in sensitivity for the competing substrate in the panthothenate and folate transport assays could be a reflection of the considerable excess of FolT2 over PanT in the liposomes, as in each liposome on average one PanT molecule, and 26 molecules of FolT2 were present. To test whether the FolT2 excess could indeed explain the decreased sensitivity for added pantothenate, we reduced the amount of co-reconstituted FolT2 by fourfold to approximately seven FolT2 molecules per liposome. With the reduced amount of FolT2 in the liposomes, the inhibitory effect of pantothenate on folate uptake was indeed more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), showing that not only folate but also pantothenate enhances competition for the shared ECF module. However, there was a prominent difference in the dose-dependence of the effect of the competing substrate.

Comparison of the structures of the two transporter complexes might provide insight in the structural basis of the kinetic differences. While crystal structures of ECF-FolT2 from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> were determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>), structural information on ECF-PanT from the same organism is lacking. A structure of ECF-PanT form <italic>L. brevis</italic> is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), but the PanT protein from this organism shares only 36% sequence identity with the one from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic>, and thus may not be a suitable model. Therefore, we set out to determine a crystal structure of ECF-PanT from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic>, but despite extensive trials, suitable crystals were not found. To overcome this problem, we generated nanobodies against ECF-PanT that could be used as a crystallisation chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). One of the selected nanobodies (Nb81) bound with high affinity to the ECF module, and the ECF-PanT-Nb81 complex formed well-diffracting crystals. We solved a crystal structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.8 Å, the highest resolution for any ECF-transporter structure to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In the crystals, the asymmetric unit contains two copies of the ECF-PanT-Nb81 complex. The nanobodies are positioned centrally in the asymmetric unit, making extensive contacts with both copies of ECF-PanT in the unit, but do not participate in crystal contacts with proteins in neighbouring asymmetric units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, the nanobodies cause dimerisation of the ECF-PanT complex in detergent solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). An elaborate network of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, cation-π and π-π interactions between the nanobody and EcfA and EcfA’ seems to stabilise the protein in a single conformation, which may have aided crystal formation. Overall, the structure of ECF-PanT from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> is very similar to previously solved structures of ECF-FolT2 from the same organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), and also to ECF-PanT from and <italic>L. brevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), despite only 36% of sequence identity between the PanT subunits of the two organisms.

Second, the predicted substrate-binding site in ECF-PanT is located in a largely occluded cavity with a volume of 880 Å<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), whereas in ECF-FolT2 the site is fully accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. A non-protein patch of electron density was found in the substrate-binding cavity of PanT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7bc</xref>). Since pantothenate was not added at any stage during purification and crystallisation the density likely belongs to a molecule from the crystallisation condition, most probably citrate, which was present at a concentration of 70 mM. </p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Pantothenate binding pocket in ECF-PanT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding pocket (grey) of the PanT (yellow, secondary structure cartoon) EcfT is shown in ribbon representation, ATPases are not shown for clarity.

In the superfamily of ABC transporters, a small number of classical (Type I) importers exist where more than one SBP interacts with the same translocator complex. Different SBPs evolved as gene duplications followed by divergent evolution into two homologous proteins with different substrate specificities or substrate affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghimire-Rijal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higgins and Ames, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). In some cases the SBDs fused to TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fulyani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van der Heide and Poolman, 2002</xref>). Single molecule FRET studies on such fused proteins provided insight into the competing behavior of SBDs interacting with the shared translocator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gouridis et al., 2015</xref>). In all these cases, multiple substrate binding proteins interact with the shared transmembrane translocator, and competition of the SBPs or SBDs for the shared part of the transporter resembles what is observed in ECF transporters, but exceptionally, the latter transporters use integral membrane binding proteins (S-components) instead of SBPs, which compete with each other for the ECF module within the lipid bilayer environment.</p><p>To study the dynamic interaction and competition in ECF transporters in vitro, we had to find two group II ECF transporters from the same organism that were functional upon purification and reconstitution into the proteoliposomes. The transporters ECF-FolT2 and ECF-PanT from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> fulfilled these criteria. While ECF-FolT2 had been shown to transport folate in a reconstituted system before, we here show for the first time that purified and reconstituted ECF-PanT catalyses pantothenate transport. Co-reconstitution experiments showed that the S-components PanT and FolT2, which share only 21.5% sequence identity, dynamically associate with and dissociate from the common ECF module. Dynamic interaction in the lipid bilayer explains the observed transport of folate when an incomplete or inactive folate transporter (FolT2 alone, or FolT2 in complex with a mutated ECF module, respectively) was reconstituted together with fully active ECF-PanT complexes, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).The data strongly suggest that association and dissociation of S-components is an essential step in the transport mechanism in group II ECF transporters.</p><p>Remarkably, the rates of both folate and pantothenate transport were consistently higher in liposomes containing both ECF-PanT and FolT2 than in liposomes containing only ECF-FolT2 or ECF-PanT, respectively (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although this difference may originate from the reconstitution procedure, for instance the reconstitution efficiency might be affected on the total amount of purified protein used, it is also possible that it reflects a mechanistic feature of ECF transporters. The excess of FolT2 molecules in the co-reconstituted system might cause bilayer imperfections, which facilitate toppling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faustino et al., 2020</xref>) thus leading to increased transport rates. Further experimental work is needed to test this speculative explanation.</p><p>We showed that FolT2 and PanT, when bound to their respective transported substrates, compete for the same ECF module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), thereby nicely recapitulating previous in vivo work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson et al., 1979a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majsnerowska et al., 2015</xref>), from which it was deduced that substrate-bound S-components compete more efficiently for the ECF module than those without substrate. Also, the observation that the extent of inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]folate uptake by pantothenate and vice versa, depends on the relative amounts of the S-components in the proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), is fully consistent with published in vivo observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson et al., 1979a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majsnerowska et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since the number of substrate molecules that was transported into the lumen of the liposomes was higher than the number of ECF complexes present in the liposomal membranes, multiple turnovers per transporter complex occurred in the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>. Therefore, the observed competition is not caused by a half cycle leading to transporters in a dead-end conformation. Only for the folate transport experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, the data could suggest that less than one folate molecule is transported per ECF transporter. However, if we take into account that the proteins can reconstitute in two orientations in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>), and that most likely some activity was lost during the purification and reconstitution procedure, it is reasonable to assume that multiple turnovers also took place in this case. This conclusion is further supported by the notion that multiple (unlabelled) pantothenate molecules per protein complex must have been transported in the same experiment, as deduced from the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> where more than one turnover of the pantothenate transporter was observed when radiolabelled substrate was in an identical liposome preparation as used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>.</p><p>In the co-reconstituted system, we observed that increasing amounts of unlabelled folate compete with [<sup>3</sup>H]pantothenate uptake in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 0.5–50 μM folate. Surprisingly, this concentration regime is ~3 orders of magnitude higher than the K<sub>D</sub> for folate binding to FolT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>) and the K<sub>M</sub> for folate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To explain this discrepancy, we hypothesise that the binding of folate must be much slower than the binding of pantothenate, albeit not the rate-limiting step, as the V<sub>max</sub> values for substrate transport by both transporters are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The presumed slow substrate association does not lead to poor affinity of FolT2 for folate (the K<sub>D</sub> value for folate binding to FolT2 is in the nanomolar range), but is most likely caused by a slow conformational change in the protein, either preceding binding (conformational selection) or following an initial low affinity association (induced fit). In case of [<sup>3</sup>H]folate uptake, inhibition by pantothenate was also observed, but did not show dose-dependence in the 0.5–50 μM range, which suggests that pantothenate binding is faster compared to folate binding. Alternative explanations for the discrepancy, such as differences in the dissociation rate of PanT and FolT2 from the ECF module, affected additionally by the presence of substrate, are also possible but require more assumptions. For instance, to explain the folate dependence of competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and c</xref>) by slower dissociation of FolT2 than PanT from the ECF module, it is necessary to postulate that a state must exist in which the full complex (ECF module and FolT2) has an outward facing substrate-binding site of low affinity. There is currently no structural evidence for such a state.</p><p>In contrast, the explanation based on slow binding of folate to solitary FolT2 can be explained from a structural viewpoint, because crystal structures are available of the full complex ECF-FolT2 with the S-component in the apo state, and the S-component FolT1 alone with folate-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). The conformation of the full ECF-FolT2 complex was interpreted as an inward-open, post-release state, from which the transported substrate has been delivered in the cytoplasm, whereas the structure of the solitary S-component with bound folate was interpreted as a state in which substrate had been captured from the environment, before association with ECF module. Substantial structural differences between the folate-bound and <italic>apo</italic> S-component may explain the slow binding of folate, particularly in the conformations of loops L1 and L3 that strongly affect the binding site geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). To find a potential structural explanation for the apparent faster binding of pantothenate, we solved a crystal structure of ECF-PanT. Because the conformations of the ECF modules in ECF-PanT and ECF-FolT2 are very similar, we also interpret the ECF-PanT structure as a post-release state. Although we do not have a substrate-bound structure of solitary PanT for comparison, the analysis of the ECF-PanT structure provides clues about possible differences in kinetics of folate and pantothenate binding. First, the binding pocket in PanT is more occluded, with loops L1 and L3 not being splayed out as far as in the ECF-FolT2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Therefore, smaller conformational changes are expected upon pantothenate binding to PanT than folate binding to FolT2. Second, in contrast to what was observed in ECF-FolT2, residues in ECF-PanT that have been shown by mutational analysis to be important for binding of pantothenate (R101(95), N139(131), W69(64), residue numbers of PanT from <italic>L. brevis</italic> in parentheses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) all point towards the centre of the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6bc</xref>). This binding site geometry of the apo state again suggests that only minor rearrangements are needed for pantothenate binding. It may be argued that the structure of ECF-PanT from <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> presented here does not represent a true apo state, as a patch of electron density was found in the pocket, which likely results from a bound citrate molecule form the crystallisation condition. However, the binding site organisation in PanT is identical to that of a previously published structure of ECF-PanT from <italic>L. brevis</italic>, which represents a true apo state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and therefore citrate molecule does not appear to affect the geometry of binding site of the apo state.</p><p>Possibly, the presumed fast binding of pantothenate to PanT resembles that of thiamin binding to the S-component ThiT, where pre-steady-state fluorescence experiments showed rapid association kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Majsnerowska et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of ThiT, only a structure of the thiamin-bound S-component is available, and not a structure of the apo-full complex, which again makes a complete structural comparison as for ECF-FolT2 impossible. It is noteworthy that previously, the structures of FolT1 and ECF-FolT2 were interpreted as being consistent with fast binding kinetics, albeit without any experimental kinetics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>). The work presented here shows that care needs to be taken when extracting kinetic behavior from static structures.</p><p>In conclusion, the relatively simple reconstituted systems that we have used here, is sufficient to reproduce the competition between S-components for the same ECF module as observed in vivo, but in addition, more intricate kinetic differences between transport of folate and pantothenate also became apparent. Combining the kinetic measurements with structural analysis yielded a potential mechanistic explanation for the differences in association rates. More generally, because dissociation and association of S-components are essential steps in the transport cycle, and multiple S-components interact with the same ECF module, ECF transporters may serve as a model system for studying membrane protein interaction in the lipid bilayers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> subsp. <italic>bulgaricus</italic>)</td><td><italic>panT</italic></td><td>GenBank: CP002341.1</td><td valign="bottom">LDBND_0406</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia</italic> <italic>coli</italic>)</td><td>MC1061</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casadaban and Cohen, 1980</xref></td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>WK6</td><td>ATCC 47078</td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>L. delbrueckii</italic>)</td><td><italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> subsp. bulgaricus <break/>genomic DNA</td><td>DSMZ</td><td>DSM 20081</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBAD24_PanT</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Expression plasmids for PanT in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Using this condition, the crystallisation was set up in a bigger volume (2 μL protein and 2 μL precipitating solution) in 24-well hanging drop vapor diffusion plates combined with a streak seeding technique. Crystallisation plates were incubated at 5°C and rod-shaped crystals appeared within 2 weeks. Crystals were harvested from the drops, cryo-protected with a solution containing 70 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5 and 40% (v/v) PEG300, followed by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data collection and structure determination</title><p>Diffraction data for the Ecf PanT-Nanobody crystals were collected at 100 K at Diamond Light Source beamline I24 with the highest diffraction limit of 2.8 Å resolution. The crystal belongs to space group P1 (unit cell parameters: a = 97.290 Å, b = 110.470 Å, c = 110.500 Å, α=89.00<sup>o</sup>, β=102.27<sup>o</sup>, ɣ=102.24<sup>o</sup>). Data sets were indexed, integrated and scaled using the programs XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and molecular replacement was carried out with PHASER MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The <italic>apo</italic> ECF-FolT2 structure of <italic>L. delbruckii</italic> (PDB code 5JSZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swier et al., 2016</xref>) was used as a search model for the EcfA, EcfA’ and EcfT subunits.

To overcome this problem and to reduce possible bias, Rosetta-based MR was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DiMaio et al., 2011</xref>). The refinement was performed with Phenix refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>), with the model building done with COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the support and the use of resources of Instruct-ERIC (PID 6357), part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), Instruct-ULTRA (EU H2020 Grant 731005) and the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) for their support to the Nanobody discovery.

Previous in vivo experiments have suggested that various substrate-binding S-components of ECF-II ABC transporters in a bacterial species share a common ECF module, broadening the substrate specificity of the transport system. The definitive proof, however, has been long missing. In this paper, Setyawati and colleagues have used a reconstituted system to provide strong evidence for this theory, clearly establishing that the ECF module from <italic>Lactobacillusdekbrueckii</italic> can mediate transport of either folate or pantothenate, depending on the S-component binding domain. In addition, the authors solve the structure of ECF-PanT and find interesting differences between it and the previously determined structure of ECF-FolT2. This is a thoughtful and comprehensive set of experiments that represent a substantial technical achievement. Overall, the work provides a major advance in the understanding of this type of intriguing ABC transporters. The reviewers have some suggestions for improving the interpretation and presentation of the experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments themselves are quite complex, varying many components. It would be very helpful to have some kind of visual guide to what experiment is being done for each graph; perhaps a small cartoon of which proteins and substrates are present. In addition, adding color to the graphs, consistently across the work, could aid in guiding the readers' thinking.</p><p>2) The speculation regarding the effects of high concentrations of S-factor facilitating toppling (subsection “Exchange of S-components”) may go a bit far, given that it seems like only one of many possible explanations for the differences in rates. The reviewers suggest that this topic should be moved to and elaborated on in the Discussion.</p><p>3) In the competition experiment with co-reconstituted ECF-PanT and FolT2, the components are assumed to insert in either right-side- and inside-out orientation (subsection “Competition for a shared ECF module”, and Figure 5), which is reasonable. However, the directionality of proteins in other reconstituted systems is not discussed. As a result, it is unclear whether this would affect the interpretation of the experiment. For example, were all proteins assumed to be right-side-out in the experiments for measuring the Vmax (Figure 2)? Were some of the ECTs inside-out and therefore &quot;invisible&quot;? How would that affect the V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> calculations?</p><p>4) Do the authors have evidence regarding whether there is more than one turnover event per liposome? This seems like an important point for thinking about the differences between pantothenate and folate inhibition. Could the authors comment on whether the dynamics of SBD exchange might contribute to these differences (for example, differences in the dissociation rates of the apo PanT and FolT)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64389.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The experiments themselves are quite complex, varying many components.

Indeed, multiple turnover take place in the experiments (at least three to four in most experiments). We now added a discussion on this point:</p><p>“Since the number of substrate molecules that was transported into the lumen of the liposomes was higher than the number of ECF complexes present in the liposomal membranes, multiple turnovers per transporter complex occurred in the experiments presented in Figure 5A-C. […] This conclusion is further supported by the notion that multiple (unlabelled) pantothenate molecules per protein complex must have been transported in the same experiment, as deduced from the experiment presented in Figure 5C where more than one turnover of the pantothenate transporter was observed when radiolabelled substrate was in an identical liposome preparation as used for Figure 5D.”</p><p>We have added a brief discussion on the possibility that alternative steps could explain the differences between pantothenate and folate inhibition:</p><p>“Alternative explanations for the discrepancy, such as differences in the dissociation rate of PanT and FolT2 from the ECF module, affected additionally by the presence of substrate, are also possible but require more assumptions. For instance, to explain the folate dependence of competition (Figure 5A and C) by slower dissociation of FolT2 than PanT form the ECF module, it is necessary to postulate that a state must exist in which the full complex (ECF module and FolT2) has an outward facing substrate binding site of low affinity. There is currently no structural evidence for such a state.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
