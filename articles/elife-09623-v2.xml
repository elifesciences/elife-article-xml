The effect of carbon black (CB), a universal constituent of smoke derived from the incomplete combustion of organic material, in smokers and non-smokers is less known. In this study, we show that insoluble nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB) accumulates in human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from emphysematous lung and in CD11c<sup>+</sup> lung antigen presenting cells (APC) of mice exposed to smoke. Likewise, nCB intranasal administration induced emphysema in mouse lungs. Delivered by smoking or intranasally, nCB persisted indefinitely in mouse lung, activated lung APCs, and promoted T helper 17 cell differentiation through double-stranded DNA break (DSB) and ASC-mediated inflammasome assembly in phagocytes. Increasing the polarity or size of CB mitigated many adverse effects. Thus, nCB causes sterile inflammation, DSB, and emphysema and explains adverse health outcomes seen in smokers while implicating the dangers of nCB exposure in non-smokers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09623.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09623.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09623.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Smoking for many years damages the lungs and leads to a disease called emphysema that makes it difficult to breathe and is often deadly. There are thousands of chemicals in cigarette smoke and many of them have been linked to the development of lung cancer, although it has been difficult to pinpoint those that are responsible for smoking-related emphysema. Moreover, cigarette smoke also contains large numbers of small particles and relatively little is known about the role played by these particles in smoking-related disease.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of long-term smoking is a blackening of the lung tissue that persists even if someone stops smoking. Previously, little was known about the composition of the substance that causes this blackening, or its significance in the development of emphysema. Now, by studying lung tissue taken from smokers with emphysema, You et al. have shown that this black substance is made of nano-sized particles of a material called carbon black (which is also known as elemental carbon). These nanoparticles are produced by the incomplete combustion of the cigarettes. You et al. also confirmed that nanoparticles of carbon black can cause emphysema in mice.</p><p>Closer examination of the lung damage caused by the nanoparticles revealed that they trigger breakages in DNA, which leads to inflammation of the lung. And because the nanoparticles cannot be cleared, they are released into the lung when cells die, which perpetuates lung inflammation and damage.</p><p>You et al. then went on to show that nanoparticles of carbon black can be modified in a way that allows them to be cleared from the lungs. Such modifications could potentially protect people who are exposed to carbon black nanoparticles in the environment or in workplaces where carbon black is used, such as factories that produce automobile tires and other rubber products.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09623.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09623.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>Th17</kwd><kwd>emphysema</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL117181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corry</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kheradmand</surname><given-names>Farrah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VA Merit Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corry</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kheradmand</surname><given-names>Farrah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The accumulation of carbon black nanoparticles in smokers' lungs causes sterile inflammation, double-strand DNA breaks and emphysema.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco smoking is linked to a long and growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Carter et al., 2015</xref>) list of fatal illnesses (e.g., emphysema, cancer, and stroke) and is the major preventable cause of human death. Despite public awareness of the harmful effects of smoking, in many large developing countries the prevalence of smoking is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eriksen et al., 2014</xref>). Compounding this risk is particulate air pollution due to the combustion of organic materials including biomass fuels, slash and burn agriculture, and coal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furlaneto et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arif et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dadvand et al., 2014</xref>). While our understanding of the immune basis of smoke-induced sterile inflammation has increased, the molecular mechanism underlying emphysema and its persistence despite smoking cessation remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kheradmand et al., 2012</xref>). Even less is known regarding the health-related inhalation effects of atmospheric and workplace airborne carbon particulates.</p><p>Innate immune cells such as alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are recruited to the lungs in response to cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salvi, 2014</xref>). Several human studies and pre-clinical models of smoke-induced emphysema have also confirmed that lymphocytes (T and B cells) and lung antigen presenting cells (APCs) play pathogenic roles in chronic lung inflammation in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churg et al., 2012b</xref>). Prior work has shown that increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17A are among the most important hallmarks of smoke-mediated lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). We and others have previously shown that IL-17A plays a critical role in smoke-induced emphysema in humans and in mouse models of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). Further, adoptive transfer of lineage-negative CD11c<sup>+</sup> myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) isolated from the lungs of smoke-exposed mice to naive mice recapitulates smoke-induced lung disease, indicating a direct causal relationship between mDC and emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these advances, the mechanism by which smoke induces the inflammatory mDC phenotype remains completely unknown.</p><p>Tobacco smoke contains many noxious chemicals (e.g., carbon monoxide, sulfur, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, and methane), aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylene) and chlorinated (e.g., methyl chloride, chloroethene, and chloroform) volatile organic compounds, as well as particulate matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfetti and Rodgman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salvi, 2014</xref>). One or more of these agents is thought to underlie the carcinogenic potential of smoke, involving at least eight different cancers; accordingly, the role of volatile carcinogens found in smoke has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pope et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Carter et al., 2015</xref>). Far less is known about the pathogenic effects of particulate matter that is suspended in smoke and which includes nanoparticulate carbon, metal oxides, and inorganic salts. Histopathological analysis of the lungs of heavy smokers invariably reveals dark-staining anthracotic pigment often attributed to poorly soluble material found in tobacco smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchev et al., 2002</xref>). Anthracotic pigment is also found in the lymph nodes of smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churg et al., 2005</xref>), but its chemical composition and potential contribution to smoking-related diseases have not been explored.</p><p>In this study, we show that the anthracotic material found in the lung of human smokers is nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB), a hydrophobic material that accumulates specifically in highly activated CD1a<sup>+</sup> lung APCs. Raman spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to confirm this observation and show that nCB further accumulates in the lung and APC of mice exposed to smoke. Moreover, we show that nCB given by inhalation to mice in amounts that are comparable to human exposures is alone sufficient to cause sterile inflammation and induce robust T helper 17 cell (Th17) responses and emphysema, implicating the potential health risks of airborne nCB that contaminates a wide range of workplace and domestic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection of nCB in lungs of smokers</title><p>In contrast to the white or pink appearance of normal lungs, the lungs of heavy smokers are typically dark brown or black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churg et al., 2005</xref>). During the routine preparation of lung phagocytic cells including CD1a<sup>+</sup> mDCs and APCs, we observed the same anthracotic pigmentation in lung cells from smokers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), whereas the same cells isolated from non-smokers lacked the pigment. We previously showed that activated mDCs from smokers and smoke-exposed mice promote Th1 and Th17 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2012</xref>). To determine the nature of the anthracotic pigment from mDCs, we first performed HR-TEM of the residual black material after complete proteolytic digestion of human emphysematous lung and observed the aggregates that were composed of 20–50 nm spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further extend these observations, we examined CD1a<sup>+</sup> mDCs from human emphysematous lung tissue using Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral mapping which showed the signature for pure nCB and not inorganic salts or metal oxides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>). Thus, nCB is extensively deposited as solid material in the lungs of smokers and specifically accumulates in lung APC.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09623.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Carbon black (CB) deposition in the lungs of patients with emphysema.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of lung CD1a<sup>+</sup> cells from a smoker with emphysema and a control subject.

To determine the mechanism of nCB-mediated lung pathology, we next investigated whether its physicochemical properties could account for its immunostimulatory function. Whether manufactured or found in the lungs of smokers with emphysema, nCB is very hydrophobic and completely insoluble in aqueous media. Conjugating polyethylene glycol to nCB (PEG-nCB) renders the material hydrophilic and miscible with aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>).

Further, we detected less anthracotic pigment in the lung parenchyma, suggesting that in contrast to hydrophobic nCB, PEG-nCB could be cleared from the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

A characteristic feature of the anthracotic pigment of smokers' lungs is that such discoloration persists even long after smoking has ceased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churg et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we addressed the role of insoluble anthracotic pigment that is universally found in the lungs of smokers with emphysema in driving this pathological response. Although several chemical identities have been proposed, our study is the first to clearly identify the anthracotic pigment as nCB and show that it accumulates specifically in human lung phagocytic cells. Our functional studies are also the first to show that nCB administered to the lungs in pathophysiologically relevant amounts can induce sterile inflammation and emphysema that is indistinguishable from disease induced by exposure to cigarette smoke in mice. Thus, nCB is likely the major component of smoke that causes long-term lung toxicity. Furthermore, our findings have major implications regarding the safety of activities involving the chronic inhalation of smoke and the need to control the particulate composition of air. Since nCB is used extensively in the rubber, plastics, and composites industries, the exposure levels should also be controlled in the workplace.</p><p>Our findings also elucidate both the nature of and the mechanism by which inflammation in the lungs of heavy cigarette smokers is perpetuated even long after cessation of cigarette smoking. Both chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and inhalation of nCB mediate similar inflammatory responses that are characterized by the activation of lung mDCs, differentiation and accumulation of Th17 cells, and lung parenchymal destruction (emphysema) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). In part, this sterile inflammatory response to nCB is due to activation of the inflammasome pathway. Specifically, we found that inhaled nCB induces the production of IL-1β and IL-6, two pro-inflammatory cytokines that are required for mDC-mediated differentiation of Th17 cells and emphysema development. This inflammation persists and lung damage continues to accumulate even after smoking cessation due to the insoluble nature of nCB. Although readily taken up by phagocytic lung cells that could theoretically be expectorated or migrate out of the lungs via the lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corry et al., 1984</xref>), these cells most likely undergo cell death too rapidly in response to nCB ingestion for any of these potential clearance mechanisms to operate efficiently. The nCB is then released in the lung by the cells it kills, only to be taken up again and kill subsequent phagocytes. nCB thus establishes an unending cycle of cell death that, if sufficiently pronounced, will trigger activation of the inflammasome pathway in response to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piccinini and Midwood, 2010</xref>). Immune responses both rapidly kill invading pathogens and solubilize antigenic and adjuvant-like pathogen-derived substances to facilitate their removal and thus terminate the potentially deleterious inflammation. Both of these fundamental immune functions are thwarted in the context of nCB accumulation, leading to a perpetual cycle of lung inflammation and damage.</p><p>Our findings, therefore, raise concerns that other insoluble environmental nanoparticles may, if inhaled, accumulate in lung phagocytic cells and induce similar pathology. In support of this, inflammasome-activated IL-1β has been shown to play a major role in lung sterile inflammation induced by other nanoparticles associated with lung diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merget et al., 2002</xref>). ASC is required for the assembly of pro-caspase 1 in order to yield caspase 1 for the activation of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franchi and Nunez, 2012</xref>). We show that inhaled nCB can activate the inflammasome pathway that results in production of mature IL-1β. In addition, inflammasome sensors activated by nCB-damaged cells require ASC activation because lung mDCs isolated from <italic>Pycard</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice failed to increase IL-1β and showed attenuated Th17 responses. A critically important physical feature of nCB, accounting in large part for its pro-inflammatory potential, is its hydrophobic character. Exposure to large quantities of hydrophobic nCB has been shown to induce cell injury, pyroptosis and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reisetter et al., 2011</xref>). One particular characteristic of nCB that correlates with its toxicity is its large surface area; larger forms of elemental carbon have much less potential to induce cell injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oberdörster et al., 2005</xref>) and, as we have shown here, damage DNA.</p><p>A single burning cigarette can generate approximately 10<sup>12</sup> particles that vary in size from 1 micron to a few nanometers in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>). The deposition site of particulate matter in the lungs of smokers is governed largely by size, with larger particles depositing in the mouth and upper airway while smaller particles are deposited in progressively smaller and more distal airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Dixon, 2006</xref>). For our studies, we used nCB spheroids with a nominal size of 15 nm that aggregate in clusters of 3–4, forming 50–75 nm per particle. However, in aqueous solution, this material forms macro-aggregates that fail to distribute evenly in the lung after intranasal challenge as does nCB delivered by smoke inhalation. We were partially successful in alleviating this confounding factor by adding sucrose to the nCB in aqueous solution. Nonetheless, although we endeavored to deliver nCB to mice in amounts that matched actual burdens found in human lung, it is likely that we did not fully recapitulate the in vivo particle size and distribution of nCB acquired through smoke inhalation. Further studies are required to define how nCB size affects in vivo toxicity as defined in these studies.</p><p>Thermal and chemical analyses have shown that a combustion heat of 350–550°C yields black carbon (BC) that contains PAHs that are linked to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleck et al., 2006</xref>), but combustion at much higher temperatures (650–1100°C) produces PAH-free CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watson et al., 2005</xref>); we used this material heated to higher temperatures for intranasal administration in mice. A critical question related to our studies is, therefore, which form of carbon, BC or CB, is deposited in the lung during smoking, and how much do PAHs contribute to smoking-related lung inflammation. The nCB used in our studies lacked detectable PAHs by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, which has a sensitivity limit of 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup> by mass. While PAHs are present in soot and diesel exhaust particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garza et al., 2008</xref>), neither Raman spectroscopy nor hyperspectral imaging can distinguish CB from BC as could be found in human lungs. However, X-ray analysis of the melting of small metal particles has revealed the temperature distribution inside a burning cigarette as 850–920°C during active inhalation, decreasing to 700°C during the smoldering phase; this temperature regime is consistent with the creation of predominant CB during smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 1974</xref>). Moreover, as PAH-free CB recapitulates almost entirely the pathology induced by smoke exposure, we conclude that sterile inflammation and pulmonary emphysema are primarily the result of CB accumulation in the lung and not that of BC or PAHs therein during smoking.</p><p>Among signaling pathways that are important for APC activation and inflammation, we found that phosphorylation of Erk was significantly upregulated in cells exposed to CB treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner while phosphorylation of p38 or JNK were not changed. The most notable, and unexpected, result of our RPPA analysis was the upregulation of several DNA damage enzymes by nCB exposure. This led us to confirm that nano-sized CB induces DSB in DNA as detected by the expression of γH2AX, an ATM-regulated pathway. We show that larger forms of CB result in attenuation of DSB, indicating that the size of CB is an important factor in its genotoxicity. Activation of this DNA repair pathway is in turn linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β that are required for Th17 differentiation. In addition, microRNA-22 (miR-22) has been shown to be upregulated in lung APC of mice exposed to smoke or nCB and is critical in Th17 responses through activation of AP-1 complexes and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, together with DAMPs released by cells killed by nCB, nCB-induced DNA damage accounts for much of the inflammatory nature of nCB. The mechanism by which nCB cleaves DNA and the additional biological consequences of this adverse property remain active areas of investigation in our laboratory.</p><p>In summary, our findings show that inhalation of cigarette smoke leads to the accumulation of nCB in airway APCs (macrophages and mDCs). This insoluble material promotes perpetual Th17 cell-mediated lung inflammation in part through the double-stranded cleavage of nuclear DNA. These findings largely explain the persistent and incurable nature of smoking-related lung disease. Because no medical means of removing accumulated lung nCB exists, our findings underscore the need for all individuals and societies to minimize the production of and exposure to smoke-related particulate air pollution and industrial nCB.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>Pycard</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (C57BL/6 background; Pycard encodes for Asc protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mariathasan et al., 2004</xref>]) were obtained from Dr Vishva Dixit (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Two of the three reviewers, Edwin Blalock and Dean Sheppard, have agreed to share their identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper describes a remarkable series of studies that fundamentally change our understanding of the toxicity of nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB) and its role in sterile inflammation and emphysema. The authors show that nCB accumulates in myeloid dendritic cells in lungs from emphysema patients and also in antigen presenting cells (APC) in a smoking mouse model of emphysema. Like cigarette smoke, nCB administration into the always induced emphysema in mice and such nCB persisted indefinitely in mouse lungs. nCB apparently causes disease by activating lung APC which promote Th17 helper cell differentiation via double stranded DNA break and ASC-mediated inflammasome assembly in phagocytes. The adverse effects of nCB can be negated by increasing particulate size or decreasing hydrophobicity.</p><p>Overall, this paper epitomizes translational medicine. It covers the gamut from state-of-the-art chemistry to demonstrate that nCB is a prominent component of smoke toxicity and is the likely anthracotic pigment in emphysematous lungs to showing that nCB can cause emphysema in mice. Furthermore, the authors work out the molecular as well as cellular mechanisms of nCB's toxic effects. Lastly, the authors suggest ways by which nCB toxicity can be mitigated. Experimentally the study is a tour-de-force of state-of-the-art technologies that have yielded very convincing results. These in turn have provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of a key environmental pollutant.</p><p>However, there are a few pending issues that we would like to see addressed in a revised submission:</p><p>1) As for the method used to assess the presence of emphysema, most papers in this field utilize more than one method to increase the confidence that emphysema is present and accurately measured. Without performing any new exposures, the authors could add data on mean linear intercept or another quantitative assessment of lung morphology and of lung density obtained from the same CT scans used to calculate lung volume. This is especially important given the relatively small size of the changes in lung volume seen and the small sample sizes. Moreover, the lung volume data should be shown without zero suppression on the y axis so readers could accurately see the small effect size.</p><p>2) It is nice that the authors showed much of their data as scatter plots rather than simply bar graphs, since these are much more informative representations of small samples. The authors should use this format of data presentation throughout the manuscript. It would also be preferable to present the data on T regs in Figure 3–figure supplements 3-6 as actual percentages rather than fold change, to give readers a better sense of the variability among control samples.</p><p>3) Support for the authors' conclusion that the pathway by which nCB promotes Th17 cell differentiation and emphysema involves DNA damage and Erk activation could be strengthened if the authors included evidence that inhibition of Erk signaling inhibits both IL-17A production and IL-6 production. It would also be helpful to provide evidence about whether or not these events were ordered in the same pathway, for example by determining whether inhibition of DNA damage responses decreases activation of Erk. It would also be helpful to assess the specificity of the pharmacologic effects shown, for example by providing parallel data on the effects of the same range of U0126 concentrations on Erk phosphorylation in the cells under study.</p><p>4) NLRP3 is the only inflammasome that is known to respond to particulate matter and danger signals in sterile inflammation. Therefore, the authors should perform the same experiment in <italic>Nlrp3</italic> knockout mice (should be easily accessible) similarly as they have done with the ASC knockout mice. This will make the inflammasome part more complete and convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09623.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) As for the method used to assess the presence of emphysema, most papers in this field utilize more than one method to increase the confidence that emphysema is present and accurately measured.

Moreover, the lung volume data should be shown without zero suppression on the y axis so readers could accurately see the small effect size.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the referees’ suggestion to include a second method to assess emphysema. The quantitative CT lung volume measurements in this protocol have been validated independently using mean linear intercept (MLI) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al. 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shan et al. 2014</xref>, Yuan et al. 2015). However in response to this comment, we have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig6">Figures 2, 3, 4 and 6</xref> that now include corresponding MLI measurements and confirm lung destruction in addition to the quantitative CT data.</p><p>In response to the second concern regarding the effect size of nCB on lung parenchyma destruction (emphysema), we show here that mice exposed to nCB develop approximately 25 to 35% emphysema when compared to PBS control. This change in lung volume (% emphysema) is statistically significant, and is slightly greater than exposure to 4 months of cigarette smoke in the same strain of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shan et al. 2012</xref>). These findings couldn’t be directly compared to smoke-induced lung disease in humans, nevertheless lung destruction at 20-30% is strongly associated with end-stage emphysema in smokers (Coxson et al. 2013, Hesselbacher et al. 2011). Further, in this report, as well as in prior publications, we show lung volume data in such a way to minimize the blank space in the figures (Shan 2014 et al., Yuan et al. 2015). Changing this parameter will result in inclusion of a larger area of space in each figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, to keep the figure flow consistent, we used the zero suppression; however if our reviewers feel that leaving blank spaces in the figures is necessary, we would revise all 8 panels accordingly.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09623.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Lung volume and MLI figures without zero suppression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09623.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09623.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09623-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) It is nice that the authors showed much of their data as scatter plots rather than simply bar graphs, since these are much more informative representations of small samples.

It would also be preferable to present the data on T regs in Figure 3–figure supplements 3-6 as actual percentages rather than fold change, to give readers a better sense of the variability among control samples.</italic></p><p>We have revised our figures to show individual data points throughout the manuscript. In response to the reviewers’ concern regarding small sample size, we would like to point out that while each panel in the figures may show data points for 4 to 6 mice in each group, the data are representative of at least 2 or 3 independent experiments. Therefore our findings are statistically significant within each experiment and are reproducible. We have revised the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3 fig3s4 fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplements 3-5</xref> to show percentages of Tregs from four independent experiments. We hope that these changes address the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p><italic>3) Support for the authors' conclusion that the pathway by which nCB promotes Th17 cell differentiation and emphysema involves DNA damage and Erk activation could be strengthened if the authors included evidence that inhibition of Erk signaling inhibits both IL-17A production and IL-6 production.

Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed decreased phosphorylation of Erk in response to Nu7026 and U0126 (in a dose-dependent manner) but not Ku55933.

Interestingly, although NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome in relation to danger signals, other molecules (e.g. AIM2), have been shown to recognize cytosolic dsDNA (Cavlar, Ablasser and Hornung 2012, Hornung et al. 2009, Hornung and Latz 2010). Because ASC is critical in the inflammasome-mediated IL-1β activation pathway, we opted to examine the general role of inflammasome using <italic>ASC</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and these mice became available to us through the generosity of Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech). Furthermore, at the time of our initial investigation <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice were not commercially available. These mice have recently become available for purchase from the Jackson laboratory ($205.9/mouse priced in 8-2015), but we were informed that an order of 10 mice could only be shipped within approximately 2-3 months after the purchase. Because our nCB experimental protocol requires an additional of 2-3 months to complete and be analyzed (i.e., a total of six months delay) we believe that the excessive time required to fully address a confirmatory role for NLRP3 would be beyond the 2-month timeline provided to us for revision of the current manuscript. Therefore, while we agree with the need for future studies, we would like to ask the referees to allow this new work to be deferred to future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
