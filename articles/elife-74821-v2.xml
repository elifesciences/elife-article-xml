lateral positions. Little is known about what controls the precise timing of angioblast migration and their final destination at the midline. Using zebrafish, we found that midline angioblast migration requires neighboring tissue rearrangements generated by somite morphogenesis. The somitic shape changes cause the adjacent notochord to separate from the underlying endoderm, creating a ventral midline cavity that provides a physical space for the angioblasts to migrate into. The anterior to posterior progression of midline angioblast migration is facilitated by retinoic acid-induced anterior to posterior somite maturation and the subsequent progressive opening of the ventral midline cavity. Our work demonstrates a critical role for somite morphogenesis in organizing surrounding tissues to facilitate notochord positioning and angioblast migration, which is ultimately responsible for creating a functional cardiovascular system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinoic acid</kwd><kwd>dorsal aorta</kwd><kwd>cardinal vein</kwd><kwd>angioblasts</kwd><kwd>somite morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>vasculogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1452928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Benjamin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Benjamin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulissen</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retinoic acid-dependent somite morphogenesis induces notochord-endoderm separation required for midline angioblast migration and axial blood vessel development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early organismal development relies on a variety of tissues that collectively organize into a functional body plan. In the trunk of the vertebrate embryo, many tissues are differentiating at once and often interact with one another to influence their definitive structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McMillen and Holley, 2015</xref>). The axial (notochord), paraxial (somites), and lateral (angioblasts and other tissues) mesoderm begins to be specified during gastrulation, and new cells are added to these tissues from posteriorly localized progenitor cells as they expand after gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimelman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Row et al., 2016</xref>). By the end of embryogenesis, the notochord is a prominent midline tissue of the trunk and provides structural support to the body and signals that pattern adjacent tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glickman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>). Pairs of somites flank either side of the notochord and give rise to tissues that include the skeletal muscle, tendons, and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tani et al., 2020</xref>). Ventral to the notochord and between the somites, the axial vasculature structures of the dorsal aorta and posterior cardinal vein distribute blood throughout the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogan and Bautch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Isogai et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>During somitogenesis, newly formed somites undergo a maturation event in which they change their morphology from a cuboidal shape to a chevron shape and extend in the dorsal-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tlili et al., 2019</xref>). Many cellular rearrangements and mechanical stresses contribute to making the final definitive somite shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollway et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tlili et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yin and Solnica-Krezel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Youn and Malacinski, 1981</xref>). At the same time that somites are changing shape, endothelial progenitors called angioblasts arise in the lateral plate mesoderm and migrate to the midline of the embryo to form the axial vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, angioblast migration and new somite formation occur in an anterior to posterior progression, with a wave of angioblast migration happening slightly after the wave of somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yabe and Takada, 2016</xref>). Despite these two events occurring in close temporal and physical proximity to one another, it is not clear how they influence one another during this developmental stage. While some evidence has shown a relationship between somites and blood vessel patterning, much of this research focused on angiogenic sprouting or arterial-venous specification, well after angioblast migration and somitogenesis is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Therapontos and Vargesson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Torres-VÃ¡zquez et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Loss-of-function mutation of the notochord specifying gene <italic>noto</italic> results in nonautonomous migration defects of angioblasts as they move to the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fouquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helker et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of <italic>noto,</italic> the notochord adopts a somitic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fouquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Talbot et al., 1995</xref>). The requirement of notochord specification for angioblast migration suggested that the notochord may act to attract angioblasts to the midline. This model was further explored when a notochord-derived secreted factor named <italic>apela</italic> (also known as <italic>toddler/elabela</italic>) was discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). This small peptide is expressed in the notochord and when mutated caused angioblast migration defects. However, <italic>apela</italic> loss of function also causes defects in mesoderm and endoderm formation prior to notochord and angioblast specification via gastrulation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>noto</italic> loss of function causes morphological changes that could interfere with angioblast migration, including a broad expansion of somite tissue near the developing blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halpern et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, although it appears that mutations that affect notochord development can disrupt angioblast migration, the exact mechanism of this effect is not clear.</p><p>As new somites form during body axis extension, they secrete all-trans retinoic acid (RA). RA is a metabolic derivative of vitamin A, and a series of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases convert vitamin A into RA in specific locations of the embryo including newly formed somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duester, 2008</xref>). RA acts as a morphogen with broad roles during vertebrate embryogenesis. Some of these include the development of the limb, skeleton, hindbrain, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heine et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lohnes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mendelsohn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niederreither et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sandell et al., 2007</xref>). Although involved in many processes, RA has a particular influence over the maturation of mesoderm and somitic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamade et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janesick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janesick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>). While RA is notably involved in ensuring the bilateral symmetry of the somites, it is ultimately dispensable for axis elongation in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berenguer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernheim and Meilhac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamade et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar and Duester, 2014</xref>). Based on the timing of somite-derived RA signaling activity relative to when angioblasts migrate to the midline, we speculated it may be involved in midline angioblast migration.</p><p>Here, we show that RA-mediated somite maturation is required for the proper formation of the axial vasculature through a nonautonomous role in inducing morphological changes in surrounding tissues. A process we call notochord-endoderm separation (NES) occurs prior to angioblast migration, wherein the dorsal translocation of the notochord during development leads to its separation from the endoderm along the dorsal-ventral axis to generate a transient cavity we refer to as the ventral midline cavity (VMC). The angioblasts migrate toward and eventually into the VMC after NES. The induction of NES and the VMC is somite maturation dependent, and a delay or failure in NES can cause systemic angioblast migration defects. This evidence places somite maturation as a critical event that is required for NES and the development of the axial vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinoic acid promotes convergence of angioblasts to the midline and the formation of the axial vasculature</title><p>To determine if RA signaling impacts angioblast migration, we made time-lapse videos of <italic>tg(kdrl:GFP</italic>) embryos, which express GFP in angioblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). Embryos were mounted at the 10-somite stage and their migration was observed over a 3 hr time period. Wild-type angioblasts migrated to the midline in a manner consistent with previously described research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>). To determine what effect the loss of RA would have on the migrating angioblasts, we generated <italic>aldh1a2</italic> mutants with the <italic>tg(kdrl:GFP</italic>) angioblast reporter in the background. Time-lapse imaging of these embryos shows defects in angioblast migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), which was also confirmed by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Three other methods of disrupting RA signaling caused the same phenotype. Loss of RA by treatment with N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) (an inhibitor of the Aldh family, including Aldh1a2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan et al., 2015</xref>), the small-molecule retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha and gamma inhibitor (BMS453), or expression of a dominant negative RARa using the <italic>Tg(hsp70l:eGFP-dnHsa.RARA</italic>) transgenic line (hereafter referred to as <italic>HS:dnRAR</italic>) all caused midline migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brilli Skvarca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâE</xref>). Angioblasts in these embryos show delayed migration with disorganized anterior to posterior processivity. To determine if addition of RA accelerated angioblast migration as well as anterior to posterior processivity, we compared the angioblast migration patterns of 10-somite stage <italic>tg(kdrl:GFP</italic>) embryos treated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 0.1 Î¼M RA at the tailbud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, respectively). Angioblasts in the DMSO-treated embryos migrate normally, but the angioblasts treated with RA had prematurely initiated migration and arrived earlier to the midline during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, respectively, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). To determine the rate at which angioblasts reach the midline, we quantified the percentage of GFP fluorescence at the midline in relation to the total amount of fluorescence for the both wild-type and <italic>aldh1a2-/-</italic>. We defined angioblast fluorescence as reaching the midline if they are settled beneath the notochord. The <italic>aldh1a2</italic>-/- embryos show very low percentage fluorescence at the midline, relative to total fluorescence, compared to wild-type embryos 4 hr after observation, when angioblast migration is largely complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). On the other hand, fluorescence was higher at the midline in embryos treated with RA than in DMSO-treated control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>). This shows that RA is necessary and sufficient for promoting angioblast migration to the midline. To determine at which stage RA is needed for angioblasts to migrate to the midline, we administered DEAB at different stages of development. Inhibition of RA at tailbud stage caused the angioblast migration defect, but treatment at the five-somite stage resulted in normal migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, respectively), thus establishing the critical developmental window for RA signaling regulation of midline angioblast migration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retinoic acid (RA) is required prior to segmentation for angioblast migration.</title><p>(<bold>AâD</bold>) Dorsal view of <italic>tg(kdrl:eGFP</italic>) embryos with representative images taken every 60 min over the course of 180 min, in (<bold>A</bold>) untreated (N = 12, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>aldh1a2</italic>-/- mutants (N = 12, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), (<bold>C</bold>) DMSO-treated (N = 10), or (D) 0.1 ÂµM RA-treated embryos (N = 8, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

Embryos sectioned at the 12-somite stage showed premature angioblast migration to the midline and NES, indicating that angioblast migration and NES are responsive to exogenous RA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Angioblasts continue to be at the midline at the 15-somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The 18-somite stage embryos were not available as posterior elongation discontinued in prolonged RA exposure, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin and Kimelman, 2010</xref>). To determine whether angioblast migration and NES were attenuated in RA-depletion conditions, embryos were treated with DEAB and sectioned at the 12-somite, 15-somite, 18-somite, and 21-somite stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâI</xref>, respectively). At the 12-somite stage, the angioblasts are localized in the lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Focusing on the midline of the embryo, we observe that the notochord remains flush against the endoderm with no visible VMC or NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). At the 15-somite stage, we observe some midline movement of the angioblasts; however, the notochord remains flush against the endoderm and no angioblasts have been able to reach the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). During the 18-somite stage, a small VMC has formed between the notochord and endoderm. The leading angioblasts have partially migrated into this VMC; however, the bulk of the angioblasts still reside outside of the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). By the 21-somite stage, the angioblasts have largely resolved to the midline, although with some angioblasts still residing outside the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><p>Given the pronounced delays in NES formation for anterior regions in RA-depleted embryos, we suspected that NES was a consequence of the known processive somite maturation that begins in the anterior regions and progresses posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stern and Piatkowska, 2015</xref>). We sectioned 15-somite stage <italic>tg</italic>(<italic>HS:lifeact</italic>)<italic>, tg(kdrl:e</italic>GFP) embryos in the anterior and posterior regions corresponding to the 5th and 12th somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In more immature 12th somite, angioblasts reside in their lateral regions and NES is not pronounced (white dashed lines outline the somites, and yellow brackets show the distance from the notochord to the ventral endoderm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). In the fifth somite of the same embryo, angioblasts reside at the midline and NES is very pronounced, indicating that NES occurs anterior to posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). The lack of angioblasts at the 12th somite, and low NES, is similar to the DEAB-treated embryos sectioned at the more mature 5th somite position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>).</p><p>To quantify how the dorsal translocation of the notochord was correlated with angioblasts arriving to the midline, we created a two-variable graph to measure both the distance of the notochord to the ventral endoderm and the percentage of angioblasts arriving at the midline for a given somite. For this analysis, we used 15-somite stage embryos sectioned at the 5th somite and 12th somite. We expect that immature somites in the posterior would have little midline migration of angioblasts and the anterior, with more mature somites, would have significant midline migration. We measured the distance in microns on the x-axis and the percentage of midline angioblasts on the y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N and O</xref>). In DMSO-treated embryos, embryos sectioned at the fifth somite grouped together, showing both significant notochord-endoderm distance and angioblasts residing at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, blue dots in the orange box, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). Embryos sectioned at the 12th somite show short notochord-endoderm distance and little angioblast migration towards the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, red squares in gray box). When comparing angioblast migration, the 5th somite and 12th somite regions were significantly different (p&gt;0.0001). The corresponding sectioning of DEAB-treated embryos shows a difference compared to wild-type in the fifth somite region. Embryos sectioned at the fifth somite have a small distance from the notochord to endoderm, as well as no angioblast migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, blue dots in orange box, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>). Interestingly, the notochord-endoderm distance/migration percentage ratio strongly resembled the more immature somites. The angioblast migration percentage was not statistically significant between the 5th and 12th somite in RA-depletion conditions (p=0.33). This indicates that the midline exists in a more immature state in RA-depleted conditions, and the more mature state provides space in which the angioblasts can migrate into.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Retinoic acid induces changes in the definitive vasculature</title><p>Pharmacological inhibition of RA signaling has previously been shown to effect the zebrafish vasculature, notably causing a smaller than normal dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pillay et al., 2016</xref>).

However, in the <italic>aldh1a2</italic>-/- embryos, the size of the dorsal aorta is reduced but remained lumenized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, white arrows).

However, the vasculature of the <italic>aldh1a2</italic>-/- siblings shows a large reduction of the size of the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, white arrow). In addition, it appears that the posterior cardinal vein of <italic>aldh1a2</italic>-/-increased in size compared to its sibling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, yellow arrowhead). To determine if the size change was the result of a reduced cell number in the DA in response to RA loss, we utilized the transgenic line <italic>tg(kdrl:nls-GFP</italic>), which labels the nucleus of endothelial cells to count the number of cells in each blood vessel over a 225 Î¼M horizontal section of a 24 hpf zebrafish embryo.

This corresponds to an increase in the number of cells in the veins during DEAB treatment compared to DMSO.

Therefore, we sought to determine if RA depletion within the somites caused morphological changes that compromised NES and angioblast migration to the midline. During normal development, newly born somites initially lay flat and extend farther in the medial-lateral axis, demonstrated by a section of 15-somite stage embryo at the 12th somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, white dashed lines; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tlili et al., 2019</xref>). However, as somites mature, they will narrow in the medial-lateral axis and extend in the dorsal-ventral axis, as demonstrated by a section of the fifth somite of a 15-somite stage embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, white dashed line; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tlili et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore sought to determine if somite maturation could be affected cell-autonomously in RA-depletion conditions. We therefore transplanted either wild-type or <italic>HS:dnRAR</italic> cells into <italic>tg(ubb:lck-m</italic>NG) embryos. Embryos were then sectioned at roughly the fifth somite region for 12-somite stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).

Run time = 240 min.</p></caption></media><p>We speculated that the ventral expansion of the somite that occurs during somite cell rearrangement and maturation was responsible for NES. At the 10-somite stage, embryos have their notochord adjacent to the endoderm and level to ventral-most edge of the somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). As the embryo develops, the somite expands ventrally (black bracket). As the ventral distance of the somite extends relative to the dorsal part of the notochord (yellow bracket), it induces space that the angioblasts occupy (blue brackets). Starting from the 10-somite stage, we measured the distance of ventral expansion relative to the distance between the notochord and the endoderm every hour for 4 hr. A simple linear regression of the data, indicated by the black line, shows a slope of 0.002 and y-intercept of 1.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7âsource data 3</xref>). The flat slope indicates little variance across time, and the y-intercept near 1 indicates that NES is equivalent to ventral expansion of the somite. The 1:1 correlation of ventral somite expansion and notochord displacement, as well as the <italic>tbx16</italic> loss-of-function NES defect, provides strong evidence that somite morphogenesis is critical for NES.</p><p>To further verify the relationship between somite ventral expansion and angioblast migration, we also created a two-variable graph to measure both the relative distance of the notochord to the ventral somite along the dorsal-ventral axis and the percentage of angioblasts arriving at the midline for a given somite. For this analysis, we used 15-somite stage embryos sectioned at the 5th somite and 12th somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata4">Figure 7âsource data 4</xref>). Embryos sectioned at the 12th somite show little notochord-ventral somite distance and little angioblast migration toward the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>, red squares in gray box). Embryos sectioned at the fifth somite have greater distance from the notochord to ventral somite along the dorsal-ventral axis, as well as significant angioblast migration to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>, blue dots in orange box, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata4">Figure 7âsource data 4</xref>). This corresponds to migration with data seen previously for NES distance, indicating that these processes are tightly correlated.</p><p>Finally, we investigated a methodology to track all cellular movements within an embryo to co-visualize somite morphogenesis along with angioblast migration and NES. We used a live explant method to monitor migration in a transverse section view. Live <italic>tg(kdrl:GFP</italic>) embryos, injected with <italic>mCherry-</italic>CAAX mRNA, were sectioned at the 10-somite stage at the fourth somite and mounted to observe a transverse section of the trunk. We were able to observe migrating angioblasts, as well as somite morphogenesis and midline NES in the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O and P</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). At the 180â² timepoint, angioblasts were not at the midline and the hypochord remained flush with the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). At this timepoint, the somites have begun to narrow in the medial-lateral axis. By the 240â² stage, the hypochord is separated away from the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P</xref>), and shortly after this, the angioblasts are able to complete their migration to the midline by the 270â² timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P</xref>). Similar to the results seen in fixed sections, live explants of embryos treated with DEAB show angioblast migration defects and lack of NES (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>).</p><media id="video8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-74821-video8.mp4"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse fluorescent video of <italic>mCherry-</italic>CAAX mRNA-injected <italic>tg(kdrl:eGFP)</italic> explant at the 10-somite stage.</title><p><italic>tg(kdrl:eGFP</italic>) marks angioblasts as they migrate to the midline, and <italic>mCherry-</italic>CAAX marks the cell surfaces.

The emergence of the transient VMC is a necessary requirement for contralateral angioblasts to complete their migration and coalesce at the midline. We observed a defect in somitic mesoderm development in RA-depletion conditions, which delayed somite maturation, intrasomite cellular movement, and significantly impeded NES. Conversely, we found that addition of RA accelerated somite maturation and NES, along with angioblast migration. We were able to confirm that the somitic mesoderm was required for angioblast migration by examining <italic>tbx16</italic> mutants, which have a lack of somites caused by EMT defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho and Kane, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and Kimelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Row et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of function of <italic>tbx16</italic> prevented angioblast migration completely and resulted in bifurcated blood vessel formation. These changes in vascular morphology indicate that the somitic mesoderm is a requirement for angioblast migration to the midline. It is notable that in amniotes, such as the mouse and quail, the dorsal aorta and cardinal vein are initially bifurcated in a similar manner to zebrafish <italic>tbx16</italic> mutants prior to fusion at the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drake and Fleming, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pardanaud et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pardanaud et al., 1987</xref>). It is possible that evolutionary differences in the somitic mesoderm between teleosts and amniotes could play a role in the differences in vascular development.</p><p>Very little is known about the process of NES. Our observations indicate that its initiation correlates very closely with angioblast migration, with angioblasts migrating into the VMC seemingly as soon as it appears in both wild-type and RA-depletion conditions. Given that these blood vessels become lumenized and need to achieve a sufficient volume for blood transport, it is plausible that they require morphological changes within the ventral part of the embryo to accommodate for their size. Delays in somite maturation prevent angioblasts from reaching the midline in a normal developmental time frame. It is possible that the consequences of this migration defect result in the malformed blood vessel structure in RA-depleted embryos, which have small arteries and larger veins. Prior work showed that the most lateral angioblasts, which migrate later than more medial angioblasts, preferentially adopt a venous fate over an arterial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohli et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that somite maturation is a key factor in determining the proper distribution of endothelial progenitors to the arteries and veins by essentially timing angioblast migration and altering cell fate decision patterns. However, we cannot definitively determine if this is solely from angioblast migration defects.</p><p>We found that the formation of the VMC does not necessarily require the notochord tissue itself. In <italic>noto</italic> morphants, which causes the notochord to adopt a somitic fate, there is still a ventral cavity and angioblasts are able to arrive at the midline. This implies that the notochord is ultimately dispensable for the completion of angioblast migration, even though its loss can produce migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sumoy et al., 1997</xref>). The migratory defects could be the result of reduced notochord-secreted factors such as <italic>apela,</italic> which greatly reduce but do not completely abolish migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helker et al., 2015</xref>). Another factor could be that signals from the notochord, such as Hedgehog, influence somite development, which in turn facilitates angioblast migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blagden et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinits et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). While the fate of the midline tissue does not need to be notochord for NES to occur, it is likely that mechanical coupling between the somites and midline tissue is required such that somite morphogenesis drives the separation of the midline mesoderm away from the underlying endoderm. In <italic>noto</italic> loss of function, the somitic tissue that forms at the midline in place of notochord is continuous with the flanking somites. In wild-type embryos, there is evidence of mechanical interactions of the somite and notochord during convergent extension, which are required for the remodeling of the adaxial cells, the medial most cells in the somite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yin and Solnica-Krezel, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypes observed in both the somites and endothelium after loss of RA signaling are not the result of a simple deficit of mesoderm. RA signaling loss of function affects somite maturation and morphogenesis, but does not prevent them from forming, and yet the migration of the angioblasts is still disrupted. The direct transcriptional targets of RA signaling that induce somite maturation are unknown, but it is clear that RA signaling controls the timing and progress of somite shape changes as they mature. Cell-autonomous effects of RA depletion on the somites, coupled with angioblast migration defects in RA-depleted somites, indicate that RA directly controls somite shape changes that facilitate migration. The fact that somites can adopt mature shapes in explants, even in the absence of adjacent somites, indicates this control is local to individual somites. It is also noteworthy that loss of RA signaling activity in a relatively few number of adaxially localized cells in our chimeric somites was sufficient to cause somite shape and angioblast migration defects. This implies that the somite cells most medial to the midline could be the population required for the ventral expansion of the somite and NES. It is not clear if NES is required for the initiation of angioblast migration as some midline-directed cellular movement occurs in DEAB-treated embryos before NES is visibly seen. It is possible that the somite itself could facilitate the angioblastsâ movement to the midline or simply provide an opening through which angioblasts can reach the midline. The fact that angioblasts reside adjacent to the notochord in <italic>tbx16</italic> mutants, but do not migrate beneath them, implies that angioblasts are not sufficient to drive NES or their coalescence at the midline. It is likely that ventral expansions of the somite drive the notochord away from the endoderm. Together, this indicates that somitic maturation requires tight spatial and temporal control to facilitate the concomitant development of the endothelium.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

We calculated the corrected total fluorescence of the area at the midline and of the whole embryo using the notochord as a reference for the midline. Corrected total fluorescence for the midline was calculated as (mean gray value of midline Ã area of midline) â (mean gray value of background Ã area of midline). Corrected total fluorescence for the embryo was calculated as (mean gray value of embryo Ã area of embryo) â (mean gray value of background Ã area of embryo). Percentages for fluorescent intensity were calculated as (corrected total fluorescence at the midline)/(corrected total fluorescence of the whole embryo). Tracks for cells were made using the Trackmate plug-in for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). We utilized a Laplacian of Gaussian detector and a Simple LAP Tracker to generate the tracks and analysis. p-Values for indicated figures were generated using two-tailed unpaired Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-tests. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.4.2 for dot plots, and Excel for line graphs. The black lines indicate the median and interquartile ranges, and were generated using the Prism software. Simple linear regression was also determined using GraphPad software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Somite morphogenesis is required for axial blood vessel formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The common feeling of the three reviewers is that the manuscript is potentially interesting, suggesting a previously unappreciated role of somite tissue remodeling in axial blood vessel formation. However, the present version is too preliminary and does not identify the mechanisms by which retinoic acid may drive somite remodeling, cavity opening and angioblast migration. Moreover, the assumption that manipulation of somite morphogenesis specifically impacts axial vessel formation by opening a ventral midline cavity, rather than previously detailed roles for the somite in axial vessel formation, is not adequately supported by the data. The reviewers believe that extensive additional work would be required to meet these criticisms, which is beyond what is possible to complete in a standard manuscript revision period.</p><p>We hope you find the full reviews attached below helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The work of Paulissen et al. presents a new model for early development of the vertebrate vasculature. Using live imaging microscopy in the zebrafish model, Paulissen and colleagues propose that formation of the first axial blood vessels in zebrafish embryos is dependent upon retinoic acid (RA)-mediated remodeling of surrounding somite tissue, which creates a &quot;ventral midline cavity&quot; that facilitates recruitment of angioblasts to the midline. Whereas others have demonstrated that notochord-derived cues (such as Apela) direct angioblasts to the midline, Paulissen et al. provide evidence that the notochord is overall dispensable for axial vessel formation. Alternatively, they propose that migration of angioblasts to the midline is dependent upon RA-driven somite remodeling, which triggers separation of the notochord and endoderm to create the midline cavity that facilitates angioblast recruitment. In support of this concept, Paulissen et al. use genetic and chemical manipulations of RA signaling to demonstrate that (a) angioblast migration to the midline is dependent on RA, (b) RA regulates somite shape and formation of a ventral midline cavity, and (c) angioblasts populate this cavity as they coalesce at the midline. However, the precise mechanisms by which RA drives somite remodeling remain unclear. More importantly, the work lacks experimental evidence confirming that RA-mediated midline cavity formation is itself is a driver for recruitment of angioblasts. Hence, whilst this study proposes an exciting new model for axial vessel formation, conclusions that RA-mediated somite remodeling drives this process need further clarification. In particular:</p><p>1) How does RA drive expansion of a ventral midline cavity?</p><p>A number of key questions remain regarding the role of RA in somite remodeling and cavity formation. For example, which RA-responsive tissue drives ventral midline cavity expansion? Indeed, only the notochord, adaxial cells and epidermis appear RA-responsive at these stages (Figure 3) â but not the somite cells that exhibit movement defects in the absence of RA in Figure 7. In Figure 4, transplantation of dnRAR-expressing cells indicates that angioblasts do not require RA signaling for midline migration. Similar experiments defining the role of notochord and/or adaxial or somite tissue in cavity formation would at least shed light on the cell-cell interactions driving cavity formation. For example, can transplanted WT notochord, adaxial or somite tissue recover local angioblast migration in RA signaling deficient mutants. Moreover, such experiment would also be critical to defining the tissue to target in experiments described below.</p><p>2) Is formation of a ventral midline cavity required for angioblast migration?</p><p>Paulissen et al. provide evidence that formation of a cavity at the midline is dependent on RA signaling, but it still remains unclear if the defects in angioblast migration observed in the absence of RA signaling are directly due to failure of midline cavity formation or are a consequence of disruption to other RA-dependent processes. For example, mosaic experiments using a mix of transplanted WT cells of the relevant cell type (which has yet to be defined â please see point 1 above) in RA-deficient mutant embryos to induce local recovery of cavity formation (or vice versa to disrupt local cavity formation), would determine if angioblasts can only populate regions at the midline where the ventral cavity forms. Without such direct testing of this core hypothesis, evidence that midline cavity formation directly impacts angioblast migration remains only correlative, and strong statements in the text, such as &quot;The emergence of the VMC is a necessary requirement for endothelial progenitors to both migrate into and develop into functioning blood vessels&quot;, lack sufficient experimental support.</p><p>In addition to experiments suggested above, several other experimental improvements would significantly strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1) Overall, the live imaging data would greatly benefit from higher spatial resolution and robust quantification. For example, live imaging data of notochord-endoderm separation presented in Figure 4 are of poor resolution and are difficult to interpret. These analyses would benefit from post-acquisition conversion to transverse movie sections to directly observe cavity formation and enable direct quantification of cavity size. Likewise, live-imaging of angioblast migration would be strengthened by better spatial resolution and consistent quantification (for example, quantification is absent in Figure 3, 5 and 6), as well as analysis over longer time periods to determine to what extent loss of RA signaling truly blocks angioblast migration, or if this is a slight temporal delay. Importantly, comments in the text such as &quot;Angioblasts in these embryos show no clear anterior to posterior migration patterns and are often disorganized in their directionality&quot; need to be strengthened by appropriate quantification.</p><p>2) The author's core hypothesis is that somite morphogenesis creates a midline cavity that is required for recruitment of angioblasts to the midline. Yet, this the study lacks live imaging evidence that this cavity opens prior to angioblast midline coalescence. Experiments in Figure 5 that monitor angioblast migration in tissue slices do not show the midline cavity. As such, further live imaging studies using a membrane label to pinpoint the forming cavity (such as the author's HS:mcherry-caax line) should be performed to provide convincing evidence that cavity formation occurs prior angioblast arrival.</p><p>3) Likewise, it would be important to test if angioblasts can still reach the midline in the absence of a midline cavity. For example, angioblast migration defects in aldh1a2 mutants clearly recover later in development, as axial vessels still form (Figure 2). It would be important to determine if the midline cavity needs to be open for this recovery, or if angioblasts can still reach the midline in its absence â which may question the overall importance of cavity formation.</p><p>4) As angioblast phenotypes observed upon disruption of RA signaling are near-identical to those described Apela mutants (Helker et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015), it is important to determine that notochord expression of Apela is unaffected by disruption of RA signaling â i.e., that angioblast migration defects are not simply due to loss of notochord Apela expression. This is especially important considering that the notochord is the most RA-responsive tissue at the timepoints investigated (Figure 3).</p><p>5) Caution should be exercised when interpreting results in tbx16 mutants that lack somite tissue, as this will perturb expression of many somite-derived cues that impact angioblast behavior. As such, disruption of angioblast migration cannot be solely attributed to a lack of midline cavity formation in tbx16 mutants and text comments, such as &quot;This indicates that the somatic mesoderm is required for NES and formation of the VMC, which in turn is necessary for the angioblasts to reach the midline&quot;, need to be toned down to accurately reflect the data.</p><p>6) Labelling of Figure 7I, J and K do not match the figure legend and text discussion of the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this article, the authors present a study of midline angioblast migration in zebrafish that requires surrounding tissue rearrangement controlled by somite morphogenesis.

The work is clearly explained and nicely presented, but the studies lack some depth that would increase the impact of this work. Of note, there are previous zebrafish studies/mutants that have been published that demonstrate that abnormal somite formation/cellular delamination leads to mis-patterned vasculature that are not cited or discussed within this current study: (DOI: 10.1002/dvdy.20814, doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.096305, DOI:10.1002/dvdy.22410, doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16515-y, doi.org/10.1186/1471-213X-10-96, and so onâ¦). Because of this, it is unclear that this work presents the conceptual advancement that it purports, though it is still a well-executed study that adds to this literature. Given the limitations presented above, and the data specific critiques presented below, I cannot recommend publication of this manuscript in its current form.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. The predominate concern of this reviewer is the concept that the somites are 'required' for axial blood vessel formation. In short, it seems from this work that what is 'required' is space for the cells to move and form tubes, i.e., that the somites move out of the way to allow expansion of cells from the LPM to form the axial vasculature. It was unclear if the authors were suggesting there were additional guidance cues required and produced by the somites, but this did not seem to be the argument. In this case, the conclusions seem very overstated.</p><p>2. In several instances data that seems like it would not share a control is plotted on the same graph and represented by the same control data. This should be fixed (examples: Figure 1E, Figure 4G).</p><p>3. Figure 2- the authors aim to understand the role of RA signaling in global architecture of the axial vessels. They use an aldh1a2-/- mutant to do so. The initial axial vessel phenotypes are shown at 5dpf, well after these vessels are formed. So, it is impossible to interpret if the small aorta is a primary or secondary defect to loss of aldh1a2. Further, the authors show lumenization at 25hpf, which drastically predates the 5dpf phenotype described. In short, this does not conclusively prove that the DA is still open and not collapsed at 5dpf. The presence/absence of nuclei making up the DA and CV also does not prove that angioblasts preferentially went to the CV versus the DA as the authors also did not assess things such as proliferation to determine if cells are dividing at the same rate in the mutant vs. WT siblings. Without live imaging across a broad timescale and proliferation analysis, this data is over interpreted.</p><p>4. The aldh1a2-/- mutants show slower dorsal movement of the notochord than WT siblings. It is unclear why the images in Figure 4H-M are of a chemical treatment instead of the mutants quantified in panel G. Additionally, does exogenous RA rescue the mutant phenotype? This would increase the confidence that the treatments are specific and targeted and strengthen the argument that RA is guiding this dorsal movement phenotype.</p><p>5. Do the noto MO treated embryos form both a DA and CV? From the cross sections, it looks as if only one axial vessel is present.</p><p>6. Supplemental Movie 4- The transplanted magenta cells don't seem to extend processes like the other cells surrounding them. Are these magenta cells actively or passively moving with the green cells? While they do reach the midline, it's not clear that they are actively 'leading' themselves there. Please clarify, as this is critical for the interpretation of the autonomous/ non-autonomous need for RA signaling in angioblasts. What proportion of these transplanted cells ultimately target to the endothelial lineage? Are there cells in the surrounding tissue that also carry these markers that are not angioblasts?</p><p>7. If the tbx16 mutants don't have a functional somatic mesoderm, how and where do the angioblasts arise from? Isn't the LMP derived from the somatic mesoderm? Do the authors know if the same number of angioblasts are present? Are they specified correctly to begin with? The interpretation of this experiment should be clarified as it's unclear if cells that can be termed 'angioblasts' remain present and raises a potential alternate interpretation of this data. Additional studies/clarity needs to be added to address this point.</p><p>8. Figure 7I-K: Perhaps these sections aren't representative? It looks like there is separation in J- the DEAB treated. Or are these images mislabeled?</p><p>9. Could the authors clarify this point: &quot;Cells in DMSO treated embryos showed significant amounts of displacement throughout the somite (Figure 7C). However, the DEAB cells showed less displacement over time (Figure 7C). Quantification of speed in the same manner showed no statistically significant difference between DMSO and DEAB treatment (Figure 7D).&quot;</p><p>How is this possible? If the cells move less distance over time, shouldn't that equate to a change in speed? Additionally, the tracks in E,F are not visible. Please adapt these images.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Somite morphogenesis is required for axial blood vessel formation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This would provide stronger evidence that cavity opening itself impacts angioblast accumulation, as well as provide evidence to explain why transplantation of dnRAR-expressing somite tissue disrupts midline accumulation of angioblasts from the right, but not the left side of the embryo in Figure 2H.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Following the previous submission of this work for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, Paulissen et al. now present a significant revision to their study that includes new experimental data, analyses and interpretation. In this re-submission, the authors reveal that retinoic acid (RA) drives angioblast accumulation at the zebrafish embryo midline to form axial blood vessels. Supported by new transplantation and imaging data, they find that RA signaling in the somite acts to drive midline angioblast migration, and that RA drives remodeling of the somite, promotes separation of the notochord and endoderm, and forms a midline cavity. Observations that the opening of this cavity occurs concomitant with arrival of angioblasts leads the authors to propose that progressive somite-mediated opening of this ventral midline cavity is important for midline angioblast accumulation. In response to comments from the reviewers, new data has been included in this re-submission that addresses most of my previous concerns. However, there are still several key points that are not adequately addressed and that should be tackled with further experiments before acceptance for publication.</p><p>1) A previous concern was that it is unclear if the ventral midline cavity is itself required for angioblast accumulation at the midline (as proposed by the authors) or, alternatively, that other RA-dependent signals released by the somite are responsible. Observations of concomitant cavity opening and arrival of angioblasts at the midline are suggestive, but not conclusive evidence that cavity opening is required for angioblast accumulation. Repetition of transplantation experiments from Figure 7C and D alongside angioblast staining (for Etv2, as in Figure 2B) would allow direct quantification of cavity size and angioblast accumulation at perturbed and unperturbed sites within individual embryos. Further quantification of cavity size and angioblast accumulation in this experimental condition would provide stronger evidence that local manipulation of ventral midline cavity size has a predictable impact local angioblast migration.</p><p>2) New data presented in Figure 2H raise further questions about the role of ventral midline cavity opening in angioblast midline accumulation. In this experiment, transplantation of dnRAR-expressing somite tissue disrupts midline accumulation of angioblasts from the right, but not the left side of the embryo. If the delay to angioblasts accumulation from the right is entirely due to a disruption in ventral midline cavity opening, wouldn't it be assumed that angioblasts access from the left would also be disrupted? The experiments requested in comment 1 would be key to resolve this point upon quantification of the relationship between local cavity size and angioblast accumulation.</p><p>3) Separation of the notochord and endoderm are proposed to generate an empty cavity that allows access of angioblasts to the midline. This point needs to be further clarified upon co-staining of transverse sections of Lifeact embryos over time (as in Figure 5) with DAPI, or another nuclear label, to conclusively determine that this cavity is acellular, and where and when it opens up.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the majority of my concerns.

Transplants of HS:dnRAR cells into the somites showed significant angioblast migration defects, which was not seen in transplants to the angioblast or notochord tissue populations (Figure 2E-2J).

To better observe the dorsal translocation of the notochord and NES, we utilized a cell-surface marker transgenic line tg(ubb:lck-mNG) to label all cells in the embryo. Using this, we can more accurately visualize notochord translocation (Figure 4A-4C). We saw a similar event, which we were able to quantify, in Figure 4D-4F. To the latter point, we used a new transgenic line, Tg(hsp70l:lifeact-mScarlet), to perform sections at more developmental time points and were able to capture the formation of the VMC (Figure 5A), as well as NES and angioblast migration recovery in RA depletion conditions (Figure 5F-5I).

This is especially important considering that the notochord is the most RA-responsive tissue at the timepoints investigated (Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the Apela/Aplnra/Aplnrb axis via in-situ hybridization and found it is not affected by the loss of RA (Figure Supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Caution should be exercised when interpreting results in tbx16 mutants that lack somite tissue, as this will perturb expression of many somite-derived cues that impact angioblast behavior. As such, disruption of angioblast migration cannot be solely attributed to a lack of midline cavity formation in tbx16 mutants and text comments, such as &quot;This indicates that the somatic mesoderm is required for NES and formation of the VMC, which in turn is necessary for the angioblasts to reach the midline&quot;, need to be toned down to accurately reflect the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified out data to better reflect the relative importance of the somitic mesoderm and notochord while avoiding direct comparisons to NES solely from the tbx16 data. The conclusions are changed as follows, âEmbryos injected with noto morpholino have angioblasts located at the midline that appear to have resolved into one blood vessel structure (Figure 3H). Embryos injected with tbx16 morpholinos, however, show two distinct vessels located on either side of the notochord (Figure 3I). This indicates that the somites are critical for angioblast convergence at the midline, while the notochord is ultimately dispensable.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Labelling of Figure 7I, J and K do not match the figure legend and text discussion of the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>This data was replaced with higher resolution data (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>1) In &quot;Figure 1&quot; the quality of the images are poor and very difficult to discern what is actually happening at cellular resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate this concern, the images in Figure 1 were not meant to show cellular resolution of individual angioblasts, but rather the migration of the collective population of angioblasts.

The somites are a source of both endothelial progenitor cells themselves (a fact ignored in this study) as well as signals that regulate them. How are these two observations/properties reconciled in your model. How are they explained in the defects observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Somite derived endothelial cells can be a source, but only a very small contribution (Ambler et al.,2001). As well, the tbx16 mutants have been shown to preserve endothelial cells in the absence of somitic tissue (Thompson et al., 1998). It has also been established that the lateral plate mesoderm is a prominent source of angioblasts (Prummel et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript, 'Somite morphogenesis is required for axial blood vessel formation' by Paulissen, et al., aims to elucidate novel mechanisms linking somatogenesis to midline migration of angioblasts for axial blood vessel formation. The work is clearly explained and nicely presented, but the studies lack some depth that would increase the impact of this work. Of note, there are previous zebrafish studies/mutants that have been published that demonstrate that abnormal somite formation/cellular delamination leads to mis-patterned vasculature that are not cited or discussed within this current study: (DOI: 10.1002/dvdy.20814, doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.096305, DOI:10.1002/dvdy.22410, doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16515-y, doi.org/10.1186/1471-213X-10-96, and so onâ¦). Because of this, it is unclear that this work presents the conceptual advancement that it purports, though it is still a well-executed study that adds to this literature. Given the limitations presented above, and the data specific critiques presented below, I cannot recommend publication of this manuscript in its current form.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that somites have been shown to have some effect on the definitive vasculature. However, none have focused on midline angioblast migration, nor the role of somite morphogenesis, specifically, on the formation of the midline vasculature. We reflect on this with the following text, âWhile some evidence has shown somite-related defects on blood vessel patterning, much of this research focused on angiogenic sprouting or defects in arterial-venous specification, well after angioblast migration and somitogenesis is completed (Lawson et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 2006; Therapontos and Vargesson, 2010; Torres-VÃ¡zquez et al., 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. The predominate concern of this reviewer is the concept that the somites are 'required' for axial blood vessel formation. In short, it seems from this work that what is 'required' is space for the cells to move and form tubes, i.e., that the somites move out of the way to allow expansion of cells from the LPM to form the axial vasculature. It was unclear if the authors were suggesting there were additional guidance cues required and produced by the somites, but this did not seem to be the argument. In this case, the conclusions seem very overstated.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show in Figure Supplement 2 that known angioblast migration cues are unaffected. Additional evidence shows that Notochord translocation (NES) and formation of the VMC are required for the completion of angioblast migration (Figure 4 and 5). Data in figures 3 and 7 also show that lack of somites, or lack of proper morphogenesis of somites (caused by loss of RA signaling), causes a failure of VMC formation. Together the data support a model in which the morphogenesis of the somites induces the VMC, which is in turn required for the angioblasts to reach the midline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In several instances data that seems like it would not share a control is plotted on the same graph and represented by the same control data. This should be fixed (examples: Figure 1E, Figure 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>We have separated the graphs and added the proper controls to each graph (Figure 1E, and 1F). We clarified our controls in Figure 4G to demonstrate that all embryos were imaged in the same conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2- the authors aim to understand the role of RA signaling in global architecture of the axial vessels. They use an aldh1a2-/- mutant to do so. The initial axial vessel phenotypes are shown at 5dpf, well after these vessels are formed. So, it is impossible to interpret if the small aorta is a primary or secondary defect to loss of aldh1a2. Further, the authors show lumenization at 25hpf, which drastically predates the 5dpf phenotype described. In short, this does not conclusively prove that the DA is still open and not collapsed at 5dpf. The presence/absence of nuclei making up the DA and CV also does not prove that angioblasts preferentially went to the CV versus the DA as the authors also did not assess things such as proliferation to determine if cells are dividing at the same rate in the mutant vs. WT siblings. Without live imaging across a broad timescale and proliferation analysis, this data is over interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, we agree that it is difficult to say for certain if the smaller DA was the direct result of the angioblast migration defect, although that hypothesis is derived from studies that show slower migrating angioblasts preferentially join the cardinal vein (Kohli et al., 2013). We clarified this point in the text, âWhile we cannot definitively say the migration defects themselves caused the arterial reduction, it indicates that RA is required for the proper formation of the definitive vasculature.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The aldh1a2-/- mutants show slower dorsal movement of the notochord than WT siblings. It is unclear why the images in Figure 4H-M are of a chemical treatment instead of the mutants quantified in panel G. Additionally, does exogenous RA rescue the mutant phenotype? This would increase the confidence that the treatments are specific and targeted and strengthen the argument that RA is guiding this dorsal movement phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>The data quantified in Figure 4G were different images than shown in 4H-4M. We have provided images of that data to illustrate how the Figure 4G data was quantified (Figure 4D-4F). In response to the second point, the aldh1a2-/- mutant targets the dehydrogenase directly responsible for RA production, and we confirmed the specificity of the angioblast migration defect by observing the same phenotype in three additional methods of inhibiting RA signaling (2 pharmacological and one genetic, Figure S1). Additionally, exogenous RA is shown to cause the opposite phenotype of loss of RA (Figure 4C and 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Do the noto MO treated embryos form both a DA and CV? From the cross sections, it looks as if only one axial vessel is present.</p></disp-quote><p>It was shown previously that noto loss of function results in a single, disorganized blood vessel. This is reflected in the new statement âIn noto mutants, it was observed that some angioblasts had reached the midline at later developmental stages, and resolve into a single blood vessel (Fouquet et al., 1997).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Supplemental Movie 4- The transplanted magenta cells don't seem to extend processes like the other cells surrounding them. Are these magenta cells actively or passively moving with the green cells? While they do reach the midline, it's not clear that they are actively 'leading' themselves there. Please clarify, as this is critical for the interpretation of the autonomous/ non-autonomous need for RA signaling in angioblasts. What proportion of these transplanted cells ultimately target to the endothelial lineage? Are there cells in the surrounding tissue that also carry these markers that are not angioblasts?</p></disp-quote><p>The cells transplanted in supplemental movie 4 are entirely targeted toward the angioblasts. We utilized a technique to drive cells into the angioblast progenitor pool by excluding them from the somitic mesoderm (Row et al., 2018). Based on new data in which we have targeted dnRAR cells to the somites, which causes the angioblast migration defect, we feel that we have provided strong evidence that RA signaling in somitic mesoderm is affecting angioblast migration rather than cell autonomous effects in angioblasts (Figure 2H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. If the tbx16 mutants don't have a functional somatic mesoderm, how and where do the angioblasts arise from? Isn't the LMP derived from the somatic mesoderm? Do the authors know if the same number of angioblasts are present? Are they specified correctly to begin with? The interpretation of this experiment should be clarified as it's unclear if cells that can be termed 'angioblasts' remain present and raises a potential alternate interpretation of this data. Additional studies/clarity needs to be added to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown previously that tbx16 mutants have endothelial progenitors (Thompson et al., 1998).

Could the authors clarify this point: &quot;Cells in DMSO treated embryos showed significant amounts of displacement throughout the somite (Figure 7C). However, the DEAB cells showed less displacement over time (Figure 7C). Quantification of speed in the same manner showed no statistically significant difference between DMSO and DEAB treatment (Figure 7D).&quot;</p><p>How is this possible?

This experiment requires repetition of transplantation experiments from Figure 7C and D alongside angioblast staining (for Etv2, as in Figure 2B) to allow direct quantification of cavity size and angioblast accumulation at perturbed and unperturbed sites within individual embryos. This would provide stronger evidence that cavity opening itself impacts angioblast accumulation, as well as provide evidence to explain why transplantation of dnRAR-expressing somite tissue disrupts midline accumulation of angioblasts from the right, but not the left side of the embryo in Figure 2H.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was performed as suggested using either control wild-type donor cells or dnRAR expressing donor cells transplanted into host embryos with either a ubiquitous mNeonGreen plasma membrane transgene, or host embryos with ubiquitous Lifeact-mScarlet + kdrl:GFP angioblast reporter transgenes. We selected embryos where transplanted cells were localized to somites on one side of the embryo and not the other, to observe a direct comparison between somites on either side in transverse sections. In both types of host embryos, the ventral midline cavity does not open on the side of the embryo where dnRAR cells are located within the somite, but does begin to open on the side where donor cells are absent from the somite. The kdrl:GFP fluorescence indicates this partial opening on the side without transplanted cells facilitates angioblast migration to the midline, whereas angioblasts remain in a more lateral position on the side with dnRAR cells. Control experiments using wild-type donor cells showed no difference in ventral midline cavity opening or angioblast migration on the side with transplanted cells and the side without. These new results are presented in Figure 7 âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Separation of the notochord and endoderm are proposed to generate an empty cavity that allows access of angioblasts to the midline. This point needs to be further clarified upon co-staining of transverse sections of Lifeact embryos over time (as in Figure 5) with DAPI, or another nuclear label, to conclusively determine that this cavity is acellular, and where and when it opens up.</p></disp-quote><p>To show that the ventral midline cavity is acellular, we examined a transverse section image Z-stack of an embryo containing both the ubiquitous Lifeact-mScarlet and the angioblast reporter kdrl:GFP transgenes, and stained with DAPI. A maximum projection of a 15 Î¼m image stack at a time-point immediately preceding angioblast arrival at the midline shows that the ventral midline cavity is devoid of Lifeact and DAPI fluorescence, indicating that it is an acellular cavity.
