mechanism of articular chondrocytes remain poorly understood. Broadly, the difference in developmental mechanisms of articular and growth-plate cartilage is still less elucidated. Here, we identified that the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) is a crucial regulator of articular, but not growth-plate, chondrocyte differentiation during development. At the early stage of mouse knee development (embryonic day 13.5), NFATc1-expressing cells were mainly located in the flanking region of the joint interzone. With development, NFATc1-expressing cells generated almost all articular chondrocytes but not chondrocytes in limb growth-plate primordium. NFATc1-expressing cells displayed prominent capacities for colony formation and multipotent differentiation. Transcriptome analyses revealed a set of characteristic genes in NFATc1-enriched articular cartilage progenitors. Strikingly, the expression of NFATc1 was diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppressing NFATc1 expression in articular cartilage progenitors was sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrogenesis while overexpressing NFATc1 suppresses chondrogenesis. Mechanistically, NFATc1 negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of the <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene. Thus, our results reveal that NFATc1 characterizes articular, but not growth-plate, cartilage progenitors during development and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating COL2A1 gene transcription.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within the body are about 300 joints connecting bones together. Many factors – including trauma, inflammation, aging, and genetic changes – can affect the cushion tissue covering the end of the bones in these joints known as articular cartilage. This can lead to diseases such as osteoarthritis which cause chronic pain, and in some cases disability.</p><p>To treat such conditions, it is essential to know how cells in the articular cartilage are formed during development<bold>.</bold> In the embryo, most cells come from groups of progenitor cells that are programmed to produce specific types of tissue. But which progenitor cells are responsible for producing the main cells in articular cartilage, chondrocytes, and the mechanisms that govern this transformation are poorly understood.</p><p>In 2016, a group of researchers found that the gene for the protein NFATc1, which is important for building bone, is also expressed in a group of progenitor cells at the site where ligaments insert into bone in mice. Inactivation of NFATc1 in these progenitor cells has also been shown to cause abnormal cartilage to form, a condition termed osteochondromas. Building on this work, Zhang, Wang et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2016 study – set out to find whether NFATc1 is also involved in the normal development of articular chondrocytes.</p><p>To investigate, the team used genetically modified mice in which any cells with NFATc1 also had a green fluorescent protein, and tracked these cells and their progeny over the course of joint development. This led them to discover a group of NFATc1-containing progenitor cells that gave rise to almost all articular chondrocytes in the knee joint<bold>.</bold></p><p>Further experiments revealed that when NFATc1 was removed, this made the progenitors become articular chondrocytes very quickly. In contrast, when the cells had excess amounts of the protein, the formation of articular chondrocytes was significantly reduced. This suggests that the level of NFATc1 governs when progenitors develop into articular chondrocytes.</p><p>These findings have provided a way to track the progenitors of articular chondrocytes throughout development and study how articular cartilage is formed. In the future, this work could help researchers develop treatment strategies for osteoarthritis and other cartilage-based diseases. However, before this can happen, further work is needed to confirm that the effects observed in this study also relate to humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>articular chondrocyte</kwd><kwd>progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>transcriptional factor</kwd><kwd>NFATc1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81100767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Xianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5222008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Xianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Capital Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1220010146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Xianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Outstanding Young Researcher Award of Beijing Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Xianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Outstanding Researcher Award of Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Xianpeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NFATc1 is identified as a molecular marker of articular cartilage progenitor cells and a transcriptional repressor of chondrocyte differentiation, providing fundamental insights into the origin and differentiation mechanism of articular chondrocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basic mechanism underlying articular cartilage development, particularly the origin and differentiation of articular chondrocytes, remains poorly understood. It is well appreciated that synovial joint tissues, including the articular cartilage, originate from a distinct group of progenitors from those that generate the limb primary cartilaginous anlagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chijimatsu and Saito, 2019</xref>. GDF5 is one of the genes widely used for tracking synovial joint and articular cartilage development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker, 2017</xref>. Using reporter mice, multiple groups have displayed that <italic>Gdf5</italic>-expressing cell lineages form almost all articular chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rountree et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>. As GDF5 is expressed in both interzone cells and its flanking cells at the early stage of joint morphogenesis, current results cannot discriminate which site is the origin of articular chondrocytes. Also, GDF5 expression is greatly diminished at the late stage of embryonic development and almost undetectable in articular cartilage in neonatal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker, 2017</xref>. Thus, GDF5 cannot be used to track articular cartilage progenitors postnatally.</p><p>PRG4 is an articular cartilage progenitor marker in the late stage of synovial joint development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chijimatsu and Saito, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chagin and Medvedeva, 2017</xref>. This gene encodes lubricin, a major component of synovial fluid and responsible for joint lubricity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coles et al., 2010</xref>. PRG4 is detected from the stage of joint cavitation and is predominantly expressed in the surficial layer of developed articular cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>. Several studies exploited <italic>Prg4<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> reporter mice to track postnatal articular cartilage development and identified this gene as a marker for postnatal and adult articular cartilage progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>. Since PRG4 starts to predominantly express and function at the late stage of articular cartilage development, it does not label the primary progenitors of articular cartilage. Several other molecules, such as <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Dkk3, and Tgfbr2</italic>, were also utilized to track articular cartilage and synovial joint development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>, but none of these molecules have been shown to specifically and constantly label articular cartilage progenitors and to be able to distinguish the origin of articular chondrocytes.</p><p>In addition to the origin of articular chondrocytes, molecular mechanisms regulating articular chondrocyte differentiation remains largely unknown. In particular, the transcriptional regulation of articular chondrocyte differentiation is far from clear. SOX9 is essential in multiple steps of chondrogenesis, but it was originally and mainly studied in growth-plate chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lefebvre and Dvir-Ginzberg, 2017</xref>. Although SOX9 is also expressed in articular cartilage and is essential for maintaining adult articular cartilage homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haseeb et al., 2021</xref>, its detailed functions and mechanisms in articular cartilage development remain to be elucidated. Also, SOX9 starts to express in mesenchymal cells from the very early stage of limb development before the cartilage template formation and it alone is not sufficient to induce chondrogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lefebvre and Dvir-Ginzberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2005</xref>. Therefore, the identification of a core transcriptional regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation is paramount for understanding the basic mechanism of articular cartilage development and exploring new strategies for treating disorders of articular cartilage.</p><p>The nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) is one of the five members of the NFAT family, which share a similar DNA binding domain of approximately 300 amino acid residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vaeth and Feske, 2018</xref>. NFAT signaling plays a broad function in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune cell differentiation and functions, cardiac valve development, and cancer progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mancini and Toker, 2009</xref>. In the skeletal system, NFATc1 is critical for osteoclast differentiation and functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprantis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takayanagi, 2007</xref> and is also involved in osteoblast differentiation by cooperating with the Osterix gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koga et al., 2005</xref>. Intriguingly, NFATc1 expression was found in the superficial layers of articular cartilage as well and decreased in human osteoarthritic cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenblatt et al., 2013</xref>. Following these studies, we recently identified a function of NFATc1 in restricting osteochondroma formation from entheseal progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2016</xref>, revealing that NFATc1 is a suppressor of chondrogenesis in these cells.</p><p>In this study, we unexpectedly found that NFATc1 constantly labels articular cartilage progenitors throughout embryonic development and postnatal growth. The expression of NFATc1 is diminished with articular chondrocyte differentiation, and suppression of NFATc1 in articular cartilage progenitors is sufficient to induce spontaneous chondrocyte differentiation through regulating the transcriptional activity of the <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene. These findings provide novel insights into the identity and origin of articular cartilage progenitors and identify a fundamental function of NFATc1 in determining physiological articular chondrocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Articular cartilage is derived from NFATc1-expressing progenitors</title><p>Following our previous discovery that NFATc1 identifies entheseal progenitors at the site of ligaments inserted onto the bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2016</xref>, we unexpectedly found that in <italic>Nfatc1<sup>Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> dual-fluorescence reporter mice, the majority of articular chondrocytes expressed green fluorescence protein (GFP) at 8 weeks of age [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(A and B)</xref>, 90.55 ± 6.38%, n=5 mice].

Of interest, with tamoxifen pulse, RFP<sup>+</sup> cells were found scattered in the articular cartilage at 2 weeks of age accounting for about 22.75 ± 2.18% (n=3 mice) of all cells of articular cartilage, while most RFP<sup>+</sup> cells were confined to the superficial layers of articular cartilage at 8 weeks of age (10.94 ± 1.26%, n=3) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(C and D)</xref>].

Strikingly, the deletion of NFATc1 expression was enough to induce chondrocyte differentiation without adding the chondrogenic medium as shown by alcian blue staining and induced expression of <italic>Acan</italic>, <italic>Col2a1,</italic> and <italic>Col10a1</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(B)</xref>]. In the meantime, overexpression of NFATc1 in GFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells inhibited chondrocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(C)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>].</p><p>To verify the function of NFATc1 in the regulation of articular chondrogenesis in vivo, we conditionally deleted <italic>Nfatc1</italic> in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-expressing limb mesenchymal progenitors by crossing <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Nfatc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. The staining for articular cartilage was markedly strengthened in <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (homozygous) <italic>vs. Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> (heterozygous) mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(D and E)</xref>]. Consistently, the expression of <italic>Acan</italic>, <italic>Col2a1</italic>, and <italic>Col10a1</italic> genes was significantly upregulated in the articular cartilage of <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(F)</xref>]. Notably, the articular cartilage consisted of mostly round, large chondrocytes in <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, instead of the normal transitional alignment from the superficial layer to the deep layers [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(E)</xref>]. The volume changes of articular chondrocytes resulted in an increased thickness of articular cartilage in <italic>Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/fl</sup> vs. Prrx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Nfatc1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(E)</xref>]. These results indicate that the in vivo deletion of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> in limb mesenchymal progenitors promotes articular chondrocyte differentiation as well. Note that a previous study showed that <italic>Nfatc1</italic> deletion in <italic>Col2a1</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>Nfatc1<sup>Col2a1</sup></italic> mice) does not affect articular cartilage integration or osteoarthritis progression induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenblatt et al., 2013</xref>, suggesting that NFATc1 is dispensable in <italic>Col2a1</italic>-expressing differentiated articular chondrocytes. Therefore, NFATc1 may primarily function in articular cartilage progenitors to regulate articular chondrocyte differentiation.</p><p>Based on gene expression changes after deleting or overexpressing NFATc1, <italic>Col2a1</italic> turned out to be one of the most significantly changed chondrocyte-related genes we examined [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(B, C and F)</xref> and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2016</xref>]. To understand the mechanism of NFATc1 regulating articular chondrocyte differentiation, we performed computational screening and identified a total of 38 potential NFAT binding sites across the upstream 6 k base pairs of exon 1 and the intron 1 of mouse <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(G)</xref>]. To narrow down the NFATc1 binding sites in the regulatory region of the <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene, we performed a FIMO analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grant et al., 2011</xref> and identified a NFATc1 motif that locates in mouse chr15: 98004609–98004620 and overlaps with the <italic>Col2a1</italic> promoter region [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>]. Furthermore, we verified the binding of NFATc1 to this site using the technique of cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(H)</xref>]. These results show that NFATc1 might play a role in regulating <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene transcription. Indeed, the luciferase analysis showed that silence or overexpression of NFATc1 markedly upregulated or downregulated the transcriptional activity of <italic>Col2a1,</italic> respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(I)</xref>]. Therefore, NFATc1 negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation at least partly through regulating the transcription of the <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>For quite a long period, the interzone cells have been considered as the origin of articular chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chijimatsu and Saito, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rux et al., 2019</xref>. Also, progenitor cells in the flanking mesenchyme surrounding the joint interzone were found to migrate into the interzone region and form articular cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niedermaier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koyama et al., 2007</xref>. The current obscurity in identifying the precise origin of articular chondrocytes could be attributed to the lack of a specific molecular marker to distinguish cells in the flanking region from interzone cells. From this perspective, the limited expression of NFATc1 in the flanking region at the primary stage of mouse knee development [E13.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(A and E)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>] provides a unique opportunity to track progenitors in the flanking region during articular cartilage development. The progressive pattern of NFATc1-expressing cells contributing to articular cartilage formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) suggests that NFATc1-expressing progenitors in the flanking region may represent the origin of articular chondrocytes. Further studies into the spatiotemporal roadmap of NFATc1-expressing progenitor cell development are essential to elucidate the landscape of articular cartilage formation. Notably, these results also demonstrate that NFATc1 can constantly track articular cartilage progenitors throughout embryonic development and postnatal growth.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses in both single-clone and bulk primary cells reveal that NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage cells enrich several previously identified articular cartilage progenitor cell markers including <italic>Osr2</italic>, <italic>Prg4</italic>, <italic>Postn</italic>, <italic>Col3a1</italic>, and <italic>Gdf6</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(C)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2020</xref>], therefore advocating their identity as articular cartilage progenitors. In addition, cell surface molecules including CD105, CD13, CD10, CD9, SCA1, and CD166 can be considered as complementary markers for identifying and screening articular cartilage progenitors. Most impressively, NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors enrich a set of genes like <italic>Fbn2</italic>, <italic>Piezo2</italic>, <italic>Dchs1</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, <italic>Gdf6</italic>, <italic>Fgf9</italic>, <italic>Trps1</italic>, <italic>Col27a1</italic>, <italic>Tgfbr2</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic>, and <italic>Col1A2</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(B)</xref>], whose mutations have been linked to a diverse range of human musculoskeletal disorders (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omim.org">https://www.omim.org</ext-link>). These findings suggest that the dysfunction of articular cartilage progenitors may underlie these human musculoskeletal disorders. Of note, we did not detect the expression of <italic>Gdf5</italic> in articular cartilage progenitors from neonatal mice, which coincides with previous reports that <italic>Gdf5</italic> is greatly diminished with synovial joint development and undetectable in the articular cartilage of neonatal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francis-West et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merino et al., 1999</xref>. However, the enriched expression of <italic>Gdf6</italic> may provide a complementary role to <italic>Gdf5</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(B)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Settle et al., 2003</xref>]. Furthermore, based on the distribution of GDF5<sup>+</sup> progenitors during synovial joint development and their contribution to the formation of most articular chondrocytes in previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2017</xref>, NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors are probably a subset of GDF5<sup>+</sup> progenitors. Together, these results provide important insights into the molecular signature of articular cartilage progenitors.</p><p>Our results show that suppression of NFATc1 is sufficient to induce articular chondrogenesis both ex vivo and in vivo [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(B and D–F)</xref>] and thus NFATc1 could represent a core negative transcriptional regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation. Notably, this role of NFATc1 in regulating chondrocyte differentiation is confined to the articular cartilage because NFATc1 does not express in growth-plate progenitors or chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(A and E)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>]. Consistent with the inhibitory role of NFATc1 in articular chondrocyte differentiation, previous in vitro studies in murine chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 cells and human epiphyseal chondrocytes also showed that NFATc1 suppresses chondrocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zanotti and Canalis, 2013</xref>.</p><p>Notably, a protective role of NFATc1 in osteoarthritic cartilage has been suggested previously, which is based on the decrease of NFATc1 expression in lesional osteoarthritic cartilage in human patients, as well as the severe articular cartilage deterioration in mice with conditional deletion of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> driven by the Collagen 2 promoter Cre with a background of <italic>Nfatc2</italic> deficiency (<italic>Nfatc1<sup>Col2a1</sup>;Nfatc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenblatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beier, 2014</xref>. While the <italic>Nfatc1<sup>Col2a1</sup>;Nfatc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice indeed develop osteoarthritic phenotypes, we did not find the typic osteoarthritic phenotype in the follow-up study in mice with deletion of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> driven by tamoxifen-induced <italic>Aggrecan<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> with the background of <italic>Nfatc2</italic> deficiency (<italic>Nfatc1<sup>AggrecanCreERT2</sup>;Nfatc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice) after administering tamoxifen at different ages. Instead, these animals develop obvious osteochondroma-like lesions at the entheseal site and within ligaments around the joint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2016</xref>. Since <italic>Col2a1</italic> is also expressed in perichondrial precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2014</xref>, the accelerated osteoarthritis phenotype in <italic>Nfatc1<sup>Col2a1</sup>;Nfatc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could be secondary to the osteochondroma phenotype in these animals, instead of a direct beneficial role of NFATc1 in articular cartilage.</p><p>A recent study by Atsuta et al. using limb bud mesenchymal cells showed that the ectopic expression of NFATc1 seems to promote chondrocyte differentiation as shown by the alcian blue staining in micromass-cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atsuta et al., 2019</xref>). While additional experiments are necessary to confirm chondrocyte differentiation at the molecular level, overexpression of NFATc1 in cells from the whole limb bud might not reflect the physiological function of NFATc1 in chondrogenesis because NFATc1 expression is highly confined to articular and perichondrial progenitors during skeletal development according to the lineage tracing data in <italic>Nfatc1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nfatc1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, this disparity could also be due to the different cell types utilized in these two studies.</p><p>The mechanism of regulating NFATc1 expression during articular cartilage development remains unclear. A previous study showed that Notch signaling suppresses NFATc1 expression in ATDC5 cells and primary chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zanotti and Canalis, 2013</xref>. Furthermore, the Notch signaling can be activated by mechanical loading in mandibular condylar chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ziouti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2021</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that mechanical loading and Notch signaling act upstream of NFATc1 expression during articular cartilage development. Further studies need to verify this speculation and explore other biochemical, biophysical, and epigenetic pathways regulating NFATc1 expression during articular chondrocyte differentiation. In addition, our transcriptome data show that <italic>Nfatc4</italic> is also enriched in articular cartilage progenitors. The function of NFATc4 and its relationship with NFATc1 in regulating articular cartilage formation needs further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have unveiled that NFATc1-expressing progenitors generate articular but not growth-plate chondrocytes during development and identified NFATc1 as a critical negative transcriptional regulator of articular chondrocyte differentiation. Given the importance of NFATc1 in articular chondrogenesis, modulating NFAT signaling in skeletal progenitors may represent a novel, precise strategy for articular cartilage regeneration and treating cartilaginous diseases.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>There are some important limitations to our present study. Firstly, the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells we used in this study might contain some cells not expressing NFATc1 but derived from NFATc1-expressing precursors. Given the prominent progenitor cell properties of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population, if these derived cells also display characteristics of progenitor cells, their precursors (NFATc1-expressing cells) will represent a higher hierarchy of progenitors or stem cells, which yet support our conclusions. In fact, NFATc1 is positively expressed in the incipient articular cartilage of neonatal mice [Fig. 1(E)] and these NFATc1-expressing cells can form local cell clusters with articular cartilage development [Fig. 2(A)], indicating that NFATc1 also marks articular cartilage progenitors in neonatal mice. Secondly, these GFP<sup>+</sup> cells might include cells from other articular tissues (e.g. meniscus, articular synovium, and ligament). Since all articular tissues are derived from progenitor cells sharing the same molecular markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shwartz et al., 2016</xref> and currently there are no specific markers to distinguish progenitors for these different articular tissues, it was challenging to explicitly isolate articular cartilage progenitor cells at the early stages of development. Future studies will be necessary to dissect the developmental hierarchy of NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitor cells and elucidate the mechanisms determining their differentiation to meniscal, synovial, or ligament cells versus articular chondrocytes. Thirdly, the detailed molecular mechanism of NFATc1 regulating articular chondrocyte differentiation needs further exploration. Future studies combining techniques like ChIP, CUT&amp;RUN, or CUT&amp;Tag with high-throughput DNA sequencing will be able to unveil the transcriptional landscape of NFATc1-regulated articular chondrocyte differentiation. Lastly, the origin of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors should be further explored, which will be critical to better understand the basic mechanism of articular cartilage development and leverage it for articular cartilage regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

One major concern with severe technical issues is an animal model option for FACS-based studies. FACS utilized here is predominantly based on NFATc1 Cre-mTmG rodents whereas Figure 1A and 1B displayed almost all articular cartilage cells express, or expressed, NFATc1 during developmental stage. Thus, the conclusions addressed based on this technique represented the biological behavior of all articular chondrocytes though this point was partially discussed in limitations. Should it be considered that an inducible-Cre model, such as NFATc1-CreER individuals, be taken advantage of in future FACS-based in vitro and in vivo assays to avoid these limitations. Otherwise, all these experiments downstream of FACS were just comparing chondrocytes with muscle cells, according to gene ontology results.</p><p>2. A likely nuisance of this data with previous studies is that in Figure 4, GFP- cells includes a similar proportion of CD200+ cells and a higher amount of CD105- cells compared with GFP+ cells but, conversely, shown a reduced ability in differentiation ability albeit other exclusive markers are not compared through flow cytometry in this figure, and this should be worried more considering the total loss of physiological function according to Figure S2B. Although transcriptome study uncovered these cells are mesenchymal-derived progenitors, this requires to be clarified as it clearly disobeyed the phenomenon observed in murine models according to previous documents. Further in vitro or in vivo assays are required to evaluate the conclusion of GFP+ cells were generated from their intrinsic progenitor functions or from a baseline issue consequent to loss-of-function of GFP- cells.</p><p>3. At the same time, since osteoclasts also highly express NFATc1, would it be possible to analyze some major clastogenic gene to prove how precise the dissections performed for FACS were and exclude potential osteoclast contamination?</p><p>4. The approaches of in vivo transplantation here somehow exhibited leakage of cells from the calcified organoid, pointed out by black arrows, formed as HE staining displaying some histologically identified chondrocytes at both right and lower sides. Saf-O staining also confirmed this concern by showing escaped chondrocytes outside of the Matrigel organoid. This concern is also linked to major point 1 since GFP+ cells implanted are almost all chondrocytes, it is hard to make a conclusion that NFATc1+ cells are able to form cartilage organoid in vivo. Experimental details and more appreciable results are required to be specifically discussed for the clarification of those confusions.</p><p>5. Related to point 4, one question needs to be answered: why kidney capsule transplantation was not performed in this case? Apparently, renal capsule provides a more stable environment for cellular graft compared to subcutaneous space considering the nutrient supply and the immune attack might cause unwanted outcomes.</p><p>6. According to Murphy MP., et al., Nat Med., 2020, SSCs and BCSPs that contribute to articular cartilage regeneration were defined by cells expressing or lacking a group of surface marker. Whereas in this manuscript those panels are not the same, especially ItgaV which were proven to be an important marker for cells that have capacity of self-renew and multipotent differentiation abilities. It might be worthwhile for authors to go over those panels in their previous experiments to confirm if NFATc1+ cells overlap with SSCs and/or BCSPs that could functionally confirm NFATc1+ cells as a crucial source of chondrogenic progenitors.</p><p>7. It is not appropriate to address GFP+ cells formed mineralized tissues around them simply through HE staining according to Figure 3F. A Von-Kossa staining is required for the sake of basic validation of calcified area. Also, Saf-O staining looks weird and requires to be duplicated for better images.</p><p>8. The authors reported that NFATc1-expressing progenitors generate articular chondrocytes, meniscus cells, and synovial lining cells. Do these progenitors also generate articular ligaments?</p><p>9. Does the deletion of Nfatc1 in Prrx1-cre; Nfatc1flox mice affect the ligament? It looks like the articular ligament is abnormal in Figure 5E, which should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The title does not reflect the finding that NFATc1 expressing progenitors give rise to most of articular cartilage chondrocytes. The title should be revised to reflect such finding.</p><p>2) There is a discordance between the NFATc1 expression and NFATc1 expressing cells on articular cartilage according to Figure 1 and 2. In Figure 1E, NFATc1 immunostaining of articular suggests abundance of NFATc1 expressing cells at P0. However, in Figure 2, only a limited number of cells on the superficial layer is GFP positive despite the cre-induction occurring at P0 and P1. The expected results would be GFP-positive population abundance would be reflective of NFATc1 immunostained cell distribution, which is not according to Figure 1 and 2.</p><p>3) Based on the expression pattern of NFATc1 expressing progenitors at E13.5, P0, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks (Figure 1), one wonders whether NFATc1 expressing cells at E13.5 are a subset of GDF5 expressing cells or a distinct population during that time or earlier. Articular chondrocyte progenitors are likely heterogenous and may need multiple markers to identify them. Immunofluorescence for GDF5 and whether that co-localized with NFATc1 expressing cells could potentially reveal whether these cell populations overlap.</p><p>4) Authors could further strengthen their finding that NFATc1 expressing progenitors being multipotent (Figure 3) by performing more analyses of osteoblasts and adipocytes. They already have evidence in Figure 1(A) that shows abundance of GFP-positive bone lining cells. In addition, tibial metaphyseal bone marrow adipocytes may also be positive for GFP, which cannot be ascertained from the provided data. Authors can perform immunofluorescence of FISH to identify whether these GFP-positive cells express markers of osteoblasts or adipocytes.</p><p>5) Although not in articular cartilage, NFATc1 ChIP-seq has been previously performed (Keyes et al. 2013) with the public dataset already available. Through these studies authors may be able to further narrow down the binding sites of NFATc1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81569.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To determine the function of NFATc1 in articular cartilage development at postnatal stage, the authors may need to cross Nfatc1-flox mice with Col2-CreER mice to specifically determine changes in articular cartilage morphogenesis at postnatal stage.</p></disp-quote><p>The Col2-Cre;Nfatc1-flox (Nfatc1Col2) mouse model has been reported in a previous study1. These animals do not develop gross and histological defects in the articular cartilage. Compared to wild-type controls, they also do not show differences in osteoarthritis progression by destabilization of the medial meniscus. These results indicate that NFATc1 is dispensable in Col2-expressing articular chondrocytes. In fact, these results match our findings in the current study that NFATc1 mainly characterizes articular cartilage progenitors, and its expression decreases with articular chondrocyte differentiation. As Nfatc1 is deleted in all Col2-expressing cells, including postnatal articular chondrocytes, in the Nfatc1Col2 mouse model, we think it is not necessary to further analyze the tamoxifen-induced Col2-CreER;Nfatc1-flox mouse model.</p><p>In reference to the reviewer’s comment, we have integrated the previous results from Nfatc1Col2 mice into the manuscript (Lines 253-258 in the merged PDF of the revised manuscript).

Cells for FACS analysis in this study were from neonatal <italic>Nfatc1- Cre;Rosa26-mTmGfl/+</italic> mice (postnatal day 0), at which age the incipient articular cartilage consists mainly of progenitor cells that have not yet developed the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of differentiated articular chondrocytes<sup>4</sup>. The progenitor cell properties of these cells are well demonstrated in vivo and ex vivo (Figures 2 and 3). Furthermore, the FACS analysis in Figure 4E and F aimed primarily to verify the expression of several surface molecular markers based on the RNA-seq results in NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors.</p><p>The heterogeneity of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population is mainly caused by different cell lineages in the joint (articular cartilage, meniscus, synovium, and ligament) and different stages of progenitor cell development, which will probably still exist in the <italic>Nfatc1-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mouse model after multiple pulses of tamoxifen.

Studies have shown that there could be multiple different pools of stem cells in the generation and maintenance of the musculoskeletal system<sup>5-8</sup>. Since the NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors we identified in this study do not generate the mouse growth plate primordium during embryonic development (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), they probably represent a distinct lineage of skeletal stem cells from those mentioned by the reviewer in previous documents. Consequently, it remains unclear whether these different lineages of skeletal stem cells share the same profile of surface molecules. Although our transcriptome data and FACS results in Figure 4D, E and F provide certain insights into the molecular characteristics of the GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> progenitor cells, further studies need to dissect the developmental hierarchy and the surface molecular profile of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors and systemically compare them with other populations of skeletal stem cells.</p><p>In reference to the reviewer’s comment, we add the following sentence to the Discussion section of the manuscript (Lines 388-390 in the merged PDF of the revised manuscript):</p><p>“Lastly, the origin of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors should be further explored, which will be critical to better understand the basic mechanism of articular cartilage development and leverage it for articular cartilage regeneration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. At the same time, since osteoclasts also highly express NFATc1, would it be possible to analyze some major clastogenic gene to prove how precise the dissections performed for FACS were and exclude potential osteoclast contamination?</p></disp-quote><p>Osteoclasts are considered cells of hematopoietic origin<sup>9</sup>. Both RNA-seq data (Supplementary file 1) and FACS analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) showed negative staining for CD11B and CD45 in GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> cells, which can exclude osteoclast contamination in both cell populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The approaches of in vivo transplantation here somehow exhibited leakage of cells from the calcified organoid, pointed out by black arrows, formed as HE staining displaying some histologically identified chondrocytes at both right and lower sides. Saf-O staining also confirmed this concern by showing escaped chondrocytes outside of the Matrigel organoid. This concern is also linked to major point 1 since GFP+ cells implanted are almost all chondrocytes, it is hard to make a conclusion that NFATc1+ cells are able to form cartilage organoid in vivo. Experimental details and more appreciable results are required to be specifically discussed for the clarification of those confusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. Note that the GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population enriched with articular cartilage progenitors could be at different stages of development. The development of postnatal articular cartilage is highly dependent on the increased volume of articular chondrocytes<sup>10</sup>. The colony formation capacity of postnatal articular cartilage progenitors is limited to 3-6 cells/clone (Figure 2A and reference<sup>10</sup>). We refer the editors and the reviewer to our response to comment #1 of this reviewer, in which we explain the population of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and the characteristics of articular cartilage development in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Related to point 4, one question needs to be answered: why kidney capsule transplantation was not performed in this case? Apparently, renal capsule provides a more stable environment for cellular graft compared to subcutaneous space considering the nutrient supply and the immune attack might cause unwanted outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. It should be noted that articular cartilage is a blood vessel and nerve- free tissue, and the development of articular cartilage occurs right underneath the skin. Therefore, we consider that the subcutaneous space is closer to the native environment of articular cartilage development. The Matrigel can provide the structural organization of the extracellular matrix and essential growth factors for chondrogenesis.</p><p>Kidney capsule transplantation is a very useful model in the analysis of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis of skeletal stem cells from the bone marrow or growth plate. It would be interesting to try this method for NFATc1<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells and compare it with subcutaneous transplantation in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. According to Murphy MP., et al., Nat Med., 2020, SSCs and BCSPs that contribute to articular cartilage regeneration were defined by cells expressing or lacking a group of surface marker. Whereas in this manuscript those panels are not the same, especially ItgaV which were proven to be an important marker for cells that have capacity of self-renew and multipotent differentiation abilities. It might be worthwhile for authors to go over those panels in their previous experiments to confirm if NFATc1+ cells overlap with SSCs and/or BCSPs that could functionally confirm NFATc1+ cells as a crucial source of chondrogenic progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The RNA-seq data showed that both GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>-</sup> cells express a high level of <italic>Itgav</italic> (<italic>Cd51</italic>). We have added the data in Supplementary file 1 and the manuscript (Line 213 in the merged PDF).</p><p>In the paper by Murphy MP, et al., cartilage formation was induced from Itgav<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>-</sup> SSCs by adding BMP2 and FGF inhibitors<sup>11</sup>. For this purpose, the authors induced microfracture lesions in the articular cartilage by drilling the surface of the articular cartilage down to the marrow space. In this context, the population of stem cells that regenerate cartilage remains undefined. As mentioned above in our response to this reviewer’s comment #2, the articular cartilage progenitors are probably different from the Itgav<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>-</sup> SSCs that were originally identified from the postnatal growth plate<sup>5</sup>. We agree with the reviewer that future studies should carefully compare molecular profiles and cartilage formation capacity between NFATc1<sup>+</sup> articular cartilage progenitors and Itgav<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup>CD105<sup>-</sup> SSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is not appropriate to address GFP+ cells formed mineralized tissues around them simply through HE staining according to Figure 3F. A Von-Kossa staining is required for the sake of basic validation of calcified area. Also, Saf-O staining looks weird and requires to be duplicated for better images.</p></disp-quote><p>The formation of calcified cartilage around GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was first noticed by the hardness of these tissues when making sections, and in particular, the HE staining was evaluated by two experienced pathologists (Lines 474- 476 in the merged PDF of the revised manuscript). Note that a specific method for staining calcified articular cartilage has not been well established yet. Von-Kossa staining is usually used to recognize mineralized bone matrix, which has not been widely used for staining calcified articular cartilage.</p><p>It should be noted that the Matrigel background may make the safranin-O staining different from that of native articular cartilage. The safranin-O staining in this study was repeated multiple times using sections from different animals (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per group).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors reported that NFATc1-expressing progenitors generate articular chondrocytes, meniscus cells, and synovial lining cells. Do these progenitors also generate articular ligaments?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, NFATc1-expressing progenitors also generate cells in the articular ligaments, which has been mentioned in our previous study<sup>3</sup>. In reference to the reviewer’s comment, we have also highlighted the finding in Figure 2 and the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Does the deletion of Nfatc1 in Prrx1-cre; Nfatc1flox mice affect the ligament? It looks like the articular ligament is abnormal in Figure 5E, which should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, deletion of <italic>Nfatc1</italic> in <italic>Prrx1</italic>-Cre;<italic>Nfatc1</italic>-flox mice also caused abnormal ligament development and ectopic cartilage formation in articular ligaments. These findings were mentioned in our previous article<sup>3</sup>. In this study, we focus on a novel physiological function of NFATc1 in identifying progenitors of articular cartilage and determining articular chondrocyte differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The title does not reflect the finding that NFATc1 expressing progenitors give rise to most of articular cartilage chondrocytes. The title should be revised to reflect such finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. The title of the manuscript has been changed as follows: “NFATc1 marks articular cartilage progenitors and negatively determines articular chondrocyte differentiation”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a discordance between the NFATc1 expression and NFATc1 expressing cells on articular cartilage according to Figure 1 and 2. In Figure 1E, NFATc1 immunostaining of articular suggests abundance of NFATc1 expressing cells at P0. However, in Figure 2, only a limited number of cells on the superficial layer is GFP positive despite the cre-induction occurring at P0 and P1. The expected results would be GFP-positive population abundance would be reflective of NFATc1 immunostained cell distribution, which is not according to Figure 1 and 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The discordance in NFATc1 expression between Figures 1 and 2 could be due to the recombination efficiency of the CreER<sup>T2</sup>-LoxP system in Figure 2. The recombination efficiency of the CreER<sup>T2</sup>-LoxP system is affected by the dosage, times, and routes of administration of tamoxifen. The experiment in Figure 2 aimed to observe in vivo colony formation of NFATc1-expressing progenitors and two doses of tamoxifen in the dams were enough to label some NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors in the pups and trace their fate in vivo. Note that this dose of tamoxifen administered to dam mice may not be enough to induce full recombination of the CreER<sup>T2</sup>- LoxP system in pup mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on the expression pattern of NFATc1 expressing progenitors at E13.5, P0, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks (Figure 1), one wonders whether NFATc1 expressing cells at E13.5 are a subset of GDF5 expressing cells or a distinct population during that time or earlier. Articular chondrocyte progenitors are likely heterogenous and may need multiple markers to identify them. Immunofluorescence for GDF5 and whether that co-localized with NFATc1 expressing cells could potentially reveal whether these cell populations overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this nice suggestion. We tried immunofluorescence staining for GDF5 in E13.5 mouse embryos. Unfortunately, we were unable to locate an antibody for specific staining of GDF5 in mouse tissue. However, by combining our results in this study with previous lineage tracing data in <italic>Gdf5</italic>-Cre and <italic>Gdf5</italic>-CreER reporter mice, which showed that most articular chondrocytes are derived from GDF5-expressing articular cartilage progenitors, NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors are probably a subset of GDF5- expressing progenitors. we are continuing to localize a specific antibody for GDF5 staining and will address this question in more detail in the next study.</p><p>According to this comment of the reviewer, we have discussed this point in the manuscript (Lines 307-310 in the merged PDF). Specifically, we state: “Furthermore, based on the distribution of GDF5<sup>+</sup> progenitors during synovial joint development and their contribution to the formation of most articular chondrocytes in previous reports<sup>10, 12</sup>, NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors are probably a subset of GDF5<sup>+</sup> progenitors.”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that multiple markers, especially surface molecules, are necessary to identify articular cartilage progenitors. An ongoing study in our group is dissecting the developmental hierarchy of NFATc1-expressing articular cartilage progenitors that will be able to reveal specific markers, especially surface markers, to identify articular cartilage progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors could further strengthen their finding that NFATc1 expressing progenitors being multipotent (Figure 3) by performing more analyses of osteoblasts and adipocytes. They already have evidence in Figure 1(A) that shows abundance of GFP-positive bone lining cells. In addition, tibial metaphyseal bone marrow adipocytes may also be positive for GFP, which cannot be ascertained from the provided data. Authors can perform immunofluorescence of FISH to identify whether these GFP-positive cells express markers of osteoblasts or adipocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestion. The focus of the current study is to report the findings that NFATc1 identifies articular cartilage progenitors and the function of NFATc1 in determining articular chondrocyte differentiation. The contribution of NFATc1<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells to osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes is beyond the scope of the current study. However, the authors recognize that it will be critical to address these questions in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although not in articular cartilage, NFATc1 ChIP-seq has been previously performed (Keyes et al. 2013) with the public dataset already available. Through these studies authors may be able to further narrow down the binding sites of NFATc1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To narrow down the binding site of NFATc1 in the <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene promoter, we instead performed a FIMO analysis<sup>2</sup> and identified an NFATc1 motif that is located in mouse chr15: 98004609-98004620 and overlaps with the <italic>Col2a1</italic> promoter region (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we validated the binding of NFATc1 to this site by the technique of cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) (Figure 5H). These results have been added to the manuscript (Lines 265-270 in the merged PDF of the revised manuscript).</p><p>References</p><p>1.
