biomarkers that predict response to treatment are highly desirable. The primary aim was to predict progression-free survival (PFS) with a multivariate risk prediction model.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental covariates were derived from blood samples of 56 HNSCC patients which were prospectively obtained within a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02633800) at baseline and after the first treatment cycle of combined platinum-based chemotherapy with cetuximab treatment. Clinical and experimental covariates were selected by Bayesian multivariate regression to form risk scores to predict PFS.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>A ‘baseline’ and a ‘combined’ risk prediction model were generated, each of which featuring clinical and experimental covariates. The baseline risk signature has three covariates and was strongly driven by baseline percentage of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>high</sup> monocytes. The combined signature has six covariates, also featuring baseline CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>high</sup> monocytes but is strongly driven by on-treatment relative change of CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells percentages. The combined model has a higher predictive power than the baseline model and was successfully validated to predict therapeutic response in an independent cohort of nine patients from an additional Phase 2 trial (NCT03494322) assessing the addition of avelumab to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC. We identified tissue counterparts for the immune cells driving the models, using imaging mass cytometry, that specifically colocalized at the tissue level and correlated with outcome.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This immune-based combined multimodality signature, obtained through longitudinal peripheral blood monitoring and validated in an independent cohort, presents a novel means of predicting response early on during the treatment course.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Daiichi Sankyo Inc, Cancer Research UK, EU IMI2 IMMUCAN, UK Medical Research Council, European Research Council (335326), Merck Serono.

For many years, the standard-of-care first-line systemic treatment was the EXTREME regimen, consisting of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Cutsem et al., 2009</xref>). The KEYNOTE-048 trial in 2019 changed the treatment paradigm for these patients by incorporating pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, into the first-line setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burtness et al., 2019</xref>). However, the EXTREME regimen remains a first-line standard-of-care for a substantial number of patients, specifically those with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) negative tumours or those with contraindications to the use of anti-PD1 immunotherapy.</p><p>While effective, these regimens are associated with significant toxicities. One of the key challenges for the treating physician is to identify the patients who would benefit from either of these treatment regimens. A predictive biomarker signature for patients with advanced HNSCC will help individualize discussions with patients regarding the risk-benefit balance of treatment and may guide patients who are likely to perform poorly towards alternative therapy regimens or clinical trials.</p><p>The absence of predictive biomarkers in this patient cohort represents a significant clinical unmet need. Until the development of PD-L1 as a biomarker for immunotherapy, efforts to generate biomarkers in HNSCC have focused on gene expression profiles, which are dependent on the availability of tumour tissue and are only performed on pre-treatment samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bossi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2019</xref>). Signatures based on a single biological modality and taken at a single timepoint may be insufficient to predict outcomes, as response to therapy relies on a dynamic interplay between cancer genomics, immune profile, tumour microenvironment, and clinicopathological characteristics of the patient receiving treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheerla and Gevaert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Efforts to develop a machine learning model to stratify survival risk by combining genetic and clinicopathological characteristics have revealed some success in advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tseng et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesize that a multimodal analysis, taking into account both clinicopathological and laboratory-based biological covariates at different timepoints, would provide better predictive value. Furthermore, by only including covariates that can be obtained from a blood biopsy, patients could be easily screened for discovered biomarkers.</p><p>We prospectively collected peripheral blood samples from a Phase 2 trial in R/M HNSCC (NTC02633800) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forster et al., 2019</xref>), which utilized cetuximab with platinum therapy as a backbone, and conducted a parallel exploratory analysis with the aim of generating a biomarker signature which would predict outcomes to treatment. We hypothesized that the detailed definition of a broad immune cell signature could contribute to the development of assays employing liquid biopsies to predict clinical outcomes. We also incorporated the analysis of two circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) from exosomes: <italic>miR-21-5p</italic> and <italic>miR-142-3p</italic>, which have previously demonstrated prognostic and predictive utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Summerer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vahabi et al., 2021</xref>). As the trial investigated the efficacy of an anti-ErbB3 antibody, patritumab, administered alongside an anti-EGFR antibody, we simultaneously analysed EGFR-ErbB3 dimerization using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and included it in our analysis.</p><p>By extracting information from patient samples at baseline and after the first cycle of treatment within this trial, we aimed to generate a multimodal predictive signature for the systemic therapy based on a novel Bayesian multivariate model. The immune populations driving the risk signature were then prospectively validated in an independent cohort of patients from a Phase 2 trial evaluating avelumab in combination with cetuximab in R/M HNSCC (the EACH trial; NCT03494322). Blood samples were collected at baseline and post first dose of cetuximab before administration of avelumab. Validation was performed against the best overall response, as assessed by iRECIST, showing strong correlation between biomarkers identified in the risk signature and therapeutic response despite changes in treatment regimen. We then used imaging mass cytometry driven by the risk signature to identify correlate changes in systemic immune populations with intra-tumoural immune subsets that colocalize at the tumoural level and appear to be key to response. This risk signature can serve as a non-invasive risk stratification for patients with R/M HNSCC using only peripheral blood, guiding the clinician toward the likelihood of success early during the treatment course.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The clinical study design of the Phase 2 study (NCT02633800) and its associated exploratory analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Four patients were excluded due to lack of blood samples at both timepoints. One patient was excluded due to lack of outcome data. Two patients only had a baseline biopsy. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Study approval was obtained from ethics committees (Research Ethics Committee reference: 18/LO/0021). PBMCs underwent a quality control step to check viability which resulted in the exclusion of one of the patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Using Bayesian multivariate proportional hazards regression, covariates were ranked and selected by predictive importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigoriadis et al., 2018</xref>). We derived two models using separate datasets: firstly, a baseline predictive model containing a dataset of 42 baseline covariates (29 laboratory parameters at baseline (C1) and 13 clinical characteristics). The second, a combined predictive model, consists of 71 covariates, that is, the 42 baseline covariates and a further 29 derived from the on-treatment change of the value of a lab-based parameter relative to its value in the same patient at baseline denoted as lfc of that variable.</p><p>The relative efficiency of the predictive model was assessed by using C-index (a metric proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrell et al., 1984</xref>, to evaluate the accuracy of predictions made by an algorithm) and rank correlation of the signature-generated risk scores with survival time. The number of significant covariates in each prediction signature was determined with the aim of avoiding overfitting of the signature to the study data using the ‘batch regression’ option of the Saddle Point Signature software (Saddle Point Science Ltd., London, UK), according to methods that were previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shalabi et al., 2018</xref>). Systematic iterative covariate rejection and cross-validation (5000 iterations) allowed for the selection of an optimal covariate set to avoid overfitting though inclusion of too many covariates. The optimal set can be chosen in two ways, either based on the peak prediction performance of cross-validation or the more stringent method that equally penalizes validation performance and overfitting (defined as the deviation between training and validation performance). All signatures presented were chosen using the more stringent criterion and data for all covariates is also presented for the purposes of identifying covariates that may be important but do not quite meet the criterion. The regression included covariates representing the missingness of the data to account for the possibility that patient or sample selection/rejection (for any reason) is biased with respect to outcome and therefore could be informative.</p><p>Covariates were normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation such that the importance and significance of covariates can be judged by their assigned beta value (β) in the proportional hazards model, and corresponding hazard ratio (HR) equal to e<sup>2β</sup>. A negative β value reflects a lower risk of developing an event. The Saddle Point Signature software additionally judges the performance of similar randomized data, which most often has β values around zero and within a critical range, such that any real covariate that has a β value outside this critical range can be judged to be performing significantly better than randomized data. For standard correlation tests between numeric covariates, Pearson correlation was used and denoted as r. For correlation tests against categorical outcomes, or where correlations may not be linear (e.g. PFS), Kendall rank correlation was used which was denoted as τ. Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank tests were generated using the R survival package. Correlations were performed with the R cor.test function. C-index values were calculated using the Hmisc R package.</p><p>Validation of the signatures was performed by calculating the risk score for each patient in the validation trial (EACH) using the combined risk signature covariate weights and performing a correlation test versus the iRECIST outcome for that trial. The covariates were obtained from flow cytometry analysis on the PBMCs of the validation cohort and patient age at registration. As detailed tumour site information was not available for the validation cohort, these covariates were replaced in the signature by the average values from the discovery cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Frozen PBMC samples were thawed and stained with Fixable viability dye (Yellow Live/Dead, Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by two different panels of membrane markers.

Separately, each of the variates showed similar trends in the validation cohort to those observed in the test cohort yet only two key immune populations showed interesting strong correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). High pre-treatment levels of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes significantly correlated with a worse disease outcome in all patients except for a single outlier who exhibited a complete response to treatment. A post-treatment increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory cells (lfcCD8CM) also correlated with a poorer treatment outcome. Interestingly, both covariates were the strongest drivers of the risk signature in the discovery cohort with the baseline level of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes being a key covariate in both signatures. Given this result we assessed their ability to predict PFS as univariates in the original cohort. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS by median of each of these covariates. We observed a modest split that reached significance only in the case of baseline CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte (log rank p-value = 0.03) and not in the case of lfcCD8CM cells (log rank p-value = 0.1). lfcCD8CM more strongly predicted PFS (C-index=0.74, τ=−0.36, p=0.01) than base line CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (C-index=0.39, τ=0.22, p=0.07). Due to the consistency with which the CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte population appeared across our study, we wanted to further characterize this population to determine its phenotype hence we expanded the antibody panel for the validation set and determined that these CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes also express high levels of HLA-DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Imaging mass cytometry of tissue reveals correlation of CD33<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>high</sup> myeloid cell with tissue CD74<sup>+</sup> macrophages interacting with tissue CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells</title><p>Having established that two immune subsets in peripheral blood predict therapeutic response within a multivariate signature, we subsequently explored the relationship between the immune findings in peripheral blood with tumour infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). We obtained sufficient tissue from the biopsy at trial enrolment for in-depth profiling by imaging mass cytometry from nine patients.</p><p>Standard FFPE samples from these patients were stained using a custom immune focused imaging mass cytometry panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The cells were segmented and then classified into superpopulations using a trained machine learning approach. These segmented cells were divided into subpopulations by unsupervised clustering using uniform manifold approximation and projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The distribution of the superpopulations per patient is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, yet none of which correlated with PFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The phenotypes of the subclusters are shown by heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

The complete list of these correlations can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We focused on the two main populations highlighted by the validation cohort, being CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes and CD8CM to understand how they are represented at the tumoural level. The peripheral intermediate monocyte population strongly correlated with a tissue CD14<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD74<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophage population while the CD8CM inversely correlated with CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory T cell (CD8Trm) population. Both of those populations positively correlated with PFS. Interestingly, the peripheral CD33<sup>+</sup> monocyte population strongly correlated with CD8Trm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To understand whether this correlation resulted in cellular levels of interactions, we assessed the average number of cell-to-cell contact that CD8Trms had with each of the clustered subpopulations. We found these cells were significantly more likely to be in contact with a CD74<sup>+</sup> macrophage than any other identified population suggesting this interaction is biologically driven and not random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Imaging mass cytometry analysis on tissue sections from nine patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Uniform manifold approximation and projections (UMAP) of the segmented cells from the combined patient sections showing their distribution across the superpopulations.

Gene expression profiling has revealed promising initial results in this domain but have been limited to HPV-positive HNSCC which inherently have better prognoses. The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) in the peripheral blood of HNSCC patients prior to treatment has been extensively investigated for its ability to predict disease outcome. Two recent meta-analyses on the subject have identified that a high pre-treatment NLR correlated with worse OS with respective HRs of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.47–1.93; p&lt;0.001) and HR of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.53–2.07; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mascarella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takenaka et al., 2018</xref>). Using our combined risk signature, we were able to predict disease outcome more accurately across two separate treatment modalities. Other recent biomarker research has focused on predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade by analysing tissue-based biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression levels, but when used in isolation have not been sufficiently predictive at identifying patients who would benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burtness et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While unimodal biomarkers may offer some predictive value, the biology of HNSCC and likelihood of response to treatment is likely to be dictated by an interplay between tumour immunity, genomic signatures, and a host of clinicopathological characteristics which can only be assessed by a multivariate analysis. There has been an increased interest in peripheral blood-based liquid biopsies in recent years, particularly in the context of PBMC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nixon et al., 2019</xref>). The ability to extract predictive biomarkers from a blood-based liquid biopsy mitigates certain limitations posed by tissue biopsies – particularly the tissue accessibility, technical expertise to obtain the biopsy, patient frailty, and the amount of tissue available. The ease of obtaining liquid biopsies also facilitates longitudinal monitoring of response to treatment. Moreover, PBMCs offer a much more systemic snapshot of the immune response which overcomes intra-tumoural heterogeneity that results in non-uniform distribution of biomarkers. The potential of PBMCs to unravel the tumoural immune landscape is slowly being realized, thanks to advancements in the fields of high-dimensional flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and cytometry by time of flight. However, such techniques generate an excessive number of variables which require powerful statistical analysis tools to overcome pitfalls such as overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shalabi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first examples of integrating multiple biological covariates derived from peripheral blood and patient clinical data to generate a signature which predicts treatment response and that has been validated across multiple therapeutic modalities.</p><p>By employing cross-validation iterations to estimate training and validation errors, implementing advanced overfitting correlation protocols, using built-in corrections for informative data missingness, and probabilistic covariate removal, we were able to derive a robust optimal covariate set which correlates with PFS. This combination of analyses has been shown to produce robust signatures that do generalize to uncaptured data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The biological components of the predictive model warrant discussion. The only clinical covariate to feature in the combined risk signature was the hypopharyngeal SCC sub-site, which was adversely correlated with PFS. This corroborates previous findings that the 5-year relative survival of patients with hypopharyngeal SCC is consistently the worst amongst different anatomical HNSCC sub-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gatta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Machiels et al., 2020</xref>). The propensity of hypopharyngeal tumours to present at the de novo advanced stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadoni et al., 2017</xref>) and the density of submucosal lymphatics in this anatomical region translates into these patients inherently performing worse – lending support to the robust nature of our predictive signature. The notable absence of patritumab (denoted as ‘Drug’) in our predictive signatures is also consistent with the outcome of the Phase 2 clinical trial where the addition of this investigational medicinal product did not produce any benefit to PFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forster et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another key discovery in this study is the significance of analysis of sequential samples even at early stages of therapy. This, we believe, is important for the analysis of lab-based biological variables. There is a high level of inter-individual heterogeneity in the relative abundance of PBMC subpopulations even between healthy donors. This inherently weakens the predictive power of covariates based on raw PBMC populations. We observe this phenomenon in our dataset as the combined risk signature had higher predictive power than the baseline one. By opting to present the biological data obtained from the first post-treatment biopsy as change relative to the baseline biopsy, we obtained a much more predictive risk signature in our combined model. This is highlighted in the post-treatment change in CD8CM percentage relative to baseline value which is not only the strongest predictor of PFS in the combined model, but also has a greater univariate predictive value than the whole baseline signature. This validates the potential of our approach has in deconvoluting observed biological phenomena due to patient heterogeneity from that induced by drug treatment, both of which are key to biomarker discovery.</p><p>We also validated our risk signature in a second cohort thus allowing us to successfully identify predictive biological biomarkers for therapy across different treatment modalities. The fact that the first trial involved targeted therapies and the second a combination of anti-EGFR and anti-PD-L1 therapy, yet the same blood kinetic change can still distinguish between responders and non-responders is novel and has not been seen before according to our knowledge. The limitation is that the independent validation cohort is small despite the fact that the result we obtained with the present number of validation samples did reach significance (Kandall tau = 0.725, with p-value 0.018). This further highlights the power of multivariate analysis as none of the univariates identified in the test cohort independently predicted treatment outcome in the validation cohort, yet the risk signature strongly correlated with a poorer outcome. We believe that understanding the interplay of key immune subsets between the tumoural microenvironment and the circulation will be key to biomarker development. We focused on two covariates from the risk signature based on their predictive power in both cohorts. Analysis of immune populations at the tissue level allowed us to identify tissue counterparts of peripheral CD33<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>+</sup> monocytes and CD8CM that not only colocalized at the tissue level but also were favourable to a good outcome. Hence, we hypothesize to have uncovered a two-checkpoint system for predicting response to systemic therapy which merits further investigation.</p><p>Firstly, a favourable therapeutic outcome requires the presence of high pre-treatment levels of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>high</sup> monocytes. These correlated with a similar population of CD74<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> population of tumoural myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are plastic yet given the similarity in the marker expression patterns between the peripheral CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>high</sup> monocyte population and the CD14<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD74<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> tissue macrophages, as well as the strong correlation between their corresponding blood and tissue abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we hypothesize that they represent the same group of cells that gain CD68 expression as they enter the tissue. This monocyte population matches the population of intermediate monocytes described in the literature shown to have a key role in antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cravens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zawada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Given the correlation between tissue levels CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cell, peripheral intermediate monocytes, and the tissue colocalization of the CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells with the CD74<sup>+</sup> macrophages, we can imagine a role for our myeloid population in inducing post-treatment expansion of CD8CM potentially via a mechanism involving cross-presentation of antigens released by drug-induced cancer cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, cetuximab treatment can be a source of tumour-derived antigens as it has been shown to increase TCR diversity in peripheral T cells as well as cross-presentation by antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kansy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srivastava et al., 2013</xref>). Ideally, we would require analysis of the draining lymph node to fully understand how these cells move between the tumour and the circulation and their contribution to the expansion of the CD8CM, a role generally accomplished by dendritic cells at the level of the lymph node. Nevertheless, monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to activate and expand tissue resident memory T cells (Trm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snyder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Low et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muntjewerff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An on-treatment increase in the level of circulating CD8CM significantly correlated with a worse disease outcome in patients who received two regimens of systemic treatments within two trials. Interestingly, high levels of pre-treatment CD8CM cells correlating with a favourable treatment outcome in HNSCC has been previously and independently reported by the Whiteside group indirectly validating our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czystowska et al., 2013</xref>). While an increase in CD8CM correlating with a poorer outcome in both our datasets seems counter-intuitive, it is key to realize that this increase is only seen at the levels of peripheral CD8CM which inversely correlate with tissue Trm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Using single-cell sequencing and mapping of T cell receptor clonality at the levels of TILs and peripheral T cells, researchers have definitively proven that tumour reactive T cell clones can be found in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairfax et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kok et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pauken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Padrón et al., 2022</xref>). The movement of these cells between the tumour and draining lymph node was recently investigated using photoactivable T cells in mice which showed that there is continuous recruitment of memory T cells from the periphery into the tumour which replenishes the pool of tissue Trm identified by CD103 and TCF1 expression. However, this recruitment is usually matched by an egress of Trm cells out of the tumour to the draining lymph nodes which is accompanied by decreased expression CXCR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2022</xref>). The peripheral origin of Trm cells is still under investigation with recent data suggesting that CD8CM are not only capable of homing into the inflamed tissue but also undergoing transcriptional reprogramming to a stable Trm phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matos et al., 2022</xref>). We hypothesize that the predictive power of the population of peripheral CD8CM stems from its ability to home to the tumour and contribute to the Trm population which has recently been identified as key player in anti-tumour immunity in HNSCC as well as other cancers mainly in the context of immunotherapy but also in chemo/radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ida et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djenidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luoma et al., 2022</xref>). Unfortunately, one key shortcoming of our study is the lack of Trm-specific markers such as CD103, CD69, and TCF1 from the imaging mass cytometry panel of antibodies which we believe contributed to this anti-correlation not being stronger.</p><p>The accumulation of clonally expanded memory T cells in the periphery in poor responders is the potential result of tumour-induced T cell exclusion which we can infer from the negative correlation observed between peripheral and tumour infiltrating memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018</xref>). In this model CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells are being generated only in patients having a large pre-treatment pool of competent APCs yet these anti-tumour CD8<sup>+</sup> memory cells cannot enter the tumour from the periphery hence accumulating in circulation. Our group is now focused on understanding the different aspects of this model mainly with regards to the specific tumour exclusion of CD8CM T cells.</p><p>Another limitation of our work to discuss is the absence of overall survival (OS) data within our current dataset. It would have been interesting to assess whether the immune markers predict survival in the longer term. However, the accuracy of the predictive signature for OS is often diluted by a variety of subsequent treatment regimens.</p><p>The present study shows that the combination of biomarkers established prospectively by liquid biopsies early in the treatment course offers potential for the provision of personalized treatments to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nenclares et al., 2021</xref>). The risk signature drove the discovery of synergies between the systemic and tumoural immune response. Identifying such complex biological interplay as having a role in disease outcome is impossible without multivariate analysis. The post-stratification survival curves in our study demonstrate markedly different PFS outcomes as a testament to this robust statistical model and could represent an invaluable guide to clinicians during the initial stages of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is a shareholder of Nano Clinical Ltd</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received honoraria from Pfizer, GSK/Tesaro and Boheringer Ingleheim, and has had travel/accommodation/expenses paid for by Tesaro</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>has received research funding in the form of a grant from Novartis and Celgene</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>is in employment with Daichii Sankyo, and has stock and other ownership interests, research funding within Daichii Sankyo and has had travel/accommodation/expenses paid for by Daichii Sankyo</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf6"><p>has received honoraria from Amgen; Arch Oncology; AstraZeneca; Boehringer-Ingelheim; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Codiak; Inzen; Merck; MSD; Pfizer; Replimune and is on a speakers' bureau for Amgen, AstraZeneca; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Merck, MSD; Pfizer.

treatment of locally advanced and recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, predictive biomarkers are lacking. In this study, the co-authors have developed an algorithm that they conclude predicts the clinical outcome to multimodality immunotherapy. While this machine learning approach is intriguing, prospective validation of the proposed immune-based signature is essential to begin to incorporate such an approach into the clinic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73288.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Grandis</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263942">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263942v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

I feel that the authors have made a good-faith effort to answer all of my prior comments. I, unfortunately, feel that the prior comments have not been very completely addressed.</p><p>First is the issue of unmet clinical need. Several reviewers asked whether a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy is relevant, in the era of ICB. I do in fact agree with the authors that there is still clinical value to predicting response to regimens such as EXTREME which do in fact still have a role in the treatment of HNSCC, and are understudied.</p><p>However, I did raise the question as to whether this fairly labor-intensive, difficult-to-scale, and expensive assay would add value to the fairly inexpensive and widely available (although admittedly not widely used) biomarkers we already have. I gave the example of NLR but also alluded to simple nomograms that include clinical factors such as age, performance status, tumor stage, etc. It seems important to more convincingly make the case that this model outperforms the widely available, inexpensive data we already have. Looking at the c-indices for this model, I am not sure this is the case. I again would advise this be shown rigorously with direct comparisons, to make the case that this model adds value.</p><p>The validation set is very important to the conclusion that this assay has potential clinical use. I fully recognize that a validation set is hard to come by. But this is the &quot;acid test&quot; for such an assay. The validation data here is promising, and again, I understand how hard it is to gather such data, but it is not very convincing. Only 8 patients, with no PFS data (iRECIST is used, with a 50% objective response rate, which seems very high). To support the claim that such an assay has clinical value, a much broader set of validation data are needed.</p><p>I raised the question earlier about the large number of patients excluded due to a lack of biospecimens and am concerned that this may limit the results, as this is akin to unequal censoring in a clinical trial. It would be important to compare the patients being studied and those not being studied. This was not addressed.</p><p>As with the other reviewers, the lack of OS data is a weakness here. This is a more minor point, as I do understand that the reviewers tried and were unable to obtain this data from the industry sponsor. I want to stress this is a minor weakness compared to some of the above points. However, multiple co-authors have very significant industry COI (co-authors each receiving personal payments from 15-20 companies) and I am concerned that the withholding of OS data (which has already been collected and is in fact a component of PFS) may reflect other motives on the part of the industry sponsor with whom some authors may be conflicted. Nevertheless, if the data are unavailable, a suggestion: if OS data are not available, perhaps the authors could show rigorously that PFS is a very good surrogate marker of OS in this disease.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73288.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Barber et al. present a manuscript discussing predictive factors for chemotherapy efficacy in head and neck squamous cancer (HNSCC).

We selected a finite number of covariates based on a few factors – (a) published literature, (b) previous data generated by the group and (c) the applicability of the findings to the clinic. Instead of an exploratory article in which we could generate an infinite number of covariates by a technique similar to RNA sequencing, we opted for a select set of covariates. This hypothesis-driven approach generated a strong signature that is now validated across two trials. The focus on immune population is driven by our hypothesis that systemic changes in the PBMCs are indicative and reflective of the status of the intra-tumoral immune response. In the revised manuscript we used a custom immune focused imaging mass cytometry antibody panel to probe tissue sections from 9 patients. We now show that the key populations driving the predictive model in the periphery are not only reflected at the tumoral level, but these disparate immune cell subpopulations also interact. Figure 6 from the manuscript is shown below, in which we use a machine learning approach to segment cells and assign them to distinct immunological subpopulations. We found that the peripheral monocyte population strongly correlated with a tumoral macrophage population having a similar marker expression pattern. We found that the peripheral central memory CD8 T cells inversely correlated with tissue resident memory T cells. The tissue presence of both these cells correlated positively with outcome. Most strikingly, these two populations were most likely to co-localize with each other at the tissue level at a frequency of almost double the second highest co-localization. Data on the nature of the interplay between peripheral systemic immunity and intra-tumoral immunity is novel and rarely exists in the literature outside the scope of in-vivo animal models. Here we describe these interactions using human patient samples treated with a clinically relevant therapy.</p><p>Given the limited amount of patient sera collected in the trial we opted to perform exosome analysis on markers known to impact the response to the anti-EGFR/HER3 treatment/immune responses. This was in line with our labs work to use exosome FRET-FLIM as a surrogate for tissue FRET-FLIM which we originally used to discover a potential dimer dependent mechanism for anti-EGFR treatment resistance in neoadjuvant breast cancer patients<sup>9</sup>; and more recently published on a colorectal patient sample cohort from the COIN study <sup>10</sup>. While exosome EGFR-HER3 heterodimer failed to reach significance in our risk signature, it was close as depicted in the Kaplan-Meier curve from Figure 3C shown below. We of course acknowledge the potential added benefit of having serum cytokine array analysis. While that was not feasible for this study our group now aims at ensuring that extra patient serum samples are bio-banked for such analysis from ongoing and future trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The signatures were not prospectively validated on an independent cohort.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer regarding the need to obtain a validation set. Obtaining patient samples from a similar cohort was difficult but we managed to validate the signature on a set of patients treated with an anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody in combination with Cetuximab. Furthermore, the validation was performed using a limited numbers of covariates that were identified in the risk signature by the Bayesian model. These immune populations can be obtained by running a limited set of markers on flow cytometry. We were very happy to see that these limited immune based covariates strongly correlated with a worst disease response in an independent cohort using a different treatment modality. This furthers our hypothesis that changes in the immune populations are key to understanding response to systemic therapy. Fueled with the data from the validation cohort we furthered our analysis of the tissue from a total of 9 patients from the test cohort. Using imaging mass cytometry, we were able to identify how immune populations are mirrored at the tumoral level opening the horizon for new research. The data for the validation set is copied into this letter in response to point 2 of the public evaluation summary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Unfortunately this algorithm predicts outcome for a first-line therapy that is no longer considered to be the standard of care for HNSCC.</p></disp-quote><p>The EXTREME regimen (platinum/5-FU/cetuximab) remains a first-line standard of care treatment in the UK and European countries for HNSCC patients with negative PDL1 status (CPS score &lt;1) which account for around 15% of all HNSCC patients <sup>7</sup>. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment regardless of PD-L1 expression and pembrolizumab alone for patients with PD-L1-expressing tumours (CPS ≥1), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy only for patients with a CPS ≥1, and this has been highlighted in the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines <sup>8</sup> and (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta661/chapter/1-Recommendations).</p><p>Furthermore, chemotherapy with EXTREME regimen is standard of care for patients with contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as autoimmune disease <sup>8</sup>. It can also be considered as second-line treatment in patients who only received pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first line setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The outcome measure is PFS, which is appropriate for therapy effect but not the standard in first line therapy (OS would be).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We admit that the absence of overall survival is an inherent limitation of the study. In the process of submitting this revision, we have once again requested this dataset from the sponsoring pharmaceutical company but were informed that they are unable to provide it. This is because reorganization of funding priorities within the company precludes them opening datasets from an already-published clinical trial. We are equally disappointed to not be able to obtain this data, but firmly believe that the ability of the signature to predict PFS (the primary endpoint of the trial, untainted by subsequent lines of treatment), as well as cross-validation against the contemporary EACH trial, is a testament to the signature’s strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The conclusions of the manuscript are supported by the data, but some of the caveats (such as the lack of a validation cohort, key in predictive biomarker development), are not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the reviewer accepts the revised manuscript in which we believe we have addressed all his comments.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

I, unfortunately, feel that the prior comments have not been very completely addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to go through our revisions and the detailed rebuttal letter. However, we are sorry that he felt that our revision did not address all his concerns. We were confident and reasonably hopeful that the inclusion of a difficult to obtain validation cohort and the significant expansion of our immunological data would be sufficient to satisfy the previous reviewers’ comments. The fact that the first trial involved targeted therapies and the second a combination of anti-EGFR and anti-PDL1 therapy, yet the same blood kinetic change can still distinguish between responders and non-responders is very novel and unprecedented according to our knowledge and reinforced the originality of the research. We also regret that the immune cell biology findings from the deep profiling of our two Phase 2 studies were largely ignored despite their implications for the development of future immunotherapeutic. For instance, the additional imaging CyTOF data (in Figure 6) showed a very novel finding that the two most significant immune cell subpopulations (CD33+CD14+HLADRhigh monocytes and CD8 central memory T cells) were most likely to co-localize with each other at the tissue level at a frequency of almost double the second highest co-localization. This suggests that in-situ antigen presentation is a key driver for therapy induced response across multiple therapeutic modalities (e.g. standard of care chemotherapy and targeted therapies). These results once published will stimulate the immune-oncology community to further test this specific cell-cell interaction mechanism in preclinical mouse model treated e.g. with immune checkpoint therapeutics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First is the issue of unmet clinical need. Several reviewers asked whether a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy is relevant, in the era of ICB. I do in fact agree with the authors that there is still clinical value to predicting response to regimens such as EXTREME which do in fact still have a role in the treatment of HNSCC, and are understudied.</p><p>However, I did raise the question as to whether this fairly labor-intensive, difficult-to-scale, and expensive assay would add value to the fairly inexpensive and widely available (although admittedly not widely used) biomarkers we already have.

Looking at the c-indices for this model, I am not sure this is the case. I again would advise this be shown rigorously with direct comparisons, to make the case that this model adds value.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly disagree with the “no added value” comment. As a translational research group, we have been passionate about applying modern omic technology coupled with mathematical modelling and machine learning to Phase 1/Phase 2/Phase 3 clinical trial samples (Barber, Weitsman et al., 2020), with a goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the scientific mechanisms behind heterogeneity of response between patients to targeted and/or immune-based therapeutics. Also I sincerely believe that this early phase trial related translational work, underpinned by deep profiling techniques (rather than the crude neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) has shown us the way to find hidden subpopulations of patients who may be able to respond better; and for those the models predict will be resistant to treatment, we can in the future offer them new treatments based on the molecular immunological information about the individual patients arising from these deep profiling techniques.</p><p>As an illustration, our results echo the recent finding that treatment-induced expansion of emergent T cell clones in tumors and the systemic circulation that were undetectable prior to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Luoma, Suo et al., 2022). The latter requires looking at multiple time points and is similar to our findings that it is the analysis of the blood kinetic changes between pretreatment and (early) post treatment time points that reveals the memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion which predict response. These memory T cells are now believed to be bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade according to recent results obtained from preclinical models (Huang, Wu et al., 2022).</p><p>It was precisely the deployment of deep profiling (Spectral flow cytometry analysis (Luoma et al., 2022)) that leads to the conclusion of this recent translational trial paper (which unlike ours does not have an independent phase 2 trial to confirm the findings). We therefore strongly disagree with the reviewer’s criticism on the basis of the lack of need for expensive assays (compared to NLR) as a reason to reject our revised work.</p><p>We also believe that the value of this work should not be hindered by its ability to be readily implemented in the clinic by directly comparing it to clinical nomograms. While we appreciate the relevance and importance of generic clinical nomograms, they often lack the specific type of data required for discovery and development of next generation precision and personalized medicine, by identifying future targets for overcoming resistance, for instance.</p><p>Summing up, our work is the first of its kind where the derived deep profiling signature was cross validated in a separate independent cohort, and the drug induced changes in immune populations were assessed at the tumoral and systemic level furthering our understanding of immune cells interaction and trafficking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The validation set is very important to the conclusion that this assay has potential clinical use. I fully recognize that a validation set is hard to come by. But this is the &quot;acid test&quot; for such an assay. The validation data here is promising, and again, I understand how hard it is to gather such data, but it is not very convincing. Only 8 patients, with no PFS data (iRECIST is used, with a 50% objective response rate, which seems very high). To support the claim that such an assay has clinical value, a much broader set of validation data are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the small sample size criticism, our collaborator Prof. Ton Coolen is one of the few statistical physics/machine learning experts (https://www.ru.nl/en/people/coolen-a) who was invaluable in helping us to review a recent ML paper https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.80150, which would have been difficult to review without his specialist opinion. The following is his response to this specific Reviewer’s comment on our paper:</p><p>“Regarding the small number of patients in the validation cohort; there was an a priori chance that this cohort would not have demonstrated the correlation of the risk score with treatment response, and that more patients would have been required. However, the result we obtained with the present number of validation samples (Kandall tau = 0.725, with p-value 0.018) indicates that the number of validation samples suffices. The p-value, by definition, already takes into account the number of patients in a cohort — for smaller data sets it is easier to observe correlations as a result of fluke, and p-values are typically larger. Our present result states that the likelihood of achieving for the validation data presently used a correlation value of 0.725 or higher by chance, i.e. under the null hypothesis of statistical independence, is 0.018. This being below the standard confidence level of 0.05 for statistical significance, one must conclude with confidence that our validation data is correlated with the risk score, and hence no further patients are necessary to support this claim.”</p><p>Hence obtaining a significant correlation despite the small sample size in fact empowers our model.</p><p>The 50% objective response rate in this validation cohort is rather a reflection of improved response and efficacy of combining the anti-EGFR and anti-PDL1 in this setting. This is based on the preliminary finding of the trial which was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Congress in 2020 and published as an abstract (M. Forster, 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I raised the question earlier about the large number of patients excluded due to a lack of biospecimens and am concerned that this may limit the results, as this is akin to unequal censoring in a clinical trial. It would be important to compare the patients being studied and those not being studied. This was not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern with regards to a potential skewing of outcome data due to some patient exclusions. While we attempted to address this concern by showing no difference in PFS when comparing our study to the literature, we accept that this answer did not meet the reviewer’s expectations. Hence in this revised manuscript we have amended supplementary file 1 to compare the patient characteristics between the discovery sub-cohort assessed in this study with the original study cohort (Dillon, Grove et al., 2019). The table clearly shows that the clinical characteristics of the included sub-cohort were similar to those in the published full cohort. Hopefully this comparison will convince the reviewer that the data is robust and not skewed by patient subsampling due to availability of biological specimens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As with the other reviewers, the lack of OS data is a weakness here.
