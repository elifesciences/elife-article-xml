experience accelerates acquisition of novel, related information through processes like assimilation into mental schemas, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the roles that prior experience and hippocampal CA3 <italic>N</italic>-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity play in CA1 place cell sequence encoding and learning during novel spatial experiences. We found that specific representations of de novo experiences on linear environments were formed on a framework of pre configured network activity expressed in the preceding sleep and were rapidly, flexibly adjusted via NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience accelerated encoding of subsequent experiences on contiguous or isolated novel tracks, significantly decreasing their NMDAR-dependence. Similarly, de novo learning of an alternation task was facilitated by CA3 NMDARs; this experience accelerated subsequent learning of related tasks, independent of CA3 NMDARs, consistent with a schema-based learning. These results reveal the existence of distinct neuronal encoding schemes which could explain why hippocampal dysfunction results in anterograde amnesia while sparing recollection of old, schema-based memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01326.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01326.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01326.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Learning is an inherent feature of the living animals. During development and childhood we learn a large repertoire of items that we encounter for the first time in our life, such as the names of things and how to perform certain tasks. This de novo learning process takes a relatively long time and generally requires repeated exposures to the particular features of the external world that are being learned. Later in life, when we are exposed to novel but related features, we acquire this new information much faster. For instance, if a child learns to associate various odors with various locations around the home—such as associating the smell of bread with the kitchen and the smell air freshener with the bathroom—they will find it easier to make new odor-place associations outside the home, such as associating gasoline with gas stations.</p><p>It is thought that the de novo learning process is achieved when the newly acquired information is being consolidated and transferred into long-term memory storage within networks of neurons in the brain. The process of consolidation is believed to lead to the formation of mental schemas that can accelerate learning of novel but related information. Although the concepts of mental schema and related learning are widely used in psychology and education, their underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood.</p><p>The formation of new memories depends on a part of the brain called the hippocampus and involves changes in the strength of the connectivity between groups of neurons in a process called synaptic plasticity. In particular, the interaction between a chemical called glutamate, which is released by sender neurons, and proteins called NMDA receptors (which bind the glutamate molecules) on receiver neurons have a central role in synaptic plasticity. Recently, based on experiments with rodents, it has been proposed that the hippocampus is also crucial for the formation of the mental schemas that can accelerate the learning of new spatial association tasks, such as the odor-place associations described above.</p><p>Now, Dragoi and Tonegawa reveal that the NMDA receptor in a key subregion of the hippocampus is also involved in the de novo learning of spatial tasks. Using repeated exposures to novel spatial experiences and genetic techniques to block the NMDA receptors in this subregion in mice, Dragoi and Tonegawa discovered that de novo learning involves synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and, possibly, other regions of the brain. This de novo learning, in turn, enables subsequent spatial learning to be accelerated, even when the NMDA receptors are absent. These results reveal that de novo learning, and related learning processes such as accelerated learning, are underpinned by a number of different mechanisms in the brain, which could help explain why damage to the hippocampus prevents the formation of new memories while preserving other forms of memory and learning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01326.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01326.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>NMDA</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>cellular assemblies</kwd><kwd>schemas</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH078821, P50-MH58880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tonegawa</surname><given-names>Susumu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RIKEN BSI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tonegawa</surname><given-names>Susumu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel spatial representations by hippocampal cellular assemblies develop on the framework of preconfigured hippocampal networks whose homeostatic synaptic reorganization is accelerated by prior experience and CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An essential capacity of the brain is to form internal representations of the external world. Whereas representations of past experiences can be stored internally and be rapidly recalled from memory, neuronal representations of novel experiences develop from the interaction between specific external stimuli and the spontaneous internal neuronal dynamics during the novel experience. During the free exploration of spatial environments, individual hippocampal neurons fire at specific spatial locations of the animal and are activated sequentially along the trajectory of the animal (place cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>). Sequences of place cells with partially overlapping fields fire with compressed temporal delays that correspond to the Euclidian distance between the location of their place field peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). This phenomenon, known as sequence compression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>) is thought to be an animal model of the internal representation of an external space by the place cell assemblies in the CA1 area of the rodent hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dragoi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>).</p><p>The upstream auto-associative area, CA3, has been proposed to orchestrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsodyks, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>), together with entorhinal cortex and via synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dragoi et al., 2003</xref>), the functional organization of cellular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNaughton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>) in the downstream CA1 region, the source of the hippocampal output to the rest of the cortex.</p><p>According to a prevailing model, novel temporal and spatial place cell sequences emerge rapidly in the hippocampus upon exploration of a novel linear track predominantly or exclusively in response to the complex stimuli from the external environment and with minimal or no contribution from the internal neuronal dynamics around the time of the exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>).

We proposed that spontaneous neuronal activity preceding a novel spatial experience may prime and contribute to the formation of new spatial representations via a neuronal ensemble selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>). The dynamics of the interplay between the external stimuli available ‘online’ during the novel experience and the internal neuronal activity around the time of the experience along with the specific contribution they have to the emergence of a novel spatial representation remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the dynamics and contribution of this interplay by studying the development of novel spatial representations in naïve and experienced animals during spatial exploration and their relation to the internal neuronal dynamics preceding and following the new experience.</p><p>In order to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the development of new spatial representations in the CA1, we studied mice in which experience-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-associated activity and synaptic plasticity were genetically blocked specifically in the upstream auto-associative area CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>), the source of the main excitatory input and sharp-wave/ripple associated activity into CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsaki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashiba et al., 2009</xref>). These mutant mice had their CA3 NR1 subunit knocked-out using a Cre/loxP recombination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>) and are referred to as the CA3 NMDAR KO, or simply KO mice. Throughout this study, they were compared with their control littermates, the floxed NR1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>), here referred to as control mice (CT). Previous studies using these two groups of mice have shown that deletion of the NR1 subunit in the CA3 area abolished the NMDAR currents in the CA3 pyramidal cells, but not in the downstream CA1 and upstream dentate gyrus area neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>), which resulted in impaired memory acquisition of one-time experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>). The lack of post-synaptic NMDAR function has been shown to block the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>) and other brain areas, a mechanism proposed to underlie learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moser et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In order to explore the role of prior experience on the formation of novel spatial representations and spatial learning, we compared the single and ensemble place cell dynamics as well as the animals’ performance on a delayed alternation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainge et al., 2007</xref>) in naïve and experienced mice. We therefore investigated the temporal development of hippocampal place cell assemblies and the dynamics of behavioral performance in the CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>) and KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>) during de novo spatial exposure and the effect of this (prior) experience on cell assembly and learning dynamics during subsequent exposures to related novel space and behavioral tasks. De novo neuronal representations of spatial experiences were formed on the framework of the spontaneous network activity preceding the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>) and were subsequently modified and rapidly stabilized via CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity. This prior experience on novel linear tracks accelerated the encoding of subsequent experiences on additional, contiguous or isolated novel tracks and eliminated or significantly reduced their CA3 NMDAR dependence, respectively. We evaluated the behavioral relevance of these neuronal dynamics by comparing them with the performance of naïve and experienced CT and KO animals on a T-maze delayed alternation task. The presence of CA3 NMDARs facilitated the de novo learning of the alternation task; this prior experience accelerated subsequent learning of a related alternation task in a CA3 NMDAR-independent manner, consistent with principles of a schema-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannerman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKenzie et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, prior experience and CA3 NMDARs modulated the learning rate and the neuronal ensemble dynamics across experimental conditions in a correlated manner, suggesting that these neuronal dynamics, and in particular the expression of stable cell assemblies in CA1, might be part of the neural mechanisms of learning in naïve and experienced animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Ensemble neuronal recordings were performed from the CA1 area of the hippocampus in CT and CA3 NMDAR KO mice alternating between periods of sleep/rest in the sleep/rest box and periods of exploration of portions of walled linear and L-shaped tracks under three conditions of behavioral novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Under the de novo condition, naïve mice previously housed in small cages slept in the sleep/rest box (pre-DnRun1 sleep/rest), after which they were allowed to explore a linear track for the first time (i.e., novel track) for two run sessions (DnRun1 and DnRun2) separated by sleep/rest epochs in the sleep/rest box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). The sleep/rest session between DnRun1 and DnRun2 is referred to as post-DnRun1 when correlated with DnRun1 and pre-DnRun2 when correlated with DnRun2, while the one following DnRun2 is referred to as post-DnRun2. After the sessions under the de novo condition, the majority of mice were transferred to home cages for one night and returned to the sleep/rest box for the recording session of the next day. This session is referred to as pre-ContigRun session because it preceded a run session under the contiguous condition.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01326.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and place cell dynamics across experimental conditions and sessions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design displaying sleep/rest - run - sleep/rest sessions across de novo, contiguous, and disjunct experimental conditions.

repeatedly on the previous day. After recordings in the now familiar linear track (FamRun1 session), the wall at one end of the linear track, which had been blocking the access to a second novel linear track attached perpendicular to the first track, was removed. This manipulation allowed mice to run freely on the entire L-shaped track, composed of the new and familiar arms, which constituted the ContigRun session. At the end of this session, the mice were transferred back to the sleep/rest box for post-ContigRun sleep/rest session. A minority of mice went through minor variations of this general protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Two days later, under the disjunct condition, the mice were re-exposed to the now familiar L-shape track (FamRun2 session) after which they were given a session of sleep/rest in the sleep/rest box (pre-DisjRun1). They were then allowed to explore a novel linear track in isolation for two sessions (DisjRun1 and DisjRun2) separated by a sleep/rest session in the sleep/rest box (post-Disj1Run).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prior experience and CA3 NMDARs accelerate CA1 place cell tuning and neuronal ensemble temporal correlation in novel environments</title><p>For all experimental conditions we determined the across-sessions changes in spatial tuning and stability of individual CA1 place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cacucci et al., 2007</xref>) and in the lap-by-lap correlation (co-variation) of spiking activity of cell pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>) during exploration of novel environments. The changes in single cell activity allow the quantification of the temporal development of place fields over successive exploratory sessions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref> for individual cell examples for all three conditions), and the lap-by-lap correlation reflects the organization of neurons in coordinated cellular assemblies whose member pairs exhibit higher temporal correlation than pairs of independent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). The stability of place cell firing within the run session on novel tracks increased with experience in the de novo condition similarly in the CT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), appeared high from the beginning of the contiguous condition in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and appeared high from beginning in the CT mice and increased with repeated experience in KO mice in the disjunct condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Under the de novo condition, the spatial tuning of CA1 place cells was relatively poor in session 1 (DnRun1) in both CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cacucci et al., 2007</xref>) and KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>) by the measure of place field length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

An overnight holding in the home cage led to significantly increased spatial tuning in KO mice the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, DnRun1 compared to FamRun1, 29.6 ± 2.6 cm compared to 20.6 ± 2.0 cm, p&lt;0.01). The average number of place fields per place cell (&gt;1 Hz) was not different across genotypes and experimental sessions (CT vs KO: 1.52 vs 1.58 fields/place cell in DnRun1, p&gt;0.5, ranksum test; 1.50 vs 1.53 in DnRun2, p&gt;0.7). This result indicates that the experience- and genotype-dependent changes in place field size reported above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) result from the spatial tuning of initially large place fields rather than from the scattering of large place fields into multiple smaller ones. At the neuronal ensemble level, there was a significant increase in the lap-by-lap correlations with increased experience for both genotypes, although the increase occurred faster in CT compared to KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the CT, but not KO mice, the increase reached a plateau by the second exploratory session (DnRun2) under the de novo condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DnRun1 compared to DnRun2, 0.37 ± 0.007 compared to 0.48 ± 0.01, p&lt;10<sup>−13</sup>, ranksum test in CT mice; 0.38 ± 0.005 compared to 0.38 ± 0.004, p=0.38 in KO mice; CT vs KO in DnRun2, p&lt;10<sup>−9</sup>, ranksum test). Although the correlations eventually reached stable CT levels in KO mice, this did not occur until the next day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, DnRun1 compared to Fam, 0.37 ± 0.007 compared to 0.48 ± 0.01, p&lt;10<sup>−13</sup> in CT and 0.38 ± 0.005 compared to 0.48 ± 0.01 in KO, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>). These results suggest that the first-time spatial experience on a linear track leads to a gradual increase in spatial tuning and co-variation of ensembles of CA1 place cells encoding the novel experience, and that the temporal dynamics of these processes are facilitated by NMDAR-dependent activity in the auto-associative area CA3 of the hippocampus. The two run sessions of the de novo condition (over 1 hr altogether, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) may have provided enough time for the relatively slower non-NMDAR-dependent plasticity to occur and underlie the slower place cell dynamics. The results suggest that CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity and plasticity are specifically involved in the rapid within-session changes in single and ensemble place cell activity.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01326.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prior experience and CA3 NMDARs accelerate tuning and co-variation of place cells in novel environments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dynamics of place field length for CT (black color) and KO (red color) during de novo, contiguous, and disjunct conditions.

Surprisingly, for both genotypes, the new place fields were as spatially tuned during the first session (ContigRun) in the novel arm of the L-shaped track as in the contiguous familiar arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E</xref>) and as in the preceding FamRun1 session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). No additional spatial tuning could be detected within the ContigRun session within each group of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>; FamRun1 compared to ContigRun: 22.1 ± 1.7 cm compared to 23.9 ± 1.7 cm, p=0.46 in CT and 20.6 ± 2.0 cm compared to 21.9 ± 1.1 cm, p=0.34 in KO), across genotypes (CT compared to KO, p=0.6 in FamRun1, p=0.46 in ContigRun), and for both the familiar and the novel portions of the L-shaped track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, p&gt;0.05). The average number of place fields per place cell on the L-shaped track was similar across genotypes during ContigRun (CT vs KO, 1.90 vs 1.89, p&lt;0.98). Similarly, the increased lap-by-lap correlations observed in FamRun1 were preserved in the ContigRun session for both groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>; FamRun1 compared to ContigRun, 0.48 ± 0.01 compared to 0.47 ± 0.009, p=0.41 in CT and 0.48 ± 0.01 compared to 0.46 ± 0.01, p=0.2 in KO), and there were no significant differences in the correlations between genotypes (CT compared to KO, p=0.98 in FamRun1, p=0.42 in ContigRun), nor between the familiar and the novel portions of the L-shaped track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, p&gt;0.05). These results suggest that under the contiguous condition, independent of CA3 NMDARs, the spatial information regarding the previously unvisited novel portion of the L-shaped track was rapidly bound with the existing stable representation of the familiar track given the animals’ prior experience on the familiar track. These rapid dynamics on the novel arm during the Contig session are in contrast to the slow dynamics of place field tuning and co-variation during de novo exposure to a novel track (i.e., the DnRun1 session for CT and DnRun1–2 sessions for KO). This may reflect the prior recruitment at a subthreshold firing level of the new place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>) into stable, tuned cortico-hippocampal cellular assemblies during pre-exposures to the familiar track, which manifested as preplay of the novel arm during the preceding sleep or resting epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the contiguity between the novel and familiar arms was essential for the rapid spatial tuning and assembly organization and to further assess the effect of experience on novel spatial representations, experienced animals were exposed to an isolated novel linear track in the same general environment (disjunct condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this case, exploration of the novel track induced a significant, albeit transient, increase in the CA1 place field length in KO but not CT mice (FamRun2 vs DisjRun1: 23.9 ± 1.4 vs 23.9 ± 1.5 cm in CT, p=0.9; 22.6 ± 1.3 vs 28.9 ± 2 in KO, p&lt;0.01, ranksum test; between genotypes, CT vs KO in DisjRun1, p&lt;0.05; DisjRun1 vs DisjRun2 in KO, p&lt;0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; paired difference in place field length FamRun2–DisjRun1 CT vs KO, p&lt;0.027, ranksum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; within-session DisjRun1, CT vs KO, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>). The average number of place fields per place cell was slightly higher in CT compared to KO mice, but this relationship was not affected by the additional experience of animals on the novel track (CT vs KO: 1.76 vs 1.52 in DisjRun1 and 1.76 vs 1.47 in DisjRun2, p&lt;0.002). The increased lap-by-lap correlations recorded on the familiar track (FamRun2) decreased with novelty (DisjRun1) in KO but not in CT mice (FamRun2 vs DisjRun1: 0.49 ± 0.006 vs 0.51 ± 0.008, p&gt;0.05 in CT; 0.47 ± 0.005 vs 0.41 ± 0.004, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup> in KO; DisjRun1: CT vs KO, p&lt;10<sup>−30</sup>; DisjRun1 vs DisjRun2 in KO, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The correlations returned to ‘familiar levels’ by the next session (DisjRun2) in the KO mice more rapidly compared to the de novo condition (compare DisjRun2 to DnRun2 in KO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Overall, these dynamics were not due to differences in the velocity of animal movement across sessions or genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), as place field size and lap-by-lap correlations were not significantly correlated with the animal velocity (p&gt;0.11 and p&gt;0.12, respectively). Moreover, the changes in place field tuning occurring within experimental sessions (i.e., DnRun1, DisjRun1, first vs last four laps) were not simply due to a change in the behavior of the mice during the corresponding sessions since their velocity and total distance travelled (path stereotypy) were similar in the first four laps compared with the last four laps of the sessions for both genotypes (first vs last four laps, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test; velocity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, total distance travelled, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The changes in lap-by-lap correlations across experimental sessions were not simply a result of changes in animal behavior during the 3s-bin epochs since the distances travelled by the mice on the tracks during the 3s-bins were not correlated with the values of the lap-by-lap correlations calculated over the same timescale (p&gt;0.2). The overall changes in the spatial information of place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>) between novel and familiar run sessions for individual CA1 place cells across genotypes and conditions were consistent with the changes in place field size and in lap-by-lap correlations of pairs of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the structure of correlations during DisjRun1 exploration, we grouped pairs of place cells active on both FamRun2 and DisjRun1 sessions based on the change in the relative distance between their place field peaks across the two tracks into those with changes within 5 cm (stable assemblies, 8% CT, 10% KO pairs), those with changes between 6 cm to 20 cm (27% CT, 37% KO), and those with changes between 21 cm to 35 cm (32% CT, 26% KO). The remaining pairs, with changes larger than 35 cm were excluded from this analysis. In the CT mice, cells from all three groups displayed relatively high lap-by-lap co-variation during DisjRun1 exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, in KO mice, only cells of the stable assemblies (within 5 cm change) maintained a high lap-by-lap co-variation during DisjRun1, while groups of pairs with changes larger than 5 cm exhibited significantly poorer co-variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, p&lt;0.05, ranksum test). These results suggest a modular, higher order organization of cellular assemblies, in which a certain group of cell pairs (stable assemblies) counters a complete NMDAR-dependent reorganization of the entire neuronal population in response to novel stimuli by maintaining their co-variation independent of CA3 NMDARs. This modular organization of cell assemblies was not simply based on the spatial proximity between place fields on the novel track as co-variations in the KO mice were significantly poorer than in CT mice for all three regimes of changes in place field distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, p&lt;0.05). A similar grouping of the cell pairs active in the contiguous condition during FamRun1 and ContigRun revealed that the changes in cellular ensemble organization upon exploration of the contiguous novel arm are CA3 NMDARs-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The large proportion of cell pairs showing &gt;20 cm changes in their spatial relationship from familiar to novel tracks (&gt;65% in CT, &gt;53% in KO mice) indicates that the ensemble of place cells formed distinct representations across the two environments, a process called remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muller and Kubie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dragoi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>). Consistent with the remapping, the order in which the place cells fired in the familiar track (place cell sequences) was not correlated with their order of firing in the novel arm (contiguous condition, mean R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.03, mean R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.12, p&gt;0.05, both genotypes) or novel track (disjunct condition, mean R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.11, mean R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.12, p&gt;0.05, both genotypes), whereas it was similar to the order in which they later fired in the familiar arm of the L-shape track (contiguous condition, R<sub>CT</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.6, R<sub>KO</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.5, p&lt;0.05, both genotypes).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Prior experience- and CA3 NMDAR-dependent changes in spatial-temporal neuronal sequence correlations</title><p>For each run session and for each direction of movement, place cells were ordered according to the location of their peak firing (&gt;1 Hz) on the corresponding track/arm, resulting in two place cell sequence templates for each condition and session, one for each direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>).

In order to address this question, we constructed spatial templates from the activity of place cells in the first four laps of run (early templates) and the last four laps (late templates) and correlated them with the temporal sequences recorded during the previous sleep (i.e., early and late preplay). We found that the population of early template correlations was not different from the population of late ones in both CT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, both early and late spatial-temporal correlations were higher in the KO mice compared with the CT ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that the relative instability of the place fields during DnRun1 session is associated with a process of relatively mild ‘editing’ of the early template, rather than with a process of dramatic ‘remapping’ into a new chart. The relatively high correlation between early and late place fields in the de novo condition (0.4–0.5) is consistent with this scenario.</p><p>Following a second exposure to the novel track, with the exception of one CT mouse (CT2, preplay&lt;replay, p&lt;0.006), the significant correlations of spiking events with the DnRun2 templates were similar during post-DnRun2 sleep/rest compared to the pre-DnRun2 sleep/rest in CT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ab</xref>, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test). Moreover, the proportions of significant events were also similar before and after the DnRun2 run experience in all mice (p&gt;0.05, Z-test for two proportions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bb</xref>; proportions preplay vs replay: 15/164 vs 5/69 in CT1, 465/4567 vs 196/1753 in CT2, 21/160 vs 196/1753 in CT3, 3/70 vs 8/131 in CT4, 3/74 vs 8/66 in KO1, 186/1942 vs 261/2578 in KO2, and 223/2504 vs 158/1807 in KO3). When absolute correlation values were pulled together across animals, the pre-Run vs post-Run play relationship reversed in the CT but not in the KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, right panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cb</xref>, empty bars). The significant correlations of spiking events with the DnRun2 templates were stronger during post-DnRun2 sleep/rest compared to the pre-DnRun2 sleep/rest in CT animals (pre-DnRun2 compared to post-DnRun2, 0.77 ± 0.006 (std. 0.13) compared to 0.83 ± 0.008 (std. 0.13), p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, ranksum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cb</xref>, empty bars, left); however, they were similar in the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cb</xref>, empty bars, right; pre-DnRun2 compared to post-DnRun2, 0.85 ± 0.006 (std. 0.11) compared to 0.85 ± 0.006 (std. 0.12), p&gt;0.35).</p><p>In the contiguous condition, both at the individual animal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ac</xref>) and at the group level the correlations with the ContigRun templates in the post-ContigRun (i.e., replay) were similar to the ones in the pre-ContigRun sleep/rest (i.e., preplay) for both genotypes (group level; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cc</xref>, empty bars, left, pre-ContigRun compared to post-ContigRun, 0.90 ± 0.01 (std. 0.1) compared to 0.87 ± 0.009 (std. 0.09), p&gt;0.55 in CT mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cc</xref>, empty bars, right, pre-ContigRun compared to post-ContigRun, 0.89 ± 0.01 (std. 0.1) vs 0.86 ± 0.007 (std. 0.09), p&gt;0.21 in KO mice, ranksum test).

At the genotype group level, the novel experience (DisjRun1) resulted in slightly increased correlations in the post-DisjRun1 vs pre-DisjRun1 sleep/rest in CT (0.80 ± 0.006 (std. 0.14) vs 0.77 ± 0.005 (std. 0.14), p&lt;0.05, ranksum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cd</xref>, empty bars, left), but not KO animals (0.86 ± 0.01 (std. 0.12) vs 0.85 ± 0.009 (std. 0.11), p&gt;0.17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cd</xref>, empty bars, right).</p><p>Across all experimental conditions and sessions and for both genotypes there were no overall changes in the number of cells active per significant event (preplay vs replay, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test), in the duration of significant events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test), and in the extent of the linear track being represented during the significant events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>, p&gt;0.05, ranksum test). For both genotypes and in all pre- and post-run sleep/rest sessions, the time of occurrence of significant preplay and replay events correlated with the time of occurrence of high-frequency oscillation ripples in the CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the experience- and CA3 NMDAR-dependent changes in replay over preplay described at the animal group level across sessions in the de novo condition was also found when the correlation values between place field templates and <italic>all</italic> spiking events (i.e., not only the significant ones) were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ca,b</xref>, solid bars). The correlation values of all spiking events during pre-DnRun1 sleep/rest exceeded the correlation values of all spiking events recorded during post-DnRun1 sleep/rest in CT but not KO mice (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup> in CT, p&gt;0.5 in KO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ca</xref>, solid bars). Preplay correlations were not different across genotypes (p&gt;0.9, ranksum test), but replay correlations were higher in the KO than CT mice (p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>, ranksum test). Moreover, after a second experience on the novel track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cb</xref>, solid bars), the correlation values of all post-Run (i.e., replay) events became higher than the corresponding values of all pre-Run events in CT (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) but not KO animals (p&gt;0.5). Despite the changes in correlation values from preplay to replay in CT mice, the proportions of significant events out of all of the detected events in all animals were similar in the pre-Run and post-Run sessions under all experimental conditions for both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, p&gt;0.05, Z-test for two proportions). The incidences of spiking events were similar in the sleep/rest sessions preceding and following the novel run experiences across conditions in both CT (p&gt;0.08, paired <italic>t</italic> test) and KO mice (p&gt;0.9).</p><p>More importantly, comparison of averages of absolute preplay and replay correlations over all experimental conditions and sessions performed altogether between the two genotypes (eight sessions/genotype, paired by session type between genotypes) revealed that correlation values were significantly higher (p&lt;0.006 for the significant correlations; p&lt;0.009 for all the correlations; paired <italic>t</italic> test) and their variance was significantly lower (p&lt;0.007, paired <italic>t</italic> test) in KO vs CT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). This finding is consistent with the overall reduced experience-dependent changes in the correlation values in KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B,D,F,H and 5C</xref>) and indicates a reduced flexibility (increased rigidity) of the hippocampal network in the absence of NMDAR-dependent activity in the CA3 region. Moreover, the overall spatial extent (i.e., proportion) of the linear track represented by the significant spiking events during sleep/rest was higher in the CT vs KO mice (0.94 ± 0.01 compared to 0.89 ± 0.01 of the track length, p&lt;0.027, paired <italic>t</italic> test), indicating a role for the NMDAR-dependent activity in the CA3 area in temporally linking together chunks of spatial sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). These differences in correlations between genotypes were not due to overall differences in the duration of the significant spiking events (KO compared to CT across sessions, 0.33 ± 0.02 s compared to 0.33 ± 0.02 s, p=0.82, paired <italic>t</italic> test), or in the number of cells participating in these events (KO compared to CT, 6.1 ± 0.2 compared to 6.5 ± 0.2, p=0.65, paired <italic>t</italic> test) across genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Behavioral performance on T-maze delayed alternation tasks</title><p>We tested the behavioral relevance of the observed differences in neuronal dynamics by measuring the animal performance on a hippocampal-dependent learning task, the delayed T-maze alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainge et al., 2007</xref>). In this task, the animals had to retrieve food rewards placed at the end of left vs right arms of the T-maze in alternate trials. The animals self-initiated the trials, moved toward the reward site and returned on the same path to re-initiate the next trial. Delays between trials were counted as the time between returning from the end of the left/right arms and self-initiation of the next trial (&gt;10 s). Both groups of animals reached the criterion level of performance of 70% correct choices during the 10-day training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Analysis of the data from both genotypes during the 10-day training using a balanced two-way ANOVA test (five blocks of 2 consecutive days) revealed a significant effect of the training day (F = 11.83, p=0.006) and genotype (F = 10.5, p=0.001) and a marginal duration (day) × genotype interaction (F = 3.24, p=0.057). Consistent with the difference in the neuronal dynamics across genotypes during the de novo condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, left), the KO subjects required additional sessions to reach the 70% criterion for learning to alternate (9 vs 7 days, KO vs CT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; days 7–8 block, CT vs KO, 78.1% vs 53.7% correct, p=0.006, ranksum test) indicating the involvement of the intrinsic hippocampal circuitry in the acquisition of this task. Moreover, consistent with the facilitation of neuronal dynamics on the novel arm by prior experience on the familiar track during the contiguous condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, middle), this learning experience greatly accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tse et al., 2007</xref>) the acquisition of a similar alternation task in a second, novel T-maze configuration, when both groups of animals performed above threshold by the second day of re-training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, day 10 vs 12, 78.2% vs 77.6% correct, p=0.9 for CT, and 72.2% vs 75.7% correct, p=0.6 for KO, ranksum test). Together, these results establish a correlation between the neuronal activity and the behavioral performances across genotypes and experimental conditions and suggest that the dynamics of cell assembly organization are part of the underlying mechanisms of spatial learning.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01326.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Behavioral performance of CT and KO mice in a T-maze alternation task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Performance in the alternation task over the 10 days of training on the first T-maze configuration (T-maze 1; 70% is the performance criterion for learning).

Overall, the expression of spatially tuned novel place fields in experienced animals as reported in some of the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>) is consistent with our findings in experienced CT mice (contiguous and disjunct conditions), though a faster timescale analysis might reveal additional dynamics in spatial tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our approach is to study the process of internal development of novel spatial representations as a dynamic whole by comparing and correlating the activity of ensembles of neurons during the sleep/rest period prior to first time exploration of a linear track with the one during the exploration, and both of these activities with the one during the post-Run sleep/rest session, in naïve and experienced animals, in the presence and absence of CA3 NMDARs.</p><p>This approach allowed us to identify and compare three distinct forms of novelty encoding as revealed by prior experience and CA3 NMDAR KO. In the contiguous and disjunct condition paradigms, although the spatial location and orientation of the novel linear track are as new to the animals as in the de novo condition paradigm, both the geometry (i.e., linear tracks) and the behavioral experience (i.e., repetitive runs for food rewards) are common. These parameters may have already been internalized prior to the novel run session, which may have diminished the dynamic interplay between the internal and external drives and facilitated the formation of more stable spatial representations on the novel arm/track. More importantly, the repeated access to the familiar arm in conjunction with the exploration of the novel arm in the contiguous condition accelerated the recruitment and stabilization of neuronal firing sequences independent of CA3 NMDARs; this likely happened through complementary, non-CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity or through NMDAR-dependent activity in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kentros et al., 1998</xref>). The CA3 NMDAR independence in the contiguous condition did not solely result from increased experience with linear tracks, as exploration of isolated novel tracks by the even more experienced animals during the disjunct condition did require, transiently, these receptors for the rapid formation of stable, tuned place cell sequences. In the disjunct condition, since exposure to the novel track occurred in the same general spatial environment, modules of place cells that remapped together, possibly controlled by common external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), were regrouped in a CA3 NMDAR-dependent manner to rapidly form the new representation. We hypothesize that this regrouping process observed in the disjunct condition makes the need for CA3 NMDARs only transient and thereby facilitates the formation of a new spatial representation based on the prior experience. A more drastic change in the external stimuli in the absence of prior animal training (like in the de novo condition where animals were shifted for the first time from the sleep/rest box to the linear maze) may lead to a more complete CA3 NMDAR-dependent recruitment and stabilization of neuronal ensemble activity, a slower formation of new spatial representations, and a slower learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rapid dynamics of cell assembly organization in the CA1 during exposure to novel environments and the role of CA3 NMDARs</title><p>Our data have shown that a novel representation of a first-time experience on linear tracks (DnRun1) is formed in the CA1 area primarily on the framework of the preconfigured hippocampal network (preplay), which is modified, in part, during the experience and is rapidly stabilized primarily via CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The changes in place cell activity occur without affecting the general stability of the hippocampal network, which indicates a homeostatic regulation of its temporal sequence activity in response to novelty: ∼10% of the temporal sequences reflect the novel experience during the subsequent sleep/rest period, a proportion that is not different from the proportion of corresponding preplay events. Subsequent exposures to the same track (DnRun2) and additional contiguous (ContigRun) or isolated novel tracks (DisjRun1) resulted in the expression of similar proportions of correlated temporal sequences before and after the corresponding novel spatial experiences, both in control and CA3 NMDAR KO mice.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01326.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cartoon model of the internal representation of novel experiences based on the organization of neurons in cellular assemblies.</title><p><bold>‘</bold>Hexagonal’ panels (panels 1, 4, 6, 8), network of sequentially activated neurons (cell assemblies) during sleep/rest under different experimental conditions: pre-DnRun1 sleep/rest (panel 1), post-DnRun1 sleep/rest (panel 4), pre-ContigRun sleep/rest (panel 6), and post-ContigRun sleep/rest (panel 8).

Our proposal is consistent with previous studies reporting that temporal sequences emitted during onsite resting periods do not specifically reflect the recent spatial experience of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</xref>), but rather reflect multiple related spatial experiences the animal had experienced or will experience in the near future in that particular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>).</p><p>The overall stability of the hippocampal network during sleep/rest epochs on both sides of the novel spatial experiences does not mean that the novel experiences did not induce more discrete plastic changes which are apparent at the individual cell level in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dragoi et al., 2003</xref>). More importantly, in the absence of CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity, the CA1 temporal firing sequences appear more rigid and their correlations with the place cell sequences are less modulated by the recent experiences compared to control animals. Overall, in the absence of CA3 NMDARs, the event correlations with future place cell sequences exhibit lower variance and higher values than in the presence of CA3 NMDARs. These results indicate that the organization of cellular assemblies in the CA1 area is influenced by the NMDAR-dependent activity in the upstream CA3 area. In the absence of this type of activity/plasticity, the CA1 cellular assemblies are less affected by the animals’ novel spatial experiences and maintain an increased correlation across different brain states (i.e., across sharp-wave/ripples during sleep and theta during run), behaviors, and experiences. This could explain why the mutant animals exhibit deficits in one trial learning which involves rapid plastic changes in hippocampal cellular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of neurons’ organization in cellular assemblies is their onsite coordinated activation across similar animal behaviors such as running laps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wills et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). Here we show that upon familiarization with a novel linear track, the lap-by-lap correlations between place cell pairs increase rapidly during the exploratory session in control animals but remain low for several exploratory sessions in the absence of CA3 NMDARs. These results suggest that NMDAR-dependent activity within the CA3 area of the hippocampus is involved in the rapid organization and linking of CA1 place cells in cellular assemblies during the encoding of a first-time and of subsequent isolated novel experiences on linear tracks, but is not necessary for the general expression of temporal sequences of place cells in the CA1 in the form of preplay and replay.</p><p>Our results have relevance for theories of learning and memory consolidation. Quite often, a single exposure to absolutely novel experiences does not lead to a lasting memory of the experience, whereas repeated exposures to the same experience or prior knowledge with similar kind of experiences result in more rapid learning and memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tse et al., 2007</xref>). We propose that the increased map stability, tuning, and cell assembly co-variation we find in repeatedly exposed and in experienced, but not in naïve animals underlie the rapid consolidation of episodic memories of repeated or related new experiences, but not of entirely novel ones. The latter may instead require repeated exposure to engage hippocampal replay-dependent mechanisms for memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Prior knowledge and schema-based learning</title><p>The intact hippocampus is essential for encoding and rapid consolidation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Squire, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichenbaum et al., 1999</xref>) and for associative-novelty detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumaran and Maguire, 2007</xref>).

Familiarization with the spatial environment and the behavioral task are associated with the formation of cortical mental schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKenzie et al., 2013</xref>) that rely on the stability of neocortical-hippocampal cellular assemblies.

The group of CA1 place cell pairs that maintained high levels of lap-by-lap co-variation and preserved the relative distance between their place fields across different environments independent of CA3 NMDARs (stable assemblies, disjunct condition; contiguous condition) may represent one neuronal mechanism underlying schema-based accelerated learning.</p><p>Previously, lesion experiments have argued for a transient, but necessary role of the intact hippocampus in the assimilation and consolidation of new information into schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tse et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas not speaking for the whole hippocampus, our data indicate that CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity and synaptic plasticity are not necessary for either the rapid assimilation of new contiguous locations into a previously established spatial representation or for learning of a related alternation task. Instead, this type of plasticity is necessary for the rapid formation of new CA1 cell assemblies in the hippocampus of experimentally naïve animals and the development of a new schema associated with the first-time learning of a hippocampal-dependent alternation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The existence of a mechanistic dichotomy between these different forms of learning may help explain why hippocampal dysfunction results in anterograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>) while recollection of old, schema-based memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winocur et al., 2005</xref>) is preserved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A total of 20 adult male mice with ages between 18–22 weeks were employed in this study.

During the following week of recovery, the electrodes were advanced daily while animals rested in a small sleep/resting box (12 × 20 × 35 [hr] cm) having opaque walls. The animal position was monitored via two infrared diodes attached to the headstage.</p><p>The experimental apparatus consisted of a 90 × 65 cm rectangular, walled linear track maze. All tracks were 4 cm wide at the bottom and 8–9 cm at the top; all linear track walls were translucent, 10 cm high, with opaque, uniform color barriers. Recording sessions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were conducted while the animals explored for chocolate sprinkle rewards placed always at the ends of the corresponding linear tracks (one sprinkle at each end of the track on each lap).</p><p>Under the de novo condition, the neuronal activity was recorded in naïve animals (four CT mice, CT1–4, and four KO mice, mice KO1–4) during the sleep/rest session in the sleep/rest box (pre-DnRun1) immediately preceding the first experience on the linear track and the recordings continued during the first run session on a novel track (DnRun1). Following their first run experience on the linear track, the animals were placed back in the sleep/rest box and allowed to sleep/rest (post-DnRun1 or pre-DnRun2), after which they were exposed for a second session of run on the same linear track (DnRun2). This run was followed by another session in the sleep/rest box (post-DnRun2). The first two (KO1 and KO2) out of the eight recorded mice were exposed for the third time to the linear track, followed by an additional session in the sleep/rest box. The remaining six mice went through, under the de novo condition, two run sessions (DnRun1 and DnRun2) each preceded and followed by a sleep/rest session. In the two KO mice that were exposed for a third session on the first novel track, the fields were not significantly more tuned and the lap-by-lap correlations were not as high in this session compared with their next day FamRun1 session or with the DnRun2 session in controls. There was no improved spatial tuning during the additional run session in the first two KO mice. In one KO animal (mouse KO4), no spiking events could be detected during de novo sleep/rest sessions due to the below threshold number of synchronously active cells.</p><p>In the contiguous condition, following a recording session on the now familiar linear track (FamRun1), a barrier that was blocking access to a contiguous novel linear track was lifted and the animals explored the L-shaped linear track for the first time (ContigRun). The orientation of the L-shaped track in the room and the room landmarks were kept constant throughout the experiment. Sessions in the sleep/rest box preceded (pre-ContigRun; before the barrier was lifted) and followed ContigRun (post-ContigRun; after the barrier was lifted). In one CT animal (mouse CT1), no spiking events were detected during pre-ContigRun due to the below threshold number of synchronously active cells. In three KO (mice KO1, KO2, and KO4) and two CT animals (mice CT1 and CT4), FamRun1 was recorded after an overnight sleep, whereas FamRun1 was recorded several hours after the de novo exposure to the novel track in the remaining animals.

For all conditions, the spikes from all the place cells active during run that were emitted during the preceding and following sleep/rest were sorted by time and further used for the detection of the spiking events.

The remaining animals had a below threshold number of simultaneously active CA1 place cells. The place cell sequences (templates) were calculated for each direction of the animal’s movement and for each run session in all experimental conditions by ordering the spatial location of the place field peaks that were above 1 Hz. For place cells with multiple place fields above 1 Hz on a particular arm or track in the contiguous condition, only the place field corresponding to the peak firing rate of the place cell on that arm or track was considered for the construction of the template of that particular arm or track.

For each genotype, the data were calculated for each sleep/rest session for each individual mouse as well as by averaging the specific parameters collected from all of the corresponding mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>T-maze alternation behavior</title><p>The behavioral data were collected from a total of 12 mice performing a delayed alternation task in two configurations of a T-maze. The size of the T-maze apparatus was 90 × 90 cm and the 3-D dimensions of the linear tracks were configured as in the neurophysiology part of the experiment. The mice were food deprived over 1 week to 85% of their body weight and were further trained from naïve state for ten days to alternate between the two arms of T-maze 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> inset, vertical arms) for food rewards placed at each arm end. No barriers were ever used in the choice phase throughout training. On the return from the end of the choice arm to the start point located at the free end of the stem arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> inset, horizontal arm), a temporary barrier blocked animal access to the other choice arm. The criterion for learning was set at 70% correct choices per session for 2 consecutive days for each group of mice (i.e., KO and CT). Each mouse was trained for one session of ∼20 trials each day. At the end of the 10 days over which both groups reached the criterion, all mice were exposed to a second configuration of the T-maze (T-maze 2) for 2 additional days. From the beginning to the end of each trial over the 12 days, mice behave freely in T-mazes: they self-initiated their first trial, made a choice of an arm, returned to the start point, and self-initiated the next trial, for ∼20 trials/session/day. For each day of the experiment and for each genotype, the performance of all animals was averaged and entered as a data point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For the first 10 days of the experiment, data were grouped in five blocks of two consecutive days and analyzed using a balanced two-way ANOVA test followed by the ranksum test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank MA Wilson for assistance with data acquisition and comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>GD, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>ST, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. You will find below a large number of comments/critiques that are provided because the reviewers felt that aspects of the work were incompletely described or difficult to understand. We hope that these comments can help you improve the clarity, utility, and the logic of the final manuscript.</p><p>1) What is the relationship between place field instability and preplay? Lack of evidence for preplay could occur for two reasons, either: offline sequences of the target spatial representation were not generated, or the template shifted during learning (e.g., remapping) so that attempts to identify sequence matches are frustrated by changes in the template with experience. We know that in control mice, spatial firing changes more during a first experience than in KOs, therefore, it may be important to construct multiple templates for the first session, one early and one late, with the assumption that preplay would be equivalent in controls and KOs when the early template is used though preplay would be diminished in the late template due to CA3 NMDAR dependent plasticity that altered the order of place fields, as suggested in the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>2) The authors assert that their “data have shown that a novel representation of a first-time experience on linear tracks (DnRun1) is formed in the CA1 area primarily on the framework of the preconfigured hippocampal network”. As argued, if place fields were unimodal, then indeed a great deal of the structures of the spatial representation would be predetermined; however, based on the examples provided, there seems to be a great deal of firing that is out of order, so-to-speak. According to the model set forth by the authors, this out-of-order firing ought to depend upon plasticity incurred during experience, and therefore may be less stable in control mice as compared to CA3 KOs.</p><p>3) It is not clear what is meant by homeostasis with regard to preplay, replay, and learning. Either the authors should provide a more clear and concrete definition of this new use of the preplay, or leave it out altogether and fully embrace a variant of the authors' hypothesis that “temporal sequences emitted during onsite resting periods do not specifically reflect the recent spatial experience of the animal, but rather reflect a uniform distribution of multiple spatial experiences the animal had”. Why must the structure be dictated by a uniform generic distribution rather than reflecting recall of specific, related experiences (see McKenzie and Eichenbaum, Neuron 2011 and other recent commentaries on memory updating, e.g., Dudai)? Along the same line, the authors also argue that the rapid tuning of firing fields in control mice is evidence of schema modification. The authors should also consider a highly relevant experimental report (McKenzie et al., J Neurosci 2013) that specifically addressed how a neural correlate of memory changes with new related learning and the experimental conditions necessary for addressing the neural basis of schema modification.</p><p>4) Unlike the rest of the manuscript, one of the reviewers found the Abstract to be imprecisely written and difficult to understand, so much so that he/she was inspired to edit it as follows:</p><p>“Novel hippocampal spatial representations were thought to form during novel experiences and be specifically replayed the following sleep/rest enabling memory consolidation. We found that in naïve and experienced mice, novel CA1 place cell sequences exhibit similar correlations with their firing sequences during sleep/rests following and preceding the run, indicating network stability homeostasis. The tuning and spatial reliability coordination of place cell ensembles on novel tracks were reduced in naïve animals and showed accelerated increases in compared to experienced mice ones. Genetic blockade of CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity resulted in more rigid temporal-spatial sequences between sleep and exploratory behaviors and delayed tuning and coordination of place cell ensembles. These results indicate that novel spatial representations develop on the framework of preconfigured hippocampal networks whose homeostatic adjustment reorganization is accelerated by prior experience and CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity plasticity. The increased place map stability, tuning, and cell-assembly expression coordination may underlie rapid memory consolidation of repeated/related new experiences, but not of entirely novel ones.”</p><p>The use of several terms in the Abstract and in the main text seems imprecise, inappropriate or requires better explanation. Specifically, what is meant by homeostasis? Why is this not merely stability or inertia? What evidence is there that homeostasis is occurring? Do the authors argue that the mutants show greater homeostasis? The phrase “homeostatic reorganization” seems to be an oxymoron and no evidence of reorganization is presented; instead plenty evidence of mild adjustment and modifications of the firing sequences are demonstrated. The authors demonstrate the dependence of the temporal sequence and place cell tuning changes on CA3 NMDARs and presumably their activity but not synaptic plasticity itself as stated in the Abstract and in the manuscript.</p><p>What is meant by ensemble “coordination” and how did the authors measure it?</p><p>5) One of the reviewers found the first part of the Results (“Prior experience- and CA3 NMDAR-dependent homeostatic changes in sequence correlations”) difficult to read and follow. This is because the logic of the different experiments and comparisons is not explained, and so the reader has to figure it out. In fact, this logic is revealed in the second part of the Results (“Prior experience and CA3 NMDARs accelerate CA1 place cell tuning and coordination in novel environments”). It is almost as if the first part was written after the second part and then moved to the start of the Results. This needs to be rewritten. The authors might even consider switching the order of the two Results sections, which may be more appropriate anyway.</p><p>6) Why were paired t tests used to compare the KO and CT data? How is this possible?</p><p>7) How many laps did the mice run and how long did it take them to complete a trial? It appears to have been completed in &lt; 5 minutes.

Lack of evidence for preplay could occur for two reasons, either: offline sequences of the target spatial representation were not generated, or the template shifted during learning (e.g., remapping) so that attempts to identify sequence matches are frustrated by changes in the template with experience. We know that in control mice, spatial firing changes more during a first experience than in KOs, therefore, it may be important to construct multiple templates for the first session, one early and one late, with the assumption that preplay would be equivalent in controls and KOs when the early template is used though preplay would be diminished in the late template due to CA3 NMDAR dependent plasticity that altered the order of place fields, as suggested in the cartoon in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>.</p><p>The place fields expressed during the early laps and late laps of runs on familiar tracks are correlated to a 0.6-0.7 value (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The place fields expressed during de novo runs are more dynamic, and show a correlation of 0.4-0.5 (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); this correlation is lower than on familiar tracks, yet significantly higher than chance level correlation, which is around 0.2 (cell identity shuffles; Dragoi and Tonegawa, Nature 2011; Materials and methods). The reviewers are asking how this relative instability of place fields (i.e., correlations of 0.4-0.5) in the very first run session of naïve animals affects the correlation between the spatial and temporal sequences of place cells (i.e., preplay and replay), here referred to as “spatial-temporal correlations”. Moreover, inspired by our cartoon model of temporal-spatial sequences (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), they are asking whether the early and late spatial templates display different spatial-temporal correlation values with the temporal sequences during the preceding sleep.</p><p>In order to answer the latter question, we constructed spatial templates from the activity of place cells in the first four laps of run (early templates) and the last four laps (late templates), and correlated them with the temporal sequences recorded during the previous sleep (early and late preplay). We found that the population of early template spatial-temporal correlations was not different from the population of late template ones in both control and mutant mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, both early and late spatial-temporal correlations were higher in the KO mice compared with the control ones (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with our results in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. These results indicate that the relative instability of the place fields during the first run is associated with a process of mild “editing” of the early template as illustrated in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, rather than with a process of dramatic “remapping” into a new chart as hypothesized by the reviewers. The relatively high correlation between early and late place fields in the de novo condition (0.4–0.5) is consistent with this scenario. Please also note the majority of significant correlations (preplay and replay) do not reach an absolute value of 1; this means, for example, that an early template and an edited late template could both have significant spatial-temporal correlations of 0.7 value with the same spiking event from the preceding sleep. A remapped late template would have spatial-temporal correlations values comparable with the shuffled ones, ∼0.2. Finally, we have explained in more detail in a previous publication (Dragoi and Tonegawa, Nature 2011) that an insufficient density of place cells per unit of linear track along with an insufficient sampling of spiking events in the pre-run sleep session will prevent the detection of preplay events.</p><p>In conclusion, the relative instability of place fields in the de novo condition does not prevent the detection of preplay; moreover, this instability would equally affect the detection of preplay and replay (if analyses of preplay would be frustrated by place field instabilities, the same would be true for replay).</p><p><italic>2) The authors assert that their “data have shown that a novel representation of a first-time experience on linear tracks (DnRun1) is formed in the CA1 area primarily on the framework of the preconfigured hippocampal network”. As argued, if place fields were unimodal, then indeed a great deal of the structures of the spatial representation would be predetermined; however, based on the examples provided, there seems to be a great deal of firing that is out of order, so-to-speak. According to the model set forth by the authors, this out-of-order firing ought to depend upon plasticity incurred during experience, and therefore may be less stable in control mice as compared to CA3 KOs</italic>.</p><p>A number of place cells have more than one place field per linear track (please note that not every local maxima in the spatial tuning curve is a significant peak). We calculated the proportion of cells with more than one place field per track to be about 12% on the novel arm in the contiguous condition in control mice (Dragoi and Tonegawa, Nature 2011). The presence of an additional field is a well-known feature of place cells and all previous studies on replay using template matching or cell-pair analysis dealt with it by choosing the peak or the centroid of the main place field. We believe in our data (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) the place cell sequences on the novel tracks are quite well structured and easy to be visualized by general journal readers. The stability of the “out of order” firing is captured in part by the correlations between place cell activity in the early and late laps (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and is similar across genotypes in the de novo condition. In the first paragraph of the second section of the Discussion we indeed stated that novel representations are formed on the framework of the preconfigured network, but we also added that they are “modified in part during the experience”, as also suggested in our response to the first comment, above.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear what is meant by homeostasis with regard to preplay, replay, and learning. Either the authors should provide a more clear and concrete definition of this new use of the preplay, or leave it out all together and fully embrace a variant of the authors' hypothesis that “temporal sequences emitted during onsite resting periods do not specifically reflect the recent spatial experience of the animal, but rather reflect a uniform distribution of multiple spatial experiences the animal had”. Why must the structure be dictated by a uniform generic distribution rather than reflecting recall of specific, related experiences (see McKenzie and Eichenbaum, Neuron 2011 and other recent commentaries on memory updating, e.g., Dudai)? Along the same line, the authors also argue that the rapid tuning of firing fields in control mice is evidence of schema modification. The authors should also consider a highly relevant experimental report (McKenzie et al., J Neurosci 2013) that specifically addressed how a neural correlate of memory changes with new related learning and the experimental conditions necessary for addressing the neural basis of schema modification</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct, preplay may not reflect a uniform distribution of the multiple experiences the animal had, but rather a more specific distribution of related ones. In fact, we used the argument of schema-based representations to explain the preplay activity seen in the contiguous and disjunct conditions because of animals’ recent similar experiences in the de novo condition. However, given that experimentally naïve animals had never run on long linear tracks (de novo condition animals), it is not clear what similar experiences does preplay reflect in the de novo condition. It is for this reason that we more generally referred to “multiple spatial experiences the animal had” rather than to “specific, related experiences”. We included the references to the relevant papers from the Eichenbaum lab; thank you for pointing those out. We have explained our choice of using the term homeostasis in two answers below (item 4).</p><p><italic>4) Unlike the rest of the manuscript, one of the reviewers found the Abstract to be imprecisely written and difficult to understand, so much so that he/she was inspired to edit it as follows</italic>:</p><p><italic>“Novel hippocampal spatial representations were thought to form during novel experiences and be specifically replayed the following sleep/rest enabling memory consolidation. We found that in naïve and experienced mice, novel CA1 place cell sequences exhibit similar correlations with their firing sequences during sleep/rests following and preceding the run, indicating network stability homeostasis. The tuning and spatial reliability coordination of place cell ensembles on novel tracks were reduced in naïve animals and showed accelerated increases in compared to experienced mice ones. Genetic blockade of CA3 NMDAR-dependent plasticity resulted in more rigid temporal-spatial sequences between sleep and exploratory behaviors and delayed tuning and coordination of place cell ensembles. These results indicate that novel spatial representations develop on the framework of preconfigured hippocampal networks whose homeostatic adjustment reorganization is accelerated by prior experience and CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity plasticity. The increased place map stability, tuning, and cell-assembly expression coordination may underlie rapid memory consolidation of repeated/related new experiences, but not of entirely novel ones.”</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for editing the Abstract. We incorporated these changes/comments in our revised version of the Abstract (150-word limit).</p><p><italic>The use of several terms in the Abstract and in the main text seems imprecise, inappropriate or requires better explanation. Specifically, what is meant by homeostasis? Why is this not merely stability or inertia? What evidence is there that homeostasis is occurring? Do the authors argue that the mutants show greater homeostasis? The phrase “homeostatic reorganization” seems to be an oxymoron and no evidence of reorganization is presented; instead plenty evidence of mild adjustment and modifications of the firing sequences are demonstrated. The authors demonstrate the dependence of the temporal sequence and place cell tuning changes on CA3 NMDARs and presumably their activity but not synaptic plasticity itself as stated in the Abstract and in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>More generally, the term homeostasis defines “the ability of the body or a cell to seek and maintain a condition of equilibrium or stability within its internal environment when dealing with external changes”. In our study, the term homeostasis refers to the ability of the hippocampal network (and associated brain areas) to maintain the stability of temporal sequences expressed during sleep before and after “dealing” with a novel run experience: we report similar incidence of significant p/replay events and similar spatial-temporal correlation strengths pre- and post-run experience. The term inertia proposed by the reviewers seem to refer more to a physical rather than a biological system; it might somehow capture the representational processes in the CA3 NMDAR KO mice, although for that case we prefer to use the terms rigidity and less flexible. We have uncoupled the terms homeostatic and reorganization, and substituted the term reorganization with the terms modification and adjustment. We have substituted the expression NMDAR-dependent plasticity with NMDAR-dependent activity. We thank the reviewers for pointing out these points.</p><p><italic>What is meant by ensemble “coordination” and how did the authors measure it</italic>?</p><p>The term ensemble coordination refers to the tendency of groups of cells that are members of a cell assembly to co-vary their firing rates across individual running laps (also called lap-by-lap co-variation or correlation throughout the manuscript). We measure this coordination by calculating the correlation coefficient between the firing rates binned across an entire run session, for pairs of cells. The procedure has been described in detail in Dragoi and Buzsaki, Neuron, 2006 and more succinctly in the current Materials and methods section. We have replaced the term coordination with co-variation throughout the manuscript, a term that we first introduced in the Results section.</p><p><italic>5) One of the reviewers found the first part of the Results (“Prior experience- and CA3 NMDAR-dependent homeostatic changes in sequence correlations”) difficult to read and follow. This is because the logic of the different experiments and comparisons is not explained, and so the reader has to figure it out. In fact, this logic is revealed in the second part of the Results (“Prior experience and CA3 NMDARs accelerate CA1 place cell tuning and coordination in novel environments”). It is almost as if the first part was written after the second part and then moved to the start of the Results. This needs to be rewritten. The authors might even consider switching the order of the two Results sections, which may be more appropriate anyway</italic>.</p><p>We have reversed the order in which present our Results as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>6) Why were paired t tests used to compare the KO and CT data? How is this possible</italic>?</p><p>The comparisons between genotypes reported were made between groups of average values from each session for each genotype, paired by session type (displayed in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); we used this analysis because the independent variable being tested in those cases was the genotype. The average values reported are grand averages; we clarified this in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) How many laps did the mice run and how long did it take them to complete a trial? It appears to have been completed in &lt; 5 minutes. If this is correct then the authors need to take this into account and elaborate their discussion of how they interpret the NMDAR KO effects on within-trial effects because the expression of the disrupted NMDAR-dependent plasticity may have a longer time course</italic>.</p><p>The mice ran 12–18 laps per session, similar numbers across genotypes (p&gt;0.5, ranksum test). The duration of each session (trial) is entered in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The data from the run sessions are specifically in the columns containing the word ‘Run’. The sessions the reviewers appears to refer to (i.e., novel runs) are each longer than 15 minutes, and they average 40–45 minutes in the first session of de novo condition. The two sessions of the de novo condition (over 1 h altogether) provided ample time for the non-NMDAR-dependent plasticity to occur. The results suggest that CA3 NMDAR-dependent activity is specifically involved in the within-session changes in single and ensemble place cell activity. We have added this comment to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) The results indicate and the model (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>) predicts that both the temporal and spatial discharge sequences of place cells are relatively stable. How does this fundamental view point account for the basic observations and reports that these firing patterns remap, i.e., change radically and unpredictably between environments whether novel or familiar? How do the findings and preplay/replay during sleep/rest account for the viewpoint that place cell firing emerges as a consequence of convergent inputs from spatially-tuned cells in the entorhinal cortex such as grid, border and head-direction cells? What predictions does the authors’ model make for preplay/replay in these cells? The discussion of these issues is inadequate but will be important to readers</italic>.</p><p>We have recently investigated the relationship between preplay and multiple highly distinct firing patterns (i.e., remapping) using 3 novel linear tracks (Dragoi and Tonegawa, PNAS 2013). Briefly, in animals naïve to running on relatively long linear tracks (1.5 m each), the CA1 hippocampal network is capable of preplaying multiple distinct spatial firing patterns that will be expressed in future novel environments; it thus appears that this type of remapping, while significant, is not entirely unpredictable. Regarding the relative contribution of entorhinal layer III and of CA3 area inputs to the activity of CA1 place cells, several studies have now shown that these inputs are not necessary for the expression of place cells in the CA1, despite both of them sending convergent inputs onto CA1 (works from the Moser and the Tonegawa labs). The highly periodic pattern of grid cell activity and the rather persistent activity of border cells might not make them the best candidates to study p/replay in these cells, at least not by simply employing the conventional spatial-temporal sequence analysis that is being widely used for CA1 place cell sequences.</p><p><italic>9) Materials and methods</italic></p><p><italic>9.1) The description of the recording environment misses essential details</italic>.</p><p><italic>- Were the walls of the maze transparent or opaque?

We calculated three sets of correlation values, between pairs of place fields that were: 1. Both expressed on the familiar arm (Fam x Fam); 2. Both expressed on the novel arm (Novel x Novel); and 3. Expressed one on the familiar arm and one on the novel arm (Fam x Novel).
