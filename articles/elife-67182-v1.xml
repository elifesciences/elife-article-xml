operating conditions to minimize the metabolic cost. By experimentally assessing the operating conditions of two important muscles for running, the soleus and vastus lateralis, we investigated physiological mechanisms of muscle work production and muscle force generation. We found that the soleus continuously shortened throughout the stance phase, operating as work generator under conditions that are considered optimal for work production: high force-length potential and high enthalpy efficiency. The vastus lateralis promoted tendon energy storage and contracted nearly isometrically close to optimal length, resulting in a high force-length-velocity potential beneficial for economical force generation. The favorable operating conditions of both muscles were a result of an effective length and velocity-decoupling of fascicles and muscle-tendon unit, mostly due to tendon compliance and, in the soleus, marginally by fascicle rotation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>force-length and force-velocity relationship</kwd><kwd>enthalpy-velocity relationship</kwd><kwd>length- and velocity-decoupling</kwd><kwd>tendon elasticity</kwd><kwd>metabolic cost of running</kwd><kwd>soleus muscle</kwd><kwd>vastus lateralis muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007323</institution-id><institution>German Federal Institute of Sport Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZMVI14-070604/17-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arampatzis</surname><given-names>Adamantios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008334</institution-id><institution>Stiftung Oskar Helene Heim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bohm</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During human running, the soleus muscle was found to operate as work generator under optimal conditions for work production (high force-length potential and enthalpy efficiency) while the vastus lateralis promoted tendon energy storage and economical force generation (high force-length-velocity potential).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During locomotion, muscles generate force and perform work in order to support and accelerate the body, and the activity of the lower-limb muscles accounts for most of the metabolic energy cost needed to walk or run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kram and Taylor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kram, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>). Running is characterized by a spring-like interaction of the body with the ground, indicating a significant conversion of the body’s kinetic and potential energy to strain energy - via the elongation of elastic elements, mainly tendons - that can be recovered in the propulsive second half of the stance phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavagna et al., 1964</xref>). In addition, the elasticity of tendons influences the operating conditions of the muscles, which in turn are associated with their metabolic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts, 2002</xref>). For a given muscle force, the metabolic cost depends on the muscle’s operating force-length and force-velocity potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nikolaidou et al., 2017</xref>) (fraction of maximum force according to the force-length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gordon et al., 1966</xref>] and force-velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hill, 1938</xref>] curves) because it determines the number of recruited muscle fibers and thus the active muscle volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts, 2002</xref>). This means that quasi isometric contractions close the optimum of the force-length curve, that is, with a high force-length-velocity potential, are theoretically most economical for generating a given force. During steady-state running, however, the human system does not perfectly conserve all the mechanical energy in each stride. Therefore, muscular work by active muscle shortening is needed to maintain the running movement, yet it increases the metabolic cost a) due to the reduced force-velocity potential, which will increase the active muscle volume for a given force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>), and b) due to the higher metabolic energy consumption of each fiber when actively shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2000</xref>). The active shorting range and velocity of a muscle during movements can be reduced by its tendon and, thus, an important benefit of tendon elasticity is a reduction in the metabolic cost of running.</p><p>At the muscle level, it has been shown that the triceps surae muscle group produces muscular work/energy during the stance phase of steady-state running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). The soleus is the largest muscle in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albracht et al., 2008</xref>) and does work by active shortening throughout the entire stance phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bohm et al., 2021</xref>). In the first part of the stance phase, the performed muscular work is stored in the Achilles tendon as elastic strain energy. During the later propulsion phase, the tendon strain energy recoil contributes to the muscular energy production, suggesting an energy amplification behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>) within the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit (MTU) during running. On the contrary, the vastus lateralis muscle, as the largest muscle of the quadriceps femoris muscle group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mersmann et al., 2015</xref>), operates nearly isometrically despite a lengthening-shortening behavior of the vastus lateralis MTU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monte et al., 2020</xref>). The almost isometric contraction suggests a negligible mechanical work production by the vastus lateralis during running and a spring-like energy exchange between body and vastus lateralis MTU, which promotes energy conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The triceps surae and the quadriceps muscle group are considered to be crucial for running performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arampatzis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamner and Delp, 2013</xref>). The quadriceps femoris decelerates and supports the body early in stance while the triceps surae accounts for the propulsion later in the stance phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santuz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamner and Delp, 2013</xref>). The soleus and vastus lateralis, as the largest muscles of both muscle groups, show marked differences in their morphological and architectural properties with shorter fascicles and higher pennation angles in the soleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maganaris et al., 1998</xref>) compared to vastus lateralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marzilger et al., 2018</xref>). Because of the long fascicles of the vastus lateralis, a unit of force generated by this muscle is metabolically more expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biewener and Roberts, 2000</xref>) compared to the soleus. Our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that the vastus lateralis operates at a high force-length-velocity potential during running, which would indicate a fascicle contraction condition that could minimize the energetic cost of muscle force generation. The soleus muscle instead operates as a muscular work generator through active shortening, though close to the optimum of the force-length curve. Operating with increasing shortening velocity decreases the force-velocity potential according to the force-velocity relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bohm et al., 2021</xref>) and may increase the energetic cost of muscle force generation, marking a trade-off between mechanical work production and metabolic expenses. The enthalpy efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barclay, 2015</xref>) (or mechanical efficiency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref>) quantifies the fraction of chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis that is converted into mechanical work and depends on the shortening velocity, with a steep increase at low shortening velocities up to a maximum at around 20% of the maximum shortening velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) and a decrease thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barclay et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref>). Previous findings suggest that the soleus fascicles continuously shorten at a moderate velocity during the stance phase of running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>), covering a range that corresponds to a high efficiency. Therefore, the soleus muscle may operate at fascicle conditions that would be beneficial for economical work/energy production.</p><p>The muscle fascicle behavior is strongly influenced by the decoupling of the fascicles from the MTU excursions due to tendon elasticity and fascicle rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Azizi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zuurbier and Huijing, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wakeling et al., 2011</xref>). The previously reported decoupling of the soleus muscle indicates that tendon elasticity and fascicle rotation affect the operating fascicle length and velocity during running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Werkhausen et al., 2019</xref>); however, their integration in the regulation of the efficiency-fascicle velocity dependency is unclear. Regarding the vastus lateralis muscle, it was suggested that proximal muscles like the knee extensors feature less compliant tendons compared to the distal triceps surae muscles, thus limiting the decoupling between fascicles and MTU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farris and Sawicki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Biewener and Daley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Biewener, 2016</xref>). However, in our previous study, we found significantly smaller vastus lateralis fascicle length changes compared to the vastus lateralis MTU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>), indicating an important decoupling within the vastus lateralis MTU due to tendon elasticity.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to assess the soleus and the vastus lateralis fascicle behavior with regard to the operating force-length-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency to investigate physiological mechanisms for muscle work production and muscle force generation during running. The soleus muscle actively shortens during the stance phase at moderate velocities, which may match the plateau of the enthalpy efficiency-velocity curve, and operates close to the optimum of the force-length curve. Therefore, we hypothesized that the soleus muscle as a work generator operates at a high force-length potential and a high enthalpy efficiency, minimizing the metabolic cost of work production. On the other hand, the vastus lateralis muscle that promotes energy conservation seems to operate at a favorable length and almost isometrically. Thus, we hypothesized a high force-length and a high force-velocity potential that would reduce the metabolic energy cost of muscle force generation. In order to investigate the regulation of the efficiency and force potentials, we further quantified the length and velocity-decoupling of the fascicles from the MTU as well as the electromyographic (EMG) activity. Because of experimental constrains, the two muscles were measured in two groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences in the anthropometric characteristics between groups (age p=0.369, height p=0.536, body mass p=0.057). The experimentally assessed optimal fascicle length for force generation (L<sub>0</sub>) of the soleus was on average 41.3 ± 5.2 mm and significantly shorter than L<sub>0</sub> of the vastus lateralis with 94.0 ± 11.6 mm (p&lt;0.001). The forces that corresponded to L<sub>0</sub> of soleus and vastus lateralis (F<sub>max</sub>) were 2887 ± 724 N and 4990 ± 914 N (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the assessed V<sub>max</sub> was 279 ± 35 mm/s for the soleus, significantly lower than the V<sub>max</sub> of the vastus lateralis with 1082 ± 133 mm/s (p&lt;0.001).</p><p>The stance and swing times during running were 304 ± 23 ms and 439 ± 26 ms for the soleus group and 290 ± 22 ms and 448 ± 30 ms for the vastus lateralis group (p=0.075, p=0.369). The EMG comparison showed that the soleus was active throughout the entire stance phase of running while the vastus lateralis was mainly active in the first part of the stance and with an earlier peak of activation (soleus 41 ± 5% of the stance phase, vastus lateralis 35 ± 4% of the stance phase, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the stance phase, the MTU of both muscles showed a lengthening-shortening behavior, but the vastus lateralis MTU started to shorten earlier (soleus 59 ± 2% of the stance phase, vastus lateralis 50 ± 2% of the stance phase, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The soleus and the vastus lateralis fascicle length were clearly decoupled from the MTU length with smaller operating length ranges throughout the whole stance phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

There was a clear length and velocity-decoupling of MTU and belly due to tendon compliance in both muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis revealed a significantly lower DC<sub>Tendon</sub> of the soleus compared to the vastus lateralis between 4% and 8% of the stance phase (p=0.032) since decoupling started later for the soleus. Between 20% and 57% of the stance phase (p&lt;0.001) and between 65% of the stance phase until lift-off, the soleus DC<sub>Tendon</sub> was significantly higher than vastus lateralis (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

DC<sub>Belly</sub> was markedly lower than DC<sub>Tendon</sub>, indicating that the tendon took over the majority of the overall decoupling in both muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Accordingly and similarly to DC<sub>Tendon</sub>, the SPM analysis for the overall decoupling of MTU and fascicles showed that DC<sub>MTU</sub> of the soleus was significantly lower between 4% and 8% of the stance phase (p=0.032) and significantly higher from 20% to 57% of the stance phase and from 65% of the stance phase until lift-off compared to the vastus lateralis (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The soleus continuously shortened throughout the stance phase and produced muscular work at a shortening velocity close to the enthalpy efficiency optimum. Vastus lateralis operated with smaller length changes, almost isometrically, resulting in a high force-velocity potential, which is beneficial for economic force generation. Both muscles operated close to L<sub>0</sub>, that is, at a high force-length potential. Tendon compliance was responsible for the majority of the overall decoupling of MTU and fascicles in both muscles, enabling favorable conditions for muscle force or muscle work production. Only in the soleus muscle did fascicle rotation contribute to the overall decoupling, indicating an additional, yet comparatively minor effect on the fascicle dynamics during locomotion.</p><p>The triceps surae and quadriceps muscle groups are the main contributors for locomotion and thus responsible for a great portion of the metabolic energy cost of running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farris and Sawicki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fletcher and MacIntosh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamner and Delp, 2013</xref>). While the quadriceps mainly decelerates and supports body mass in the early stance phase, the triceps surae contributes to the acceleration of the center of mass during the second part of the stance phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamner and Delp, 2013</xref>). The soleus is the largest muscle of the triceps surae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albracht et al., 2008</xref>) and the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mersmann et al., 2015</xref>) and thus both muscles are important for the running movement. We found that the soleus actively shortened throughout the entire stance phase, indicating continuous work/energy production. The average velocity at which the soleus shortened was very close to the optimal velocity for maximal enthalpy efficiency. Enthalpy efficiency quantifies the fraction of chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis that is converted into mechanical muscular work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Barclay, 2015</xref>) with a peak at around 20% of V<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barclay et al., 1993</xref>). Consequently, the mechanical work performed by the soleus muscle, being essential during running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arampatzis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stefanyshyn and Nigg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamner and Delp, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2015</xref>) and high enough in magnitude to significantly influence the overall metabolic energy cost of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bohm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sawicki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beck et al., 2019</xref>), was generated at a high enthalpy efficiency (94% of maximum efficiency). Considering that also the soleus force-length potential was close to the maximum (0.92) and that a high potential may decrease the active muscle volume for a given muscle force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biewener and Roberts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fletcher and MacIntosh, 2017</xref>), our results provide evidence of a cumulative contribution of two different mechanisms (high force-length potential and high enthalpy efficiency) to an advantageous muscular work production of the soleus during running. The vastus lateralis was mainly active in the first part of the stance phase and its fascicles operated with very small length changes, that is, almost isometrically, confirming earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monte et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates that the vastus lateralis dissipates and/or produces negligible amounts of mechanical energy during running, yet generating force for the deceleration and support of the body mass. The observed decoupling of the vastus lateralis MTU and fascicles showed that the deceleration of the body mass in the early stance phase was not a result of an energy dissipation by the contractile element (active stretch) but rather an energy absorption by the tendinous tissue. Tendons feature low damping characteristics, resulting in a hysteresis of only 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pollock and Shadwick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bennett et al., 1986</xref>), and, therefore, the main part of the absorbed energy of the body’s deceleration is expected to be stored as elastic tendon strain energy, which is then returned later in the second part of the stance phase. The high force-length (0.93) and force-velocity (0.96) potential of the vastus lateralis muscle throughout stance indicates an energy exchange within the vastus lateralis MTU under almost optimal conditions for muscle force generation during running. Operating at high potentials reduces the active muscle volume for a given force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biewener and Roberts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fletcher and MacIntosh, 2017</xref>) and thus the metabolic energy cost of muscle force generation.</p><p>By actively shortening the soleus delivered energy during the entire stance phase to the skeleton, providing the main muscular work required for running. On the other side, the contractile elements of the vastus lateralis muscle did not contribute to the required muscular work and operated in concert with the elastic tendon in favor of energy storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>). Our findings showed that, although the human body interacts with the ground in a spring-like manner during steady-state running to store mechanical energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberts and Azizi, 2011</xref>), there are indeed muscles that operate as work generators, like the soleus, and others that promote energy conservations, like the vastus lateralis. Further, our results indicate that the fascicle operating length and velocity of the soleus muscle, the main work generator, is optimized for high enthalpy efficiency, while of the vastus lateralis muscle, which promote energy conservation, for a high potential of force generation. The consequence of the active shortening of the soleus muscle for work production is a decrease of the force-velocity potential during the stance phase, which may increase the active muscle volume and shortening-related cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hill, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fenn, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2000</xref>). However, the soleus muscle features shorter fascicles (L<sub>0</sub> = 41 mm) compared to the vastus lateralis muscle (L<sub>0</sub> = 94 mm), and, for this reason, a given force generated by the soleus is energetically less expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biewener and Roberts, 2000</xref>). The specific morphology of the soleus muscle certainly compensates for the reductions of the force-velocity potential and provides advantages for its function as work generator during submaximal steady-state running. Furthermore, operating around the ‘sweet spot’ of the shortening velocity for high enthalpy efficiency facilitates the economical muscular work production, while either a too high or a too low shortening velocity would be disadvantageous. The advantageous operating conditions specific for soleus and vastus lateralis during submaximal running shown here for a moderate speed of 2.5 m/s seem to persist at faster running speeds as well. This is indicated by recent evidence of a comparable muscle operating length and velocity of the soleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lai et al., 2015</xref>) and vastus lateralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monte et al., 2020</xref>) over a broad range of running speeds, respectively. In addition, the operating behavior of both muscles seems to reflect their respective muscle group. The gastrocnemius muscles, as the second largest plantar flexors, have been shown to operate at a length similar to soleus and only at slightly higher velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting efficient work production too. For the other monoarticular knee extensors, vastus medialis and intermedius, the resting fascicle length is about similar to the vastus lateralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ward et al., 2009</xref>), and, since they share the same single patellar tendon, we also do not expect that those muscles operate substantially different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>), that is, likewise at a high force potential.</p><p>The almost optimal conditions for muscular work production and muscle force generation of the soleus and vastus lateralis were a result of an effective decoupling between MTU and fascicle length that was regulated by an appropriate muscle activation. For the soleus, the activation level increased in the first part of stance phase, contracting the muscle while the MTU increased in length. This activation pattern not only prevented the muscle to be stretched but also induced continuous shortening around the plateau of the force-length curve at a high enthalpy efficiency. The respective high DC<sub>Tendon</sub> further indicates that a part of the body’s mechanical energy was stored as strain energy in the Achilles tendon in addition to the generated work by fascicle shortening. During MTU shortening (propulsion phase), the soleus EMG activity decreased and the tendon recoiled, enabling the high shortening velocities of the MTU while maintaining the fascicle operating conditions close to the efficiency optimum. The simultaneous release of the stored strain energy from the tendon further added to the ongoing muscle work production, that is, energy amplification. The vastus lateralis muscle showed higher levels of activation during the initial part of the stance phase and earlier deactivation than soleus. The timing and level of activation regulated the decoupling within the vastus lateralis MTU during the body mass deceleration in a magnitude that the lengthening and shorting of the MTU was fully accomplished by the tendinous tissue. Consequently, the vastus lateralis fascicles operated at a high force-length-velocity potential and the body’s energy was stored within the MTU. Although being substantial for soleus and vastus lateralis, the SPM analysis revealed higher values of DC<sub>Tendon</sub> for soleus during the major part of the stance phase (average value for soleus 0.57 V/V<sub>max</sub> and vastus lateralis 0.18 V/V<sub>max</sub>), indicating a greater decoupling within the soleus MTU compared to the vastus lateralis MTU. In the soleus muscle, fascicle rotation (changes in pennation angle) had an additional effect on the overall decoupling between MTU and fascicles. The results showed an increase in DC<sub>Belly</sub> in the second part of the stance phase where the soleus belly velocity was high during the MTU shortening. However, the decoupling by the fascicle rotation was considerably smaller compared to the tendon decoupling. Over the stance phase, belly and tendon decoupling were 1.6% V<sub>max</sub> and 57% V<sub>max</sub> and during the MTU shortening phase 2.6% V<sub>max</sub> and 72% V<sub>max</sub>, respectively, suggesting a rather minor functional role of fascicle rotation during submaximal running. In the vastus lateralis, fascicle rotation was virtually absent and consequently DC<sub>Belly</sub> values showed no relevant decoupling effect at all.</p><p>Note that because of the extensive experimental protocol for each muscle it was not possible to measure soleus and vastus lateralis in the same participants. However, both groups are a representative sample and no significant differences were found in anthropometrics and relevant gait parameters. Furthermore, for the determination of the vastus lateralis force-length curve, the muscle was not isolated, hence the curve also includes the contribution of the vastus medialis and intermedius. The underlying assumption for this approach is that the force-length curves of these three synergistic knee extensors are comparable, which is supported by the study of Herzog et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herzog et al., 1990</xref>). Besides, it is currently not possible to measure enthalpy efficiency directly during running. Instead, we used an experimentally determined efficiency-velocity curve reported by Hill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref>) and confirmed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barclay et al., 2010</xref>) to relate the measured operating fascicle velocities of both muscles to the enthalpy efficiency. We were also not able to directly measure V<sub>max</sub> of both muscles and despite using a biologically funded value, its choice affects the force-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency. However, when conducting a sensitivity analysis by substantially reducing or increasing V<sub>max</sub> by 30%, the force-velocity potential of vastus lateralis only changed for V<sub>max</sub> -30% and V<sub>max</sub> +30 % from 0.96 to 0.94 and 0.98 and of soleus from 0.63 to 0.52 and 0.65 while the enthalpy efficiency changed from 0.082 to 0.081 and 0.016 for vastus lateralis and from 0.425 to 0.439 and 0.403 for soleus, respectively, without an impact on the significance of the differences between muscles (potential p&lt;0.001, efficiency p&lt;0.001). These results support the robustness of our primary outcomes and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that during the stance phase of steady-state running, when the human body interacts with the environment in a spring-like manner, the soleus muscle acts as work generator and the vastus lateralis muscle as energy conservator. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that the soleus operates under conditions optimal for muscular work production (i.e., high force-length potential and high enthalpy efficiency) and the vastus lateralis under conditions optimal for muscle force generation (i.e., high force-length and high force-velocity potential).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and experimental design</title><p>Thirty-three physically active adults, accustomed to regular running on a recreational basis (i.e., no competitive runners), were included in the present investigation.

The values were then adjusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranatunga, 1984</xref>) for physiological temperature conditions (37°C) and an average fiber type distribution of the human soleus (type 1 fibers: 81%, type 2: 19%) and vastus lateralis muscle (type 1 fibers: 37%, type 2: 63%) reported in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgerton et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Larsson and Moss, 1993</xref>) was the basis to derive a representative value of V<sub>max</sub>. For the soleus muscle under the in vivo condition, V<sub>max</sub> was calculated as 6.77 L<sub>0</sub>/s and for the vastus lateralis as 11.51 L<sub>0</sub>/s. For L<sub>0</sub>, we then referred to the individually measured optimal fascicle length (described above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The constant a<sub>rel</sub> was calculated as 0.1 + 0.4 FT, where FT is the fast twitch fiber type percentage, which then equals to 0.175 for the soleus and 0.351 for the vastus lateralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winters and Stark, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winters and Stark, 1988</xref>). The product of a<sub>rel</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> gives the constant b<sub>rel</sub> as 1.182 for the soleus and 4.042 for the vastus lateralis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Umberger et al., 2003</xref>). Based on the assessed force-length and force-velocity relationships, we calculated the individual force-length and force-velocity potential of both muscles as a function of the fascicle operating length and velocity during the stance phase of running. The product of both potentials then gives the overall force-length-velocity potential.</p><p>Furthermore, we determined the enthalpy efficiency-velocity relationship for the soleus and the vastus lateralis muscle fascicles in order to calculate the enthalpy efficiency of both muscles as a function of the fascicle operating velocity during running. For this purpose, we used the experimental efficiency values provided by the paper of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for a/P<sub>0</sub> = 0.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill, 1964</xref>). By means of the classical Hill equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hill, 1938</xref>), we then transposed the original efficiency values that were presented as a function of relative load (relative to maximum tension) to shortening velocity (normalized to V<sub>max</sub>). The values of enthalpy efficiency and shortening velocity were then fitted using a cubic spline, giving the right-skewed parabolic-shaped curve with a peak efficiency of 0.45 at a velocity of 0.18 V/V<sub>max</sub>. The resulting function was then used to calculate the enthalpy efficiency of the soleus and the vastus lateralis during running based on the average value of the fascicle velocity over stance, accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessment of decoupling within the MTU</title><p>To quantify the decoupling of fascicle, belly, and MTU velocities over the time course of stance, we calculated a decoupling coefficient to account for the tendon compliance (DC<sub>Tendon</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref>), fascicle rotation (DC<sub>Belly</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">equation 2</xref>), as well as for the overall decoupling of MTU and fascicle velocities that includes both components (DC<sub>MTU</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">equation 3</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>V(t</italic>) is the velocity at each percentage of the stance phase (i.e. t = 0, 1, …, 100% stance).

For the soleus and VL, evidence suggests that their fascicle behaviors are almost unaffected by running speed. The study by Monte et al. [1] showed that during higher speeds of 2.8, 3.6 and 4.4 m/s, the shortening velocity of the VL remained very close to zero, i.e. 3.1, 1.8 and −2.8 %V/V<sub>max</sub>, respectively. Similarly, the operating length remained close to optimal length at the higher speeds, i.e. 1.03, 1.06 and 1.10 L/L<sub>0</sub>. For the soleus, Lai et al. [2] reported for a very broad range of speeds (2.0-5.0 m/s) that, although shortening velocity increased significantly, the magnitude of increase was rather low (2.0 m/s: 1.59 <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> vs. 5.0 m/s: 2.60 <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> resting muscle fascicle length measured during static standing).

Applying this factor to our soleus muscle shortening velocity at 2.5 m/s, the predicted enthalpy efficiency at a speed of 5.0 m/s would be 0.446. This would still cover the plateau on the efficiency-velocity curve (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and would be comparable to the 2.5 m/s observed in our study (2.3% higher). Regarding the soleus fascicle length, Lai et al. reported a decreased with increasing speed, but the authors themselves argued that the fascicles would remain on the plateau of the force length curve (2.0 m/s: 1.04 <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and 5.0 m/s: 0.92 <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). These findings demonstrate that in a range of slow to fast running, the soleus and VL muscles do not substantially change their operating profiles.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Predicted efficiency for running at 5.0 m/s.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67182-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the effect of external factors suggested by the reviewers (treadmill and mechanical ground properties), the study by Cronin et al. [3] showed that neither shod vs. barefoot nor treadmill vs. overground walking and running significantly affected the soleus fascicle operating range and velocity. In further support, the study by Hollville et al. [4] indicated that between different surfaces with different mechanical properties, the gastrocnemius medialis and VL fascicle behavior during jumping was unaffected by the type of surface. Therefore, we are confident that our results can be generalized to running on common running surfaces.We added the following paragraph to the limitations section (page: 6, line: 234):</p><p>“The advantageous operating conditions specific for soleus and vastus lateralis during submaximal running shown here for a moderate speed of 2.5 m/s seem to persist at faster running speeds as well.

The reason not to measure both muscles in the same participants was because of the extensive experimental protocol for each muscle, including separate assessment stations: i. assessment of force-length relationship on the dynamometer (kinematics, EMG, ultrasound, dynamometry), ii. assessment of tendon lever arm (for VL using MRI in an external hospital lab), iii. assessment during running (kinematics, EMG, ultrasound). Due to the high overall effort for both measurements (VL and soleus) most participants would not have been willing to participate. ­­­­However, the participants in each group were chosen randomly and no significant differences were found in anthropometrics and relevant gait parameters as reported.</p><p>We now added this aspect to the limitation section of the revised manuscript (page: 7, line: 273):</p><p>“Note that because of the extensive experimental protocol for each muscle, it was not possible to measure both soleus and VL in the same participants.

To account for the reviewers’ comment, we could argue that the choice of V<sub>max</sub> might be most crucial to the primary outcome variables, because it may affect the force-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency of both muscles. In our view, it is barely possible to obtain valid measurements of V<sub>max</sub> in vivo in humans. Thus, we defined V<sub>max</sub> based on reports of in vitro fiber testing of the human soleus and VL, which we then corrected for temperature effects and fiber type distribution in the whole muscle, resulting in a biologically founded value of V<sub>max</sub>. However, when conducting a sensitivity analysis by substantially reducing or increasing V<sub>max</sub> by 30%, the force-velocity potential of VL only changed for V<sub>max</sub>-30% and V<sub>max</sub>+30% from 0.96 to 0.94 and 0.98 and of soleus from 0.63 to 0.52 and 0.65 while the enthalpy efficiency changed from 0.082 to 0.081 and 0.016 for VL and from 0.425 to 0.439 and 0.403 for soleus, respectively, without an impact on the significance of the differences between muscles (potential p &lt; 0.001, efficiency p &lt; 0.001). These results support the robustness of our primary outcomes and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>The following paragraph was added as a part of a greater limitations section in the revised manuscript (page: 8, line: 282):</p><p>“We were also not able to directly measure V<sub>max</sub> of both muscles and despite using a biologically funded value, its choice affects the force-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency.

A strength of our ultrasound-based fascicle length assessment is that we track many fascicle portions over the entire field of view of the probe that are then averaged to a representative fascicle length for each muscle (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) [7]. That means that we did not track only one fascicle but considered multiple fascicles from the muscle belly to characterize the respective muscles fascicle length.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Ultrasound-based determination of muscle fascicle length.</title><p>upper (uA) and deeper (dA) aponeurosis, representative reference fascicle (rF) calculated from all identified visible features of multiple fascicles (F).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67182-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the second part of the reviewers’ comment, we agree that more muscles are involved and contribute to the metabolic cost. Still, for the plantar flexors it is obvious that the soleus is substantially larger and features a greater PCSA compared to the gastrocnemii [8,9]. Furthermore, although the gastrocnemius muscles span also the knee joint, their fascicle length behavior during running is comparable to the continuous shortening of soleus during running [3]. Lai et al. [10] also showed no significant differences in shortening velocity of soleus and gastrocnemius lateralis, yet higher velocity of gastrocnemius medialis but only during the initial stance phase (+38%). As shown in response to comment 1, higher shortening velocities in this range would likely still cover the plateau of the efficiency-velocity curve. Thus, it can be assumed that the efficient work generation observed in soleus is comparable in the gastrocnemius muscles. The VL is the largest muscle in the quadriceps muscle group. To the best of our knowledge, there are no experimental studies on the fascicle behavior of the other muscle compartments of the quadriceps. The resting fascicle length of the monoarticular VI, VM seem to be comparable to the VL [9] and since they share the same single patellar tendon we would not expect those muscles to operate substantially different. This is supported by the modelling study of Arnold et al. that showed almost identical operating conditions of VL and VM [11]. The RF also spans the hip joint and it cannot be ruled out that this muscle operates differently, yet it is the smallest muscle in the quadriceps group [9].</p><p>We added the following sentence to the limitation section of the revised manuscript (page: 6, line: 238):</p><p>“In addition, the operating behavior of both muscles seem to reflect their respective muscle group. […] For the other monoarticular knee extensors, vastus medialis and intermedius, the resting fascicle length is about similar to the vastus lateralis [9] and since they share the same single patellar tendon we also do not expect that those muscles operate substantially different [11], i.e. likewise at a high force potential.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Because muscles, like the soleus, have multiple compartments with complicated architecture, tracking only 1 fascicle may not represent fascicles mechanics in other compartments of the soleus.</p></disp-quote><p>According to our previous response, we used a representative fascicle length that was calculated from multiple fascicle portions and not a single fascicle (please see description and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment about the complex anatomy of soleus. Using a sophisticated methodological combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D microdissection techniques, Bolsterlee et al. [12] recently showed that in the four soleus compartments the fascicle length were not significantly different neither when measured in short (plantar flexion) nor in long muscle length (dorsi flexion). The fascicle lengths provided by this study were also comparable in magnitude to our results. In further support, the studies of Lai and colleagues [2,10] scanned the soleus muscle during running from the lateral side (lateral-posterior compartment) while we used the medial side (medial-posterior compartment). Qualitatively, there seems no difference in the fascicle behavior of soleus throughout stance when comparing the different sides, which agrees well with the findings of fascicle length homogeneity between compartments by Bolsterlee et al. [12] mentioned before. Together these findings strengthen our view that our results represent a general soleus operating condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Are the metabolic costs of performing work separate from the metabolic costs of producing work and accounting for force-length-velocity potential? Consider actin-myosin crossbridge ATP turnover, if a crossbridge cycles and shortens the sarcomere, does it use more ATP to produce work, to operate at a shorter length-velocity, and to perform work? Making implications regarding force-length-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency confuses me and makes me think that there are separate costs that one could add up to determine the ATP use in a muscle contraction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this important comment. The metabolic cost for a given muscle force depends on the muscles operating force-length-velocity potential because it determines the number of recruited muscle fibers, i.e. a high force potential reduces the active muscle volume. This means that quasi isometric contractions close the optimum of the force-length curve (e.g. vastus lateralis) are theoretically most economical for generating a given force. During steady state running, however, is not possible to operate all muscles isometrically because the human system does not perfectly conserve all the mechanical energy in each stride. Therefore, muscular work by active shortening is needed to maintain the running movement (e.g. soleus), yet it increases the metabolic cost due to a reduced force-velocity potential that will increase active muscle volume [13] as well as due to the higher cost of each fiber when actively shortening [14,15]. The metabolic cost in this case, can be minimized by generating the needed muscular work at a shortening velocity close to the maximal enthalpy efficiency and an operating length close to the optimum of the force-length curve.</p><p>We clarified the section in the introduction of revised manuscript (page: 2, line: 40):</p><p>“Running is characterized by a spring-like interaction of the body with the ground, indicating a significant conversion of the body’s kinetic and potential energy to strain energy by elongation of elastic elements, mainly tendons, that can be recovered in the propulsive second half of the stance phase [16–18]. […] The active shorting range and velocity of a muscle during movements can be reduced by its tendon and thus, an important benefit of tendon elasticity is a reduction in the metabolic cost of running [19].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I was surprised that his study did not take any metabolic cost measures. The study's hypotheses both discuss the metabolic cost of each muscle group, but the authors did not study the metabolic cost of the muscles, only the mechanics of 1 fascicle per muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any method that can measure metabolic cost of individual human muscles in vivo during locomotion. Therefore, no metabolic cost measurements of neither muscle were taken. Given the underlying known causality of muscle mechanics and metabolic energetics [14,25], we decided to investigate the main muscles for human running experimentally and draw indirect conclusions on the related muscle specific energetics of running.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Some of the comparisons between Sol and VL do not seem valuable. Do the authors need to compare soleus to vastus lateralis mechanics to make a statement about each muscle? Could the authors justify a threshold, such as 0.85 force-velocity potential that differentiates isometric versus concentric actions and describe their results according to the muscle's action?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a threshold might be useful to distinguish isometric and concentric contractions. However, a justification for such a threshold seems difficult to us, i.e. any velocity beyond zero would be shortening per definition, and we are also not aware of any value that is established in the scientific community. Therefore, we would prefer not to introduce a certain threshold. Our main purpose was to compare the muscle operating conditions with respect to physiological mechanisms of force generation and work production, i.e. force-length and force-velocity potential as well as enthalpy efficiency-velocity relationship. This comparison provide evidence that the operating behavior of both muscles is in fact different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Discussion lines 181-184: the authors never measured VL force-length, SOL/VL force-velocity, or SOL/VL efficiency values – rather the authors built their study on many layers of unmeasurable assumptions that severely limit the use of this study</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. It is correct that for the force-length curve of the vastus lateralis, the muscle was not isolated and that the assessed force-length curve also included the contribution of the vastus medialis and intermedius (rectus femoris was supposedly eliminated because of the chosen hip angle). The underlying assumption here is that the force-length relationship of the vastus medialis and intermedius are comparable to the vastus lateralis and in fact this is strongly supported by the study of Herzog et al. (1990) [26]. We believe that this approach is more qualified compared to estimations of single muscle forces that are based on a number of questionable assumptions.</p><p>Regarding the force-velocity curves of both muscles, we already mentioned in response to comment 5 that in our view, it is barely possible to obtain valid measurements of V<sub>max</sub> in vivo in humans. Thus, we assessed V<sub>max</sub> by using the individual experimentally measured optimum fascicle length and based on reports of in vitro fiber testing of the human soleus and vastus lateralis, which we then corrected for temperature effects and fiber type distribution in the whole muscle, resulting in a biologically founded value of V<sub>max</sub>. We then used the classical Hill equation to calculate the force-velocity curves of the two muscles for the investigation the force-velocity potential during running.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that the choice of V<sub>max</sub> might by be critical because it may affect the force-velocity potential and enthalpy efficiency of both muscles. When conducting a sensitivity analysis by substantially reducing or increasing V<sub>max</sub> by 30%, the force-velocity potential of VL only changed for V<sub>max</sub>-30% and V<sub>max</sub>+30% from 0.96 to 0.94 and 0.98 and of soleus from 0.63 to 0.52 and 0.65 while the enthalpy efficiency changed from 0.082 to 0.081 and 0.016 for VL and from 0.425 to 0.439 and 0.403 for soleus, respectively, without an impact on the significance of the differences between muscles (potential p &lt; 0.001, efficiency p &lt; 0.001). These results may support and strengthen our findings.</p><p>Currently it seems not possible to measure the enthalpy efficiency in humans in vivo during running. Accordingly, we used an efficiency-velocity curve reported by Hill (1964) [27] that was, however, experimentally determined and mapped our measured muscle operating velocities onto this curve. The characteristic efficiency curve has also been confirmed by the later study of Barclay et al. (2010) [28] for the mouse under physiological temperature conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> and note the comparability of curves).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of efficiency-velocity curves provided in literature and assessed operating velocities of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67182-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The following paragraph was added as a part of a greater limitations section in the revised manuscript (page: 7, line: 276): “Furthermore, for the determination of the vastus lateralis force-length curve, the muscle was not isolated, hence the curve also includes the contribution of the vastus medialis and intermedius.
