Classical models suggest that loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of mesenchymal traits are associated with cancer aggressiveness and therapy resistance. However, the mechanistic link between these phenotypes and mutant KRAS biology remains to be established. Here, we identify STAT3 as a genetic modifier of TGF-beta-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Gene expression profiling of pancreatic cancer cells identifies more than 200 genes commonly regulated by STAT3 and oncogenic KRAS. Functional classification of the STAT3-responsive program reveals its major role in tumor maintenance and epithelial homeostasis. The signatures of STAT3-activated cell states can be projected onto human KRAS mutant tumors, suggesting that they faithfully reflect characteristics of human disease. These observations have implications for therapeutic intervention and tumor aggressiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>KRAS</kwd><kwd>cancer dependency</kwd><kwd>epithelial carcinogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1CA236389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Nancy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carol M Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Nancy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Catacosinos Cancer Research Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrenko</surname><given-names>Oleksi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Results show that STAT3 and KRAS jointly regulate oncogenic dependency of mutant KRAS cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pan-cancer projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have provided a comprehensive view of the mutational landscape in human cancers. The foremost objective has been the discovery of key genes that drive cancer initiation and progression. It is estimated that cancer genomes contain an average of less than five driver mutations, whose outcomes are realized in the context of chromosomal and epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sondka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Consortium ITP-CAoWG, 2020</xref>). While the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) has been largely defined, unraveling the contributions of normal cell functions to cancer development and their influence on tissue homeostasis, plasticity, and differentiation remains a complex task. A large body of evidence suggests that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has tumor-promoting properties that it exerts in a context-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>). Canonical activation of STAT3 occurs following phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 (pY705) by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) or other tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Philips et al., 2022</xref>). The clinical relevance of hyperactive STAT3 has been linked to subsets of hematological malignancies, with the identification of JAK1/3 or STAT3 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jerez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koskela et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crescenzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milner et al., 2015</xref>). The most common STAT3 mutations, Y640F and D661Y, render STAT3 constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jerez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koskela et al., 2012</xref>). In sharp contrast, STAT3 mutations rarely occur in solid tumors. TCGA pan-cancer analysis reveals that most cancers do not express high levels of activated STAT3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov">https://www.cancer.gov</ext-link>). Patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models have yielded contrasting findings regarding the role of STAT3 in cancer development that range from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive, suggesting a high degree of tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We aim to delineate the role of STAT3 in shaping the patterns of oncogenic KRAS dependency in KRAS mutant cancer cells. A previous study from our laboratory uncovered a novel link between STAT3 and cancer showing that activation of STAT3 in KRAS mutant cancers led to the stabilization of epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Amico et al., 2018</xref>). This observation suggests that STAT3 plays a dynamic role in modulating the phenotypic diversity of KRAS-driven tumors, ostensibly coupled with the selection of the fittest variants. In this study, we leverage isogenic STAT3 intact and deficient cells to more fully delineate the effects of STAT3 on oncogenic KRAS dependency and the growth of cancer cells in culture or as tumors. To determine whether KRAS-dependent tumor cells are co-dependent on STAT3, we used two wellestablished models of KRAS mutant cancer: mouse embryonic fibroblasts and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells expressing endogenous KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that neither persistent activation of STAT3 nor its loss confers distinct growth advantages on tumor cells. Instead, STAT3 guides morphological and functional characteristics of the transformed cells and tumors. Stabilization of the epithelial phenotype and attenuation of the TGF-β/SMAD4 pathway are two main driving forces behind STAT3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oft et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David and Massagué, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Principe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gough et al., 2021</xref>). The data highlight antagonistic epistasis between SMAD4 and STAT3, where SMAD4 expressing tumors are poorly differentiated and exhibit mesenchymal features only in the absence of STAT3, while SMAD4-deficient tumors are well-differentiated and display epithelial morphology only in presence of STAT3. The results have implications for our understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenic KRAS dependency and therapy response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of STAT3 activity on KRAS-mediated transformation</title><p>To assess the role of STAT3 in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis, we measured proliferation rates, contact inhibition, and tumor formation in mice.

We used naturally occurring GOF mutants, Y640F, K658Y and D661Y, and a synthetic mutant STAT3C (A662C/N664C), which all render a persistently phosphorylated and thus hyperactive STAT3 pY705 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crescenzo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bromberg et al., 1999</xref>).

Loss of STAT3 expression did not affect cell growth under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likewise, loss of STAT3 did not affect KRAS-induced transformation. This is indicated by the ability of STAT3 KO cells to grow in multilayers and form transformed foci to the same extent as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using LOF mutations in STAT3 DNA binding (EE434-435AA and VVV461-463AAA) and transactivation domains (Y705F and S727A). In contrast, STAT3 GOF mutations, Y640F, D661Y, and K658Y, impaired KRAS-induced focus formation (p&lt;0.005 by two-tailed T test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Because the transduced STAT3 constructs co-expressed a GFP reporter, the formation of transformed foci was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Through these real-time studies, we discovered that only a small percentage of cells with hyperactive STAT3 Y640F had some ability to form transformed colonies, while the majority of cells remained contact inhibited. We noted that STAT3 S727E had no significant effect on cell transformation, while the Y640F/S727E double mutant displayed only a marginal increase in the number of transformed foci relative to STAT3 Y640F itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the hyperactive Y640F mutation exerts a dominant influence over S727E in KRAS-transformed MEFs. As expected, lentiviral expression of wild-type or GOF STAT3 alleles, Y640F and D661Y, failed to transform primary p53KO MEFs or immortalized NIH 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; data not shown), indicating that STAT3 does not display intrinsic oncogenicity on its own.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>STAT3 GOF mutations reduce tumor development in mice</title><p>To investigate tumorigenic effects of STAT3 in vivo, subcutaneous implants of KP MEFs into nude mice were used.

In contrast, cells expressing the hyperactive STAT3 Y640F and, to a lesser extent, K658Y mutations were delayed in their ability to form tumors in mice. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting for GFP to fractionate STAT3 Y640F MEFs into pools with low and high STAT3 pY705 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Following implantation in mice, cell populations with high STAT3 pY705 expression developed tumors more slowly compared to low expressing cells (p=0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, there is a dose-dependent ability of hyperactive STAT3 Y640F to limit tumorigenicity of KRAS-transformed MEFs.

Western blot analyses of control and STAT3 Y640F-expressing MEFs showed unperturbed RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling (as assessed by phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT1), suggesting that STAT3 does not directly alter these downstream KRAS effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNA-seq analysis showed that expression of STAT3 Y640F in MEFs resulted in the differential expression of approximately 290 genes (p&lt;0.05) compared to control cells. Gene ontology (GO) classification of biological processes showed an enrichment of pathways consistent with the role of STAT3 as a mediator of immunity and the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Biological processes attenuated by hyperactive STAT3 included differentiation and tissue development, and pathways mediated by TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oft et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David and Massagué, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore tested whether inactivation of the TGF-β pathway could inhibit KRAS-induced MEF transformation. Indeed, ablation of the TGF-β signaling components TGFBR2 or SMAD4 in KP MEFs using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing nearly eliminated foci formation and effects of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We provide evidence that the STAT3 transcription factor acts as a genetic modifier of EMT and KRAS dependency in a mouse model of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Our results demonstrate that neither persistent activation nor genetic ablation of STAT3 confers a selective growth advantage on tumor cells. Instead, STAT3 plays a crucial role in guiding the morphological and functional characteristics of tumors by inhibiting EMT and maintaining epithelial identity. Furthermore, our study uncovers an intriguing relationship between the SMAD4 and STAT3 transcription factors in PDAC. While the involvement of STAT3 in cancer has been predominantly associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laklai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), our data underscore the significance of epistasis as a key factor that underlies functional antagonism between STAT3 and TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer progression.</p><p>Oncogenic KRAS mutations are observed in approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers and less frequently in other cancer types. However, the role of KRAS in PDAC maintenance, once held to be nearly absolute, has shown limitations. A notable feature of KRAS mutant cancers, including those of the pancreas, colon, and lung, is that they can be either KRAS-dependent or KRAS-independent, based on the degree of their addiction to canonical KRAS signaling. The concept of KRAS dependency, originally introduced as a measure of oncogenic addiction following KRAS inactivation, has proven to be multifaceted. It integrates KRAS signaling outputs, with effector topologies, cooperating mutations, and environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ischenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brubaker et al., 2019</xref>). Cellular morphology (epithelial versus mesenchymal) appears to be one of the most noticeable manifestations of different degrees of KRAS dependency. Although SMAD4 classically promotes EMT and KRAS independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), approximately 50% of moderately to well-differentiated tumors in the TCGA cohort are, in fact, SMAD4 wild-type. This indicates that SMAD4 mutation alone is not sufficient to predispose cancer cells to a particular RAS phenotype. Our study emphasizes the mutual antagonism of SMAD4 and STAT3, and a fundamental role of STAT3 in the maintenance of epithelial cell identity. While SMAD4 wild-type tumors displayed features of EMT in the absence of STAT3, SMAD4 KO tumors displayed an epithelial phenotype only in the presence of STAT3. The results demonstrate that STAT3 and SMAD4 inversely contribute to oncogenic dependency. STAT3 sustains the KRAS-dependent phenotype and tumor aggressiveness, with the potential for improved efficacy of anti-RAS drugs, whereas SMAD4 promotes KRAS independence at the expense of enhanced therapy resistance. Therefore, the epistatic relationship between SMAD4 and STAT3 has implications for tumor aggressiveness, metastatic propensity, and therapeutic resistance.</p><p>Genes involved in cancer (~200 drivers validated to date) affect critical cellular processes, rendering them tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. The Cancer Dependency Map project sets out to model the genetic landscape of cancer in accordance with the oncogene addiction paradigm. By employing high throughput RNAi or CRISPR knockout screens across a multitude of cancer-derived cell lines, the goal is to broadly identify putative cellular dependencies for cancer therapy. While an important undertaking, not all cell lines align well with tumor samples in terms of mutations and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Warren et al., 2021</xref>). STAT3 exemplifies this problem, as efforts to understand its role of STAT3 in cancer have resulted in conflicting reports that show either a positive or negative role in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>).

Endogenous phosphorylation/activation of STAT3 appears able to function within a narrow operating range in multiple solid tumor types.</p><p>Cancers are complex biological systems exhibiting inexplicable levels of intractability and unpredictability. For instance, even when challenged with the same lethal anticancer drugs used in vitro, cancers show remarkable resistance in vivo. Further complicating the analysis, there exist KRAS mutant cell lines whose survival and growth are no longer dependent on continued KRAS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ischenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muzumdar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lentsch et al., 2019</xref>). This raises doubts regarding their eventual responsiveness to targeted anti-KRAS therapies. Here, we used genetic analyses to identify STAT3 as a relevant dependency in KRAS-driven cancer. While in vitro evidence indicates that STAT3 lacks classical driver properties, it nevertheless plays an essential role in cancer maintenance and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. This may explain the rarity of STAT3 GOF mutations in human cancers with mutant KRAS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Clonally-derived <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup> Tp53KO</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (KP MEFs) and pancreatic <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup> Tp53<sup>R172H</sup></italic> (KPC) cells were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ischenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>).

Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed 5 μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Expression analysis</title><p>Western blotting was performed using antibodies against AKT1 (4691), P-AKT1 pS473 (4060), CDH1 (3195), P-ERK1/2 (4370), SMAD4 (46535), P-STAT3 pY705 (9131), VIM (5741) (all from Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (05–157, Millipore), STAT3 (610190, BD) and TGFBR2 (sc-400, Santa Cruz). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 40 mM NaVO4, 0.1% SDS, and 1 x protease inhibitors (Roche). Western blots were imaged using Image Studio software (LI-COR). Total cellular RNA was isolated using PureLink RNA (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s specifications and phenol-extracted. Pancreatic tissues were incubated for 24 hr at 4 °C in ≥5 volumes of RNAlater solution (Thermo Fisher) to preserve RNA integrity. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics were performed by Novogene Corporation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.novogene.com">https://en.novogene.com</ext-link>). STAT3 and SMAD4 knockout signature scores (STAT3KO_UP, STAT3KO_DN, SMAD4KO_UP, SMAD4KO_DN) were computed as the average of RNA expression values (fpkm) of the top up- or down-regulated genes in KPC cell lines. EMT and mouse Ras Dependency Index (RDI) scores were calculated using defined gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ischenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Serresi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). For publicly available human datasets, RDI, KRAS_sig, RSK_sig, epithelial (EPI) and mesenchymal (MES) gene expression scores were calculated as the sum of RNA expression values (z-scores) using previously characterized gene modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test or Wilcoxon test, as appropriate for the dataset. ARRIVE guidelines were used in the study as appropriate. An FDR adjusted p-value (q-value) was calculated for multiple comparison correction. Individual mice and tumor cell lines were considered biological replicates. Statistical details for each experiment are denoted in the corresponding figures and figure legends. The micrographs (H&amp;E) represent at least three independent experiments. All data are presented as mean ± SD. In box and whisker plots, the middle line is plotted at the median, the upper and lower hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles, and the ends of the whisker are set at 1.5 x IQR above the third quartile and 1.5 x IQR below the first quartile (IQR, interquartile range or difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stony Brook University (IACUC 269685).

Specifically, SMAD4 deficient tumors (commonly observed in pancreatic cancer) are well differentiated in the presence of STAT3. Yet surprisingly, in the presence of SMAD4 in a STAT-3 deficient pancreatic cancer, the phenotype is poorly differentiated in the background of KRASGD12D. The evidence in the animal models supporting the authors' claims is solid, although including TCGA data and/or a larger number of patients would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to medical biologists working on pancreatic cancer and potentially the broader field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Strengths are the animal models and the lead author's expertise in STAT3 signaling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Weaknesses are the absence of correlation between the results from the animal studies and human pancreatic cancers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92559.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript explores mechanisms by which STAT3 may regulate KRAS mutant cancers.</p><p>In the first set of experiments, STAT3 GOF mutants diminished the transformation of p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing endogenous mutant KRAS(G12D) (KP MEFs) and this was dependent on direct transcriptional activation induced by phosphorylated STAT3. It appears that this is mediated via a reduction in TGFb signaling such that knockout of either TGFBR2 or SMAD4 can phenocopy the effects of STAT3 GOF mutants in KP MEFs.</p><p>In the next part of the paper, the authors used murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-derived cell lines bearing endogenous KRAS(G12D) and TP53(R172H) mutations (KPC) to determine the extent to which STAT3 may regulate KRAS dependency. They determined that KRAS and STAT3 KO both induced mesenchymal-like phenotypes and that TGFBR2 and SMAD4 KO induced epithelial phenotypes. The loss of STAT3 appeared to correlate with a KRAS-independent signature, and SMAD4/TGFBR2 KO could not induce epithelial phenotypes when STAT 3 was also knocked out.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting paper that highlights the complicated interactions between KRAS, STAT3, and TGF beta signaling. The authors use multiple models and attempt to link data to patient cohorts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While correlations are strong, the study would benefit from additional cause-and-effect type experiments. It would also be beneficial to better tie together the first and second parts of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92559.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>D'Amico</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stony Brook University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stony Brook</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kirillov</surname><given-names>Varvara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stony Brook University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stony Brook</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Petrenko</surname><given-names>Oleksi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stony Brook University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stony Brook</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reich</surname><given-names>Nancy C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stony Brook University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stony Brook</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...] Weaknesses are the absence of correlation between the results from the animal studies and human pancreatic cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to the importance of human pancreatic cancer studies. In a previous study (D’Amico et al. Genes &amp; Development 2018 doi: 10.1101/gad.311852.118), we evaluated the expression of STAT3 in human pancreatic tissue microarrays and data from the Human Protein Atlas. Mutations in Stat3 are infrequent in human pancreatic cancers, however there is a trend of decreased STAT3 activity in poorly differentiated carcinomas.</p><p>In the current study, STAT3 and SMAD4 gene signature scores (computed from KO KPC cells) were aligned with human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples from the TCGA cohort, and statistical analyses supported the selective antagonism of STAT3 and SMAD4 (Fig 4D, Fig 4E).</p><p>The complex process of EMT is difficult to characterize rigorously in human cancers.

We previously investigated the development of mutant KRAS knockout tumors (Ischenko et al. Nature Communications 2021 doi:10.1038/s41467-021-21736) to find loss of KRAS promotes EMT, similar to loss of STAT3. Additional experiments are underway but are outside the scope of the current study.</p><p>The first part of the paper is mechanistic and used KRAS-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts to perform in vitro studies with foci formation. The cell-based foci formation assay has been shown to best evaluate malignant transformation and oncogenic potential. In the second part we transitioned to epithelial cells and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas to combine mechanistic relationships with genetic models.</p></body></sub-article></article>
