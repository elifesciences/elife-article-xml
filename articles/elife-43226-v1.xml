invade the skin. This skin-nerve sensory system demands a quantitative model that spans the application of mechanical loads to channel activation. Unlike prior models of the dynamic responses of touch receptor neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (Eastwood et al., 2015), which substituted a single effective channel for the ensemble along the TRNs, this study integrates body mechanics and the spatial recruitment of the various channels. We demonstrate that this model captures mechanical properties of the worm’s body and accurately reproduces neural responses to simple stimuli. It also captures responses to complex stimuli featuring non-trivial spatial patterns, like extended or multiple contacts that could not be addressed otherwise. We illustrate the importance of these effects with new experiments revealing that skin-neuron composites respond to pre-indentation with increased currents rather than adapting to persistent stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>touch sensation</kwd><kwd>tissue mechanics</kwd><kwd>somatosensory neurons response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-047715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Miriam B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-NS-105092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>Miriam B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EB-006745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pruitt</surname><given-names>Beth L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31-NS-093825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katta</surname><given-names>Samata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nonlinear elasticity of skin tissues and somatosensory neural responses are combined to predict and test <italic>C. elegans</italic> processing of touch stimuli and modifications due to changes in the body mechanics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sense of touch is a prime example of mechanotransduction in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>) that culminates in the activation of mechanically-gated ion channels arrayed along sensory dendrites. These dendrites are not isolated from the tissues they innervate, nor are the relevant ion channels isolated from the extracellular matrix, plasma membrane, or the underlying cytoskeleton. In mammals, slowly-adapting mechanoreceptors depend on their association with keratinocyte-related Merkel cells for their response dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the response dynamics of rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors are sensitive to their association with Pacininan corpuscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loewenstein and Mendelson, 1965</xref>). Extracellular links are present in the sensory neurons innervating hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Ginty, 2014</xref>) and in dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). Such protein tethers are also thought to be essential for mechanotransduction by vertebrate hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakaguchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fettiplace, 2017</xref>). The NompC channels that mediate mechanosensation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are directly linked to microtubules and, in campaniform receptors, this intracellular protein tether is essential for mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, independent of their specific anatomy or mechanosensory function, the mechanically-gated ion channels that decorate sensory dendrites are intimately connected to surrounding tissues.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Touch Receptor Neurons (TRNs) are embedded in the skin and attached to a specialized extracellular matrix, and this structure is required for the proper distribution of MEC-4-dependent Mechano-electrical Transduction (MeT) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lumpkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emtage et al., 2004</xref>). The TRNs and the MEC-4 channels enable these roundworms to evade predatory fungi that trap nematodes in a noose-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maguire et al., 2011</xref>). This escape behavior can also be elicited manually by drawing an eyebrow hair across the animals body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalfie, 2014</xref>) or using mechanical stimulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petzold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazzochette et al., 2018</xref>). These observations suggest that laboratory stimuli are sufficiently good replicas of natural stimuli that they elicit the same behaviors. Forces in the nano- to micro-Newton range are sufficient to elicit this escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petzold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazzochette et al., 2018</xref>) in wild-type animals. Sensitivity also depends on body stiffness such that larger forces are needed to trigger escape behaviors in stiffer animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petzold et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, touch sensitivity is a combined property of the skin-nerve tissue systems.</p><p>Delivering a touch by pushing a flexible probe against the worms body activates MEC-4-containing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>), connecting touch stimulation directly to activation of a specific ion channel in living animals. This process of sensory mechanotransduction depends more on the depth of body indentation than it does on the force applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>), reinforcing the importance of tissue mechanics in touch sensation. As found for the dendrites innervating Pacininan corpuscles, the TRNs depolarize in response to the application and removal of a simple touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>). In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>), we introduced a simplified, but quantitative description of sensory mechanotransduction that recapitulated this on/off response dynamic. This initial model introduced a hypothetical elastic tether connected to the channel that would be stretched in response to stimulus onset, relax during continued stimulation, and stretch in the opposite direction following stimulus offset. It was inspired by the tip-link model for auditory hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hudspeth, 2014</xref>), but differs from this classical model in that it posits a tangential, rather than vertical, stretching of a tether. The picture emerging from this model replaces the hinged trapdoor of hair cell mechanotransduction with a sliding trapdoor. The tangential motion emerges from the mechanics of thin shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landau et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ventsel and Krauthammer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audoly and Pomeau, 2011</xref>) and applies to the worm's body and its TRNs based on their anatomical position within the animal's skin (outer shell).</p><p>While appealing in its simplicity, the model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al. (2015)</xref> is incomplete: we replaced the ensemble of channels known to be distributed along TRN dendrites by a single effective channel. This simplification is similar in spirit to a mean-field approximation in physics and shares its utility for insight as well as its theoretical and predictive limitations. An important theoretical limitation was the neglect of the nonlinear mechanics of the worm’s body. Additionally, the response to variations in contact areas or stimulus timing are not well described in this simplified model. The main object of the present study is to introduce a comprehensive and quantitative description linking focal mechanical stimuli to activation of single mechanically-gated ion channels, taking into account nonlinear mechanics and the spatial distribution of mechanically-gated ion channels. We evaluate the current model against prior experimental data, generating new insight into the contribution of internal hydrostatic pressure to touch sensitivity and as a major source of variation in experimental data. Additionally, we show that pre-indentation increases the response to subsequent indentation steps and use the model to reveal that this unexpected finding can be explained by the spatial distribution of tissue deformation and MeT channels. The approach underlying the present model and its evaluation by comparing simulated and experimental data could be adapted to other mechanosensory neurons that differ in their anatomy, their encapsulating tissues, and the distribution of MeT channels within the dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To improve understanding of mechanosensory transduction during touch at the systems level, we develop a comprehensive and quantitative description of how a focal mechanical stimulus or touch activates single MeT channels in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons, taking their spatial distribution into account.

The outer shell includes the cuticle, skin (hypodermis), excretory system, neurons and body wall muscles, and the inner shell is formed by the pharynx, intestine and gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>).

This simple body plan has inspired models of its mechanics consisting of a cylindrical outer shell and internal pressure, which is conferred by the combined effects of internal organs and the pseudocoelom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Small punctures in the cuticle and skin are thought to decrease, but not eliminate internal pressure. Indeed, this maneuver has been demonstrated to decrease stiffness inferred from force-indentation curves derived from experiments using self-sensing microcantilevers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>).

The pressure <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is understood to be the difference between the internal and the external atmospheric pressure. To simplify the following dimensional analysis, we shall neglect the external atmospheric pressure, which has only minor effects for our thin cylindrical shells (see Appendices 2 and 3). Elastic parameters are effective quantities that subsume different contributions in the inner and outer tube. Previous estimates of those parameters are discussed in the Section on Results for experimental validations. Boundary conditions generated by the pressure <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the external forces are in the next Section. Finally, Appendix 4 discusses the reduction of the 3D <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> to the 2D thin-shell limit.</p><p>The nonlinear structure of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> hampers analytical approaches, which pushed us to apply numerical finite-element methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnett, 1985</xref> for an introduction). Numerical simulations of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref> were performed by the open-source program <italic>code-aster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Électricité de France, 2001</xref>). An hexahedral element with eight standard nodes (HEXA8) was used in combination with a mesh sensitivity analysis to verify that results are minimally sensitive to the element size. The numerical procedure was benchmarked and tested by comparing its results to known elasticity problems. In particular, Appendix 5 reports on the comparison with the deformation field and the force-indentation relation produced in small indentations of cylindrical shells, where an analytical solution is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morley, 1960</xref>), as well as large indentations of pressurized spherical shells, where a simplified equation was derived in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vella et al. (2012a)</xref>. In all cases, agreement was verified.</p><p>For the internal pressure <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, active readjustments of the internal pressure are possible and could <italic>a priori</italic> be accommodated in our approach. Here, we shall make the simplest working hypothesis that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> holds constant when the stimulus is exerted onto the body of the worm. Its justification is empirical, that is we argue that the simplest option is sufficient based on results reported below.</p><p>As for boundary conditions, neurophysiology experiments have worms glued onto a plate and limited in the vertical displacement of their body’s lower half (see Materials and methods). Since a mathematical formulation is not obvious (and elasticity has long-range effects), we tested different boundary conditions and present two of them for comparison (see Appendix 6). For the first, the lower half of the body is vertically rigid, that is the upper half of the cylinder in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is free to move, while the lower one is constrained to move only parallel to the plane onto which the worm is glued. For the second boundary condition, the lower half is fixed, that is allowed to move neither vertically nor laterally. Results presented in the main text are obtained with the latter condition. As for the two ends of the cylinder, we present results with vanishing lateral forces; Appendix 7 discusses the effects of plugs at the ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single MeT channel gating and its relationship to total mechanoreceptor currents</title><p>The TRN dendrites are decorated by MeT channels along their entire length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emtage et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cueva et al., 2007</xref>). We propose that these channels are activated by the deformations described above. Because the touch-induced deformation and the channels are spatially distributed, we developed an approach that accounts for the activation of a single MeT channel by local deformation and subsequently computes their summation based on the spatial distribution of both the deformation and the channels. This model departs from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>) by considering the contribution of individual channels to the total current and taking into explicit consideration the spatial features of the activation process.</p><p>The mechanism in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al.

Because of the onset-offset symmetry of the touch response, the response to sinusoidal stimuli oscillates at twice the input frequency. At high frequencies, inertia in the switch between open and closed states of the channels contributes to the reduced amplitude of the oscillations. The response to ramps is intuitive: the slower the indentation, the smaller the response because of adaptation.

The latter restrictions being speculative at this stage, we shall focus on the unrestricted model; we only note that tangential restrictions admit plausible molecular mechanisms, for example. by microtubules that run along TRNs, are attached to the neural membrane through filaments and are known to impact touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bounoutas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Additional insight is gained by delivering stimuli alternative to the classical profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, namely pre-indented stimuli in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Panel A contrasts standard and pre-indented steps, that is where an initial step (5 μm in our data) is delivered. The neural response to two steps of equal amplitude, one pre-indented and the other not, is substantially stronger for the former. That is surprising at first, since the amplitude of the steps is identical, and enough time between the successive half steps was left for adaptation. The explanation was obtained by using our model: it is indeed the case that channels adapt and return to their rest state; however, the tissue is deformed by pre-indentation, which leads to a more extended region of stimulation and more channels activated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. The previous mean-field model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al.

The resulting predictions reproduce experimental trends, highlighting the importance of the coupling between mechanics and channel activation that constitutes the main focus of our paper.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Variance in residual internal pressure following dissection accounts for variation in responses among individual worms</title><p>The full model not only allows us to predict neural responses to complex stimuli, but also to delve further into how body mechanics can explain the variation in experimental responses. The dissection procedure required for recording from TRNs in vivo necessarily alters body mechanics: a small incision allows some portion of the tubular internal organs (intestine and gonads) to be released outside the animal. The cuticle is largely re-sealed by the remaining internal pressure pushing large organs over the hole, and a second incision is then made to release the TRN cell body without other organs. This standard procedure results in ‘soft’ worms with varying fractions of their internal organs released. A modified dissection also used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al.

The point is that the curves differ much less when displacement is clamped, rather than force. That is translated into predictions for currents as follows. We assume that the dissection procedure does not affect the channels and calculate their respective currents as described previously. Specifically, we fix the distribution of the channels, change <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf133"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to the value corresponding to soft or stiff worms, and compute the neural response to force or displacement-clamped stimuli. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: responses for force-clamped stimuli widely differ for soft and stiff animals, yet they are similar for displacement-clamped stimuli. In sum, empirical observations reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al. (2015)</xref> are explained by the mechanics of the nematode and its coupling to neural activation.</p><p>Finally, we address the variability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> among soft worms, which we tentatively related to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf134"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> varying over three orders of magnitude. For further support, we tested whether the observed variability could indeed be reproduced by keeping all parameters fixed but <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf135"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> show that the peak current increases systematically with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf136"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for displacement-clamp and has the opposite behavior for force-clamped stimuli. The predicted change is larger in the former case, which is consistent with differences between soft and stiff worms. The model predictions are compared with an experimental dataset of 21 worms obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al. (2015)</xref>.

Indeed, for the experimental value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2008</xref>) of the single-channel current <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf241"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.6</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>pA, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ13">Equation (13)</xref> underestimates the mean current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). More generally, we can optimize parameters and calculate the errors in the fits of the experimental datasets: the probability distribution for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ13">Equation (13)</xref> is broader and shifted to higher errors with respect to the isotropic model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Similar conclusions hold if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf242"><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is allowed to vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the analysis of available experimental data favors symmetric channels, but is not fully conclusive. New data will be needed, which is our motivation to describe hereafter two possible experiments.</p><p>A first approach relies on the noise level of currents. The intuition is that anisotropy reduces (for a given density of channels) the number of active channels along the TRN, and thereby leads to more noise. Specifically, the number of active channels could be inferred (Appendix 10 includes a generalization of the noise analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Hagan et al., 2005</xref> to non-equally-stimulated channels) and compared to the number of channels measured by fluorescent tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cueva et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> presents the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the TRN current vs the stimulus strength, calculated over repetitions of a given stimulus. Differences in CVs are poised to permit discrimination and the approach described in Appendix 10 estimates that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf243"><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> trials suffice for their reliable measurement.</p><p>A second alternative exploits the architecture of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons: TRNs extend longitudinally for about half of the nematode’s length, leaving a region around its center that is relatively insensitive to touch (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazzochette et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> indicates the range over which effects of indentation are felt by individual channels; panel F shows the differences between microscopic models as the indenting bead slides along the longitudinal direction. An additional relevant statistic is the asymmetry between on- and off-currents. The logic is that, as the number of stimulated channels decreases, asymmetries should become more substantial if the channels are not isotropic, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>. An appealing possibility is the stimulation of the worm in its center (negative coordinates in panels F,G). There, the number of activated channels is small, which could indeed bring microscopic insight.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present a quantitative description of the response of <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons to simple and complex mechanical cues. This work combines modeling and simulations of how touch deforms the skin and its embedded TRNs with a detailed model of the activation of single MeT channels, linking skin indentation to neuronal strain and MeT activation. This model explains several facets of the coupling between tissue mechanics and neural responses that were not previously understood.</p><p>Our model explains several aspects of the coupling between mechanics and neural responses. First, the model replicates experimental observed currents evoked by a wide range of indentation profiles. The prior model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>) relied on a mean-field approximation of channel activation, which could not properly account for the fact that pre-indentation increases the number of channels that contribute to the total current. Second, the model explains how the mechanics of skin deformation contribute to the empirical observation previously made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastwood et al. (2015)</xref> that neural responses are variable for force-clamped stimulation but less so for displacement clamp. It shows that variation in internal pressure resulting from the dissection procedure is a major source of variability in the neural responses of individual nematodes. Third, the model predicts that the neural response should increase with the size of the indenter in a manner dependent on internal pressure. Finally, the variation in deformation around the circumference of the worm suggests that the angular position of the TRN with respect to the indentation bead affects the response. These findings can help design future experiments to include measurements of these important parameters.</p><p>Our analysis also provides insight on two points related to the mechanics of the worm and the underlying biology. These findings reconcile conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2015</xref>) on mechanical properties in wild type and mutants. Specifically, we showed that the mechanical response of the nematode is captured by an elastic cylindrical thin shell in a pressure-dominated regime. The theory makes testable predictions on the dependence of the force-indentation relation on the indenter size, as well as the effects of mutations in the cuticle on the bulk modulus. An experimental verification of those predictions would further support the major role of internal pressure in <italic>C. elegans</italic> body mechanics. The fact that our model yields best results for boundary conditions with no force at the two ends of the cylinder, suggests that the body of the nematode might relax longitudinal components of the stress. One possible mechanism is through the annular structure of the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>), which may be effectively described as a shell with anisotropic Young’s moduli. This relaxation of longitudinal stresses could facilitate the bending motions required for nematode motility.</p><p>We have shown how neural responses have similar amplitude when the stimulus is applied or released, which addresses the long-standing puzzle of the onset-offset symmetry. The picture emerging from our work is that the most likely gating model involves displacement tangential to the neuronal membrane. This insight can guide the search for the biophysical basis of in vivo activation of MeT channels and differs fundamentally from other models that involve orthogonal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hudspeth, 2014</xref>). At the microscopic level, we inquired whether the symmetry holds for individual channels or at the population level only (individual channels are asymmetric yet their preferential directions are randomly distributed and their cumulative effect is again symmetric, as suggested for <italic>Drosophila</italic> sound receiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>]). We showed, however, that a model with symmetric channels gives a better description of existing data, hinting at symmetry for single channels. Definitive evidence could be obtained by the experiments that we suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and G</xref>, with the noise levels better controlled and the stimulation point moved along the longitudinal axis so as to assay a variable number of channels. The ideal experiment would be to precisely assay the neural response to stimuli in the central dead-zone of the body, where few channels are likely to be directly stimulated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazzochette et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In our current description, we assumed that the material composing the shell is purely elastic and the dependencies on frequency result from the gating of the channels. While this procedure successfully captures many experimental observations, it is known that tissues do feature viscous effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Backholm et al., 2013</xref>). Future developments will address viscoelastic effects, which should be relevant to the understanding of touch sensation at high frequencies.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that our modeling ultimately relies on the fact that touch receptor neurons are close to the surface of the skin’s thin layers. This leads to physical effects peculiar to thin shells, namely the importance of tangential forces, which are at the basis of the gating mechanism discussed here. Since the above features are common in touch sensation, we expect results and methods that we developed to be widely relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We incorporated most of our modeling methods in Results and Discussion.

To image the worms, we used a high-magnification camera (Orca-R2, Hamamatsu) on an inverted microscope (Leica) with an EGFP filter set and a high-numerical aperture 63x oil immersion lens, to yield a shallow depth of field ≈0.1 µm for optical sectioning. When glass beads were trapped between the cuticle of the animal and the coverslip, we were able to capture fluorescence images of COL-19::GFP in the cuticle at &gt;10 different focal planes. At each focal plane, we measured the radius of the bead and the radius of the cuticle deformation (by identifying where the cuticle was in focus).

The stack was biased with a starting offset of 3–4 μm, and the largest displacement used was 3–4 μm less than the upper limit of the stack’s travel distance, ensuring that stack motion was linear.

rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2015</xref>). This Appendix will explore the consequences of the simplest possible assumptions on the effects of those mutations, obtain predictions for our mechanical model, and compare them to experiments.</p><p>We shall describe the effects of mutations in the cuticle through variations in the stretching stiffness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf432"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is the only parameter related to the thin external layers (see Appendix 4). We assume that mutations do not affect the internal pressure of the nematode. The argument in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al. (2007)</xref> is that the genes involved, for example <italic>dpy-5</italic> and <italic>lon-2</italic>, do not affect transport proteins likely to regulate osmotic pressure. It is possible, though, that mutations in the cuticle affect the development of the nematode, hence its body structure and the internal pressure. To constructively advance the issue, we assume that that does not happen and explore consequences.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1A</xref> shows the dependence of geometrical properties on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf433"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> : the radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf434"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of the pressurized cylinder decreases, whilst its length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf435"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> increases with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf436"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Finally, the stiffness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf439"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> enters the response to indentation experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1B</xref> shows the ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf440"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, that is the force <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf441"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> needed to reach an indentation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf442"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, vs <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf443"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (we verified that results do not depend on the choice of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf444"><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>). The increase with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf445"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is due to two contributions that affect the change in volume via the deformation field. First, if the external radius of the shell is kept constant, the deformation field is wider (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1B</xref>). Second, the radius of the shell becomes smaller as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf446"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> increases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1A</xref>) which leads to a larger deformation field (data not shown).</p><p>The parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf447"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is not measured experimentally, which forces us to use <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf448"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> as a proxy. In this formulation, the model predicts that mutations in the cuticle which increase <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf449"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> will decrease <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf450"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, stiffness and bulk modulus. These features are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Quantitatively, we observe that : (i) the length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf451"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of the mutants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al. (2007)</xref> is systematically larger than our predictions; (ii) the radius of <italic>lon</italic>-2 mutants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al. (2007)</xref>, which is about 25% smaller than the wild type, cannot be obtained in our simulations, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1C</xref>. (i) may be due to the likely non-isotropy of the Young’s modulus generated by the annular structure of the external layers. That is expected to make the stiffness smaller in the longitudinal than the orthogonal direction. (ii) is due to the fact that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf452"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> cannot be smaller than the value for the unpressurized shell, which is only 20% smaller than the wild type. Since relative changes in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf453"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> grow with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf454"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, it is likely that uncertainties on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf455"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are due to fluctuations in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf456"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> among worms (see main text). As already mentioned above, both <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf457"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf458"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> could also be affected by our neglecting developmental effects.</p><p>We finally compare in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app11fig1">Appendix 11—figure 1C-D</xref> our predictions to experimental data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al.

The agreement is notable and leads to the prediction that the bulk modulus in <italic>lon</italic>-2 mutants should significantly deviate from the wild type. This differs from the conclusion that the bulk modulus is not affected by the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2015</xref>), which was based on mutants other than <italic>lon</italic>-2.</p><fig id="app11fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43226.036</object-id><label>Appendix 11—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the mechanics caused by mutations of proteins in the cuticle.</title><p>Mutations are modeled via changes of the stretching stiffness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf459"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> with respect to the wild type <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf460"><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

This simplification neglected the spatially-varying nature of the deformation profiles along the body of the worm and the recruitment of channels known to be distributed along the neuron. Similarly to a mean-field approximation in physics, the simplification provided useful insight but had crucial limitations, both theoretical and predictive. Theoretical limitations were major, as the nonlinear mechanics of the body of the worm was not accounted. For predictive purposes, replacing the number of recruited channels by an effective factor in the strength of a single channel works well for relatively simple profiles of stimulation but it is substantially limiting for predicting responses to realistic stimuli. In particular, stimuli with large or divided contact areas, or stimuli with varying timescales, would not be well described.</p><p>The current manuscript fills the above major gaps and illustrates previous limitations by discussing pre-indentation experiments that were not previously reported. New data reveal that the combination of skin and neurons responds to pre-indentation with increased currents rather than fully adapting to persistent stimulation. The effect is entirely due to the spatial effects dealt with in this paper, and could not be captured by previous modeling or by classical models of other mechanosensory cells such as vertebrate hair cells, as now made explicit in Figure 4. These experiments provide a simple, yet striking illustration of the general point brought by this paper that touch sensation cannot be fully understood without properly accounting for the dynamics of skin deformations that lead to the activation of multiple ion channels along the neurons. Furthermore, the nonlinear mechanics of the body of the worm developed here allowed us to resolve issues in the literature on disparately inconsistent values of elastic parameters, elastic regimes of worm’s body, and the role of mutations in proteins composing the cuticle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have replaced title, Abstract and substantially rewritten the Introduction and the Discussion. We have taken into account all the other comments by reviewer 2.</p><p>The title of the manuscript is rather non-specific and differs only slightly from that of a previous paper by some of the authors, reinforcing the impression that the ideas presented here are not really new.</p></disp-quote><p>Title and Abstract have been replaced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “C. elegans body mechanics”: &quot;the latter [tube] is formed by pharynx, intestine, and gonad&quot; is very inaccurate. While the pharynx and intestine form a single tube, the gonad is completely distinct from the digestive tract and moreover does not resemble a single tube, being doubled over on both ends.</p><p>– Subsection “C. elegans body mechanics”: What exactly is meant by an &quot;effective description&quot;?

Words like &quot;modest&quot; and &quot;substantial&quot; are vague and need to be clarified quantitatively.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a reference to Appendix A, where quantification was provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “The mechanical elastic model”, fifth paragraph: The hypothesis of constant internal pressure during deformation is poorly supported. Can the authors estimate how much change in pressure would occur given the deformations and worm mechanical properties? This would provide a firmer basis for this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed below, the internal pressure arises from the dynamics and effects of internal organs contained within the stiff cuticle. Modeling these effects requires an additional knowledge of the contribution of each tissue. Such a model would be quite independent of the current model and would be a significant undertaking in and of itself. We take this assumption as a working hypothesis and its justification is empirical. The text has been made more explicit on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “The opening/closing dynamics of channels”: &quot;…to reduce free parameters, its free energy is assumed intermediate between the closed and open state…&quot; Reduction of free parameters is a not a sound basis for assuming a specific value for a parameter. The authors should provide some basis for this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of more specific information, Occam’s razor seems a sound and well-established way of proceeding. Its empirical consistency is provided by comparison with experimental results. We have reformulated the statement and justification in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Experimental validation of the mechanical model”, first paragraph: One can write that the mutation alters the cuticle, or the cuticle is altered in this mutant, but it's not correct that the mutant alters the cuticle.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we apologize for the elision between genotype and phenotype. We have revised the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Experimental validation of the mechanical model”, fifth paragraph: 40kPa is not really &quot;consistent with&quot; a range 2-30 kPa.

We have clarified this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Experimental validation of the mechanical model”, eleventh paragraph: &quot;Quantitative aspects are also well captured by our predictions&quot;. What exactly does the capture of aspects by predictions mean? The authors should be as specific as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised to “Simulations also capture the empirical relationship between speed and current amplitude (Figure 3C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Explaining the effect of dissection protocols on neural responses”, second paragraph: Why does the internal pressure not go to zero when the worm is punctured?</p></disp-quote><p>Contrary to molecules in a gas-filled balloon, the tubular internal organs (intestines and gonad) of a worm are much larger than the opening created by a puncturing. Some portion of the organs are released outside the animal, in a manner similar to the intestinal inversion seen in <italic>him-4</italic> mutants, but the majority of them cannot pass through the small incision. The majority of organs are then pushed up against the opening, and largely seals the hole. The internal pressure defined in the model is a combination of hydrostatic pressure retained by the partial seal and the resistance to compression due to the remaining organs. Although individual dissections vary in the fraction of the organs that escape the body cavity (which is consistent with the large variability discussed in our paper), we observe that, following the initial dissection, there is still more than enough pressure to push neuronal cell bodies out through a second, very small incision made in the cuticle. A detailed discussion of these points is now included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Shell bending is weak compared to stretching; stiffness is dominated by internal pressure”: &quot;The functions… are empirically extracted from simulations as:&quot; The authors need to show much more detail here. If this is an empirical fit to the simulations, we need to see the results to assess the goodness of fit.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following information:</p><p>“The above functions 𝒢<sub>3</sub> and 𝒢<sub>1</sub> are determined as follows. We computed numerically the force indentation relation of cylinders of different radius (R=25, 40, and 50μm) to stimulations produced by beads of different size (<italic>R<sub>b</sub></italic> from 3 to 10μm); results of the simulations are then used to fit coefficients of the Taylor expansions of 𝒢<sub>1</sub>(<italic>x</italic>) and 𝒢<sub>3</sub>(<italic>x</italic>).

Small compared to what?</p></disp-quote><p>Small compared to the rest of the components of the tensor, namely the tangential ones. This is now included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Neural response at the single channel level: isotropic vs. directional models”, last two paragraphs: This section on potential future experiments would be much stronger if the authors could make specific, testable predictions for each experiment based on the model.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 9D was meant to provide a testable prediction but the reviewer’s response made us realize that this was not quite clear so we modified the text to be more specific and explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 9C: How is mean error defined and why is it very close to 1 over nearly its entire range? What are the units of measurement?</p></disp-quote><p>There was an error in the y-label, which has now been corrected. Thanks for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;Our model explains several aspects of the coupling between mechanics and neural responses&quot; and proceed to list 5 points (comments below).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these detailed critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) &quot;First, we capture the experimental current… in response to… indentation profiles…&quot; If &quot;capture&quot; means &quot;model&quot;, this sentence is just a recapitulation of the goals of the work. If it means something else, the authors should clarify.</p><p>2) &quot;…the model explains the.… observation that neural responses are similar for displacement-clamped stimulations…&quot; As explained in Eastwood et al., this finding is a direct consequence of a mechanosensitive channel opening dependent on strain. Therefore this result is an assumption in this model, not a result of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously observed variations in response to steps of fixed indentation or force across worms, with responses being more similar if plotted against indentation than force. Here, we showed that this empirical observation can be explained in terms of the effects of internal pressure on local strain. This result requires a quantitative understanding of how body mechanics affects stimuli on the channels and, as shown in Figure 5B, the spatial component of the body deformation plays a key role and the effect would not be captured by the mean-field approach of Eastwood et al., where the body mechanics and effects of deformation profile are not included in the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;shows that internal pressure… is the major source of variability among different animals&quot;. The evidence provided for this is suggestive at best. Why should there be any internal pressure difference at all in a punctured animal?</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above for more detail. In brief, a pressure difference remains following the dissection procedure because only a subset of internal organs are everted during dissection through the small incisions we make in the cuticle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;the model predicts how the neural response should change with the size of the indenter&quot; and;</p><p>5) &quot;…the variation of deformation evidences… a dependence on the angular position of the TRN…&quot; These are predictions, not explanations.</p><p>– Discussion section: &quot;…bending, an ingredient necessary for swimming&quot;. Considering that all locomotion in C. elegans occurs by bending the body, it is odd that swimming in particular is singled out here.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion section has been modified to accommodate the reviewer’s remarks and to better highlight the novelty of our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
