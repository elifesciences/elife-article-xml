We created a dynamic transmission model to project TB incidence, TB mortality, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB prevalence, and incremental costs over 5 years after scale-up of nine alternative diagnostic strategies. A corresponding web-based interface allows users to specify local costs and epidemiology. In settings with little capacity for up-front investment, same-day microscopy had the greatest impact on TB incidence and became cost-saving within 5 years if delivered at $10/test. With greater initial investment, population-level scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF or microcolony-based culture often averted 10 times more TB cases than narrowly-targeted strategies, at minimal incremental long-term cost. Xpert for smear-positive TB had reasonable impact on MDR-TB incidence, but at substantial price and little impact on overall TB incidence and mortality. This user-friendly modeling framework improves decision-makers' ability to evaluate the local impact of TB diagnostic strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02565.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02565.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease caused predominantly by the microorganism <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Although the number of deaths from tuberculosis has been falling in recent years, the disease still kills more than 1 million people every year, mainly in developing countries. Tuberculosis can be treated with antibiotics, but the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to existing drugs is threatening efforts to eradicate the disease.</p><p>Preventing the spread of tuberculosis is heavily dependent on accurate diagnosis of individuals with the disease. This is challenging because the initial symptoms are often mild, usually just a cough, which means that someone can spread the disease to many others over a period of several months before the symptoms become worse—fever, night sweats, and weight loss—and they realize that they are sick. Multiple diagnostic strategies are available, from the relatively low-tech—examining sputum samples under a microscope to detect tuberculosis bacteria—to more sophisticated tests that can detect bacterial DNA and determine whether the bacteria are drug-resistant in less than 2 hr.</p><p>Choosing which diagnostic strategy to adopt can be challenging because the optimal solution in a region will depend on the specific local conditions. To overcome this problem, Dowdy et al. have developed a computer program that enables decision-makers to input four key parameters that describe the tuberculosis situation in their region, and to obtain 5-year projections of the rate of new infections, mortality, and total costs likely to result from adopting any of nine different diagnostic strategies.</p><p>The four parameters are the number of new cases of tuberculosis each year (incidence), the proportion of new cases that are multi-drug resistant, the proportion of the adult population that has HIV, and the local costs of various diagnostic techniques and treatments. Since the entire computer program is written in a freely available open-source programming language (Python), any user can tweak these parameters to provide a more precise fit to their own region. Alternatively, the standard version of the program can be run directly from a website without any need to interact with computer code.</p><p>This model is the first to enable local decision-makers to evaluate the impact of different diagnostic strategies for tuberculosis under the conditions specific to their region. The model predicts, for example, that in areas where there is little money available for up-front investment, same-day microscopy analysis of sputum samples and starting patients on treatment is the most cost-effective strategy for reducing the rate of new infections. Given the wide variation in conditions within even small geographical areas, this more flexible approach should lead to the more efficient use of resources and may, ultimately, help to reduce the spread of tuberculosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02565.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02565.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>diagnostic techniques and procedures</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>infectious disease transmission</kwd><kwd>economic models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI101152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dowdy</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 271997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dowdy</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A freely available computer program that takes into account specific local conditions enables users to predict the impact of adopting different diagnostic strategies on the spread of tuberculosis in their region.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infectious disease transmission models are important tools for translating the best current knowledge of the natural history and epidemiology of infectious diseases into projections of epidemiological impact (e.g., incidence, mortality) and costs under alternative strategies for disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garnett et al., 2011</xref>). Currently, most published transmission models are either loosely calibrated to reflect global/regional outcomes or more tightly fit to specific epidemiological settings; in either case, model results may be difficult for local decision-makers in the majority of public health settings to utilize. Simplified models designed for in-country use by decision-makers, most notably the Spectrum suite of models supported by the Futures Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stover et al., 2010</xref>), have been used to inform decision-making in the fields of reproductive health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stover, 2004</xref>). Estimates from the Spectrum models are now routinely incorporated into official global and country-level estimates of HIV disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2010</xref>) and intervention impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farnham et al., 2013</xref>). Other simplified models are readily available for impact projections related to non-infectious diseases, where transmission assumptions are less important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz Brown et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). However, to date, simple, user-friendly transmission models have not been widely used for decision-making related to many infectious diseases other than HIV. Diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) is an example of a public health intervention for which transmission models may provide guidance on both global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dowdy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2009</xref>) and country-specific levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menzies et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, an unprecedented number of new diagnostic strategies for active TB are now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), including same-day microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>), microcolony-based culture techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leung et al., 2012</xref>) such as the microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility (MODS) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore et al., 2006</xref>), line-probe assays for drug susceptibility testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bwanga et al., 2009</xref>), and Xpert MTB/RIF (‘Xpert’), a molecular assay capable of providing results (including rifampin resistance) in 90 min with minimal human resource requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehme et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2011</xref>). TB program decision-makers must repeatedly determine when to invest in scaling up a novel diagnostic test, which test(s) to promote, and whether the implementation strategy should differ by epidemiological situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cobelens et al., 2012</xref>). Without transmission models to provide locally relevant estimates of cost and impact under alternative implementation strategies, such decisions will be made without systematically considering the implications of available scientific evidence.</p><p>To aid in this decision-making process, we created a flexible, simple modeling tool that allows non-expert users to define their local situation according to three key epidemiological parameters (TB incidence, proportion of new TB cases that are multidrug-resistant [MDR], and adult human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] prevalence) and local unit costs of TB diagnosis and treatment. This tool then incorporates those estimates into a combined decision analysis-transmission framework to generate 5-year projections of TB incidence, mortality, and control costs for nine diagnostic strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>). These strategies are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>‘Baseline’: Sputum smear microscopy for each diagnostic attempt, with liquid-media TB culture only to evaluate smear-positive cases with a history of previous TB treatment for drug resistance. (Cultures in all scenarios trigger drug-susceptibility testing if positive.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘TB culture if previously treated’: Sputum smear microscopy used for patients without a history of TB treatment; smear plus liquid-media culture used to diagnose TB in any previously treated individual with symptoms (regardless of smear status).</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Xpert if HIV-positive’: Xpert MTB/RIF for HIV-infected patients only, with a positive test for rifampin resistance triggering treatment for MDR-TB. Xpert is assumed to be deployed at the district level, such that results cannot generally be provided during the same clinical encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawn et al., 2012</xref>). This strategy is conceived as a ‘best-case’ scenario for HIV-targeted TB testing: if individuals unaware of their HIV status are not tested with Xpert, this strategy will overestimate effectiveness, and if those unaware of their status are tested, it will underestimate costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Xpert if Smear-Positive’: Xpert MTB/RIF for smear-positive patients only (i.e., for rapid DST), with a positive test for rifampin resistance triggering treatment for MDR-TB.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Xpert for All’: Xpert MTB/RIF for all patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Xpert with Culture DST Confirmation’: Xpert MTB/RIF for all patients, but treatment for MDR-TB only initiated if rifampin resistance is confirmed by culture.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘MODS/TLA’: Sputum smear, plus microcolony-based TB culture (e.g., MODS or thin-layer agar, TLA) for all patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Same-Day Microscopy’: Double the per-test cost of sputum smear microscopy, in exchange for the ability to provide results to patients in the same clinical encounter (e.g., with peripheral, unbatched reading of sputum smears).</p></list-item><list-item><p>‘Same-Day Xpert’: Double the per-test cost of Xpert MTB/RIF, in exchange for the ability to provide results to patients in the same clinical encounter (e.g., peripheral deployment, with greater costs reflecting lower volume per machine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vassall et al., 2011</xref>]).</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of user-friendly model.</title><p>Users are asked, via open-source computer script or Web interface, to select one of the nine diagnostic strategies and to provide unit costs and three basic epidemiological parameters (TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence among new cases, and adult HIV prevalence). The selected diagnostic strategy is used to populate a decision tree that calculates (a) the probability of missed diagnosis, unsuccessful treatment, and successful treatment, (b) costs, and (c) diagnostic delays. These outputs depend on patients' TB (yes/no, and drug susceptibility status), HIV, and TB treatment history status. The selected epidemiological parameters are then used to populate a dynamic transmission model, creating a steady-state population that reflects local TB epidemiology. The decision tree—which inputs user-defined unit costs—is then incorporated into the transmission model to project outcomes under the selected diagnostic scenario. Users can sequentially select multiple diagnostic scenarios for comparison, and the computer script (though not the Web interface) allows users to manipulate input parameters at their discretion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02565.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02565.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02565-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transmission model of TB diagnosis.</title><p>Boxes represent sub-populations in the model, and arrows represent rates of movement between those sub-populations.

The incremental cost-effectiveness, in terms of cost per case averted (i.e., slope of the line from origin to each point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), was similar across all strategies with the exception of same-day smear, which was cost-saving and had greater effectiveness than the baseline. Same-day microscopy remained cost-saving by year 5 as long as same-day results could be provided at less than five times the per-smear cost of routine results (i.e., &lt;$10/test). Among the targeted strategies, Xpert for smear-positives was the most expensive but had the greatest impact on MDR-TB cases averted, whereas Xpert for HIV-infected individuals and culture for retreatment cases offered smaller gains at lower cost. Among the broad strategies, culture confirmation of rifampin-resistant tests on Xpert saved costs with little reduction in effectiveness. There was little difference between culture-confirmed Xpert and MODS/TLA, and same-day Xpert was the most expensive and most effective strategy.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Incremental 5-year cost and impact of TB diagnostic strategies, high-incidence setting.</title><p>Shown are cumulative projected 5-year costs and impact (averted TB cases [panel <bold>A</bold>] or MDR-TB cases [panel <bold>B</bold>]) of each diagnostic strategy described in the Introduction, incremental to the baseline strategy, per 100,000 population.

These three parameters were: (1) the proportion of TB patients who would be empirically treated even if microbiologic testing yielded a negative result (‘empiric treatment proportion’), (2) duration of infectiousness before seeking care (‘pre-diagnostic delay’), and (3) rate of reactivation from latent infection to active disease (‘reactivation rate’). For this latter parameter, in-depth investigation revealed that the key determinant was not the reactivation rate per se, but rather the proportion of active TB representing recent vs remote infection. If the empiric treatment proportion was increased from 25% to 37.5%, the projected reduction in TB incidence fell from 20% to 13%. By contrast, when only 12.5% of false-negative patients were started on therapy, ‘Xpert for all’ achieved a 31% reduction in incidence. Corresponding reductions in incidence with ‘Xpert for all’ (20% at baseline) included: 27% if pre-diagnostic delay was shortened from 9 months to 4.5 months, 14% if pre-diagnostic delay was lengthened to 13.5 months, 15% if the reactivation rate was doubled from 0.05% to 0.1% per year, and 23% if reactivation was halved to 0.025% per year. The projected 5-year reduction in incidence for this strategy did not fall outside the range of 12–25% under variation of any other model parameter, up to 50% of that parameter's baseline value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Both costs and incremental costs were more sensitive to the cost of TB treatment than the cost of diagnostics. For example, doubling the cost of first-line therapy (from $500 to $1000 per person) augmented the incremental year 1 costs for ‘Xpert for all’ from a 57% increase over baseline to a 77% increase, and doubling the cost of MDR therapy (from $5000 to $10,000 per person) generated an 86% increase in incremental year 1 costs, whereas doubling the unit cost of Xpert (from $15 to $30) only resulted in a 72% increase. Unit costs other than those for first-line treatment, MDR treatment, and the diagnostic modality under study in each scenario were not important determinants of incremental costs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, most transmission models of infectious disease control interventions present results that are not directly usable by decision makers because they are not customizable to local conditions. We present a flexible, user-friendly model of TB diagnosis and transmission that allows users without modeling expertise to define an epidemiologic setting (according to TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence, and HIV prevalence) and unit costs, evaluating various diagnostic strategies in that setting in terms of population-level costs and impact. While this model cannot precisely replicate the epidemiological situation in any given location, it applies a standardized methodology across a wide range of settings, thereby illustrating important interactions between epidemiological parameters and projected impact. We provide both a web interface for rapid calculations and full model code whereby users can change any model parameter for ‘personalized’ sensitivity analysis. Our model results suggest that the rank-ordering of diagnostic strategies may be relatively stable across epidemiological settings, but that the actual population-level costs and impact differ dramatically. This model also serves as an example of how epidemiologists can provide decision-makers across a wide variety of local settings with rapid access to customizable ‘first-pass’ projections of cost and impact from transmission models without the need to construct tightly fitted models to represent all epidemiological settings.</p><p>Our results provide important guidance to TB decision-makers. Specifically, in settings where little additional up-front investment is possible (&lt;25% increase in TB control budget), same-day microscopy has the greatest impact on TB incidence with no increase in overall cost at 5 years, provided that same-day microscopy can be feasibly delivered for less than $10 per patient.  For settings in which containing MDR-TB is the most important consideration, Xpert for smear-positives has the greatest effectiveness for this outcome, but at substantial price and very little impact on overall TB incidence and mortality. Xpert for HIV-positives and culture for retreatment cases both offer meaningful, albeit small, gains; the cost and impact of these strategies are the highest in HIV-endemic settings. In settings where more initial investment is possible (about 50% increase in TB control budget), broader scale-up of either Xpert or MODS/TLA for all TB diagnosis can offer substantially greater benefits, both in terms of reduced incidence (often 10 times more TB cases averted than with the more narrowly-targeted strategies above) and long-term costs (in that the incremental cost of these strategies declines greatly by Year 5). In general, culture confirmation of positive Xpert results before committing to a course of second-line therapy is preferred. Finally, where the greatest impact is sought, combination of Xpert for all plus infrastructure for same-day diagnosis achieves this aim in all settings, but at the highest cost.</p><p>Although this model represents a highly simplified framework, it compares well to other global estimates to which it was not fit (e.g., WHO estimates of TB mortality, previously treated TB, HIV-associated TB, and MDR-TB prevalence among previously treated cases). Its results are also similar to those of other mathematical models of TB diagnosis that are fit to specific locations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menzies et al. (2012)</xref> modeled scale-up of Xpert for people living with HIV in southern Africa, estimating a 6% reduction in incidence, 21% reduction in TB mortality, 25% reduction in MDR-TB incidence that declines to &lt;10% over a longer time frame, and 40% increase in costs (not including costs of antiretroviral therapy). Our corresponding estimates for the Xpert for HIV-positive strategy in the high-HIV setting are 5% reduction in incidence, 25% reduction in TB mortality, 7% reduction in MDR-TB incidence, and increase in costs from 41% (year 1) to 28% (year 5). For purposes of deciding between alternative strategies of scaling up TB diagnostics, the estimates from these two models are likely to provide similar guidance.</p><p>For any such simplified transmission model to have an impact on decision-making, it is important to consider who the eventual users of such a model might be, and to develop the model in consultation with those groups. In this case, we identified a number of potential end-user organizations including technical assistance agencies (e.g., KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation), funding bodies (e.g., Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria), non-governmental organizations (e.g., Medecins Sans Frontiers), National Tuberculosis Programs, and regional offices of the World Health Organization. We then invited representatives of these organizations to attend a 1-day workshop (April 2014, The Hague, The Netherlands) describing methods and challenges related to modeling of TB diagnostics in general, including this transmission model in particular. We developed ‘hands-on’ exercises for participants to better learn the model and solicited specific feedback, which is being incorporated into the model structure and web interface in ongoing fashion. We next intend to develop a series of informal ‘case studies’ whereby the use of this model for in-country decision-making can be demonstrated and disseminated.</p><p>As with any modeling analysis, this research has important limitations. In order to provide sufficient flexibility and generalizability, we make a number of strong assumptions that include a constant population, homogeneous mixing, no change in parameter values over time, and simplistic incorporation of HIV and drug resistance. Without making such simplifying assumptions, it is impossible to deliver a flexible modeling framework that can generate transparent, customizable, rapid results (i.e., without complex statistical fitting to each individual epidemiological scenario). This model can replicate user-defined TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence, and HIV incidence but does not describe the breakdown of these values in key subpopulations (e.g., congregate settings or geographical ‘hotspots’), nor does it incorporate operational aspects of the TB diagnostic system in any one setting. Thus, this model does not ameliorate the need for more detailed models in settings where precise estimates are needed; rather it provides access to ‘first-pass’ estimates in settings (i.e., the vast majority of local decision-makers) where such tightly calibrated model projections are not available. This model focuses on transmission dynamics and thus does not include pediatric TB and extrapulmonary TB; these largely non-infectious disease manifestations remain very important components of the TB epidemic that are not captured here. We validate our model against global estimates and other models; ideally, further validation would be performed over time using field data across a wide variety of settings. Our model allows users to define three key epidemiological parameters (as well as other model assumptions within the program), but data to inform even these three parameters—as well as unit costs—are unlikely to be available on sub-national levels. As a result, users wishing to adapt the model to a smaller geographic scale will need to perform additional data-gathering exercises to inform these estimates if they wish to maximize the utility of the model.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if high-quality data are not available at the local level, this model allows decision-makers to estimate epidemiological and economic values according to reasonable assumptions (e.g., comparison of TB notification rates or budget line-items to those in the published literature or at the national level), vary those assumptions in real-time, and obtain corresponding projections of comparative impact that incorporate the best available current data on epidemiological or natural history parameters (e.g., TB progression and reactivation). Future efforts might also provide flexibility to specify operational characteristics (e.g., health system capacity) as well.</p><p>A final concern is that, by providing users the ability to specify TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence, and adult HIV prevalence, a number of scenarios can be created (e.g., low TB incidence and very high adult HIV prevalence) that are not epidemiologically realistic. Although there is danger in allowing uninformed users to make projections for such scenarios (and the model will reject or alert users to highly implausible values), we believe that this risk is outweighed by the benefit of providing full flexibility to model epidemiological scenarios (e.g., sub-district level data) that will never be captured by a limited number of closely-calibrated TB transmission models.</p><p>In summary, we have created a flexible modeling framework that allows users without modeling expertise to generate simulated populations with locally relevant values for TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence, adult HIV prevalence, and TB treatment costs. By comparing an array of diagnostic options across emblematic epidemiological scenarios, we provide guidance to decision-makers who seek to ascertain the optimal diagnostic strategy to achieve their selected disease control targets, and to do so using a standardized methodology. Success in the fight against infectious disease generally, and TB specifically, depends on our ability to place global knowledge in the hands of local decision-makers, enabling them to choose those interventions that are likely to have the greatest impact, given existing resources and local epidemiological realities. This flexible modeling framework of diagnostic interventions takes an important step in that direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transmission model</title><p>Using previously published models of TB diagnostics as a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dye et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menzies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dowdy et al., 2013</xref>), we constructed a transmission model of TB using ordinary differential equations.

Individuals enter the model at age 15, and TB with no pulmonary component (i.e., not infectious) is not included. For purposes of transparent communication, we chose a population size of 100,000 (to match standard reporting of TB outcomes) and assumed a constant population with no net population growth or immigration/emigration. After constructing the transmission framework, we used decision analysis to estimate (a) the probability of each diagnostic outcome; (b) the diagnostic delay; and (c) the cost of TB diagnosis and treatment under each of the nine diagnostic strategies, assuming immediate implementation at the beginning of a given year (‘Year 1’). Two separate authors (DWD and PJD) independently coded the model; these models gave comparable results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Model initiation</title><p>After setting probabilities and costs under each diagnostic strategy, we then created a flexible modeling structure capable of generating epidemiological scenarios as a function of three variables, which the user specifies: HIV prevalence (assuming a global mean level of antiretroviral therapy coverage), TB incidence, and MDR-TB prevalence among new TB cases. We accomplished this by allowing three key parameters to vary across model scenarios: annual HIV incidence, rate of TB transmission per smear-positive/highly infectious person-year, and relative per-case transmission rate of rifampin-resistant TB. We also allow users to specify all relevant unit costs for TB diagnosis and treatment; other model parameters were estimated from existing literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We then created a program that numerically generates a unique steady-state population meeting the user-defined values; this population serves as the baseline strategy (Strategy 1 above) at the beginning of the time frame under evaluation. The program has flexibility to create its steady-state population 50 years in the past, allowing it to replicate the protracted, slow declines in TB incidence as seen in many lower-incidence settings; this is done automatically for any scenario with a target TB incidence less than 50 per 100,000/year.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Model compartments</title><p>The mathematical model consists of the following TB compartments:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>U</italic><sub><italic>hp</italic></sub>, Uninfected</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>L</italic><sub><italic>hdp</italic></sub>, Latently infected</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>E</italic><sub><italic>hdp</italic></sub>, Early active (infectious status <italic>i</italic> = 0)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>A</italic><sub><italic>hdip</italic></sub>, Late active</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P</italic><sub><italic>hdip</italic></sub>, Active ‘pre-treatment’: diagnosis in progress, will lead to appropriate therapy</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>I</italic><sub><italic>hdip</italic></sub>, Active ‘inappropriate treatment’: receiving therapy that ends in default or failure</p></list-item></list></p><p>In these compartments, the subscript <italic>h</italic> refers to HIV status (<italic>h</italic> = 0 if HIV-uninfected, 1 if HIV-infected), <italic>d</italic> refers to drug resistance status (<italic>d</italic> = 0 if drug-susceptible, 1 if isoniazid [INH]-monoresistant, and 2 if multidrug-resistant [MDR]), <italic>i</italic> refers to infectious status (<italic>i</italic> = 0 if smear-negative/less infectious and 1 if smear-positive/highly infectious), and <italic>p</italic> refers to previous treatment status (<italic>p</italic>=0 if never treated, 1 if previously treated). Infectious status can be conceptualized as an individual's sputum smear status, if two smears were to be performed in a quality-assured laboratory at any given point in time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model structure</title><p>The model assumes an adult population of stable size with no immigration or emigration: the number of individuals entering the uninfected compartment <italic>U</italic> is set as equal to the number who die (whether from TB or other causes) from all other compartments. Pediatric and purely extrapulmonary TB are not explicitly considered because the diagnostic considerations for these manifestations are different. In the short-term, however, to the extent that these forms of TB are non-infectious and equally fatal as adult pulmonary TB, their effects on TB incidence and mortality may be approximated by dividing the model's projected incidence and mortality by (1 − proportion of TB that is not adult pulmonary), to obtain a new incidence/mortality estimate. Thus, if 20% of all TB in a given location is extrapulmonary or paediatric, the rough projected total TB incidence would be (projected TB incidence)/(0.8).</p><p>In this model, we consider latent TB infection to be asymptomatic and non-infectious, with a constant rate of reactivation and ongoing risk of exogenous reinfection leading to active TB; individuals successfully treated for TB are assumed to return to this compartment upon initiation of effective therapy (i.e., therapy that will result in completion, with no relapse for 2 years). Upon developing active TB, individuals enter a ‘pre-diagnostic’ phase that is characterized by a low level of infectiousness and mortality (equivalent to smear-negative TB) and during which individuals do not actively seek diagnosis. The duration of this phase (9 months) was selected a priori based on an existing model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dowdy et al., 2013</xref>) in which the total duration of disease after incorporating this phase reflected the global ratio of prevalence to incidence, as estimated by the World Health Organization. We compared the total duration of disease to this ratio as part of our model validation and assumed that this ‘pre-diagnostic’ phase is much shorter for HIV-infected vs HIV-uninfected individuals. Upon completing this ‘pre-diagnostic’ phase, individuals progress to a diagnosis-seeking phase of active disease, which is characterized by separation into highly infectious (‘smear-positive’) and less infectious (‘smear-negative’) compartments. Among HIV-uninfected individuals, the highly infectious compartment also carries higher mortality risk. Diagnosis-seeking active TB implies active seeking of diagnosis at a defined rate; the probability that any single diagnostic attempt will result in effective therapy is calculated as a function of diagnostic sensitivity, probability of empiric therapy (i.e., without bacteriological confirmation), prior treatment status, and losses to follow-up, as described below. Each diagnostic attempt, if successful, leads either to effective therapy (which is initiated after a defined diagnostic delay) or to ineffective therapy (defined as leading to failure or default). In order to focus on differences between the nine selected strategies above in a tractable framework, we subsumed all other diagnostic tests and procedures (e.g., chest X-ray, antibiotic trials) as a probability of non-microbiologic diagnosis, without attempting to specify the associated cost or diagnostic delay. Once effective therapy is initiated, it is assumed to immediately render the individual non-infectious, with no residual risk of mortality. Upon initiation of ineffective therapy, individuals are assumed to remain infectious (at the ‘smear-negative’/less infectious level) for a defined period before either failing (followed by another round of therapy, which can be either appropriate/curative or ineffective) or default. Reasoning that default will occur, on average, at the midpoint between receipt of fully-ineffective and fully-effective therapy, half of defaulters are presumed to develop recurrent TB (which is assumed to occur immediately), while the other half return to the latent TB compartment (from which reactivation or reinfection remains possible). All individuals who relapse within 1 year are included as failures; thus, no specific parameter for relapse is incorporated. Individuals who are effectively treated, or whose disease is contained without therapy, return to the latent compartment following the convention of other TB models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dye et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Role of HIV coinfection</title><p>As the goal of this model is to focus on TB-related interventions, HIV is modeled as occurring at a defined annual incidence, calibrated to achieve a given user-defined prevalence at baseline. We do not explicitly model HIV infection in dynamic fashion (i.e., the HIV incidence rate does not depend on the number of HIV-infected individuals in the model). HIV infection is assumed to affect all parameters related to TB disease, including the level of immune protection afforded by latent infection (assumed zero if HIV-infected), mortality rate (increased), rate of reactivation from latent TB (increased), duration of ‘pre-diagnostic’ TB (decreased), and risk of ‘primary’ progression to active disease upon infection (increased). For purposes of maintaining a simple model structure, we do not explicitly model CD4 counts or antiretroviral therapy (ART), but instead assume the global average of ART coverage, as estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">UNAIDS (2012)</xref>. We weight all HIV-related parameters according to this estimated probability of ART receipt; this probability can be modified by users.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Drug resistance</title><p>We assume infection with TB strains of three different drug resistance levels: fully susceptible, INH-monoresistant, and MDR. Dual infection with multiple strains is not considered in this model, but superinfection (i.e., reinfection of a latently infected individual with a different strain, resulting in primary progression to disease with the reinfecting strain) is allowed, as is acquisition of resistance (i.e., change of strain from more susceptible to less susceptible) as a result of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Individuals without TB</title><p>A key consideration with any TB diagnostic strategy is the role of the diagnostic test as applied to individuals who do not have TB (i.e., specificity). We included this element by considering that a small proportion of the population without TB would present with TB-like symptoms each year. This proportion (selected such that 10% of individuals being evaluated in the high-incidence setting actually have underlying TB) remains constant across all scenarios, such that the pre-test probability of TB is higher in settings of high TB incidence, and declines over time as successful TB control strategies are employed. Individuals without TB who are (inappropriately) treated for TB incur costs of TB therapy and are also marked as ‘previously treated’ for purposes of diagnostic evaluation in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Economic parameters are estimated using a unit-costing approach, whereby the unit cost of a TB diagnostic attempt and a TB treatment course (separately for first-line, category two, and second-line therapy) is enumerated under each scenario, and this cost is multiplied by the number of diagnostic attempts and treatment courses performed. For simplicity, we adopt the perspective of a TB control program for our costing; additional costs of HIV care and general health services (e.g., hospitalization) are not included. The decision tree below is used to estimate the cost per diagnostic attempt or treatment course, conditional on an individual's HIV, drug resistance, and previous treatment status. Individuals who default or die on therapy are assumed to incur half the cost of a treatment course. Given the short time horizon (5 years), the focus on costs and outcomes (rather than cost-effectiveness per se), and the desire to compare costs in year 1 and at the end of year 5 in equivalent terms, we did not discount future costs or outcomes for this analysis. All costs are reported in US dollars, assuming the year of costs that is specified by the user.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Decision analysis: probability of diagnostic success</title><p>Under each scenario, we use decision analysis to ascertain the following quantities related to each diagnostic attempt:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Probability of receiving successful treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Probability of receiving ineffective treatment (resulting in failure or default, including the probability of acquired resistance).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cost of treatment (conditional on whether treatment is successful or ineffective).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cost of diagnosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnostic delay incurred before treatment initiated.</p></list-item></list></p><p>These quantities are calculated conditional on each patient's infectious (smear) status, drug resistance status, HIV status, and prior treatment status. These probabilities are calculated for each diagnostic attempt, with the result fed back into the transmission model for purposes of appropriately allocating flows between compartments.

primary outcomes under each scenario were TB incidence, TB mortality, MDR-TB incidence, and incremental TB diagnostic and treatment costs (during year 1 and at the end of the 5-year period) relative to the baseline strategy. By giving flexibility to change model inputs, we provide users the ability to conduct any sensitivity analysis desired. However, for illustrative purposes, we also conducted a series of one-way sensitivity analyses in which each model parameter in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> was varied by ±50% of its listed value (for proportions, 50% of the difference between the value and either zero or one).

Unlike the previous (successful treatment) compartment, diagnostic delay is not explicitly incorporated into this compartment, as to do so would prolong the duration of time until individuals who default re-enter the ‘late active’ compartment. Inclusion of a diagnostic delay before this compartment does not materially affect results. Individuals exit this compartment either in default after partial therapy—which has a defined probability of achieving cure despite not being completed—or failure. Failure leads immediately to another course of treatment, which can either be successful (i.e., transition to the latent compartment) or unsuccessful (i.e., remain in the inappropriate treatment

In order to generate an equilibrium population according to user specifications of TB incidence, MDR-TB prevalence, and HIV prevalence, it is necessary to solve for the roots of a system of these 100 equations, plus three additional equations to account for the user inputs. We accomplish this using the ‘fsolve’ routine in SciPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scipy.org/">www.scipy.org</ext-link>). To solve for these three additional equations, we first match each user input to a single parameter: TB incidence to the transmission rate <italic>β</italic>, MDR-TB prevalence to the relative reduction in transmission for MDR-TB <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, and HIV prevalence to the HIV incidence rate <italic>θ</italic>. We then constrain the system of equations such that the total population remains constant at 100,000, and we add the following three equations to the system:<disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">dt</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>calculated TB incidence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>user-defined TB incidence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ10"><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>calculated MDR-TB prevalence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>user-defined MDR-TB prevalence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ11"><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>calculated HIV prevalence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>user-defined HIV prevalence</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>By solving for the roots at which this system of equations equals zero, we generate an equilibrium (steady-state) population that also defines <italic>β, φ</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, and <italic>θ</italic> such that the user-defined targets are also met.</p><p>Additional complexity is added to account for non-equilibrium in TB incidence and MDR-TB prevalence. We accomplish this by fitting an equilibrium defined by the user-specified target of HIV prevalence, and the user-specified ‘initial’ values of TB incidence and MDR-TB prevalence. This equilibrium is set to be 50 years in the past; at this time, the system of equations is solved as above. We then allow for the parameters <italic>β</italic> and <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> to be altered from their original values (corresponding to the equilibrium condition) such that a second set of targets are attained after 50 years (start of the analysis). If these calculated values at the end of 50 years do not match the user-defined targets, the parameter values are changed accordingly, and the model is re-run from equilibrium until the appropriate parameter value is identified that generates the user-defined TB incidence and MDR-TB prevalence, within a relative tolerance of 0.05 in each variable. These parameters may then be further modified such that they change over the analysis frame of five years (e.g., to describe an epidemic with increasing MDR-TB prevalence over time).</p><p>In the primary version of the model, this is only automated for low-incidence scenarios in which the user inputs a TB incidence of less than 50 per 100,000/year. In such cases, the model generates an equilibrium population 50 years in the past with a TB incidence of 50 per 100,000/year and reduces the transmission parameter <italic>β</italic> until the user-defined TB incidence is achieved 50 years later (i.e., the start of the analytic period). This accounts for the fact that most low-incidence settings have substantially more latent TB infection than would be estimated by an equilibrium population with a very low TB incidence—thereby more appropriately reflecting a higher proportion of TB due to reactivation rather than recent infection. However, we include code (described in the user manual below) that allows users to define high incidence scenarios that are likewise not at equilibrium, as well as ‘emerging MDR’ scenarios in which the prevalence of MDR-TB is increasing rather than stable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jeff Pennington for development of the web interface, and to Adithya Cattamanchi, Madhukar Pai, Jonathan Golub, and Richard Chaisson for helpful comments.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>DWD, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>JRA, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>PJD, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>RHG, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.009</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><p>Model code</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02565.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02565.009</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="py" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-02565-supp1-v2.py"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02565.010</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><p>Model interface and user manual</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02565.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02565.010</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="txt" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-02565-supp2-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abu-Raddad</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabatelli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Achterberg</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Longini</surname><given-names>IM</given-names><suffix>Jnr</suffix></name><name><surname>Dye</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Halloran</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name></person-group><year>2009</year><article-title>Epidemiological benefits of more-effective tuberculosis vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics</article-title><source>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</source><volume>106</volume><fpage>13980</fpage><lpage>13985</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1073/pnas.0901720106</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Noubary</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Walensky</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Cerda</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Losina</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Horsburgh</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name></person-group><year>2012</year><article-title>Risk of progression to active tuberculosis following reinfection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></article-title><source>Clinical Infectious Diseases</source><volume>54</volume><fpage>784</fpage><lpage>791</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/cid/cir951</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antonucci</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Girardi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Raviglione</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ippolito</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><year>1995</year><article-title>Risk factors for tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons.

Two features that differentiates it from other TB models are: 1) its ability to be customized to local conditions using input specifications of TB incidence/MDBR TB prevalence/HIV prevalence/costs) and 2) being a simplified model freely available on a web-based platform that can be manipulated by non-experts to make programmatic decisions. The authors compared the nine diagnostic strategies across four other epidemiological settings.</p><p>They demonstrate that regardless of the scenario, the interventions rank in the same order in terms of their impact and overall cost. However, actual costs and impact may differ.</p><p>The field needs these simplified tools and needs to empower local decision makers to make choices that are relevant to their context. We do however have comments and would appreciate if the authors could address these:</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1) The provision of a tool does not mean that the tool will be used and it is often the case that it does not. In country dissemination and training is needed. The use is strengthened if a global body (e.g. WHO) advocates for this. Have the authors tested/disseminated this tool with global and country level stakeholders? What is their plan to make sure that this tool does get used?</p><p>2) It would be great if the authors could comment on other simplified tools that are available for TB or HIV and how these tools have transformed the field (if at all).</p><p>3) Is the availability of data a limiting factor for these models to be used at local a local level (national or sub-national). A key input parameter to the model is TB incidence. How available is localized TB incidence data? At national or sub-national data? Similar comment regarding intervention costs.</p><p>4) The model assumes that everything else remains constant overtime (e.g. TB incidence). How does this affect the results?

What is their plan to make sure that this tool does get used?</italic></p><p>We agree wholeheartedly with this comment. In response, we have added the following as the fourth paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“For any such simplified transmission model to have impact on decision-making, it is important to consider who the eventual users of such a model might be, and to develop the model in consultation with those groups. In this case, we identified a number of potential end-user organizations including technical assistance agencies (e.g., KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation), funding bodies (e.g., Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria), non-governmental organizations (e.g., Medecins Sans Frontiers), National Tuberculosis Programs, and regional offices of the World Health Organization. We then invited representatives of these organizations to attend a one-day workshop (April 2014, The Hague, The Netherlands) describing methods and challenges related to modeling of TB diagnostics in general, including this transmission model in particular. We developed “hands-on” exercises for participants to better learn the model and solicited specific feedback, which is being incorporated into the model structure and web interface in ongoing fashion. We next intend to develop a series of informal “case studies” whereby the use of this model for in-country decision-making can be demonstrated and disseminated.”</p><p><italic>2) It would be great if the authors could comment on other simplified tools that are available for TB or HIV and how these tools have transformed the field (if at all)</italic>.</p><p>As also commented in the first minor comment below, the obvious example of a simplified tool that has been used for decision-making in HIV is the Spectrum suite of models. We now include the following text in our Introduction:</p><p>“Simplified models designed for in-country use by decision-makers, most notably the Spectrum suite of models supported by the Futures Institute, have been used to inform decision-making in the fields of reproductive health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for over a decade. Estimates from the Spectrum models are now routinely incorporated into official global and country-level estimates of HIV disease burden and intervention impact. Other simplified models are readily available for impact projections related to non-infectious diseases, where transmission assumptions are less important. However, to date, simple, user-friendly transmission models have not been widely used for decision-making related to many infectious diseases other than HIV.”</p><p><italic>3) Is the availability of data a limiting factor for these models to be used at local a local level (national or sub-national). A key input parameter to the model is TB incidence. How available is localized TB incidence data? At national or sub-national data? Similar comment regarding intervention costs</italic>.</p><p>We agree that data availability may be a limiting factor, but we also believe that local decision-makers are routinely forced to make decisions in the absence of such data. This model may still be useful in such circumstances by (a) allowing users to see the effects of different assumptions (e.g., different TB incidence or unit costs) in real-time, and (<bold>B</bold>) enabling users to link such assumptions to best available data on other parameters (e.g., TB natural history or epidemiology) that may have more data to inform them. The alternative, of course, is to disregard all such data and leave local decision-making to a non-transparent process of “expert opinion.” In response to this comment, we have included the following in our Limitations section:</p><p>“Data to inform even these three parameters – as well as unit costs – are unlikely to be available on sub-national levels. As a result, users wishing to adapt the model to a smaller geographic scale will need to perform additional data-gathering exercises to inform these estimates if they wish to maximize the utility of the model.</p><p>Nevertheless, even if high-quality data are not available at the local level, this model allows decision-makers to estimate epidemiological and economic values according to reasonable assumptions (e.g., comparison of TB notification rates or budget line-items to those in the published literature or at the national level), vary those assumptions in real-time, and obtain corresponding projections of comparative impact that incorporate best available current data on epidemiological or natural history parameters (e.g., TB progression and reactivation).”</p><p><italic>4) The model assumes that everything else remains constant overtime (e.g. TB incidence). How does this affect the results? Is this the reason that projections are only 5 years out</italic>.</p><p>This is, indeed, one of the primary reasons for limiting projections to five years, over which time the majority of TB epidemics are reasonably stable. We note, however, that our low TB incidence settings do not assume constant TB incidence over time, and that users can adapt the model to incorporate declining (or rising) TB incidence at baseline. In general, incorporating declining incidence assumptions leads to higher estimates of reactivation, which result in lower estimates of impact, as covered in our new sensitivity analyses (see below).</p><p><italic>While the authors do discuss the limitations, I think a greater discussion on the limitation of the model is needed in the discussion. This should include, where relevant, greater discussion of sensitivity analyses</italic>.</p><p>In response to the comments above we have expanded the discussion of model limitations. We have also, as below, expanded our results and discussion of sensitivity analyses in the corresponding portions of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Results section:</italic></p><p><italic>5) It would be good to have confidence intervals for the model outcomes for the high incidence scenario (global validation)</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We now provide 95% uncertainty ranges for the primary validation parameters reported, as well as methods for generating those ranges. In addition, we have used those same methods to generate 95% uncertainty ranges around each of the intervention estimates in each country’s baseline scenario – these ranges are now visible as “crosshairs” in the corresponding scatterplot figures on the website, and they also appear in the web-based comparison table.</p><p><italic>6) Sensitivity analysis: I would be interested to see some sensitivity analysis around unit cost given that this is one of the most difficult data points for programs to have especially when they are considering scaling up new interventions. Please comment on this more</italic>.</p><p>We have added additional methods and results describing sensitivity analyses on cost, as well as key natural history parameters. In the latter, we describe the importance of three natural history parameters: empiric treatment proportion, pre-diagnostic delay, and the reactivation rate. Of note, we have now also added “radio buttons” on the website scatterplot to demonstrate the impact of changing these three parameters, for rapid assessment of their impact on the website.</p></body></sub-article></article>
