We discovered that, instead of silencing mDia1 and mDia2, we depleted mDia1 and mDia3 in experiments shown in the figure. The origin of this error is the nomenclature of mammalian diaphanous family formins (DIAPH2 gene encodes mDia3 formin, and DIAPH3 gene encodes mDia2 formin). We have now also preformed mDia2 silencing and quantified the number of cortical stress fibers in these cells. Our analysis revealed that mDia2 depletion does not markedly affect the numbers of cortical stress fibers. Thus, the earlier error does not affect any of the conclusions of the manuscript, and our study provides evidence that mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 formins are not necessary for cortical stress fiber assembly.</p><p>We regret this error and have corrected the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>The corrected Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-79304-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1 is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-79304-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original figure legend for Figure 4 - figure supplement 1 has changed slightly.
