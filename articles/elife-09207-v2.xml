In prostate cancer, structural genomic rearrangements are a common mechanism driving tumorigenesis. However, somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer remain largely undefined. Here, we show that <italic>SPOP</italic>, the most commonly mutated gene in primary prostate cancer modulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, and that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation is associated with genomic instability. In vivo, <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation results in a transcriptional response consistent with <italic>BRCA1</italic> inactivation resulting in impaired homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSB. Furthermore, we found that SPOP mutation sensitizes to DNA damaging therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors. These results implicate SPOP as a novel participant in DSB repair, suggest that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis in part through genomic instability, and indicate that mutant <italic>SPOP</italic> may increase response to DNA-damaging therapeutics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09207.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09207.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09207.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men in the UK and USA. Cancers develop when cells in the body acquire genetic mutations that allow the cells to grow rapidly and form a mass known as a tumor. Prostate cancer cells from different individuals can carry different genetic mutations, which affects whether the disease progresses and how the tumors respond to medical treatments. This genetic variety arises in cancer cells partly from a phenomenon known as genomic instability, in which DNA mutations accumulate due to defects in DNA repair.</p><p>Genetic studies of biopsies taken from human prostate cancers have shown that genomic instability causes chromosomes—the structures in which the cell's DNA is organized—to break and then be stuck back together haphazardly. As a result, fragments of chromosomes can end up in the wrong position, be duplicated, or be lost altogether. All of these mutations could spur on the growth of the tumor. However, it is currently not clear why some prostate cancers are more genomically unstable than others, or what exactly causes this instability.</p><p>Boysen, Barbieri et al. studied prostate cancer cells taken from patients before they started medical treatment. The experiments show that the cancer cells with high levels of genomic instability also often had mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called SPOP. These mutations occur in about 10 percent of men with prostate cancer and appear early in the development of the tumors. Next, they studied the SPOP protein in zebrafish (which is nearly identical to human SPOP), as well as in mouse and human cells. The experiments show that SPOP normally helps the cell to accurately repair DNA that has been damaged. Mutations in SPOP change the DNA repair process, which lead to genomic instability by increasing the likelihood that broken chromosomes will be stuck back together incorrectly.</p><p>Further experiments tested drugs known as PARP inhibitors on mouse and human prostate cancer cells. The drugs, which have been recently tested successfully in patients with prostate cancer, block a different method of DNA repair that operates separately to the one that involves SPOP. When both of these pathways were inactivated—one by the SPOP mutation, the other by the drug—the cancer cells died more quickly. Therefore, men that are diagnosed with types of prostate cancer in which the gene that encodes SPOP is mutated might benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors or other therapies that affect DNA repair.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09207.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09207.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

Recently, WGS of treatment naive, clinically localized prostate cancer revealed a striking abundance of genomic rearrangements, in some samples comparable to the number of rearrangements in metastatic prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baca et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the type (intrachromosomal vs interchromosomal) and complexity of rearrangements in these tumors shows remarkable heterogeneity, potentially suggesting distinct mechanisms of instability in different molecular classes of prostate cancer. However, somatic alterations underlying these phenomena remain unexplained.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>SPOP</italic> (Speckle-type POZ protein) occur in around 10% of prostate cancers and represent the most common non-synonymous mutations in primary prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbieri et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations define a distinct molecular class of prostate cancer; they are mutually exclusive with ETS rearrangements but display distinct patterns of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbieri et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated somatic alterations associated with genomic rearrangements in prostate cancer.

This analysis revealed a bimodal distribution, with a more common, ‘low-rearrangement’ population, and a less frequent ‘high-rearrangement’ population primarily driven by intrachromosomal rearrangements (deletions, inversions, and tandem duplications), rather than balanced interchromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then analyzed the association between recurrent somatic alterations (point mutations and SCNAs) and number of rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Several recurrent deletions, primarily on chromosomes 5q and 6q, were significantly associated with intrachromosomal genomic rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and these were completely distinct compared to alterations associated with interchromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Independent analysis of SCNAs from three publicly available data sets comprising 430 tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbieri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Consortium TCGA, 2015</xref>), including 47 <italic>SPOP</italic> mutant prostate cancers, confirmed that the rearrangement-associated deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were those enriched in <italic>SPOP</italic> mutant prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Analysis of clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prandi et al., 2014</xref>) of specific lesions showed that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations were highly clonal compared to loci in the associated deletion peaks, supporting that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations precede deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Together, these data nominate a distinct prostate cancer class characterized by early <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations and genomic instability. We posited that the <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation impacts genome maintenance and prioritized <italic>SPOP</italic> for functional studies.</p><p>We explored the functional role of SPOP in vivo, using zebrafish as a rapidly assessable vertebrate model system. SPOP is highly conserved (97.3% identical at the amino acid level between human and zebrafish, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Spop</italic> by two different splice-blocking morpholinos (MO5, MO7) dramatically impaired brain and eye development as well as decreased overall body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), resulted in gene expression changes consistent with p53 activation, and apoptosis measured by TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Microinjection of human SPOP mRNA rescued these phenotypes, confirming specificity of the morpholino effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To nominate signaling pathways impacted by Spop, we performed transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq on zebrafish with <italic>Spop</italic> knockdown and ectopic expression of wild-type SPOP (SPOP-wt) and SPOP-F133V, the most commonly mutated residue in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with recently reported proteomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Theurillat et al., 2014</xref>) and heterodimerization between mutant and wild-type SPOP in our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), transcriptional responses to SPOP-F133V compared with SPOP-wt and Spop morpholino showed a pattern consistent with dominant negative, selective loss of function; SPOP-F133V correlated with SPOP-wt for some gene sets (Cluster B) and correlated with Spop morpholino for others (Cluster A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) revealed gene sets involving DNA repair impacted by modulating SPOP function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Notably, the transcriptional response to F133V correlated highly with BRCA1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While SPOP has been previously proposed as involved in DNA damage and repair (DDR) signaling based on in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>), these results for the first time implicate a functional role for SPOP in DDR signaling in vivo and suggest this function is selectively impaired by prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutations. To test this hypothesis in human prostate cancers, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of transcriptional data from 11 SPOP mutant and 53 SPOP wild-type tumors, based on the transcriptional signature of BRCA1 inactivation (MSigDB: M2748). We observed significant segregation of SPOP mutant tumors (p-value = 9.5e<sup>−07</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) using this signature, with less robust segregation of tumors harboring CHD1 or MAP3K7 deletions co-occurring with SPOP mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggest that human prostate cancers with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations show transcriptional effects similar to BRCA1 inactivation, consistent with a role for SPOP in DSB repair. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed a trend of mutual exclusivity between <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations and <italic>BRCA1</italic> alterations in genomic data (p-value = 0.0496, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09207.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SPOP mediates DNA damage repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evaluation of SPOP function during zebrafish development.

To further define the impact of SPOP mutation in response to DNA damage, we utilized primary prostate cells isolated from transgenic mice with Cre-dependent conditional expression of SPOP-F133V. After transduction with Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (Cre-ERT2), cells were treated with 4-OH tamoxifen or vehicle and exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

RAD51 is a component of the HDR pathway and a marker for engagement of the HDR machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 1996</xref>). 53BP1 is a positive regulator of NHEJ that blocks 5′-DNA-end resection and therefore functions at the intersection of HDR and NHEJ; if 53BP1 is not cleared from sites of DSB by HDR components, it promotes error prone NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panier and Boulton, 2014</xref>). Strikingly, SPOP-F133V-expressing prostate cells showed delayed clearance of 53BP1 from sites of DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>); similar effects were seen with another SPOP mutation (F102C) commonly observed in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3I,J</xref>). Furthermore, SPOP-wt increased RAD51 foci formation compared to controls, while SPOP-F133V-expressing cells showed a dramatic decrease in RAD51 foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), consistent with impairment of HDR.

Knockdown of <italic>SPOP</italic> also resulted in a decrease of RAD51 foci, suggesting a selective loss of function of SPOP-F133V in HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Colonies containing 50 cells or more were counted, and the drug cytotoxicity was calculated as the ratio of colonies formed after drug treatment relative to colonies from untreated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Single-cell gel electrophoresis</title><p>Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, United States). 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml were mixed with molten LM agarose in a ratio of 1:10 and spread on a comet slide. Cells were subsequently lysed and subjected to electrophoresis. Cells were fixed and stained with SYBR Green. Images were collected with a 20× objective lens using a monochrome camera (CV-M4+CL, Jai, Japan) fitted in an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, United States). COMETscore v1.5 was used for image analysis, and 50–100 individual cells were analyzed per condition. The results are shown as comet tail moments, which is a representation of the fluorescence intensity in the tail relative to the head.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>DR-GFP (HDR) and Pem1-Ad2-EGFP (NHEJ) reporter assay</title><p>Cells were electroporated using the cell line nucleofactor kit V (VCA-1003, Lonza, Allendale, NJ, United States) with positive control plasmids (pNZE) and combinations of HDR-(pDRGFP) or NHEJ-(pPEM1-Ad2-EGFP) reporter constructs and an expression vector for the restriction enzyme I-SceI as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pierce et al., 1999</xref>). All the plasmids used in the GFP-reporter assay were a kind gift of Maria Jasin, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. The GFP expression induced by the positive control plasmid was used to normalize the electroporation efficiency. Negative controls contained the reporter construct and empty expression vectors lacking I-SceI. Cells were grown for 48 hr and processed for further flow cytometry analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were fixed in PFA (2% vol/vol in PBS), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X 100, and blocked in 1% BSA. Cells were incubated overnight in mouse Alexa Fluor 647 labeled anti-MYC-Tag antibodies (clone 9B11, cat.no: 2233, Cell Signaling, 1:50). SPOP (MYC-tag) and GFP expression was quantified by the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>RWPE cells were transduced with LacZ, WT SPOP, or F133V SPOP lentiviral particles. Transduced cells were treated with Nocodazole (40 ng/ml) for 18 hr to synchronize cell cycle. Cell cycle distribution was determined by FACS 24 hr after culturing synchronized cells in normal growth media and labeling cells with propidium iodide (PI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Wild-type zebrafish (strain AB/T) were maintained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceol et al., 2011</xref>). For functional studies, embryos were harvested at the one cell stage and yolk injected with SPOP-targeting morpholino (final 2–4 ng) or SPOP mRNA at the indicated concentrations. For phenotypical analysis, embryos were monitored for 5 days. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (15596-026, Life Technologies) at 24 hpf for RNA sequencing after dechorionating the embryos with pronase. For cell cycle analysis, embryos were homogenized and individual cells were stained with propidium iodide. All protocols were performed with prior approval of the WCMC IACUC (2011-0026).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Zebrafish whole mount apoptosis assay</title><p>Embryos (24 hpf) were fixed in 4% PFA overnight. Embryos were than washed in PBS Tween (PBT) and Methanol, rehydrated in a series of Methanol-PBT dilutions (75% MeOH/25% PBT, 50% MeOH/50% PBT, 25% MeOH/75% PBT), and washed three times in PBT. Afterwards embryos were digested with PK (5 min, 10 μg/ml). PK digestion was followed by two PBT washes, a refixation in 4% PFA (20 min), and a postfixation in prechilled Ethanol:Acetic acid (2:1) (−20°C, 10 min). TUNEL staining was performed by using the ApopTag Peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (S7100, Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL-positive cells were labeled by incubating the embryos in 3-3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Morpholinos</title><p>Antisense oligos (morpholinos) targeting Spop were synthesized by Gene Tools (Corvalis, OR, United States). Morpholino 5 (MO5) was targeted to the sequence flanking the border between intron 1 and exon 2. Morpholino 7 (MO7) was targeted to the sequence flanking the border between intron 2 and exon 3. Morpholino sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers considered this manuscript very well written, interesting, and potentially very important for a number of reasons. The manuscript describes the characterization of <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations in prostate cancers and reveals a new role for SPOP in the DNA damage repair response (DDR). While analyzing data on chromosomal rearrangements and mutational status of hundreds of prostate cancers, the authors make the interesting observation that ‘high rearrangement’ correlates with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations. They go on to show that SPOP is involved in late steps of the DDR response, and that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations impair homologous recombination (HR) and favor error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ), which could potentially explain the correlation between <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations and high frequency of rearrangements. This function resembles that of the DDR factor BRCA1. In fact, <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations also seem to be mutually exclusive with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations. Finally, the authors show some data suggesting that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations may sensitize cells to PARP inhibitors, which have been shown to be synthetic lethal with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations.</p><p>The reviewers considered the manuscript to be potentially meritorious for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing some major concerns:</p><p>1) The data supporting the conclusion that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations sensitize cancer cells to PARP inhibitors is currently very weak, based solely on the analysis of RWPE primary prostate cells, RR2v1 prostate cancer cells and embryonic kidney cells (HEK) using artifact-prone overexpression experiments. The conclusion that <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations could be synthetic lethal with PARP inhibition could have profound implications in the clinic and therefore must be exhaustively tested by the authors. Toward this end, the following experiments are requested:</p><p>1.1) PARP inhibitors should be tested in a dose-response experiment in prostate cancer cell lines expressing wild type or mutant SPOP. We recognize that this request may be challenging due to the limited number of prostate cancer cell lines but we would like to see if the prediction holds in whatever models may be available.</p><p>1.2) The authors should establish an isogenic system using a prostate cancer cell line of choice currently expressing wild type SPOP and thus resistant to PARP inhibitors, and either knockdown or knock-out SPOP and demonstrate that SPOP depletion is sufficient to confer sensitivity.</p><p>2) Can the authors account for the discrepancy between their data and the previously published work by Zhang et al. (Carcinogenesis 35: 1691, 2014)? This paper shows that SPOP is required for the DDR. Accordingly, Boysen et al. should also test whether SPOP localizes to DSBs following IR and they should more thoroughly present their own DDR data, even though their results were negative.</p><p>3) The manuscript begins with examination of WGS data from 55 treatment naïve prostate cancers and subsequent distribution into 2 chromosomal rearrangement populations – “low-rearrangement” and “high-rearrangement”. The “high-rearrangement” group was significantly associated with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations, but also with recurrent deletions on 5q and 6q, containing the tumor suppressors CHD1 and MAP3K7. Because of clonality studies the authors pursue the role of <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations only. Though the data regarding contribution of <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation to DNA damage response and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors are convincing, no attempt is made to see whether losses at 5q and 6q contribute to this phenotype independently or cooperatively with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation. 5q CNAs, specifically loss of CHD1, have been implicated in high chromosomal rearrangements, and MAP3K7 is also highly correlated with chromosomal rearrangements. Examining the 5q and 6q status of the patients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, either alone or in combination with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutant status would be informative and provide a clearer understanding of the contributions of these genes to the DNA damage phenotype (<italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant gene set) of this subtype. It would be informative to see how these CNAs co-segregate.</p><p>4) The paper does not provide a molecular mechanism. Specifically, recent studies by Theurillat et al. indicate that mutations in <italic>SPOP</italic>, an E3 substrate binding protein, results in upregulation of specific protein substrates (DEK, TRIM24, for example) via a dominant negative mechanism. But this new study by Boyser et al. does not provide a mechanism of disrupted HR. Is SPOP inhibiting the degradation of some critical substrate which is causing the transcriptional response consistent with <italic>BRCA1</italic> inactivation? Can the authors provide any additional data in this regard?</p><p><italic>Minor comments [abridged]:</italic></p><p>1) The authors conclude that phosphorylation of ATR is not affected by <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations, but the blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1F and H</xref> are discordant in this sense. Please repeat with several biological replicates to define this issue.</p><p>2) In the zebrafish experiments, SPOP knockdown leads to cell death concurrently with induction of p53 mRNA and induced expression of the p53 target genes <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>CCNG1</italic>. The authors should comment on this, acknowledging that cell death could be due to p53 activation in this setting.</p><p>3) A recent study indicates that a high percentage (15-20%) of metastatic CRPC have underlying mutations in DNA repair genes (<italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic> most commonly). The authors show some TGCA data for <italic>BRCA1</italic>. Are these mutations in CRPC (i.e. <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic>) mutually exclusive with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09207.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The data supporting the conclusion that</italic> SPOP <italic>mutations sensitize cancer cells to PARP inhibitors is currently very weak, based solely on the analysis of RWPE primary prostate cells, 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells and embryonic kidney cells (HEK) using artifact-prone overexpression experiments.

We also recognize the limitations of overexpressing mutant SPOP in the 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines as a model system. Therefore to address this issue, we developed a model system expressing inducible mutant SPOP in mouse prostate organoids. These are derived from a genetically engineered mouse model expressing SPOP-F133V in a Cre dependent manner, using a knock-in to the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (manuscript in preparation). The protein expression levels of mutant SPOP are approximately the same as endogenous SPOP in this model, mimicking human tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), and originally utilizing this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We have expanded the series of experiments examining PARP inhibitor sensitivity in this mouse organoid model. In new dose response experiments suggested by the reviewer, expression of physiologically relevant levels of mutant SPOP led to increased sensitivity to olaparib compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p><italic>1.2) The authors should establish an isogenic system using a prostate cancer cell line of choice currently expressing wild type SPOP and thus resistant to PARP inhibitors, and either knockdown or knock-out SPOP and demonstrate that SPOP depletion is sufficient to confer sensitivity</italic>.</p><p>In the initial submission, we presented limited data showing that knockdown of <italic>SPOP</italic>, similar to knockdown of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, sensitized 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells to PARP inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We have now expanded the series of experiments examining PARP inhibitor sensitivity with <italic>SPOP</italic> knockdown in our model systems. <italic>SPOP</italic> knockdown resulted in increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition in three prostate cell lines (22Rv1, PC3, and LNCaP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>). This effect was observed using two PARP inhibitors (i.e. olaparib, veliparib).</p><p>While these experiments do support the proposed role of SPOP in DSB repair, they should be interpreted with caution, since deletion of <italic>SPOP</italic> is not observed in human prostate cancer, and therefore may not phenocopy <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation in all models.</p><p><italic>2) Can the authors account for the discrepancy between their data and the previously published work by Zhang et al. (Carcinogenesis 35: 1691, 2014)? This paper shows that SPOP is required for the DDR. Accordingly, Boysen et al. should also test whether SPOP localizes to DSBs following IR and they should more thoroughly present their own DDR data, even though their results were negative</italic>.</p><p>Zhang D. et al. proposed a role for SPOP in the DDR based primarily on co-localization with other DDR components, without focusing on cancer-derived <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations. Their paper showed that <italic>SPOP</italic> knockdown with siRNA potentially led to prolongation of DSB repair (as measured by γH2AX foci). While these studies examining the consequences of <italic>SPOP</italic> knockdown in other cell types are interesting, and suggest a role in the DDR, they were not examined in a prostate context, and <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations are highly specific to prostate cancer. The tissue context may account for some of the differences between our results. We agree with the reviewers that determining localization of SPOP following γ-irradiation (IR) and co-localization with DNA repair complexes in a prostate context is important. Using immunofluorescence, we show that SPOP has increased nuclear foci following IR in both mouse and human prostate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we show that SPOP has only limited co-localization with γH2AX and phospho-ATM, following IR in prostate cells – this co-localization was not affected by expression of mutant SPOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>These additional experiments support that SPOP plays a role in responding to DSB. However, the differences in co-localization compared to those reported by Zhang et al. may be due to tissue context. Further mechanistic experiments will be necessary (and are ongoing) to define the role of SPOP and impact of prostate cancer derived <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations.</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript begins with examination of WGS data from 55 treatment naïve prostate cancers and subsequent distribution into 2 chromosomal rearrangement populations – “low-rearrangement” and “high-rearrangement”. The “high-rearrangement” group was significantly associated with</italic> SPOP <italic>mutations, but also with recurrent deletions on 5q and 6q, containing the tumor suppressors CHD1 and MAP3K7. Because of clonality studies the authors pursue the role of</italic> SPOP <italic>mutations only. Though the data regarding contribution of</italic> SPOP <italic>mutation to DNA damage response and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors are convincing, no attempt is made to see whether losses at 5q and 6q contribute to this phenotype independently or cooperatively with</italic> SPOP <italic>mutation. 5q CNAs, specifically loss of CHD1, have been implicated in high chromosomal rearrangements, and MAP3K7 is also highly correlated with chromosomal rearrangements. Examining the 5q and 6q status of the patients in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref><italic>, either alone or in combination with</italic> SPOP <italic>mutant status would be informative and provide a clearer understanding of the contributions of these genes to the DNA damage phenotype (</italic>BRCA1 <italic>mutant gene set) of this subtype. It would be informative to see how these CNAs co-segregate.</italic></p><p><italic>SPOP</italic> mutations, and deletions of 5q21 (CHD1) and 6q (MAP3K7) are highly associated, and together constitute a distinct molecular class of prostate cancer. The observation that all of these alterations were associated with increased genomic rearrangements suggests that this represents a genomically unstable molecular class of prostate cancer. To prioritize alterations for functional study, we used two points of rationale:</p><p>A) Because the phenotype in question is structural genomic rearrangements, genomic deletions (such as CHD1 and MAP3K7) could be causative or consequences of this phenotype, since they result from structural rearrangements. Point mutations (such as <italic>SPOP</italic>) cannot be a consequence of deregulated genomic rearrangements.</p><p>B) We therefore examined clonality data to determine the earliest event in this class (and therefore possibly the initiator of genomic instability, leading to subsequent genomic deletions), which prioritized <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation for functional study.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and understand that a better exposition of these ideas will improve the message of the manuscript. We have therefore added the following computational analyses and annotation:</p><p>A) To address the reviewers’ comments, we have now extended the genomic analysis to include the official TCGA-PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) dataset of 333 patients. The revised data for the copy number analysis include a total of 430 patients of which 47 harbor a <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation. As originally reported, deletions on 5q21.1 and 6q15, spanning <italic>CHD1</italic> and <italic>MAP3K7</italic> respectively, are significantly concurrent with mutations in <italic>SPOP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). When comparing individually <italic>CHD1</italic> deletions, <italic>MAP3K7</italic> deletions, and <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations, we did not observe significant differences in genomic burden for any one lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>B) Figure panel 1F has now been updated with this larger set. The clonality fraction for <italic>SPOP</italic> mutation, <italic>CHD1</italic> deletion and <italic>MAP3K7</italic> deletion are 93.2%, 66.3%, and 88.1%, respectively.</p><p>C) Further, we studied the dependencies of the 3 lesions using the larger dataset. The data still supports <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations preceding CHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>). These observations are based on algorithm we developed to build tumor evolution paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baca et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prandi et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>D) To specifically query the contribution of <italic>CHD1</italic> and <italic>MAP3K7</italic> deletions to the DNA damage phenotype, we included the deletion status in the annotation panel of the dendrogram from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. The cluster enrichment for <italic>CHD1</italic> deletion is borderline significant (in line with the strong association with <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations); no signal is detected for <italic>MAP3K7</italic>. We favor the inclusion of this panel as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> while maintaining <italic>SPOP</italic> annotation only in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as it is the focus of the study.</p><p><italic>4) The paper does not provide a molecular mechanism. Specifically, recent studies by Theurillat et al</italic>. <italic>indicate that mutations in</italic> SPOP<italic>, an E3 substrate binding protein, results in upregulation of specific protein substrates (DEK, TRIM24, for example) via a dominant negative mechanism. But this new study by Boyser et al. does not provide a mechanism of disrupted HR. Is SPOP inhibiting the degradation of some critical substrate which is causing the transcriptional response consistent with</italic> BRCA1 <italic>inactivation? Can the authors provide any additional data in this regard?</italic></p><p>In this current manuscript we focus on the biologic implications of <italic>SPOP</italic> mutations in the prostate cancer context. We agree wholeheartedly that the biochemical mechanism by which SPOP regulates DNA repair is a critical question for the field going forward. Defining the specific substrates potentially responsible for this biology will be a long process. For instance, BRCA1 is also a ubiquitin ligase clearly critical for DNA repair, yet the specific substrate of BRCA1 responsible for this function remains poorly defined over a decade after its discovery. This goal will require long-term mechanistic efforts outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>Minor comments [abridged]:</p><p><italic>1) The authors conclude that phosphorylation of ATR is not affected by SPOP mutations, but the blots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1F and H</italic></xref> <italic>are discordant in this sense. Please repeat with several biological replicates to define this issue</italic>.</p><p>The results presented originally were representative of at least three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).

The authors should comment on this, acknowledging that cell death could be due to p53 activation in this setting</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers correctly note that SPOP knockdown triggered a transcriptional response similar to p53 activation. The developmental phenotype resulting from this knockdown was observed with two different SPOP morpholinos and was rescued with human wildtype SPOP mRNA suggesting a SPOP-specific effect.
