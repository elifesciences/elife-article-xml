Despite the widespread recognition of tumor immunotherapy in treating unresectable GC, challenges, including ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance, persist. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1, particularly in the context of super-enhancers (SEs) and zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 1 (ZFP36L1) RNA-binding protein, is crucial. In this study, we performed H3K27ac Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) sequencing, investigated the heterogeneity of SEs between two GC subtypes with differential growth patterns, and revealed the immune escape signatures driven by ZFP36L1-SE in infiltrative GC through SEs inhibitors treatment. The regulation of ZFP36L1 to PD-L1 was evaluated by quantitative PCR, western blot, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we explored its regulatory mechanisms using a combination of molecular biology techniques, including luciferase reporter assay, GST/RNA pull-down, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)/RIP experiments, and in vivo functional assays. We demonstrated that ZFP36L1, driven by an SE, enhances IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression, with SPI1 identified as the specific transcription factor binding to ZFP36L1-SE. Mechanistically, ZFP36L1 binds to the adenylate uridylate-rich element in the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹUTR) of <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA, exacerbating its mRNA decay, and thereby facilitating PD-L1 abnormal transcriptional activation. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the SPI1-ZFP36L1-HDAC3-PD-L1 signaling axis in orchestrating immune escape mechanisms in GC, thereby offering valuable insights into the potential targets for immune checkpoint therapy in GC management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stomach neoplasm</kwd><kwd>super-enhancer</kwd><kwd>PD-L1</kwd><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 81871979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Jianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 82272894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Huiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2021J02056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Jianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2020CXB048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Huiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021D026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Huiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2023J011594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CUT-Tag is used to identify super-enhancers (SEs) for the first time in gastric cancer, and the mRNA decay mechanism activated by SE-driven ZFP36L1 in infiltrative gastric cancer along with innovative experimental evidence demonstrating SPI1/ZFP36L1/HDAC3/PD-L1 signaling axis are presented.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gastric cancer (GC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in China, thereby posing significant socio-economic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2023</xref>). The Ming classification, which categorizes GC into infiltrative and expanding subtypes based on distinct growth patterns, is pivotal in understanding the biological heterogeneity of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ming, 1977</xref>). Tumor immunotherapy, particularly targeting programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274), is a promising approach for unresectable GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guan et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, PD-L1, expressed on tumor cell surfaces, interacts with PD-1 receptors on cytotoxic T cells, leading to T-cell apoptosis and facilitating cancer immune evasion. Clinical studies, such as KEYNOTE-811, have demonstrated the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors, including pembrolizumab, especially in HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janjigian et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, current guidelines recommend the use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in GC cases with high PD-L1 combined positive scores. Despite these advancements, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 is imperative owing to challenges associated with ineffective immunotherapy and drug resistance.</p><p>Super-enhancers (SEs), initially proposed by Richard A Young, are densely clustered transcriptionally active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). SEs exhibit distinct characteristics, including heightened enrichment of histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), recruitment of numerous transcription factors (TFs) such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), MED1, and P300, and robust stimulation of target genes. Utilizing the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, researchers can identify and explore cancer-associated SEs through techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). In the epigenetic landscape of tumors, acquired SEs are implicated in promoting transcriptional dysregulation, contributing to oncogenesis, invasion, metabolic alterations, drug resistance, and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berico et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ye et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have elucidated the unique SE landscape in mesenchymal-type GC and highlighted the role of EMT-related kinase NUAK1 at both transcriptional and epigenetic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ho et al., 2023</xref>). However, further investigations are warranted to elucidate the effects of SEs during GC metastasis and immune evasion.</p><p>The zinc-finger protein 36 (ZFP36) gene family encodes three RNA-binding proteins: ZFP36, zinc finger protein 36 ring finger protein-like 1 (ZFP36L1), and ZFP36L2, characterized by two CCCH-type tandem zinc finger domains. These proteins recognize adenylate uridylate-rich elements (AREs) in the 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA deadenylation and degradation, ultimately diminishing protein synthesis. ZFP36 targets multiple inflammatory factors thereby playing a crucial role as an anti-inflammatory factor closely associated with inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Snyder and Blackshear, 2022</xref>). <italic>ZFP36L2</italic> has been identified as an SE-activated gene with proto-oncogenic functions in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xing et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>ZFP36L1</italic>, also known as <italic>TIS11B</italic>/<italic>BRF1</italic>, is primarily located in the q24.1 region of human chromosome 14, with a length of 8599 bases long. The gene exhibits three annotated transcripts, with NM_004926.4 being the predominant transcript. The encoded protein comprises 338 amino acids and contains two tandem zinc finger structural domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export signal region. It is distributed across the nucleus, cytoplasm, and subcellular structural apparatus. Despite ongoing debates regarding its role, ZFP36L1 remains a subject of interest in tumor biology.</p><p>We previously identified differential protein expression patterns in expanding and infiltrative GC, notably observing increased levels of MED1 and P300 in infiltrative GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hong et al., 2023</xref>). Based on these findings, we postulated that infiltrative GC may exhibit heightened enhancer activity and dysregulated transcription. To validate this hypothesis, we aimed to compare the distribution of SEs between Ming-expanding and infiltrative GC. ZFP36L1-SE was then identified as the key SE in infiltrative GC. Additionally, we aimed to elucidate the significance of SE-driven ZFP36L1 in tumor immune evasion and the SPI1-ZFP36L1-HDAC3-PD-L1 signaling axis. Collectively, we believe that our findings would contribute to a deeper understanding of immune checkpoint therapies for GC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SE heterogeneity between two subtypes of GC with differential growth patterns</title><p>Six GC samples were collected, and H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag sequencing was performed for the first time to identify of GC SEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two GC growth patterns did not significantly differ in terms of typical enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, a bimodal H3K27ac enrichment was observed in infiltrative GC compared with that in expanding GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A total of 1057 and 819 infiltrative and expanding SE peaks, respectively, were obtained using the ROSE algorithm.

Therefore, we speculated that ZFP36L1 is a key molecule for immune escape in infiltrative GC, and ZFP36L1-SE (chr14:68806839–68816867) is a probable cause of transcriptional dysregulation as it is situated upstream of the <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>).

Targeting SE regions with various single-guide RNAs has confirmed the pathogenicity of TOX2-SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). While the CRISPR/Cas9 system was not directly investigated in this study, the biological mechanism underlying ZFP36L1-SE was indirectly corroborated using ChIP, BRD4 co-immunoprecipitation, and luciferase assays. The interactions between promoters and SEs are reportedly mediated by CCCTC-binding factor loops. Recently, researchers have identified novel regulatory elements within SEs, termed ‘facilitators,’ which highlights the significance of SE integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blayney et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, SEs can transcribe SE RNA, which is beneficial for chromatin openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2023b</xref>). Collectively, further investigation into the functional architecture of SEs is warranted.</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms governing SE formation is currently a prominent area of research. <italic>PDZK1IP1</italic> is an acquired SE-driven oncogene in primary colorectal tumors, with its encoded protein regulating the pentose phosphate pathway to promote tumor redox capability. Although PDZK1IP1-SE does not initially exist in colon cancer cell lines, its production is stimulated by abundant inflammatory factors within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). These acquired somatic mutations exert influence over transcriptional epigenetic regulation. Acquired SEs in GC exhibit a high binding affinity for CDX2 or HNF4α, alongside enriched chromatin interactions and cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ooi et al., 2016</xref>). Liu et al. identified a genetic variation (SNP rs10470352) within the SOX2-SE region through a joint analysis of genome-wide association studies and HiChIP. This sequence variation enables TP73/RUNX3 occupancy, promoting active chromatin and upregulating <italic>SOX2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2023b</xref>). However, the infiltration-specific nature of ZFP36L1-SE raises questions regarding whether its pro-tumor function is attributable to somatic mutations.</p><p>We demonstrate for the first time that ZFP36L1 driven by ZFP36L1-SE promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Given that the mRNA of numerous inflammatory factors and oncogenes harbor AREs in their 3ʹUTR, ZFP36 family proteins are typically regarded as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory agents. Loh et al. proposed that <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> deletion mutations are characteristic of urological tumors owing to their targeting of hypoxic mRNAs or cell cycle markers, such as <italic>HIF1A</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, and <italic>E2F1</italic>, thereby promoting their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loh et al., 2020</xref>). The authors also reported the inhibition of the HDAC family by ZFP36L1. In small-cell lung cancer, inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1 triggers <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> expression, leading to the decay of <italic>SOX2</italic> mRNA and attenuation of tumor neuroendocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>). This highlights the complex role of ZFP36L1, thereby cautioning about simple dichotomy.</p><p>Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a key member of the HDAC family (which includes HDAC1 through HDAC11), is pivotal in regulating histone acetylation and deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2024</xref>). By modulating chromatin accessibility, HDAC3 influences transcriptional processes. It often forms co-repressor complexes with other chromatin remodeling factors to inhibit histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Beyond its role in histone modification, HDAC3 has been implicated in the regulation of non-histone proteins, broadening its functional scope. Notably, HDAC3 antagonizes the activity of P300, catalyzing the deacetylation of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and contributing to transcriptional repression. Recent studies highlight its collaboration with HDAC1 in catalyzing histone de-succinylation at promoter regions—an epigenetic mark associated with transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2023a</xref>).</p><p>Novel treatment regimen in combination with anti-PD-L1 mainly enhanced CD8+ T-cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>). Several studies have proposed that reducing PD-L1 expression enhances the tumor-killing effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and reduces primary tumor foci in vivo. Conversely, findings from this study suggest that PD-L1 expression is associated with immune evasion in metastatic foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klement et al., 2023</xref>). The upstream regulation of PD-L1 expression occurs at both mRNA and protein levels. The well-established JAK-STAT/IRF1 signaling pathway primarily governs IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 transcription, with certain oncogenes such as <italic>DENR</italic>, <italic>UBR5</italic>, and <italic>SOX10</italic> promoting tumor immune evasion via activation of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yokoyama et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, CD274-associated transcriptional regulators include <italic>HIF1A</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, and <italic>YBX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ru et al., 2024</xref>). Shang et al. demonstrated that MTHFD2 facilitates <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc glycosylation of the c-MYC protein during metabolic reprogramming, thereby activating PD-L1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shang et al., 2021</xref>). However, ZFP36L1 disrupts <italic>HDAC3</italic> mRNA, leading to PD-L1-mediated immune evasion independent of the aforementioned TFs. It destabilizes the regulatory region of <italic>CD274</italic>, enhances histone acetylation, and promotes chromatin accessibility. Likewise, depletion of <italic>ZNF652</italic> disrupts the formation of the HDAC1/2-MTA3 co-repressor complex, resulting in elevated PD-L1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2023a</xref>). Conversely, the m6A reader IGF2BP1 binds to the 3ʹUTR, initiating m6A modification and stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The regulatory mechanisms governing PD-L1 predominantly involve post-translational modifications and subcellular relocalization. K48-linked deubiquitination by USP2 and N-glycosylation by B4GALT1 stabilize PD-L1 and prevent its degradation. Both K48-linked de-ubiquitination by USP2 and N-glycosylation by B4GALT1 are able to stabilize and prevent degradation of PD-L1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cui et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kuang et al., 2023</xref>). TRIM28 overexpression in GC reportedly prevents proteasomal degradation of PD-L1 protein through SUMOylation, as well as promotes PD-L1 transcription by activating the mTOR and TBK1-IRF1 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). However, ZFP36L1 primarily exerts a negative influence on signaling pathways and is not associated with protein modification. In terms of subcellular relocalization, the mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer patients obstructs the mitochondrial translocation and autophagic degradation of PD-L1, resulting in increased membranous PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2023</xref>). ZFP36L1 reportedly forms a subcellular compartment with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the formation of membrane-less organelles in the TIS11B (ZFP36L1) granule ER domain. Within this domain, the interaction between SET and CD47/CD274, which harbor multiple AREs, promotes membrane protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>); follow-up studies are warranted to comprehensively elucidate its role.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings elucidate the regulation of the SPI1-ZFP36L1-HDAC3-PD-L1 axis in infiltrative GC and highlight immune escape signatures driven by SEs. These findings offer complementary insights for the application of immunotherapy in GC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and tissues</title><p>MKN45 and MGC803 are derived from human GC; 293T is from human embryonic kidney cells; and MC38 is sourced from mouse colorectal cancer cells.

They used human gastric cancer tissues from six patients and performed H3K27ac CUT&amp;Tag to unbiasedly identify SE specific for the infiltrative type. They identified an SE driving the expression of ZFP36L1 and immune evasion through upregulation of PD-L1. Mechanistically, they show that SPI1 binds to ZFP36L1-SE and ZFP36L1 in turn regulates PD-L1 expression through modulation of the 3'UTR of HDAC3. This mechanism of PD-L1 regulation in gastric cancer is novel, and ZFP36L1 has not been previously implicated in GC progression. However, the data presented are largely correlations and no direct proof is presented that the identified SE regulates ZFP36L1 expression. Furthermore, the effect of ZFP36L1 manipulation elicited a modest effect on PDL1 expression. In fact, several cell lines (XGC1, MNK45) express abundant ZFP36L1 but no PD-L1, suggesting the ZFP36L1 per se is not a key stimulant of PD-L1 expression as IFNg is. Thus, the central conclusions are not supported by the data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Use of human GC specimens to identify SE regulating PD-L1 expression and immune evasion.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The difference in H3K27ac over the ZFP36L1 locus and SE between the expanding and infiltrative GC is marginal (Figure 2G). Although the authors establish that ZFP36L1 is upregulated in GC, particularly in the infiltrative subtype, no direct proof is provided that the identified SE is the source of this observation. CRISPR-Cas9 should be employed to delete the identified SE to prove that it is causatively linked to the expression of ZFP36L1.</p><p>(2) In Figure 3C the impact of shZFP36L1 on PD-L1 expression is marginal and it is observed in the context of IFNg stimulation. Moreover, in XGC-1 cell line the shZFP36L1 failed to knock down protein expression thus the small decrease in PD-L1 level is likely independent of ZFP36L1. The same is the case in Figure 3D where forced expression of ZFP36L1 does not upregulate the expression of PDL1 and even in the context of IFNg stimulation the effect is marginal.</p><p>(3) In Figure 4, it is unclear why ELF1 and E2F1 that bind ZFP36L1-SE do not upregulate its expression and only SPI1 does. In Figure 4D the impact of SPI overexpression on ZFP36L1 in MKN45 cells is marginal. Likewise, the forced expression of SPI did not upregulate PD-L1 which contradicts the model. Only in the context of IFNg PD-L1 is expressed suggesting that whatever role, if any, ZFP36L1-SPI1 axis plays is secondary.</p><p>(4) The data presented in Figure 6 are not convincing. First, there is no difference in the tumor growth (Figure 6E). IHC in Figure 6I for CD8a is misleading. Can the authors provide insets to point CD8a cells? This figure also needs quantification and review from a pathologist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96445.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Xujin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Wangyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Lingyun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Jingjing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Jianchun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Huiqin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Xiamen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) All the figure legends need to expand significantly, so it is clear what is being presented.

In this study, the key molecule ZFP36L1 was identified as a target gene through the characterization of the super-enhancer ZFP36L1-SE. The enrichment of H3K27ac at this site meets the threshold defined by the ROSE algorithm, and transcription of ZFP36L1 is regulated by BRD4, making it susceptible to inhibition by the super-enhancer inhibitor JQ1. Although we were unable to directly observe the effects of knocking out the ZFP36L1-SE via Cas9 due to experimental constraints, we believe that the indirect evidence we have gathered is sufficient to demonstrate the super-enhancer's driving role. This approach is consistent with the conventions of previous studies on super-enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The descriptions of Figures 1B, C, and D are very poor.

As described in the manuscript, the function of SE peaks depends on their location. Figure 1C shows the distribution of these peaks, where &quot;Over 50% of these peaks were located in the non-coding regions such as exons and introns, and their predicted target genes were transcribed to produce non-coding RNAs; the peaks distributed in transcription start and termination sites activated the promoters and directly drove the transcription of protein-coding genes&quot;.

Our intention with Figure 2G was to present the position of ZFP36L1-SE at a macro level rather than focusing on specific details. This broader view is meant to provide context for the SE region in relation to the surrounding genomic landscape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The use of JQ1 does not prove something is a super enhancer, just that it is BRD4 regulated and might be a typical enhancer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The role of JQ1 as a super-enhancer inhibitor has been widely reported and recognized in the literature. Its use in experimental studies targeting super-enhancers is a well-established practice. We acknowledge that while JQ1 inhibition indicates BRD4 regulation, it is consistent with the identification of super-enhancers as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) An explanation of how the motifs were identified in E1 is needed. Enrichment over what? Were they purposefully looking for multiple motifs per enhancer? Otherwise what it all comes down to later in the figure is a single motif, and how can that be &quot;enriched&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. We used the MEME-ChIP online tool for motif identification, which is a widely recognized method in transcription factor research. MEME-ChIP applies established algorithms to identify known motifs within DNA sequences.

Due to experimental constraints, we are unable to include this depletion experiment in the current study. We appreciate your understanding and will consider this suggestion for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The authors start jumping around cell lines, sometimes with little justification. Why is MGC803 used in Figure 4I rather than MKN45? This might be due to more endogenous SPI1. However, this does not make sense in Figure 5M, where ZFP36L is overexpressed in this line rather than MKN45. If SPI1 is already high in MGC803, then the prediction is that ZFP36L1 should already be high. Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. We want to clarify that we are not arbitrarily jumping between cell lines. Each experiment was validated in two different cell lines. We aimed to present representative results within the constraints of the manuscript, but if more detailed results from additional cell lines are needed, we can provide them upon request. Regarding your concern, results from the MKN45 cell line are consistent with those observed in MGC803, and these findings are not influenced by SPI1 or ZFP36L1 expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) In Figure 5, HDAC3 should also be depleted to show opposite effects to over-expression (as the latter could be artefactual). Also, direct involvement should be proven by ChIP.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your feedback. We acknowledge that depleting HDAC3, in addition to overexpressing it, would provide a more comprehensive analysis. Unfortunately, due to experimental constraints, we are unable to include this depletion experiment in the current study. We recognize these limitations and appreciate your understanding. We will consider these aspects for future research. Additionally, we would like to clarify that HDAC3 is a histone deacetylase and not a transcription factor, so it does not directly bind to DNA and therefore is not suitable for ChIP analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Figure 5G and H are not discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

Why are three patients selected here? Are these supposed to be illustrative of the whole cohort? What sub-type of GC are these?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The three patients with infiltrative GC shown in Figure 6C were selected as representative images based on prior reviewer suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Figure 6E onwards, they switch to MFC cell line. They provide a rationale but the key regulatory axis should be sown to also be operational in these cells to use this as a model system.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We would like to clarify that we used the MC38 cell line, which is a colon cancer cell line, rather than MFC. Our focus was on demonstrating the role of ZFP36L1 in vivo, rather than specifically discussing the regulatory axis in this context. We chose MC38 cells instead of MFC cells due to practical considerations. Specifically, MFC cells were shown in our experiments to be unable to form tumors in wild-type mice, despite previous reports suggesting their tumorigenicity. We will provide a rationale for this choice in the manuscript. We acknowledge that validating the entire regulatory axis in the MC38 cell line would enhance the study's depth. However, due to experimental constraints, we are unable to complete this additional validation. We appreciate your understanding and will consider this aspect for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2(Public Review):</bold></p><p>(17) The difference in H3K27ac over the ZFP36L1 locus and SE between the expanding and infiltrative GC is marginal (Figure 2G). Although the authors establish that ZFP36L1 is upregulated in GC, particularly in the infiltrative subtype, no direct proof is provided that the identified SE is the source of this observation. CRISPR-Cas9 should be employed to delete the identified SE to prove that it is causatively linked to the expression of ZFP36L1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. In this study, the key molecule ZFP36L1 was identified as a target gene through the characterization of the super-enhancer ZFP36L1-SE. The enrichment of H3K27ac at this site meets the threshold defined by the ROSE algorithm, and transcription of ZFP36L1 is regulated by BRD4, making it susceptible to inhibition by the super-enhancer inhibitor JQ1. Although we were unable to directly observe the effects of knocking out the ZFP36L1-SE via Cas9 due to experimental constraints, we believe that the indirect evidence we have gathered is sufficient to demonstrate the super-enhancer's driving role. This approach is consistent with the conventions of previous studies on super-enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) In Figure 3C the impact of shZFP36L1 on PD-L1 expression is marginal and it is observed in the context of IFNg stimulation. Moreover, in XGC-1 cell line the shZFP36L1 failed to knock down protein expression thus the small decrease in PD-L1 level is likely independent of ZFP36L1. The same is the case in Figure 3D where forced expression of ZFP36L1 does not upregulate the expression of PDL1 and even in the context of IFNg stimulation the effect is marginal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your detailed observations. In our study, the regulatory effect of ZFP36L1 on PD-L1 was validated at the mRNA level, protein level, and through flow cytometry, with each experiment being repeated multiple times. The results of the Western blot were quantitatively assessed using densitometry rather than relying solely on visual inspection. It is important to note that interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulation significantly enhances PD-L1 expression, which under the same exposure conditions, may make the baseline expression of PD-L1 appear unchanged. This could explain the marginal effect observed under IFNγ stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) In Figure 4, it is unclear why ELF1 and E2F1 that bind ZFP36L1-SE do not upregulate its expression and only SPI1 does. In Figure 4D the impact of SPI overexpression on ZFP36L1 in MKN45 cells is marginal. Likewise, the forced expression of SPI did not upregulate PD-L1 which contradicts the model. Only in the context of IFNg PD-L1 is expressed suggesting that whatever role, if any, ZFP36L1-SPI1 axis plays is secondary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments. First, ELF1, E2F1, and SPI1 were predicted transcription factors, and experimental validation is crucial. Our results specifically demonstrate that only SPI1 binds to ZFP36L1-SE, while ELF1 and E2F1 do not, confirming the specificity of SPI1. Second, Second, as mentioned in point (18), experimental results, such as those from western blot, should not be evaluated by eye alone. Our findings are quantitatively assessed, and the regulatory relationships have been confirmed through repeated experiments. This finding is supported by multiple experimental validations, including mRNA, protein, and flow cytometry analyses. Furthermore, using IFNγ to study the regulation of PD-L1 is a common and widely accepted approach in this field. Many studies adopt this model, and it should not be concluded that the axis is secondary simply because PD-L1 expression is observed primarily under IFNγ stimulation. Similarly, other popular research areas, such as ferroptosis and autophagy, also use specific inducers, but this does not diminish the significance of the pathways being studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) The data presented in Figure 6 are not convincing. First, there is no difference in the tumor growth (Figure 6E). IHC in Figure 6I for CD8a is misleading. Can the authors provide insets to point CD8a cells? This figure also needs quantification and review from a pathologist.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding this observation, we will provide an explanation in the discussion section: &quot;Several studies have proposed that reducing PD-L1 expression enhances the tumor-killing effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and reduces primary tumor foci in vivo. Conversely, findings from this study suggest that PD-L1 expression is associated with immune evasion in metastatic foci.&quot; We are unsure why those studies concluded that PD-L1 expression levels would impact the size of the primary tumor. We are more inclined to support the perspective of John et al.Klement JD, Redd PS, Lu C, et al.
