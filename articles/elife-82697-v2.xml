hypothesized to separate independent streams of information related to the encoding and recall of memories. At the cellular level, the discovery of hippocampal memory cells (engram neurons), as well as the modulation of memory recall through optogenetic activation of these cells, has provided evidence that certain memories are stored, in part, in a sparse ensemble of neurons in the hippocampus. In previous research, however, engram reactivation has been carried out using open-loop stimulation at fixed frequencies; the relationship between engram neuron reactivation and ongoing network oscillations has not been taken into consideration. To address this concern, we implemented a closed-loop reactivation of engram neurons that enabled phase-specific stimulation relative to theta oscillations in the local field potential in CA1. Using this real-time approach, we tested the impact of activating dentate gyrus engram neurons during the peak (encoding phase) and trough (recall phase) of theta oscillations. Consistent with previously hypothesized functions of theta oscillations in memory function, we show that stimulating dentate gyrus engram neurons at the trough of theta is more effective in eliciting behavioral recall than either fixed-frequency stimulation or stimulation at the peak of theta. Moreover, phase-specific trough stimulation is accompanied by an increase in the coupling between gamma and theta oscillations in CA1 hippocampus. Our results provide a causal link between phase-specific activation of engram cells and the behavioral expression of memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>theta

memory activity, often referred to as engram cells, has offered evidence that certain memories are stored in a sparse set of neuronal ensembles across the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>). These cells are active during the encoding of a memory and reactivate upon recall of that specific event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tayler et al., 2013</xref>). Further, artificial reactivation of engram neurons induces recall-like behavior, thus establishing a causal role for these neurons in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have utilized activity-based neural tagging strategies, which link expression of a protein of interest (e.g. Channelrhodopsin) to the expression of immediate early genes (IEG) (most commonly Arc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denny et al., 2014</xref>] and cFos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>]) to tag and modulate active populations during a specific event. The modulation of memories through activity-based tagging of engram neurons has often targeted cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>); a brain structure in the temporal lobe with a modular design that consists of three major sub-regions: the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1, all with extensive interconnectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Squire et al., 2004</xref>). Each of the sub-regions has distinct connectivity patterns that potentially provide unique stages in the processing of memories.</p><p>Recently, studies have probed this functional organization by driving engram neurons in different regions of the hippocampus, such as DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>) and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies, however, there have been discrepancies in the most effective stimulation frequency, both between regions and within regions (cCompare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohkawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). Further, studies have been limited to activating engram neurons using fixed-frequency stimulation, without taking into consideration the ongoing spontaneous network activity. In particular, hippocampal regions are dominated by a quasi-periodic 4–10 Hz network-wide theta oscillation in the field potential generated by temporally organized firing during memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colgin, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The hippocampus is tasked with both encoding of new information and recalling past experiences. A prominent model, termed the Separate Phase of Encoding and Recall (SPEAR) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>), posits that encoding and retrieval are temporally interleaved at different phases of hippocampal theta oscillations. In the SPEAR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasselmo and Stern, 2014</xref>), the peak of the hippocampal theta oscillation (as measured in <italic>striatum pyramidale</italic>) is dominated by inputs from the entorhinal cortex, which carry sensory information that is potentially required for the encoding process. In contrast, the trough (negative peak) of theta oscillations occurs during strong CA3 activity, a region of the hippocampus known for pattern completion that is supported through strong recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rolls, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Senzai, 2019</xref>), and thus ideally suited for the retrieval of previously stored memories.</p><p>The SPEAR model has been supported by electrophysiological data in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerrén et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwag and Paulsen, 2009</xref>). These studies have indicated that the peak of theta oscillations is associated with strong long-term potentiation, which can support the encoding process, while the trough of theta has strong long-term depression that supports the recall of previously stored memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douchamps et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manns et al., 2007</xref>). In behaving mice, memory performance can be altered through phase-specific inhibition of neurons in CA1, the output region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Finally, a recent study in human subjects has shown a strong correlation between memory tasks and the phase of theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kragel et al., 2020</xref>). Despite these results, as well as the prior development of closed-loop optogenetics stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grosenick et al., 2015</xref>), the activation of engram neurons has been carried out at fixed frequencies, without taking into account the phase of theta oscillations.</p><p>Here, we tie the modulation of engram neurons to specific phases of theta oscillations. We hypothesize that trough stimulation is more effective than peak or fixed frequencies of stimulation for inducing artificial memory reactivation. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a real-time phase prediction algorithm and tested the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of theta-phase-specific stimulation of DG memory neurons in gating memory recall. We measured theta in CA1 to be consistent with past literature and the SPEAR model. We tagged and reactivated memory neurons in DG rather than CA3, as would be ideal in a test of the SPEAR model. We did this because reactivation of tagged CA3 neurons is not well studied and tends to generate seizure-like activity (unpublished data), presumably because of the higher probability of connection among CA3 pyramidal cells. In contrast, DG stimulation causes robust behavior without generating seizure-like activity. We compared the results of phase-specific stimulation with those using fixed-frequency stimulation at the previously established value of 20 Hz, as well as stimulation at 6 Hz, which provided a control representing the average stimulation frequency during phase-specific activation. Our results support the SPEAR model, with optogenetic stimulation of engram neurons in DG at the trough (recall) phase driving the most robust behavioral recall and the largest amount of coupling between the theta and gamma rhythms in CA1 region.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Closed-loop photo stimulation at specific phases of theta oscillations</title><p>To date, engram work has used fixed-frequency optogenetic stimulation to reactivate tagged cells and drive behavior linked to memory recall. For example, most studies have used 20 Hz stimulation, which is well above the natural firing rates measured in the DG (1 Hz on average, with peak rates of 8 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that a more physiologically realistic stimulus pattern, in terms of both firing rate and timing, would reactivate memories more effectivity. To test our hypothesis, we developed a protocol that phase-locked the stimulation time to the theta rhythm.</p><p>To deliver photo-stimulation at specific phases of the theta oscillation, we used a custom and a real-time phase detection-and-prediction algorithm. Our algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) reads the LFP from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and filters it using a finite impulse response filter between 4 and 10 Hz implemented in the Real-Time eXperimental Interface (RTXI) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ndlBU/phase_specific_stim">https://github.com/ndlBU/phase_specific_stim</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noueihed, 2022</xref>). The algorithm predicts the timing of the next desired extremum by averaging the duration of previous cycles and sends a TTL pulse to drive the laser at the predicted time of either the peak or the trough of the next theta cycle. The phase of theta oscillations is in reference to measures in <italic>striatum pyramidale</italic> in the hippocampus. If the location of the electrode, as determined by post hoc histological analysis (see Methods), was observed to be in another layer of the hippocampus, we corrected for this change (trough vs. peak) to ensure similar theta phase across animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of the real-time phase detection algorithm performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LFP signal recorded from the hippocampus is amplified and processed in Real-Time eXperimental Interface (RTXI) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ndlBU/phase_specific_stim">https://github.com/ndlBU/phase_specific_stim</ext-link>). The signal is first filtered using an FIR filter in the theta range (4–12 Hz) and then a real-time phase detection algorithm predicts the next extrema. At the predicted time, a TTL pulse is sent to the laser which delivers light through fiber optics to the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus to activate tagged neurons.

Hence, we compared the performance of our real-time algorithm and phase-specific stimulation with fixed-frequency stimulation at 6 Hz. We also performed experiments with 20 Hz stimulation, as this is a commonly used stimulation frequency in past studies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cii</xref>, the use of closed-loop stimulation resulted in significantly more phase-specific stimulation: 83%, 84% true negative rate (TNR, specificity) for peak and trough stimulation, respectively, as compared to 46% and 3% TNR with 6 Hz and 20 Hz stimulations, respectively. These results indicate that our algorithm has a low rate of stimulation outside of the desired phase, which is critical to testing our hypothesis. Moreover, sensitivity of the algorithm is moderately superior to the 6 Hz stimulation with a true positive rate (TPR) of 58% and 59% for peak and trough, respectively, as compared to 54% for 6 Hz. Since a 20 Hz stimulation rate is about two times higher frequency than theta oscillations, it results in a constant, non-specific stimulation (TNR and TPR of 3% and 97%, respectively). The specificity of the algorithm is critically important in ensuring we are not confounding the results with a high rate of stimulation at the opposite phase. In terms of sensitivity, a higher than 50% value from the algorithm is satisfactory as we do not expect that during natural memory processing the animal is encoding or recalling the memory during every theta cycle.

Importantly, our setup was designed to test different modes of stimulation within the same animal. Further, our experimental design randomized the order of the stimulation in different animals as repeated engram reactivation can affect the original memory. The experiment took place in two different contexts: a neutral context A and a fearful context B. As detailed in the Methods section, the two different contexts were differentiated based on a variety of sensory stimuli (see Methods). Animals were first habituated to handling and exploration in the neutral context A. Habituation took place over 4 days, during which both fiber optics and the LFP electrodes were attached to acclimatize the mice to the setup. Light stimulation took place, but as no opsin was expressed yet the light resulted in no behavioral change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cii</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ci</xref>, the animals were anxious on day 1 as shown by the higher amount of freezing (15%).

Animal freezing on the last day of habituation was used as a measure of baseline freezing change for the rest of the experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Cii</xref>, freezing increased by about 5% during the trial. Following habituation, animals were taken off doxycycline 48 hr prior to fear conditioning to allow for the tagging of engram neurons. On the tagging day, animals freely explored context B for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, pre-FC). Over a second, 5 min interval, experimental animals (FS+) received four 1.2 mA foot shocks, while the control animals (FS-) were left to explore freely. Both experimental and control animals showed minimal freezing prior to the shocks, with only experimental animals exhibiting elevated freezing after the foot shocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Post fear conditioning, animals were put back on a doxycycline diet and returned to a new home cage.

Despite the elevated freezing (10%), neutral context A freezing was lower than the freezing following fear conditioning (45%) or during recall (46%) of the fearful memory in context B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> vs. 2E). However, the increased baseline freezing in neutral context A obscured the light-induced freezing and, therefore, required the artificial memory reactivation to generate higher freezing levels to be deemed effective. It is important to note that the elevated baseline freezing is similar across days, making it possible to pool data from different days. As a result of the elevated baseline freezing, an effective stimulation needed to be powerful enough to elicit a behavioral response (increase in percent time freezing) beyond the elevated baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trough stimulation leads to stronger and more robust recall</title><p>Next, we compared the effects of engram reactivation via different modes of stimulation using phase-specific and fixed-frequency stimulation.

For this measure, the change in freezing relative to the baseline prior to the stimulation was calculated by subtracting the percent time freezing in epochs 2 and 4 from epochs 1 and 3, respectively. The average of these two values is referred to as light-induced freezing, and represents the increased memory reactivation due to optogenetic stimulation of memory cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, only 6 Hz and trough stimulations resulted in significantly higher values of light-induced freezing when compared with the control animals receiving the same stimulation. Further, paired comparisons of the amount of light-induced freezing during each stimulation indicated that only trough stimulation elicits light-induced freezing values significantly different than the habituation trials. As a result, the increase in freezing in the cases of peak stimulation, as well as 20 Hz and 6 Hz fixed-frequency stimulations, were like those expected from a general increase in the animal’s immobility in later trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Direct comparisons of trough and peak stimulations within each animal showed significantly higher freezing values when using trough stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The analysis indicated that activating engram neurons at the trough of theta was more effective at inducing artificial recall of a tagged memory. We also found that the experimental group showed significantly higher freezing post reactivation of engrams in the neutral context A, which we believe indicates a potential strengthening of the original tagged memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Electrophysiological hallmarks during different forms of stimulation indicate changes in gamma-theta coupling following trough stimulation</title><p>Having established that trough stimulation is the most effective stimulus in driving freezing behavior, we sought to identify physiological hallmarks of its efficacy. To start, we analyzed the LFP recordings from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Although CA1 is downstream of DG, the optogenetically stimulated region, it presents an opportunity to uncover the resulting network dynamics from the stimulation. Representative traces show characteristic theta frequency oscillations. After filtering, the theta oscillations become more apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, theta oscillations were higher in frequency during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, see the ‘bumps’ in the blue lines in the right panels) when compared with measurements made during freezing (red lines). This trend held during all epochs of the experiment regardless of the presence or absence of the stimulation. Similarly, results were not different when using different modes of stimulation (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of theta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrates that theta power is not significantly different in freezing vs. non-freezing conditions.

We show that activating DG memory neurons during the trough of the theta field potential is most effective at inducing recall of stored memories and yields the most robust behavioral outcome corresponding to successful artificial reactivation of the tagged memory. When artificial recall is elicited through phase-specific stimulation, the behavioral outcome is well correlated with an increase in phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations, which has been established as an electrophysiological correlate of memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kragel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tort et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have observed frequency dependence in eliciting behavioral responses across different regions of the hippocampus. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>, activated CA1 memory neurons using 4 Hz optogenetic stimulation and observed consistent behavioral responses, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohkawa et al., 2015</xref>, were able to drive behavior with 20 Hz stimulation in the same region. In the case of DG, the majority of past studies have used 20 Hz stimulation to drive engram activation despite the rate being much higher than natural DG granule cell firing rates in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our results support the SPEAR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>), as well as a general role for theta oscillations in organizing memory recall in the hippocampus. The effectiveness of trough stimulation in eliciting recall is also consistent with previous experiments in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douchamps et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>) and human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kragel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerrén et al., 2018</xref>) performing memory tasks. However, given the artificial nature of our reactivation protocol, it is unlikely that we are regenerating quasi-natural, circuit-wide activity. For example, to avoid generating seizure-like activity, we stimulated in DG rather than CA3. It seems quite unlikely that our rather crude reactivation protocol replicates the intricate phase relationships of cellular activity, relative to theta, that are seen in careful measurement of cellar inputs and outputs in DG, CA3, and CA1 under natural conditions of recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, because we are not measuring theta where we are reactivating, we do not know if our driven DG activity is properly phase-locked with the local theta rhythm in <italic>stratum granulosum</italic>, which is typically antiphase from theta in CA1 <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, our results align well with predictions of the SPEAR model, and it says something about the robustness of hippocampal functional organization that this artificial drive yields a positive result. Our results support the SPEAR model and move the field closer to more naturalistic manipulations in the brain. Direct measures of neuronal activity in CA1 and CA3 are required to further understand the downstream effects of in phase and out of phase engram activation in DG. Additional future work could investigate methods to induce more naturalistic recall optogenetically by incorporating previously measured temporal sequences of activity with high spatial resolution. Though exceedingly challenging, such experiments might potentially drive more robust behavioral responses and would represent a detailed test of the SPEAR model.</p><p>Our controls included open-loop stimulation at both 6 Hz, representing the average frequency of our closed-loop stimulation, and 20 Hz, representing a standard value for such studies. Although open-loop, 6 Hz stimulation was moderately effective in eliciting recall, recall only occurred when the baseline freezing rate was low. It should be noted that this mode of activation is close to the peak physiological firing rates of the DG granule and mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>). Despite the success of 20 Hz stimulation in artificial recall of the tagged memory in DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohkawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>), we did not observe significant light-induced freezing with this frequency of stimulation. A possible explanation for this discrepancy was the presence of an elevated baseline freezing rate post fear conditioning in the neutral context in our study (average 10% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>] versus less than 5% in previous studies [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>]). As a result, the elevated baseline freezing could be masking the effect of the 20 Hz stimulation. Moreover, based on the distribution of enhanced and inhibited freezing with 20 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we hypothesize that this frequency of stimulation could both activate or inhibit engram neurons. In support, work measuring the impact of mossy fiber stimulation on CA3 neuron firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) indicates that 20 Hz stimulation of DG mossy fibers can potentially lead to inhibition of CA3 neurons through feedforward inhibition. For this reason, the potential inhibition caused by 20 Hz stimulation could lead to a lack of stimulation efficacy. In contrast, Lee et al. also showed that 6 Hz stimulation can have a net positive effect on CA3 neuron activity, which is consistent with us observing elevated light-induced freezing during 6 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Testing all four different forms of stimulation within a single subject to control for inter-subject variability, however, did not allow us to assess the specific effects of each type of stimulation on the original memory. Future experiments could conduct the same stimulation within one animal to assess the efficacy of certain forms of stimulation in eliciting artificial recall and its impact on the original memory and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Theta-gamma coupling was found to be modulated only in the trough stimulation during the stimulation epoch relative to the pre- and post-stimulation baselines. In past literature, slow gamma (25–50 Hz) is associated with CA3 inputs to CA1 during recall, though the frequency ranges for each sub-band of gamma vary between publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colgin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colgin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).

Instead, we saw significant modulation in the mid-gamma band of 55–85 Hz, typically associated with EC input during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colgin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colgin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with prior literature, but not with the recall phase, we found that the mid-gamma modulation arrived at the descending phase of theta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). We have two potential hypotheses for this discrepancy. First, the neuronal circuitry responsible for artificial and natural memory reactivation may be distinct, as the Tet-tag system has been shown to primarily label excitatory cells. This difference between natural and artificial memory reactivation could result in different LFP signatures. Second, it is possible that the induction of a fear memory also results in the encoding of the context. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from experiments demonstrating that engram stimulation in DG with opposite valence stimuli can re-associate the tagged cells with the new stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We tried to limit variability of behavioral results by employing a number of exclusion criteria, as described in the Methods section. We tested the data to look for factors that could explain the remaining variability, and found that the MI was significantly correlated with freezing, but only for trough-phase stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result suggests to us that the behavioral variability we see has underpinnings in neural processing.</p><p>Results presented here open the door for an exciting line of research with regard to a role of theta oscillations in the context of memory processing. Future studies using phase-specific activation of engram neurons will greatly benefit from combining stimulation with calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>) or high-density electrode arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jun et al., 2017</xref>), which could provide single neuron- and network-based mechanisms for hippocampal theta oscillation function during memory processing. Another potential research route for probing the role of theta oscillations in memory gating is through a comparison of encoding and recall engram neurons in the CA3 and EC regions, respectively. For example, we expect tagged CA3 neurons, which are associated with the recall of a fearful memory, to be more robustly reactivated when stimulating at the trough of theta. To our knowledge, however, no studies to date have demonstrated the successful artificial reactivation of memories in CA3. We also hypothesize that EC inputs to the hippocampus can be tagged during the encoding of an experience, with subsequent peak stimulation of the tagged neurons during a second experience disrupting the encoding of that event.</p><p>In conclusion, our systematic investigation of engram neuron activation using different modes of stimulation provides new insights regarding the impact of stimulation frequency and phase on engram reactivation, as well as the utility of using a closed-loop photo-stimulation approach. Work to follow should allow the community to refine these early experiments to reproduce behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of normal recall more closely.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were done in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use and Biosafety Committees. We exclusively used adult C57BL/6 wild type male mice (aged 4–8 months). Exclusion of female mice from the study was based on the observation that female mice expressed elevated anxiety relative to male mice, which made assessing fear responses very difficult. Animals were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sampling and exclusion criteria</title><p>No statistical methods were used to determine the sample size; the number of subjects per group was determined based on previously published studies. We used 53 male mice in the current study, with 10 serving as control and 43 as experimental animals. Animals were randomly assigned to the experimental versus control group. Mice were included in the analysis based on pre-defined factors regarding viral expression, effects of the light stimulation, and the quality of LFP recording. If the experimental animals did not show at least 5% increase in their freezing as a result of engram reactivation on 2 out of 4 days of the experiment, they were excluded. Seventeen (17) animals showed lack of effects from the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The exclusion was further confirmed based on virus expression using post hoc manual inspection of brain slices. All mice that exhibited behavioral effects had high levels of expression. Further, since it was crucial for phase-locked stimulation to have an LFP signal with low noise, if the quality of LFP was deemed unsatisfactory to drive reliable phase-locked stimulation, the animal was removed from further analysis. Low-quality LFP affected 1 control animal and 10 experimental animals. The exclusion left 17 experimental animals and 9 control animals for the analysis. Additionally, if the LFP was post hoc located in DG rather than CA1, then the peak and trough data were switched due to the reversal of theta between the regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>). This change only affected 2 of the 26 mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgeries</title><p>To express the virus, as well as implant the fiber optics and the electrode, animals underwent stereotaxic surgery 3–4 weeks prior to the start of the behavioral experiments. Twenty-four hours prior to the surgery, animals were put on 40 mg/kg doxycycline diet. For the surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.8–2%) vaporized in room air. Bilateral holes were drilled above the dorsal DG at 2.2 mm anterioposterior (AP); ±1.3 mm mediolateral (ML) from Bregma. To express channel rhodopsin in engram neurons, animals were bilaterally injected with AAV9-TRE-ChR2-EYFP acquired from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at a depth of 1.8 mm dorsoventral (DV) from the surface. A total of 200 nl of the virus was injected using a 10 nl syringe (World Precision Instruments [WPI]) fitted with a 33-gauge needle (NF33BL; WPI), at a speed of 50 nl/min that was controlled via a microsyringe pump (UltraMicroPump 3–4; WPI). Post injection, one side was implanted with a fiber-optic cannula (200 μm core diameter, 0.39 numerical aperture; Doric Lenses). Following that, the other side was implanted with a costume single LFP electrode (diameter 125 μm, acquired from inVivo1) glued to a fiber optic. Cannulas were implanted at –1.6 mm DV above the injection site. The electrode was targeted to stratum pyramidale layer of CA1 region of the hippocampus. Location of the electrode was validated post hoc using Prussian Blue staining to identify the tip of the electrode and ensure correct phase of theta was measured. Craniotomy was secured with a layer of metabond followed by dental cement. Postop animals received an intraperitoneal injection of the analgesia Buprenorphin (0.2–0.5 mg/kg) which was continued for 48 hr post surgery every 8–12 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>After recovery, prior to behavioral experiments, mice were handled daily to habituate them to the transportation and researchers. For the first few days, handling was accompanied with a small treat. Behavioral experiments started after animals were acclimatized to the experimenter, behavioral testing was conducted in a 30.5×24×21 cm<sup>3</sup> conditioning chambers (Med Associates). During all the trials, both fiber optics and the LFP electrode were plugged in to normalize the effects of the distress between all trials.</p><p>Two contexts were designed for the experiment. The fearful context B contained the bare chamber with metal rods on the bottom, aluminum side walls and a 20 kHz, 40 dB noise source. In the neutral context A, walls and the floor were covered with striped papers along with an ambient white light.</p><p>Wooden cage bedding was present on the floor and walls were infused with an orange scent. Animals’ behavior was monitored using a near-infrared camera.</p><p>The experiment started with 4 days of habituation for the animals. During which animals were exposed to context A while both fiber optics and the LFP electrode were plugged in. The trial was designed to be the same as the experimental trial. On each day animals stayed in the chamber for four 3 min epochs alternating between no stimulation and stimulation. The habituation days got the animal acclimatized to the experimental environment, with data from the last day used as a baseline for the rest of the experiment.</p><p>Mice were taken off doxycycline 48 hr prior to the tagging experiment. To tag engram neurons, animals were introduced to context B, and after 5 min of exploration, the experimental group received four 1.2 mA electrical foot shocks over the next 5 min. Control group animals did not receive any foot shocks. Subjects were put back on the doxycycline immediately after the experiment. In following day, animals were put back in context B, to assess recall of the fearful behavior.</p><p>Testing the different stimulation setups was done in context A over 4 days. At the conclusion of the fourth day, mice were re-exposed to context B on day 5, after which mice were being sacrificed and perfused for histological analysis. This last step was performed to assess the long-term effects of artificial reactivations on the original memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reactivation of engram neurons</title><p>To test the effectiveness of different stimulation setups, engram neurons for each animal were optogenetically activated in the context A over 4 days. The order of different stimulations was randomized to control for possible effects of repeated stimulation using an equal number of animals for each stimulation at each specific order. Engram reactivation on each day consisted of four 3 min epochs: no stimulation, stimulation, no stimulation, and last epoch of stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology and optogenetics stimulation</title><p>LFP signals were gathered via custom electrodes created by inVivo1. Signals were recorded using a head-stage connected to a Molecular Devices, Axon Instrument amplifier, and digitizer. Digitized signal was recorded at 1 kHz. The closed-loop algorithm implemented in RTXI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), filtered the signal at 2–10 Hz and delivered a TTL pulse to drive a DPSS Single Longitudinal Mode 473 nm laser (optoEngine LLC) at a predicted time for stimulation (peak or trough or fixed frequency).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral scoring</title><p>In order to remove experimenter’s bias from the analysis, an open-source Python package named ezTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>) was used to score the freezing during each trial. Parameters for the analysis of motion were manually tuned and kept consistent between trials of the same day in the same animal. For the mice to be considered freezing, it required the animal to remain still for at least 6 s. To ensure accuracy of the algorithm, random blinded trials were hand scored and compared with the automated analysis. Since there was no significant difference between the two, the automated analysis was kept for all trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Slice preparation and histology</title><p>After completion of experimental manipulations, animals were introduced to context B for the last recall. Ninety minutes after testing, animals were transcardially perfused with cold PBS and tissue fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS with ferrocyanide dissolved in the solution (10%). Brains were extracted and after 24 hr storage in 4% PFA, 50–100 μm slices were prepared. For EYFP staining, slices were incubated at 4°C with PBS and 0.2% Triton and normal goat serum solution for 1 hr, followed by an incubation period with a primary anti GFP chicken antibody 1:1000 (Invitrogen, catalogue # A-10262). After 48 hr of incubation, slices were washed and then incubated with a secondary antibody 1:500, Alexa 488 goat-anti chicken (Invitrogen catalogue # A-11039) for 1 hr. Slices were washed and mounted on a slide with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories H-1000-10) containing a DAPI stain (stain for cell bodies). Olympus FV3000 was used for confocal imaging of slices and a z stack of 10 μm thick slices was acquired.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For each of the statistical analyses, both visual inspection of the distribution histogram and Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was performed. Following the determination of normal distribution, Levene’s test for equality of variance was performed to determine appropriate variables in the test. In all the cases, data were normal and paired or independent t-test was applied to test for significance. In cases of multiple comparison, the Bonferroni correction of multiple comparisons was used. All the statistical tests were done in Python, using custom scripts taking advantage of SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>) package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>LFP analysis</title><p>LFP analysis was performed through custom Python scripts.

For the spectral analysis, zero-mean signal was bandpass filtered from 1 to 100 Hz using a fourth-order Butterworth filter. A notch filter was applied to remove the 60 Hz noise (fourth-order Butterworth band-stop filter, with a center frequency of 60 Hz). Spectral content was estimated using a multi-taper method (9 tapers) with a 5 s sliding window, and 1 s overlap.</p><p>To identify the actual phase of theta, and determine sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm, post hoc analysis was performed. Data was filtered using fourth-order Butterworth filter (4–10 Hz bandpass) and a Hilbert transform was performed to determine the phase of signal. If the stimulation was within quarter cycle of the peak (0 degree) or trough (180 degree), it was considered on target for respective stimulations, otherwise it was considered off target. Sensitivity was calculated by dividing the number of stimulations by total number of in-phase extrema detected. Specificity was calculated by dividing number of out-of-phase extrema not stimulated by the total number of out-of-phase extrema.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>PAC analysis</title><p>A metric adopted from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tort et al., 2010</xref>), termed the MI, was applied to identify the coupling between gamma amplitude and theta phase. This metric is defined through comparing the amplitude distribution through a theta cycle with a uniform distribution. The phase from the Hilbert transform of the LFP filtered at theta range (4–10 Hz) was used as the phase signal. Amplitude of Hilbert transform of the LFP filtered at slow gamma frequency (35–55 Hz) and mid-gamma frequency (55–85 Hz) was used as the amplitude distribution. Data was binned in twenty 18 degree bins, with the amplitudes normalized by the average amplitude of the signal. This normalized distribution (P) was compared to a uniform distribution (U) using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. MI was calculated by dividing the KL divergence by logarithm of the number of bins (N).<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">U</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Comodulograms, like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, were created by calculating MI between theta and gamma by binning the phase frequencies in bands of 4 Hz, steps of 1 Hz and amplitude frequencies in bands of 20 Hz and steps of 5 Hz.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

functional role of hippocampal theta oscillations and one related to the behavioral impact of engram reactivation, and thus the findings have implications for our understanding of memory that will impact multiple subfields. In combination with additional context from the literature, the important findings are supported by solid evidence supporting the conclusion that memory recall operations occur preferentially at a specific phase of theta.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82697.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Colgin</surname><given-names>Laura L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Siegle</surname><given-names>Josh</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03cpe7c52</institution-id><institution>Allen Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Fernandez-Ruiz</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05bnh6r87</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.27.513992">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.27.513992v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Josh Siegle (Reviewer #1); Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify why the dentate gyrus was chosen for stimulation and discuss the implications of recording in CA1 while stimulating in the dentate gyrus.</p><p>2) The authors should expand γ analyses and better explain γ methods and results.

The rationale for dentate and its role in the SPEAR hypothesis should be explained in the introduction.</p><p>– It is unclear how the authors correct for theta phase differences based on the location of the electrode. The authors state if the recording location is deemed out of the striatum pyramidal then it was &quot;corrected&quot; but the correction method and accuracy are unclear.</p><p>– Could the mice see the laser light during stimulation? Did that affect their behavior?</p><p>– How many DG cells were labeled? How many were stimulated? Did that have an effect on freezing behavior? Is this study labeling and stimulating similar numbers of neurons and areas of DG as prior studies, especially those that did see a significant increase in freezing with 20Hz stimulation?</p><p>– The statistical approach needs revisions. Many statistical comparisons were made in freezing behavior without controlling for multiple comparisons. Multiple comparisons should be taken into account. In some cases the statistical tests used are unclear, e.g. Figure 3Bii, C, and D.</p><p>– The figures need clarification and lack key info. First, several figures/captions lack an adequate explanation of colors or acronyms. Some examples:</p><p>– Throughout color meaning should be indicated in the caption.</p><p>– Line plots throughout do not note errors being shown.</p><p>– Statistical details beyond p-values are required: n and the statistical tests used are also required.</p><p>– Figure 2Ci – caption is missing or mislabeled as C.</p><p>– Figure 2Cii: What are X and Stim on the x-axis? Needs to be explained.</p><p>– Figure 2E left graph – you cannot see the color of the smallest bars. They should be labeled with words/letters.</p><p>– Figure 3A – define E and C or use FS+ and FS- in the legend. Define x.</p><p>– Is each dot with the box plots an animal or a day or something else?</p><p>– Figure 3B – what do open vs filled box plots mean?</p><p>Second, some figure colors are unclear/confusing:</p><p>– Figure 1Ci – is there green (20Hz stim)? If so, I can't tell where.</p><p>– Figure 2 – the pink and purple are hard to distinguish. Looking at Figure 2E left graph I could not tell if that was Habituation or Engram Reactivation, eg pink or purple.</p><p>– Figure 3 – A schematic showing the stimulation paradigm and interleaved stimulation trials is warranted. I am confused about how long was given between different types of stimulation.</p><p>– The authors show that theta trough stimulation of DG cells increases medium γ coupling to theta while other stimulation parameters do not increase. Slow γ is thought to correspond to periods of stronger CA3 input to CA1, while medium γ is thought to correspond to periods of stronger EC input to CA1. The authors should explicitly examine these different gammas separately and their modulation by theta. What phase of theta is each γ coupled to after trough or peak stimulation? Does this shift from baseline coupling? If the authors find trough stimulation increased theta modulation of medium γ, in particular, they should explain how this fits into their hypothesis that this stimulation leads to stronger CA3-CA1 coupling when other works suggest this should result in more slow γ.</p><p>– The discussion and Figure 6 caption imply that peak stimulation is disrupting CA1 activity due to the arrival of the CA3 input at the same time as EC inputs. This could be described further to support the behavioral result in 5D. Is there any data to support this point?</p><p>– Is there any correlation with freezing behavior in the 20 or 6 Hz groups?</p><p>– What was the modulation index of animals that did not show light-induced freezing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors tag and manipulate engram cells in the DG but they performed analysis on CA1 LFPs and used the CA1 theta phase as a reference signal. While this is not necessarily a problem per se, it needs to be explicitly addressed and its implication discussed. Likewise, through the text allusions to work on CA1 are used to interpret results from DG manipulations without a clear rationale.</p><p>– The abstract should state that engram cells are been tagged and reactivated in the DG. The title will also be more informative if instead of 'hippocampal memory neurons' it said 'dentate gyrus engram neurons'.</p><p>– The inputs that impinge DG granular cells during theta are different from those received by CA1 pyramidal cells. This needs to be explained, either in the Introduction or the Discussion. CA1 receives input from CA3 at the descending theta phase and from entorhinal layer 3 at the trough (e.g. Mizuseki et al., Neuron, 2009; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Neuron, 2017). On the other hand, entorhinal input to DG granular cells originates in layer 2 and arrives at the trough of the CA1 pyramidal layer theta cycle (e.g. Mizuseki et al., Neuron, 2009; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Science, 2021). It would be also useful to mention that the theta phase completely reverses from the CA1 pyramidal layer to the DG (e.g., Buzsaki, Neuron, 2002).</p><p>– If memory encoding and retrieval occur at the same theta phase in CA1 and DG is not yet clear. This needs to be acknowledged as most of the supporting references cited are for CA1. This can actually add additional value to the present paper and previous work (e.g. Siegle et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2014) was done in CA1.</p><p>– It needs to be explicitly discussed the potential relationships between stimulating DG cells, the behavioral effects observed, and the fact that LFP analysis was done in CA1. The current discussion on the topic lacks depth, and misses some details (e.g., different phases and layers of origin of entorhinal inputs to CA1 and DG). Excessive speculative statements (e.g., &quot;Activating engrams neurons in DG at the trough of theta leads to in-phase activation of CA3 neurons&quot;) should be removed or supporting evidence provided.</p><p>Statistics and n's are missing for several analysis</p><p>– In figure legends, the n of both animals and sessions that went into each analysis should be clearly stated</p><p>– The metric plotted in each case should also be clearly stated. For example, what do the shaded error bars in Figure 2A represent, mean +/- SEM? What do boxplots represent, median +/- CI?</p><p>– Figure 4 is missing all statistics and n's (e.g., spectral power comparison across states). That whole figure should be better described. Also, panels A and B are missing voltage and colormap scales respectively.</p><p>Theta-γ analysis in Figure 5 has several issues that need to be corrected.</p><p>– It needs to be clearly stated from which layer the LFP signals came, as there are strong laminar differences in CA1 γ oscillations (e.g., Schomburg et al., Neuron, 2014; Lasztoczni and Klausberger, Neuron, 2014)</p><p>– The following sentence is not accurate: &quot;Our analysis indicated that the MI was highest between the phase of theta filtered at 4-8 Hz frequency and the amplitude of 55-85 Hz γ, known as mid γ. This is similar to previous observations in CA1 (Jiang et al. 2020; Schomburg et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2019) and consistent with CA3 inputs to CA1 driving recall of memories (Colgin 2015, 2016)&quot;. The papers cited, and many others (e.g., Colgin et al., Nature, 2009; Bieri et al., Neuron, 2014; Lasztoczni and Klausberger, Neuron, 2014; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Neuron, 2017; Lopes dos Santos et al., Neuron, 2018) show that CA3 input to CA1 in dominant is a slower γ band (~30-50 Hz) while entorhinal input is of higher frequency (60-100 Hz), the so-called 'mid γ' sub-band.</p><p>– Related to the point above, in the comodulograms of Figure 5Aii I only see the mid-γ component (thus most likely the EC3 to CA1 input) but not the slow γ (the CA3 to CA1 input). The authors can refer to the papers mentioned above to see how at least 3 γ sub-bands are typically found with CFC analysis in CA1. This should be acknowledged in the manuscript. More importantly, the authors should try to separate slow and mid-γ sub-bands and then interpret their results in terms of CA3 and EC3 inputs to CA1. To further verify this separation, theta-phase γ-amplitude analysis can be conducted, as EC3 mid-γ input arrives at the CA1 theta peak and CA3 slow γ input at the descending phase.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Theta-phase-specific modulation of dentate gyrus memory neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined in the individual reviews below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my initial review, I assumed (along with the authors) that the stronger theta-γ coupling observed during trough stimulation was associated with the enhanced flow of information between CA3 and CA1, as is expected during memory recall. However, the other two reviewers correctly pointed out that the modulation occurred at higher γ frequencies (55 Hz and above), which likely indicates stronger coupling between EC and CA1 (associated with stronger encoding). The authors now acknowledge the apparent contradiction here and have removed the schematic previously shown in Figure 6. Since this undermines a key argument of the original manuscript, they should discuss more possible explanations for their observations, rather than just attributing it to the &quot;somewhat abnormal&quot; effects of their optogenetic intervention. For example, there could actually be stronger coupling theta-slow γ coupling in a different portion or layer of hippocampus, but they've just failed to record it-they mention earlier in the discussion that the sites of recording and reactivation are not spatially aligned. In addition, it's highly plausible that the induction of a fear-related freezing state *does* lead to stronger encoding of the present environment, and hence stronger EC-CA1 interactions. The reactivation of the contextual memory may occur within the first few cycles of stimulation, after which the physiological measurements in the trough stimulation condition are most strongly influenced by differences in behavioral state. It would also be helpful to clarify what is meant by &quot;future imaging experiments should help us understand why our γ modulation experiments differ from those seen in normal behavior.&quot;</p><p>In their response to reviewers, the authors state that &quot;stringent inclusion criteria were used to ensure that mice had adequate viral expression levels.&quot; Although there is a note that the behavior-based exclusion criteria was &quot;further confirmed&quot; based on &quot;post-hoc analysis of brain slice slides,&quot; there is no information about how this analysis was conducted. What was the threshold for adequate expression? Were there any mice that showed behavioral effects but had low expression levels?</p><p>The frequency range that corresponds to &quot;mid γ&quot; is not stated consistently across the manuscript. The authors should also mention that the specific boundaries (and name) of this frequency band are not universally agreed upon in the literature.</p><p>It's fine if the authors want to continue their approach of combining capital letters and roman numerals in the figure panel labels, but I still maintain that most readers would appreciate if they switched to the more commonly used convention of consecutive letters for all panels. Closely related panels can be associated with a single letter, as they already are in Figures 2E and 4B, for example.</p><p>In several figures, the &quot;6 Hz&quot; condition is still written as &quot;06 Hz&quot;</p><p>Figure 2 – The authors state they have changed days to trial numbers, but this change does not appear in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Figure 3 – The authors state they have changed the &quot;E&quot; and &quot;C&quot; labels, but this change does not appear in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Figure 5 – Sub-panel Aii actually shows the modulation index for a frequency range from 25-90 Hz. The axis labels for this panel should be changed to &quot;γ frequency&quot; and &quot;theta frequency,&quot; since &quot;frequency of amplitude&quot; and &quot;frequency of phase&quot; are not valid terms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82697.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify why the dentate gyrus was chosen for stimulation and discuss the implications of recording in CA1 while stimulating in the dentate gyrus.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to stimulate in DG rather than in CA3 for two, interrelated reasons.

Repeating this approach allows us to compare our data with those from the bulk of the literature, including recent work from the Ramirez lab involving calcium imaging in CA1 (Zaki et al. 2022, <italic>Neuropsychopharmacology</italic>). Second, reactivation of memory-encoding cells in CA3 tends to led to seizures that confound results and are unpleasant for the mouse (Ramirez, personal communication), presumably because of the degree of mutual excitation in this structure. As discussed in detail in our response to Reviewer #3, this experimental design has important implications that we did not discuss adequately in the previous version of the manuscript.

For example, we excluded animals that did freeze in response to light drive of the channelrhodopsin. Additional factors such as baseline freezing both during habituation and during each trial were investigated on an individual basis, but lacked clear trends (data not shown). We did see that the modulation index was correlated with levels of light induced freezing during trough stimulation (Figure 5D), indicating that mice with more successful optogenetic manipulation of the natural brain rhythms responded with larger behavioral changes.

I am confused about how long was given between different types of stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The schematic in Figure 2 has been updated to be more clear and consistent with terminology, and we have explained the experimental paradigm more clearly. Now, trials are days of reactivation, while epochs are within a single day of stimulation. There were habituation trials, tagging, recall, and reactivation trials. Each mouse was stimulated with one of the frequencies on a single day, with the order of the stimulations across days balanced so that each stimulation type was equally represented across all four days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors show that theta trough stimulation of DG cells increases medium γ coupling to theta while other stimulation parameters do not increase. Slow γ is thought to correspond to periods of stronger CA3 input to CA1, while medium γ is thought to correspond to periods of stronger EC input to CA1. The authors should explicitly examine these different gammas separately and their modulation by theta. What phase of theta is each γ coupled to after trough or peak stimulation? Does this shift from baseline coupling? If the authors find trough stimulation increased theta modulation of medium γ, in particular, they should explain how this fits into their hypothesis that this stimulation leads to stronger CA3-CA1 coupling when other works suggest this should result in more slow γ.</p></disp-quote><p>As we note in the revised discussion, elicited increases in theta-γ coupling are by far strongest for medium γ, in contrast with results for natural recall. Light-stimulated effects on slow γ are not statistically significant (Appendix 1, Figure 2). We believe this anomalous effect is due to the artificial memory reactivation, where an entire group of neurons are activated simultaneously. Additionally, engram neurons expressing channelrhodopsin are typically excitatory cells, which further differentiates this manipulation from natural recall. In future work, when the downstream effects of engram reactivation are understood, a stronger explanation may emerge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discussion and Figure 6 caption imply that peak stimulation is disrupting CA1 activity due to the arrival of the CA3 input at the same time as EC inputs. This could be described further to support the behavioral result in 5D. Is there any data to support this point?</p></disp-quote><p>The convergence of simultaneous inputs in CA1 is our working hypothesis of why peak stimulation does not elicit as strong of a behavioral effect as trough stimulation, though we have not investigated the physiological basis for this result. We hope that future work will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the behavior observed. As emphasized in the revised document, the discussed hypothesis is based on the previous literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there any correlation with freezing behavior in the 20 or 6 Hz groups?</p></disp-quote><p>There was no correlation between freezing behavior and the modulation index in the 20 Hz or 6 Hz groups. Because the peak and trough groups are the only groups with physiological stimulation, we felt it was only necessary to show them in Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What was the modulation index of animals that did not show light-induced freezing?</p></disp-quote><p>Because those animals did not show light induced freezing, they were excluded from all analysis. The lack of light induced freezing could stem from a range of reasons, with some so basic as having poor viral expression to where trying to categorize all of the cases would be tedious and potentially not very fruitful. For that reason, we elected to limit the scope of our analysis to mice showing behavioral effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors tag and manipulate engram cells in the DG but they performed analysis on CA1 LFPs and used the CA1 theta phase as a reference signal. While this is not necessarily a problem per se, it needs to be explicitly addressed and its implication discussed. Likewise, through the text allusions to work on CA1 are used to interpret results from DG manipulations without a clear rationale.</p><p>– The abstract should state that engram cells are been tagged and reactivated in the DG. The title will also be more informative if instead of 'hippocampal memory neurons' it said 'dentate gyrus engram neurons'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made it clear in the revised Abstract and title that the tagged and reactivated cells were in DG. Due to shifts in the field over what constitutes an engram, that term was intentionally avoided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The inputs that impinge DG granular cells during theta are different from those received by CA1 pyramidal cells. This needs to be explained, either in the Introduction or the Discussion. CA1 receives input from CA3 at the descending theta phase and from entorhinal layer 3 at the trough (e.g. Mizuseki et al., Neuron, 2009; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Neuron, 2017). On the other hand, entorhinal input to DG granular cells originates in layer 2 and arrives at the trough of the CA1 pyramidal layer theta cycle (e.g. Mizuseki et al., Neuron, 2009; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Science, 2021). It would be also useful to mention that the theta phase completely reverses from the CA1 pyramidal layer to the DG (e.g., Buzsaki, Neuron, 2002).</p><p>– If memory encoding and retrieval occur at the same theta phase in CA1 and DG is not yet clear. This needs to be acknowledged as most of the supporting references cited are for CA1. This can actually add additional value to the present paper and previous work (e.g. Siegle et al., eLife, 2014) was done in CA1.</p><p>– It needs to be explicitly discussed the potential relationships between stimulating DG cells, the behavioral effects observed, and the fact that LFP analysis was done in CA1. The current discussion on the topic lacks depth, and misses some details (e.g., different phases and layers of origin of entorhinal inputs to CA1 and DG). Excessive speculative statements (e.g., &quot;Activating engrams neurons in DG at the trough of theta leads to in-phase activation of CA3 neurons&quot;) should be removed or supporting evidence provided.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises several excellent points here. By not expressing ourselves clearly enough, we appeared to be overstating our results. In the revised manuscript, we have added the following clarifications.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>We have revised the Abstract and the title to make it clear we tagged and reactivated cells in the DG.

Our goal was to drive CA3 inputs to CA1 using the practical but indirect method of stimulating tagged DG neurons. We did not demonstrate that we were driving CA3 inputs to CA1 at the trough, nor did we recreate natural recall-related activity in DG, CA3, and CA1. Our positive results add a new piece to the puzzle here, as we note in the revised Discussion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>As the reviewer notes, natural activity throughout the hippocampal formation is far more intricate and complex than in our experiments. We have modified the discussion, eliminating the last figure, which we think contributed to the perception that we were making overly bold claims. We have added suggested content to the Discussion about the intricacy of natural, phase-locked activity in the region.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics and n's are missing for several analysis</p><p>– In figure legends, the n of both animals and sessions that went into each analysis should be clearly stated</p></disp-quote><p>n values and statistical tests have been added to all figure captions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The metric plotted in each case should also be clearly stated.

This is similar to previous observations in CA1 (Jiang et al. 2020; Schomburg et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2019) and consistent with CA3 inputs to CA1 driving recall of memories (Colgin 2015, 2016)&quot;. The papers cited, and many others (e.g., Colgin et al., Nature, 2009; Bieri et al., Neuron, 2014; Lasztoczni and Klausberger, Neuron, 2014; Fernandez-Ruiz et al., Neuron, 2017; Lopes dos Santos et al., Neuron, 2018) show that CA3 input to CA1 in dominant is a slower γ band (~30-50 Hz) while entorhinal input is of higher frequency (60-100 Hz), the so-called 'mid γ' sub-band.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was made in error, apologies. The Discussion section has been updated to include a more thorough review of how the theta-γ coupling results fit in with the prior literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Related to the point above, in the comodulograms of Figure 5Aii I only see the mid-γ component (thus most likely the EC3 to CA1 input) but not the slow γ (the CA3 to CA1 input). The authors can refer to the papers mentioned above to see how at least 3 γ sub-bands are typically found with CFC analysis in CA1. This should be acknowledged in the manuscript. More importantly, the authors should try to separate slow and mid-γ sub-bands and then interpret their results in terms of CA3 and EC3 inputs to CA1. To further verify this separation, theta-phase γ-amplitude analysis can be conducted, as EC3 mid-γ input arrives at the CA1 theta peak and CA3 slow γ input at the descending phase.</p></disp-quote><p>This additional analysis has been conducted and included in the supplementary figures. While there is modulation in mid-γ, surprisingly there is minimal modulation in the slow-γ band. We believe this discrepancy is due to the non-physiological stimulation taking place, with only excitatory cells in DG being activated. We find it unsurprising that a non-physiological stimulation would result in shifted hallmarks of network activity downstream relative to non-perturbed hippocampal function. These ideas have been added to the Discussion section in a separate paragraph.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined in the individual reviews below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In my initial review, I assumed (along with the authors) that the stronger theta-γ coupling observed during trough stimulation was associated with the enhanced flow of information between CA3 and CA1, as is expected during memory recall. However, the other two reviewers correctly pointed out that the modulation occurred at higher γ frequencies (55 Hz and above), which likely indicates stronger coupling between EC and CA1 (associated with stronger encoding). The authors now acknowledge the apparent contradiction here and have removed the schematic previously shown in Figure 6. Since this undermines a key argument of the original manuscript, they should discuss more possible explanations for their observations, rather than just attributing it to the &quot;somewhat abnormal&quot; effects of their optogenetic intervention. For example, there could actually be stronger coupling theta-slow γ coupling in a different portion or layer of hippocampus, but they've just failed to record it-they mention earlier in the discussion that the sites of recording and reactivation are not spatially aligned. In addition, it's highly plausible that the induction of a fear-related freezing state *does* lead to stronger encoding of the present environment, and hence stronger EC-CA1 interactions. The reactivation of the contextual memory may occur within the first few cycles of stimulation, after which the physiological measurements in the trough stimulation condition are most strongly influenced by differences in behavioral state. It would also be helpful to clarify what is meant by &quot;future imaging experiments should help us understand why our γ modulation experiments differ from those seen in normal behavior.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insight. We have updated the manuscript to reflect these ideas. The discrepancy between the mid-γ coupling during induced recall is a surprising result with many possible explanations. As you suggest, it is possible that the induction of a fear memory also results in the encoding of the context, as can be seen with memory re-association (Redondo et al., 2014). Another explanation is that the neuronal circuitry responsible for artificial and natural memory reactivation are distinct, thus resulting in different LFP signatures. In order to differentiate these possibilities, we believe calcium imaging provides more detailed insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying memory reactivation. These points have been added, clarified, and expanded upon in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their response to reviewers, the authors state that &quot;stringent inclusion criteria were used to ensure that mice had adequate viral expression levels.&quot; Although there is a note that the behavior-based exclusion criteria was &quot;further confirmed&quot; based on &quot;post-hoc analysis of brain slice slides,&quot; there is no information about how this analysis was conducted.
