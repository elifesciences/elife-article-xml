question of organelle size regulation. Most of the flagellar materials are transported from the cell body via an active transport process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). The rate of IFT entry into flagella, known as IFT injection, has been shown to negatively correlate with flagellar length. However, it remains unknown how the cell measures the length of its flagella and controls IFT injection. One of the most-discussed theoretical models for length sensing to control IFT is the ion-current model, which posits that there is a uniform distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels along the flagellum and that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current from the flagellum into the cell body increases linearly with flagellar length. In this model, the cell uses the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current to negatively regulate IFT injection. The recent discovery that IFT entry into flagella is regulated by the phosphorylation of kinesin through a calcium-dependent protein kinase has provided further impetus for the ion-current model. To test this model, we measured and manipulated the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella and quantified IFT injection. Although the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside of flagella was weakly correlated with the length of flagella, we found that IFT injection was reduced in calcium-deficient flagella, rather than increased as the model predicted, and that variation in IFT injection was uncorrelated with the occurrence of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not appear to function as a negative regulator of IFT injection, hence it cannot form the basis of a stable length control system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>intraflagellar transport</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM130327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Wallace F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM130908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delling</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A model for flagellar length control based on calcium influx is rejected based on quantitative measurements in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanism by which cells control the size of organelles is a fundamental question in cell biology. Cells control the size of their organelles to efficiently use their energy and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan and Marshall, 2012</xref>). However, it is mostly unknown how cells regulate organelle size, in part because the complexity of many organelles makes their size control mechanisms difficult to study. Eukaryotic cilia and flagella (we use these terms interchangeably) are an ideal model system to study size regulation because they consist of a simple, hair-like structure that can change in length while maintaining a constant diameter. Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the cell body and are important for sensing extracellular signals and producing fluid flows and cell locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). It is known that the length of cilia and flagella is cell type specific. For example, the biflagellate green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> adjusts the length of both flagella to a length suitable for swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottier et al., 2019</xref>). If the flagella are too long or too short, the cells cannot swim efficiently. When flagella are removed from a cell, new flagella regenerate to the pre-severing length in around 90min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenbaum et al., 1969</xref>). Flagellar growth slows before they become full-length. This decelerating growth rate suggests that there is some mechanism that regulates the growth rate as a function of length.</p><p>Assembly and maintenance of flagella are dependent on an active transport system, intraflagellar transport (IFT). Because no protein synthesis occurs in the flagellum, new materials must be brought into the flagellum and carried to the site of assembly at the flagellar tip. IFT mediates this transport. IFT is carried out by huge protein complexes called trains, which have an elongate shape and move on the flagellar axoneme back and forth like a train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pigino et al., 2009</xref>). IFT trains assemble around the basal body and then enter the flagellum in a process known as IFT injection, after which they are carried to the flagellar tip by a heterotrimeric kinesin-2 motor and returned to the cell body by cytoplasmic dynein 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van den Hoek et al., 2022</xref>). It is known that the rate of IFT injection is negatively correlated with the length of flagella during flagellar regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ludington et al., 2013</xref>), but it is unknown how cells regulate the rate of IFT injection. To explain this negative correlation, several theoretical models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan and Marshall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludington et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum, 2003</xref>).</p><p>One well-known model for the regulation of IFT injection is the ion-current model (also known as the ciliary-current model). The ion-current model was first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum, 2003</xref> based on a previous electrophysiological study showing that voltage-gated calcium channels were present in flagella at constant density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beck and Uhl, 1994</xref>), such that the number of voltage-gated calcium channels in the flagellum increases as the flagellum elongates. Changes in flagellar calcium concentrations, due to changes in the number and activity of calcium channels in the elongating flagella, were proposed to affect calcium-dependent signaling pathways to regulate the rate of IFT injection or microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum, 2003</xref>). In fact, changes in external Ca<sup>2+</sup> are known to change flagellar length in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefebvre et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quader et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tuxhorn et al., 1998</xref>). The calcium ion-current model was first proposed based on physiological measurements, but at the time, the molecular identity of the voltage-gated calcium channel in the flagellar membrane was not known. More recently, several calcium channel proteins have been shown to localize on the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>). CAV2 is a subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel which resides in the flagellar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>ppr2</italic> mutant has a mutation in the CAV2 gene and is defective in the photophobic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuda et al., 1998</xref>). TRP channels are also found in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the original ion-current model, it was not specified how Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributes to flagellar length regulation, but a potential molecular mechanism has been proposed by Pan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). They found that a subunit of heterotrimeric kinesin that drives IFT anterograde motion, FLA8/KIF3B, is phosphorylated by a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK1), and this phosphorylation negatively regulates IFT injection into flagella. Because this work provides a potential missing link in understanding the ion-current model, calcium-mediated regulation of IFT entry has increasingly been viewed as a likely means of regulating IFT in response to flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engelke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumari and Ray, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lechtreck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). There is thus a pressing need to test whether this model does in fact account for IFT regulation as a function of length. The ion-current model hinges on two critical assumptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), both of which are experimentally testable. First, the amount of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> needs to be an increasing function of the flagellar length. This assumption would allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> to serve as a length indicator within the ion-current model. Second, for the ion-current model to work, cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> must negatively regulate IFT injection or assembly of the axoneme. This is because if the amount of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases with the flagellar length, it must work as a negative regulator to control the length of flagella in order to have a stable length control system with negative feedback. If Ca<sup>2+</sup> positively regulated IFT injection, it could not be part of a stable feedback control loop and would instead produce positive feedback.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram and modeling of the ion-current model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ion-current model assumes the ion channels are uniformly distributed along the length of the flagellum, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the flagellum are proportional to the flagellar length. Flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> is assumed to negatively regulate IFT injection into flagella to control the flagellar length. The longer flagellum can intake more ions, and these ions inhibit IFT injection such that the further assembly of flagella is suppressed.

The amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside of flagella was indeed correlated with the length of flagella, as the model requires. However, IFT injection was reduced in calcium-deficient flagella, rather than increased as the model predicted. Moreover, CaCl<sub>2</sub>-treated cells increased the amount of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IFT injection. We then examined fluctuations of IFT at the time scale of individual injection events and compared these fluctuations to fluctuations in flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> and found no correlation, suggesting that flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not influence IFT injection at a short timescale. Thus, flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> apparently does not work as a negative regulator of IFT injection and therefore could not form the basis of a stable length control system. These observations are thus inconsistent with the ion-current model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model for the ion-current model using kinesin phosphorylation</title><p>Before testing the calcium-based model experimentally, we first asked whether it could provide a stable length control mechanism, even in theory. We constructed a simplified model for flagellar length dynamics assuming that calcium entry is proportional to the flagellar length and that kinesin-2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation mediated by CDPK1 as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>) and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Details of this model, which integrates IFT-mediated transport, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and CDPK activity modulating IFT entry, are provided in Materials and Methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, this model is able to produce a stable length control system, such that when flagella are removed they grow back to the correct length with decelerating kinetics that resemble those seen in actual flagella. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> further shows that the relative level of phosphorylation of kinesin changes during regeneration, smoothly increasing as the length increases, consistent with the experimental observations reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>. We note that this is a highly simplified model, and detailed numerical comparison to experiments is not useful since a number of parameters have unknown values. Nevertheless, this model serves to confirm the intuition that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx proportional to flagellar length, combined with CDPK-mediated regulation of IFT injection could, at least in principle, serve as a length control mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantitative flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> detection using GCaMP</title><p>The first assumption of the ion-current model that we explore is the requirement that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> amount in the flagellum should be an increasing function of flagellar length. To measure the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella, we constructed <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains that express GCaMP, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>), anchored in its flagella. GCaMP was fused to the C-terminus of dynein regulatory complex 4 (DRC4), an axonemal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rupp and Porter, 2003</xref>), and DRC4-GCaMP was expressed in the <italic>pf2-4</italic> mutant cells, a loss-of-function mutant of DRC4. DRC4-GCaMP was localized along the length of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and rescued the defective flagellar motility phenotype of the <italic>pf2-4</italic> mutant. DRC4 is a component of the Nexin-Dynein Regulatory Complex, which is a part of the 96 nm axonemal repeat, periodical structures on the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heuser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rupp and Porter, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the amount of DRC4-GCaMP is constant per unit length, and the total quantity of DRC4-GCaMP associated with axonemes is determined solely by the length of the flagella. We previously showed that the amount of axonemal proteins, such as FAP20 and RSP3, is constant per unit length using GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishikawa et al., 2022</xref>). This result means that our system using DRC4-GCaMP should be able to quantitatively detect flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DRC4-GCaMP quantitatively detects free Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bright-field and fluorescent images of DRC4-GCaMP cells.

Longer flagella generally allowed more Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx but also had greater variability.

Interestingly, the <italic>ppr2</italic> mutant reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx most strongly at the distal region of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This reduction is presumably caused by the loss of CAV2 protein, which localizes in the distal part of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiu et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, we tried to increase the amount of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> by raising the concentration of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

To test this prediction, we quantified the IFT injection using kinesin-associated protein (KAP), which is a subunit of the heteromeric kinesin-2 motor (IFT kinesin), tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). We focused on the kinesin-2 motor because this is the component of IFT that is apparently regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>).

This is the opposite of the prediction of the ion-current model. To confirm that flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> is related to this IFT reduction phenotype, we treated KAP-GFP cells with 1 mM EGTA and measured the intensity of IFT injection. EGTA treated cells showed reduced, rather than increased, IFT injection, similar to that seen in <italic>ppr2</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In contrast, the KAP-GFP cells treated with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> increased the intensity of IFT injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

Such a short time scale correlation might be important given that calcium shows spiking dynamics that are more regularly spaced than predicted by a Poisson distribution. These spikes could play a role in transiently delaying or shifting the time at which IFT injections occur, leading to a more regular or uniform IFT time series.

We selected kymograph regions in which there was no observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for at least 10 s before a Ca<sup>2+</sup> burst and analyzed successive 5 s intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this analysis, we did not find a statistically significant difference in intensity or frequency of IFT injection during the time windows before or after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). However, average speeds of both anterograde and retrograde IFT appeared to increase during Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The increase in average speed was due to the fact that paused IFT trains, which had an initial speed of zero, became re-activated during the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collingridge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fort et al., 2021</xref>). In experiments in which cells were treated with 1 mM EGTA, a slowdown of IFT trains was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, the background intensity of the mScarlet-IFT54 channel decreased after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). This background reduction means that IFT trains, which paused and accumulated during the prolonged absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, restarted with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Because most of the pausing IFT trains were retrograde IFT, the intensity of the returning IFT was transiently increased after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This result showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts can clear out the accumulated retrograde IFT trains from flagella. Additional examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. Because a portion of IFT trains, after returning to the base, can be reused as new anterograde IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wingfield et al., 2017</xref>), we expected that IFT injection might increase after a burst of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, due to the resulting release of paused retrograde trains. However, IFT injection did not obviously increase after the returning IFT trains reached the base of the flagellum in this time range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can restart paused IFT trains and increase the amount of returning IFT trains to the base of flagella, but that IFT injection is not controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in a short time and is not triggered by a transient increase in the arrival of retrograde trains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Quantification of IFT behavior after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the short-time analysis of IFT behavior after a burst of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx using dual-channel imaging.

Why then in our hands do we not observe the expected effect of calcium channel modulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion on length? For one thing, it has not been shown directly that this kinase requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> for its activity in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. CDPK1 has also been shown to regulate IFT turnaround at the flagellar tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>); however, recent studies showed that IFT can turn around at the tip without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chien et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nievergelt et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> might not be required for the activation of CDPK1. Furthermore, it is important to note that regulation does not have to imply feedback control. We modeled the phosphorylation of kinesin as occurring in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through the flagellar membrane, which is consistent with the original ion-current model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum, 2003</xref>). However, it is also possible that the phosphorylation is regulated by cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, which could be independent of the flagellum, thus constituting a separate regulatory input. In such a scenario, CDPK1 would not be part of a feedback loop because it would not be sensitive to flagellar length. This case may therefore be similar to the length-regulating kinase LF4 in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Null mutants in <italic>lf4</italic> have flagella that are approximately double the normal length, but their length is still regulated in the sense that length variation is constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 2021</xref>). Since length is still regulated in a null mutant of <italic>lf4</italic>, the kinase cannot be part of a feedback loop essential for length control. Instead, it is likely to carry information from other signaling pathways to alter the set-point of flagellar length. We speculate that the calcium-dependent regulation of kinesin entry into flagella during IFT may provide a way for cellular states, such as cell cycle or metabolic state, to influence flagellar length, and not as a feedback control loop necessary for length regulation per se. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang and Pan, 2013</xref> also showed that another calcium-dependent protein kinase, CDPK3, helps flagellar assembly at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. CDPK1 and CDPK3 may have opposite regulation over length control downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We speculate that regulation of some flagella related processes by cytoplasmic, rather than flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup>, may explain the long-known result that reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to shortening or loss of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefebvre et al., 1978</xref>) which has always stood in contradiction to the ion-current model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in flagellar length control</title><p>The ion-current model assumed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was stable. However, the amount of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> was highly dispersed around the trend line although on average it is correlated with flagellar length. This variability mostly came from the randomness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events. However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events did not match a Poisson distribution, consistent with the idea of Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursting. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may itself be regulated by some other process. A previous study found that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is evoked in the trailing flagellum during gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collingridge et al., 2013</xref>). Because our cells were also mounted on glass surfaces to image flagella, the gliding motility could also be one source of variation in our experiments. Because we imaged cells embedded in agarose, they were prevented from gliding extensively. Previous studies have also shown that poly-lysine-coated coverslips can increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx events in flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fort et al., 2021</xref>). These findings suggested that a mechanical stimulus on the flagellum is one of the triggers of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx between the two flagella might also be related to the phototactic behavior of <italic>Chlamydomonas. Chlamydomonas</italic> cells can change beat frequency and beat pattern of each flagellum to turn towards the light source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rüffer and Nultsch, 1991</xref>), and they are controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamiya and Witman, 1984</xref>). This phototactic response is mediated by the signal transduction from the photoreceptor, which is located at the eyespot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harz and Hegemann, 1991</xref>). Because these kinds of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are dependent on the specific local environment in which the cell might find itself, they are unlikely to produce a stable signal, making them less useful as an indicator of flagellar length.</p><p>The flagellar regeneration kinetics of 1 mM EGTA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were similar to results reported in rapamycin treated <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells. Rapamycin-treated cells also showed slower flagella regeneration kinetics, but the length of the flagellum eventually reached its original length before deflagellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>), and it is known that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for the activation of the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gulati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The slow regeneration kinetics of EGTA-treated cells might be caused by the inhibition of the cytoplasmic mTOR pathway. Other Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent processes in the cytoplasm might also potentially affect IFT, and our results cannot rule out this possibility. However, we note that the <italic>ppr2</italic> mutant also fails to show the effect on IFT or regeneration predicted by the ion current model.</p><p>It has been proposed that not only IFT injection, but also cargo loading onto IFT particles, is regulated as a function of flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Craft et al., 2015</xref>). Quantitative studies show that some or all of this apparent length-dependent cargo loading is a result of the fact that in longer flagella, IFT trains are shorter and thus have fewer tubulin binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wemmer et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the question arises whether flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> could play a role in regulating tubulin binding to the IFT particles. If this was the case, Ca<sup>2+</sup> would have to inhibit cargo binding, in order for cargo binding to decrease at longer lengths as has been reported. Reduction of flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> should thus lead to increased cargo binding, causing flagella to grow faster and/or to longer lengths. Our measurements of flagellar growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) show that in fact the opposite is true.</p><p>Taken together, our experimental test of the ion-current model for flagella length control appears to rule out an ion channel model based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into flagella. It is formally possible that some other ion might serve as a length sensor, but thus far Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the only candidate ion for which a plausible mechanistic link to IFT regulation has been reported.</p><p>We previously provided experimental evidence against two other potential length control models - an ‘initial bolus’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludington et al., 2015</xref>) in which IFT particles are initially injected into a newly formed flagellum but then recycle without being able to leave, as well as a ‘time-of-flight’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludington et al., 2015</xref>) in which IFT particles contain a molecular timer that tracks the time spent inside the flagellum as a proxy for flagellar length. Here we rule out a calcium-based ion-current model for length sensing as well. Of the models we have considered, the remaining model for length-dependent IFT regulation is one based on diffusive return of the IFT kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendel et al., 2018</xref>). The experiments presented here do not address this diffusion-based model, which is thus far the only model for which there is no opposing experimental evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Return of re-activated retrograde trains</title><p>When anterograde IFT trains reach the tip, they remodel into a different number of retrograde trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chien et al., 2017</xref>). Much less is known about possible remodeling of retrograde trains at the basal body in order to re-inject them. One possibility might be that some of returning IFT particles are immediately packaged into anterograde trains and re-injected back into the same flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wingfield et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We observed the re-activation of large paused retrograde trains by Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, which has been reported to occur due to an ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to break the link between IFT and membrane proteins and thus restart paused retrograde IFT trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fort et al., 2021</xref>). We note in addition that many cytoplasmic dynein cargo adaptors contain EF hand domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>), and at least in the case of CRACR2a it has been shown that increased cellular calcium can activate dynein motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Regardless of the mechanism, the re-activation of these paused trains results in the sudden return of a large quantity of IFT particles to the base, as visualized by a strong retrograde trace. However, when we then looked at the anterograde trains entering the flagellum in a short time period after the return of these trains, no significant increase in IFT injection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This observation implies that returning IFT particles are not directly re-injected. This may indicate that the remodeling/recycling of retrograde IFT trains into anterograde IFT trains simply needs more time, or it might be because IFT injection is controlled by some other process that determines the timing of new particle injection, regardless of instantaneous retrograde return events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains and culture condition</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> strains, wild-type 137 c (CC-125), the <italic>fla3-1</italic> mutant expressing KAP-GFP (CC-4296)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>), the <italic>fla10-1</italic> mutant (CC-1919) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 1977</xref>), and the <italic>pf2-4</italic> mutant (CC-4404)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rupp and Porter, 2003</xref>) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN).

In effect, this assumption means that the kinetics of allosteric regulation of CDPK1 activity by calcium occur on a much faster time scale than the other events of our model. This yields the relation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where F<sub>CDPK</sub> is the fraction of enzyme that is active, and K<sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant of calcium binding by CDPK1.</p><p>Third, we assume that phosphorylation of kinesin by CDPK1, as well as subsequent dephosphorylation of kinesin, both take place on a fast timescale relative to the timescale of flagellar length change, such that the fraction of active kinesin is at a quasi-state in the model. Given this assumption, we represent the fraction of phosphorylated kinesin as a function of the relative activity of CDPK1 according to a Michaelis-Menten equation:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where K<sub>M</sub> is the Michaelis constant for the interaction of the enzyme CDPK1 with the kinesin substrate.</p><p>Fourth, based on the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>, we assume that the number of IFT particles entering the flagellum per unit time is proportional to the fraction of non-phosphorylated kinesin-2 proteins. Fifth, we assume that the occupancy of IFT particles for tubulin is proportional to the quantity of tubulin available in the cytoplasm, which is equivalent to saying that binding is not saturated. This was the assumption used in previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>) and is consistent with observations on the fractional occupancy of tubulin during flagellar assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Craft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wemmer et al., 2020</xref>). We thus represent the available tubulin pool as (P-2L) where P is the total precursor (tubulin) pool and L is the length of each of the two flagella. With these assumptions, we can describe flagellar length dynamics as follows:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where A is a proportionality constant describing the total pool of kinesins, such that AK is the pool of kinesins currently active, as well as the incremental increase in length that occurs when a kinesin delivers cargo to the tip. D is the rate of disassembly, which is assumed to be constant based on prior measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The net growth rate is used to update the length using the Euler method with a timestep of 0.02 s. Output values are stored every 50 timesteps (1 second of simulation).

It addresses how ciliary/flagellar length is controlled and whether calcium negatively regulates Intraflagellar transport (IFT) injection. The study convincingly demonstrates that calcium influx correlates with flagellar length, but calcium does not appear to work as a negative regulator of IFT injection, which challenges a previous model.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors only examined the impact of reducing ciliary calcium influx. To further support the conclusions, it is recommended that the authors examine IFT injection in a condition where ciliary calcium level is increased. Using a calcium ionophore may not be a good choice as it may change the global cellular calcium level. One approach to consider is to use mutants of a calcium pump present in cilia.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that calcium does not act as a negative regulator of IFT injection. However, close examination of the calcium flux in Figure 3B and IFT injection in Figure 4B of cilia less than 6 microns, suggests that calcium influx is higher in the ppr2 mutant than in control cilia and IFT injection is reduced in the mutant compared to the control. Thus, this analysis shows the opposite result of the authors' conclusion, and is supporting the previous model. These data should therefore be re-analysed focusing on the early stages of ciliary assembly. In addition, the graphs in Figure 4b, c, d are very hard to read and should be edited for clarity.</p><p>3) The conclusion on line 272-273 needs more evidence. The authors showed that addition of 1 mM CaCl2 does not change ciliary assembly, and used this to argue against the ion-current model. The addition of calcium extracellularly may not alter intracellular/intraciliary calcium level given that cells have robust systems to control calcium homeostasis. To support the authors' conclusion, one should measure the changes of calcium level in the cell/cilia under these conditions; alternatively, authors should temper their conclusion.</p><p>4) In figure 7A the authors show an example kymogram to illustrate the time course used to measure rapid changes in response to changes in ca<sup>2+</sup>. Prior to each DRC4-GCaMP cluster of pulses one can observe stalled mScarlet-IFT54 which is then cleared with the pulse of ca<sup>2+</sup>. Is this relationship observed in the other data-sets used in this figure or is this an artifact of this particular image? Earlier in the paper the frequency of ca<sup>2+</sup> appeared random in relation to length. Does it instead relate to stalled IFT trains in the leading or following flagella during gliding? How were the chlamy blocked from gliding during imaging? It is not apparent from the methods.</p><p>5) In figure 4B the authors show &quot;the mean KAP-GFP intensity of each flagellum&quot; as a measure of total levels of IFT in the cilia at one time. In the main text this is described as &quot;injection intensity.&quot; While total levels of IFT in the cilia are certainly influenced by injection rates it is also influenced by other factors such as IFT retrograde trafficking rates, turn around at the tip and the number of stalled trains. Were any of these other factors changed in their conditions? The authors should discuss what exactly they are measuring when they refer to injections in this paper, especially to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience. Furthermore, the authors may want to cite and discuss the Nievergelt et al. 2022 paper from Gaia Pigino's lab, which is listed in the references but not cited in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1 B. It has been reported by Liang et al. (Dev Cell 2014) that phosphorylation of FLA8 dissociates FLA8 from IFT complex. Thus, it is unknown whether kinesin-2 is inactivated.

Using a condition where intraciliary calcium can be increased to analyze IFT injection, which is critical for drawing a conclusion on calcium regulation of IFT injection.</p><p>3. For Figure 3B and 4B, I suggest the authors do another mathematical analysis but only include the data for cilia shorter than about 6 micron.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to start by thanking the authors for the work they have done.</p><p>1) In figure 4B the authors show &quot;the mean KAP-GFP intensity of each flagellum&quot; a measure of total levels of IFT in the cilia at one time.

The calcium current model would predict that if a calcium pump mutant failed to export calcium, the increased calcium building up inside the flagellum should lead to decreased IFT entry and a shorter flagellar length. We found at least two calcium pumps in the published <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella proteome (Pazour et al., 2005) and ordered several mutant strains from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> Library Project (CLiP) which are annotated as affecting these pumps. We measured the flagellar length of these potential calcium pump mutant strains, but none showed a statistically significant difference in length relative to control cells. We have now included this data as Figure 5 —figure supplement 1. Because no length change was observed, we did not perform the extremely time consuming process of constructing strains that contain these mutations along with DRC4-GCaMP and KAP-GFP.</p><p>As an alternative strategy to get at this reviewer's suggestion, we measured DRC4-GCaMP and KAP-GFP intensity in 1 mM CaCl2 treated flagella and found that CaCl2 treatment increases both the flagellar calcium level (Figure 3) and IFT injection (Figure 4). This increase in IFT injection is the opposite of what the calcium current model predicts.</p><p>Based on these results, we think the calcium pump experiment is not necessary because of the following reasons. 1. These calcium pump mutants might not increase the flagellar calcium level. 2. Even if the flagellar calcium was increased in these mutants, it does not affect the flagellar length and thus our conclusions would still hold. 3. These mutant strains might still have functional calcium pumps since the existing data on calcium pumps in flagella is likely to be incomplete. 4. The CaCl2 experiment clearly increased the flagellar calcium level inside flagella, directly addressing the point that the reviewer is getting at.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that calcium does not act as a negative regulator of IFT injection. However, close examination of the calcium flux in Figure 3B and IFT injection in Figure 4B of cilia less than 6 microns, suggests that calcium influx is higher in the ppr2 mutant than in control cilia and IFT injection is reduced in the mutant compared to the control. Thus, this analysis shows the opposite result of the authors' conclusion, and is supporting the previous model. These data should therefore be re-analysed focusing on the early stages of ciliary assembly. In addition, the graphs in Figure 4b, c, d are very hard to read and should be edited for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, but this result of apparently low calcium influx in shorter flagella in control cells is due to bias from technical issues: it is relatively difficult to image shorter flagella in our TIRF imaging setup, because shorter flagella have less flagellar surface area to attach the coverslip. The more motile the flagella are, the more likely are the cells to detach when their flagella are short, because the bending force of the flagella is strong enough to pull them away from their small area of adhesion. This effect is much stronger in control cells than in either the ppr2 mutants or EGTA treated cells, whose flagella are less motile. This led to a reduced number of cells examined with flagella shorter than 6 μm (17 versus 34 for control and ppr2 cells, respectively). To overcome the difficulties and biased result, we observed more flagella in control cells. The new data was integrated with previous data and shown in Figure 3. The new result shows that calcium influx in control cells is indeed higher than in the ppr2 mutant cells. So, our result is remains consistent with our conclusion, and we believe that we do not have to analyze the shorter flagella separately.</p><p>Regarding the clarify of the graphs, we have updated the graphs in Figures 3 and 4 by reducing the size and opacity of each point to increase the visibility of the trend lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion on line 272-273 needs more evidence. The authors showed that addition of 1 mM CaCl2 does not change ciliary assembly, and used this to argue against the ion-current model.

To support the authors' conclusion, one should measure the changes of calcium level in the cell/cilia under these conditions; alternatively, authors should temper their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have now quantitatively measured the GCaMP intensity inside flagella when 1 mM CaCl2 was added to the media. The data has now been integrated with previous data and shown in Figure 3. It is apparent in this graph that 1 mM CaCl2 treatment produces a statistically significant increase in flagellar calcium levels. We also measured KAP-GFP intensity in CaCl2 treated flagella, and found that CaCl2 addition increased IFT injection (Figure 4). We believe that these new results strengthen our conclusions, and we thank the reviewer for encouraging us to do these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure 7A the authors show an example kymogram to illustrate the time course used to measure rapid changes in response to changes in ca<sup>2+</sup>.

In fact, what we did was to extract the anterograde IFT trajectories from the kymograph, and then use only those pixels for calculating IFT injection intensity. So, we are not measuring total flagellar IFT intensity, just the intensity found in the anterograde tracks. The intensity of anterograde IFT trajectories can reflect only the IFT injection, not retrograde IFT, etc.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for noticing our accidental failure ot cite Nievergelt et al. (2022) in the Discussion section, which we had intended to do as evidenced by our inclusion of the citation in the references. We have now added a discussion of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Figure 1 B. It has been reported by Liang et al. (Dev Cell 2014) that phosphorylation of FLA8 dissociates FLA8 from IFT complex. Thus, it is unknown whether kinesin-2 is inactivated. I suggest that active/inactive kinesin-2 is changed to active/inactive IFT.</p></disp-quote><p>Liang’s paper not only discusses dissociation of FLA8 from the IFT complex, they also mention that phosphorylation inactivates kinesin and inhibits IFT entry. Nevertheless, we have replaced the words, active and inactive, with &quot;can bind with IFT&quot; and &quot;can't bind with IFT&quot; just to avoid any potential confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Using a condition where intraciliary calcium can be increased to analyze IFT injection, which is critical for drawing a conclusion on calcium regulation of IFT injection.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, given that we have shown results for calcium depletion. To this end, we have now used our fluorescent strains to measure the GCaMP intensity of 1 mM CaCl2 treated flagella and found that 1 mM CaCl2 treatment does indeed increase the calcium level in flagella. Furthermore, we now show that CaCl2 treatment increases IFT injection, again in contradiction of the prediction of the calcium ion current model that more calcium should decrease IFT injection. This new experimental data has been added as Figure 3D and Figure 4BC. These results are all consistent with our original conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For Figure 3B and 4B, I suggest the authors do another mathematical analysis but only include the data for cilia shorter than about 6 micron.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this point in the reviewer's general comments above. In brief, there were very few control cells in the short length range due to increased flagellar motility in controls. Prompted by the reviewer suggestion, we analyzed additional control cells with short flagella and found that our conclusion holds that control cells have higher calcium influx even for short flagella.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would like to start by thanking the authors for the work they have done.</p><p>1) In figure 4B the authors show &quot;the mean KAP-GFP intensity of each flagellum&quot; a measure of total levels of IFT in the cilia at one time.

Prior to each DRC4-GCaMP cluster of pulses one can observe stalled mScarlet-IFT54 which is then cleared with the pulse of ca<sup>2+</sup>. Is this relationship observed in the other data-sets used in this figure or is this an artifact of this particular image? Earlier in the paper the frequency of ca<sup>2+</sup> appeared random in relation to length. Does it instead relate to stalled IFT trains in the leading or following flagella during gliding?
