It is the target for setrons, a class of competitive antagonists widely used as antiemetics, and is involved in several neurological diseases. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R in complex with serotonin or setrons revealed that the protein has access to a wide conformational landscape. However, assigning known high-resolution structures to actual states contributing to the physiological response remains a challenge. In the present study, we used voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) to measure simultaneously, for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R expressed at a cell membrane, conformational changes by fluorescence and channel opening by electrophysiology. Four positions identified by mutational screening report motions around and outside the serotonin-binding site through incorporation of cysteine-tethered rhodamine dyes with or without a nearby quenching tryptophan. VCF recordings show that the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R has access to four families of conformations endowed with distinct fluorescence signatures: ‘resting-like’ without ligand, ‘inhibited-like’ with setrons, ‘pre-active-like’ with partial agonists, and ‘active-like’ (open channel) with partial and strong agonists. Data are remarkably consistent with cryo-EM structures, the fluorescence partners matching respectively apo, setron-bound, 5-HT bound-closed, and 5-HT-bound-open conformations. Data show that strong agonists promote a concerted motion of all fluorescently labeled sensors during activation, while partial agonists, especially when loss-of-function mutations are engineered, stabilize both active and pre-active conformations. In conclusion, VCF, though the monitoring of electrophysiologically silent conformational changes, illuminates allosteric mechanisms contributing to signal transduction and their differential regulation by important classes of physiological and clinical effectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors</kwd><kwd>voltage-clamp fluorometry</kwd><kwd>neuropharmacology</kwd><kwd>allosteric mechanisms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>788974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corringer</surname><given-names>Pierre-Jean</given-names></name><name><surname>Peverini</surname><given-names>Laurie</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conformational motions elicited by antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists in serotonin-gated ion channels 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R progressively spread from the extracellular to the transmembrane domain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), comprising nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs), serotonin (5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs), glycine (GlyRs), and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) receptors, are dynamic transmembrane proteins that mediate neuronal and non-neuronal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nemecz et al., 2016</xref>). Among them, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are cation-selective excitatory channels expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, notably in the gut and gut-brain axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbs and Chakrapani, 2021</xref>). 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are encoded by five different genes (<italic>HTR3A</italic>, <italic>HTR3B</italic>, <italic>HTR3C</italic>, <italic>HTR3C</italic>, <italic>HTR3E</italic>), giving rise to five different subunits (A to E) that assemble as homo- or hetero-pentamers. A class of synthetic competitive antagonists called setrons target these receptors and are widely used in the clinic as antiemetics, notably to counteract vomiting and nausea induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs are also potential targets to treat irritable bowel syndrome and are implicated in neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. There is therefore much interest surrounding the molecular mechanisms governing 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs function and pharmacological regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mawe and Hoffman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fakhfouri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsitsipa et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of pLGICs, and among them 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, is that their action is mediated by varying population equilibrium between allosteric states that are differentially stabilized by the binding of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monod et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corradi et al., 2009</xref>). Agonists promote the allosteric transition between resting (closed channel) and active (open channel) states, while their prolonged application promotes a slower transition to desensitized (agonist-bound-closed channel) conformations.</p><p>The first high-resolution structure of mouse homo-pentameric 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R was solved by X-ray crystallography in complex with stabilizing nanobodies, followed by numerous structures solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) without ligands or in complex with the agonist 5-HT, a series of setron competitive antagonists and an allosteric modulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassaine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zarkadas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R displays a typical pLGIC structure, where each subunit consists of a β-sandwich connected with loops composing the extracellular domain (ECD), four α-helices composing the transmembrane domain (TMD) and an intracellular domain. Agonists and competitive antagonists bind at the ECD interface between two subunits, at the orthosteric site composed of the so-called loops A, B, and C from the principal subunit and D, E, and F from the complementary subunit, with loop C bridging the subunit interface. In the presence of detergent C12E9 with or without added lipids, or in saposin nanodiscs, solved structures in the absence of orthosteric ligand (apo) were assigned as resting-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hassaine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basak et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Those in complex with setrons significantly diverged from the resting-like class and were called inhibited states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zarkadas et al., 2020</xref>). The structures captured with bound 5-HT all feature rather similar motions of the ECD, with 5-HT binding promoting a closure (in a capping motion) of loop C around the agonist, a global compaction, and a tilt of each subunit ECD. This generates a marked reorganization of the ECD-TMD interface, including in some cases an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop. However, the structures strongly diverge in the TMD, some featuring an apparently open pore and others a non-conducting pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>). In addition, reconstitution into saposin-based nanodiscs captured distinct open conformations with symmetrical or asymmetrical conformation of the TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, these atomic structures led to a complex landscape of more than the three putative conformations (resting, active, desensitized). Furthermore, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R’s wide conformational landscape accessibility seems to be governed by both orthosteric effectors and the lipids and/or detergents surrounding the TMD. Assigning these high-resolution structures to actual physiological states contributing to the electrophysiological response at the cell membrane remains to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howard, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Complementary techniques that follow the structural reorganizations of the cell-expressed receptors are thus needed to identify structural motions contributing to gating (i.e. the pathway between resting and activated/open states) and to help annotate high-resolution structures to physiologically relevant conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howard, 2021</xref>). Voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF), which monitors receptors expressed at the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte plasma membrane, is well suited for this aim. VCF performs simultaneous measurement of channel opening by two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology (TEVC) and of local protein motions by variation of fluorescence from covalently attached probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>). This technique has been applied to various pLGICs, notably to human 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R with the generation of three sensors surrounding the orthosteric site as well as one sensor on the mouse 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R located at the extracellular entrance of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have generated four fluorescent sensors grafted at new locations on the mouse 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R. We characterized their phenotypes following the binding of various agonists, partial agonists, and clinically relevant antagonists, with or without introduction of loss-of-function mutations. Simultaneous recordings of electrical currents and variations of fluorescence revealed different local and global reorganizations of the ECD depending on the pharmacological conditions. By following the conformational reorganizations leading to both electrophysiologically silent and active conformations, VCF data identify intermediate conformations within or outside the path of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R activation. These data provide unique structural information on membrane-embedded proteins to annotate known high-resolution structures to physiologically relevant allosteric states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of four fluorescent sensors along the ECD</title><p>To guide the design of fluorescent sensors, we inspected the regions undergoing the largest reorganizations in the various cryo-EM structures, mainly mapping the subunit interface from the apex of the ECD to the ECD-TMD interface and the upper part of the TMD. We introduced cysteines by mutagenesis and covalently labeled them with the fluorescent probe MTS-TAMRA, allowing conjugation of a rhodamine dye with the protein main chain through a flexible 6-atom linker (CH<sub>2</sub>-S-S-CH<sub>2</sub>-NH-CO). Since rhodamine fluorescence is sensitive to its local molecular environment, this generates conformational sensors around the graft position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munro et al., 2019</xref>). In order to increase the intensity of fluorescent variations and to report more precisely the motion observed, we also implemented the tryptophan-induced quenching method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mansoor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this technique, the cysteine-labeled rhodamine is introduced together with a nearby tryptophan since the indole moiety of the Trp side chain robustly quenches rhodamine fluorescence when in Van der Waals contact. Such pairs sense the distance between the fluorophore and indole attachment points and/or local environment, and often amplify the extent of the fluorescence variation when allosteric motions are associated with structural reorganization at this level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screening of residues located along the extracellular domain (ECD) of m5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R as potential anchors for fluorescent probes and establishment of four reporter sensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: visualization of the residues mutated, TAMRA-labeled and tested for variation of current and fluorescence on the apo cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of m5-HT<sub>3A</sub> (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>), in lateral (zoom on the ECD) and top view with two subunits in cartoon representation and the three others represented in surface mode (PDB: 6BE1).

Of note, the aromatic side chain of Y207 contributes to the binding and gating in 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, with a strong effect of alanine and serine mutations, but comparatively weaker effect of phenylalanine or unnatural aromatic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beene et al., 2004</xref>). The pair is located away from the subunit interface thus reporting tertiary reorganizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>V106C/L131W: V106C is facing the vestibule of the ECD, a large water-accessible channel with several constrictions and ring of charges that lies above the TMD ion channel. L131W is positioned more profoundly in each ECD, its side chain remaining visually accessible through the vestibule. Given the proximity of all subunits in this confined space, the observed fluorescence variation can potentially arise from quenching by tryptophan of any of the five subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of note, we verified that the observed fluorescent quenching is not caused by direct collisional quenching with the hydroxy indole group of perfused 5-HT, that arises at concentrations above 200 μM (see an example of direct quenching by 5-HT perfused at 1000 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>R219C/Y140W are positioned at the ECD/TMD interface. R219C is located in the pre-M1 area and Y140W in the highly conserved Cys-loop. Both positions flank the M2-M3 loop that undergoes a major outward motion in some agonist-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The four sensors monitor fast motions not related to desensitization</title><p>The four sensors were recorded on a custom VCF chamber where the ligands are perfused only on the portion of the oocyte from which the fluorescence emission is collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2023</xref>). This ensures that the same population of receptors is recorded in current and fluorescence simultaneously. For all sensors, perfusion of a high concentration of strong agonists (5-HT or <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenylbiguanide [mCPBG], selected depending on the particular sensor, see dedicated section to each sensor) elicit currents reaching maximal value in a few seconds, followed by desensitization appearing with much slower kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To measure the desensitization kinetics, we performed parallel measurements on a dedicated TEVC setup equipped with a fast perfusion system allowing solution exchange in less than a hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gielen et al., 2020</xref>). This shows that all sensors display comparable desensitization kinetics to that of the wild-type receptor (WT), evaluated in the 50–150 s range through mono-exponential fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, activation and desensitization appear well separated in time in the VCF setup. This allows a reasonable evaluation of the extent of activation by measuring the amplitude of the peak current. Concentration-response curves measured at this peak current show that, for all sensors, labeling by MTS-TAMRA has no significant effect in terms of EC<sub>50</sub> current (EC<sub>50</sub>c) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In fluorescence, labeled S204C, I160C/Y207W, and R219C/Y140W show robust agonist-elicited dequenching and V106C/L131W agonist-elicited quenching. In all cases, the rise time of the fluorescence variations (ΔFs) are in the same range to that of the rise time of the currents (1–10 s range depending on the particular sensor and the agonist concentration, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, prolonged applications of agonist show no significant variation of the fluorescence during the desensitization phase (with the fluorescent signal remaining stable), providing evidence that the sensors do not report movements related to desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As far as the four sensors are concerned, VCF data suggest that the ECD (and its labels) does not undergo notable conformational changes between activated and desensitized states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Competitive antagonists elicit agonist-like reorganizations at the orthosteric site that do not spread to the lower part of the ECD</title><p>We first explored the action of competitive antagonists on the various sensors. To this end, we applied to the same oocyte saturating concentrations of the agonists 5-HT, mCPBG, and var (varenicline) as well as a selection of four competitive antagonists of different molecular structure: alosetron, granisetron, ondansetron, and metoclopramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kilpatrick et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lummis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thompson and Lummis, 2006</xref>).

In addition, the amplitude of ΔFs evoked by antagonists are in the same range than that of agonists for granisetron and ondansetron while it is significantly higher for alosetron and lower for metoclopramide.

saturation. Concentration-response curves show that the variations of current (ΔIs) and fluorescence are well correlated with similar EC<sub>50</sub> fluorescence (EC<sub>50</sub>f) and EC<sub>50</sub>c. This shows that agonists promote local reorganizations around the binding site that are correlated to the opening of the channel, suggesting a concerted motion of the orthosteric site and the ion channel during activation. As for strong agonists, var displays similar EC<sub>50</sub>f and EC<sub>50</sub>c. However, it displays a ΔFmax similar to that of strong agonists despite activating only 33% of the current. Therefore, var at saturation promotes full reorganization of the binding site suggesting that among the population displaying a variation of fluorescence, only a fraction shows an open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the S204C sensor on a different allosteric background, we introduced the strong loss-of function mutation N101K. Substitution of N101 by several natural or unnatural amino acids indeed produces a marked increase in agonist EC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Price et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). N101 is located just below the orthosteric site on loop A and has been proposed to contribute to the allosteric network coupling the orthosteric site to the ion channel. In combination with S204C, N101K displays, as expected, a loss-of-function phenotype characterized by: (1) a 31-fold and 9-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub>c for 5-HT and mCPBG, respectively, (2) a decreasing efficacy of 5-HT as compared to mCPBG, as already reported, and (3) a decreasing efficacy of var yielding no detectable current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Interestingly, the effects on the fluorescence variations were comparatively weaker, N101K causing only a 4-fold and a 1.4-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub>f for 5-HT and mCPBG, respectively, while var causes a ΔF higher than 5-HT at saturation (173%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) with a 1.6-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub>f (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, N101K on S204C decorrelates the ΔF and ΔI. For 5-HT and mCPBG, ΔFs are already robust at agonists concentrations not eliciting sizable currents (for instance at 5 µM 5-HT and 1 µM mCPBG, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For var, it elicits quantitative ΔF but no current.</p><p>Finally, the sensor I160C/Y207W displays by itself a marked loss-of-function phenotype characterized by: (1) a 7-fold and 17-fold increase in EC<sub>50</sub>c for mCPBG and 5-HT as compared to the WT, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and (2) at saturation, mCPBG is the most efficient agonist, while 5-HT elicits only 2% of its currents and var fails to activate the channel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Of note, this phenotype is caused by both I160C and Y207W mutations, that individually cause a 17-fold and 12-fold increase in the EC<sub>50</sub>c for 5-HT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel). Given the position of these mutations within and around the orthosteric site, their effect is likely due to a mix of alteration of both gating and binding affinity of the agonists. The phenotype of I160C/Y207W resembles that of S204C/N101K, with a leftward shift of the ΔF over the ΔI curve for the partial agonist 5-HT, and robust ΔF but no ΔI for var (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, VCF data obtained for these two sensors close to the binding site highlight three families of conformations, the apo conformations, the agonist-bound active conformations characterized by a concerted reorganization of the orthosteric site and the ion channel (opening), and ligand-bound intermediate conformations characterized by reorganization of the orthosteric site with a closed channel. On the S204C that displays a WT-like phenotype, these intermediate conformations are partially populated for the partial agonist var. On the two loss-of-function backgrounds (S204C/N101K and I160C/Y207W), these intermediates are fully stabilized by var that behaves as an antagonist and are partially populated for 5-HT and mCPBG at sub-saturating concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Correlation between vestibular and ECD-TMD interface motions and ion channel activation</title><p>VCF recordings of both V106C/L131W and R219C/Y140W sensors show reproducible currents upon mCPBG perfusion at saturation but not in the case of long recordings required for dose-response curves, where they were non-reproducible. In contrast, 5-HT and var elicit robust and reproducible currents. For both sensors, quantification of the desensitization kinetics on the fast perfusion TEVC setup suggest a slight, although non-significant, increase in desensitization kinetics for 5-HT and var but shows surprisingly very fast desensitization kinetics for mCPBG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.). This explains why, in the VCF setup endowed with a relatively slow perfusion system, the very transient mCPBG-elicited activation peak is truncated by desensitization, precluding its further analysis.</p><p>V106C/L131W and R219C/Y140W both display a gain-of-function phenotype that is moderate for the former (1.5-fold and 2.7-fold decrease EC<sub>50</sub>c for 5-HT and var, respectively), and more pronounced for the latter (5.5-fold and 22.5-fold decrease EC<sub>50</sub>c for 5-HT and var, respectively). For both sensors, var appears as a partial agonist eliciting around 30% of the 5-HT currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We also combined R219C/Y140W with the loss-of function N101K mutation. N101K reverts the R219C/Y140W gain-of-function phenotype, the triple mutant R219C/Y140W/N101K displaying EC<sub>50</sub>c of 5-HT and var close to that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>These three sensors show a good correlation between EC<sub>50</sub>c and EC<sub>50</sub>f for the strong agonist 5-HT, suggesting that the motions reported by fluorescence at the vestibule and ECD-TMD interface are concerted with channel opening. For the partial agonist var on V106C/L131W and R219C/Y140W, the ΔFmax (40–50% of that of 5-HT) is comparable to the ΔImax (30–40% of that of 5-HT), suggesting in the first approximation that var at saturation promotes the same transition as 5-HT, but only partially. However, concentration-response curves on V106C/L131W show a small yet significant decorrelation of fluorescence and current, suggesting the occurrence of intermediate conformations. R219C/Y140W/N101K confirms this idea with var. On this construct, var acts as a strongly partial agonist eliciting at saturation only 3% of the 5-HT currents, while it displays 37% of the ΔF evoked by 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel). In addition, var shows a leftward shift of the fluorescence dose-response curve as compared to the current dose-response curve (with EC<sub>50</sub>c being 15.6 µM and EC<sub>50</sub>f is 5.2 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel).</p><p>In conclusion, as for orthosteric-located sensors, fluorescent and current signals are well correlated for strong agonists, pointing to a concerted mechanism. In contrast, the partial agonist var on V106C/L131W and especially on R219C/Y140W/N101K shows a decorrelation of fluorescence and current, pointing to the contribution of distinct states endowed with robust ΔF but no ΔI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we undertook a screening of 19 mutants of the m5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R with an aim to identify fluorescent sensors within the ECD. Around the orthosteric site, we find that cysteine incorporation often yields ΔF suitable for VCF investigation. In contrast, outside the orthosteric site all single-cysteine mutants investigated failed. This observation parallels a previous VCF screening on the h5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R that identified four suitable sensors around the orthosteric site but none among the seven additional positions tested in the pre-M1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munro et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, we have previously investigated a sensor on the top of M2 helices on m5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>). In the pLGIC family, the α1-GlyR has also been extensively studied by VCF and many positions were screened for cysteine incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pless et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pless and Lynch, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pless and Lynch, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, most positions show robust ΔF outside the orthosteric site. This suggests that the α1-GlyR undergoes gating reorganizations of larger amplitude than that of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R. Still, we succeeded in designing two sensors at the vestibule and the ECD-TMD interface by implementing the tryptophan-induced quenching method, further illustrating that this technique is suitable to monitor subtle conformational changes when the fluorophore-quencher pair is properly engineered.</p><p>The mapping of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R has enabled us to generate four fluorescence sensors of the protein conformations. They are located at three distant positions within the ECD 3D structure, thereby constituting reference points to infer its global conformation. Simultaneous steady-state concentration-response relationships for the fluorescence and current responses reveal important ligand-elicited protein motions and their relationship with activation.</p><p>We first show that agonists and antagonists elicit similar local reorganizations around orthosteric sensors. For both S204C and I160C/Y207W, all tested ligands at saturating concentrations elicit fluorescent dequenching signals. All agonists, partial agonists, granisetron, and ondansetron elicit ΔF of similar amplitude, while alosetron compared to metoclopramide display significantly higher and lower ΔF, respectively. These results are in remarkable concordance with cryo-EM structures. They show that both 5-HT and a series of setron antagonists promote locally a similar reorganization of the orthosteric site, with an inward displacement of the landmark loop C that caps the bound ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>). Furthermore, subjecting these structures to molecular dynamic simulations suggests that different antagonists promote different degrees of local conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2020</xref>). Among setrons, alosetron is the one promoting the largest conformational effects, consistent with VCF data. Of note, the ligand-elicited dequenching signal of the I160C/Y207W is also consistent with the cryo-EM structures, since the capping of loop C is predicted to reduce the accessibility of the indole side chain to the rhodamine dye grafted on the other side of the loop. Interestingly, three other fluorescence sensors around the orthosteric site were already reported on the human 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R on loop C (M223C), D (Y89C), and E (Q146C). They also report that agonists and antagonists equally elicit fluorescence dequenching, with ΔF intensities strongly ligand-dependent for loops C and E, but not for loop D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We also show that antagonist-elicited reorganizations do not spread to the vestibular and ECD-TMD sensors. Indeed, the sensors at the ECD-TMD interface (R219C/Y140W) and at the middle vestibule (V106C/L131W) show robust ΔF upon perfusion of agonists, but no effect for antagonists. Cryo-EM structures show no setron-elicited change at the ECD-TMD interface, especially no motion of the M2-M3 loop that lies in between the attachment points of the fluorophore and the indole of the tryptophan in R219C/Y140W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zarkadas et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, setrons elicit small reorganizations of the architecture of the vestibule (measured as a slightly increased radius of the constriction at K108 and D105), while 5-HT elicits stronger reorganizations at this level. Overall, VCF data are in excellent agreement with cryo-EM data, providing evidence that high-resolution structures of setron-inhibited states represent pertinent snapshots of actual allosteric states at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Steady-state concentration-response relationships support that strong agonists elicit an apparently concerted reorganization of the global protein structure. Indeed, for most constructs, those agonists eliciting the maximal response currents among all tested agonists show no difference in ΔF and ΔI concentration-response curves. This is the case for 5-HT, that maximally activates the S204C, V106C/L131W, and R219C/Y140W sensors and for mCPBG that maximally activates the S204C and I160C/Y207W sensors. This suggests a concerted mechanism where local motions around the four sensors happen simultaneously with the pore opening. These data are thus accounted by a simple two-state model, where the receptor is in equilibrium between a resting and an active state. VCF measurements are also remarkably coherent with the 5-HT-bound structures showing an open pore: PDB 6HIN (called F), PDB 6DG8 (called state 2), and PDB Y5A (called serotonin-bound state). Indeed, all of them show symmetrical and global reorganizations of the ECD involving loop C capping, vestibular reorganization, and M2-M3 reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, we found that partial agonists stabilize additional intermediate conformations characterized by fluorescence variations but no current, especially when loss-of-function mutations are engineered. Intermediate conformations are observed for the two sensors outside the orthosteric site. Indeed, for R219C/Y140W sensor in combination with N101K, var elicits at saturation only 3% of 5-HT currents but promotes a robust ΔF signal corresponding to 38% of that of 5-HT. In addition, the ΔF concentration-response curve appears slightly left-shifted as compared to the ΔI curve, indicating that the ΔF/ΔI ratio is even higher at low var concentrations. These data clearly show that var stabilizes in majority intermediate conformations where the ECD-TMD interface has moved, generating a ΔF, but where the channel remains closed. A similar although milder ‘intermediate’ phenotype is seen for var on the V106C/L131W sensor.</p><p>Within the gating pathway, these intermediate conformations may a priori contribute either to the activation transition (pre-active state) or to the desensitization transition (fast or slow desensitized states). However, VCF data strongly argue for the former hypothesis. Indeed, for all experiments including var partial activation of V106C/L131W, the rise times of ΔF are in the same range to that of ΔI, desensitization being much slower and associated with no significant ΔF. This shows that the intermediate states are recruited during or concomitant with the activation phase. This is in line with the general observation that partial agonists currents are strongly increased by positive allosteric modulators, indicating that the electrophysiologically silent conformations they promote are activatable and therefore not desensitized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Felt et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Two 5-HT-bound structures of m5-HT<sub>3A</sub> displaying a closed channel sustain the intermediate reorganizations seen by VCF. Indeed, conformations called I1 (PDB 6HIO) and state 1 (PDB 6DG7) feature rearrangements at the ECD and interface between ECD/TMD similar to that of conformation displaying an open channel, but with non-conducting pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basak et al., 2018a</xref>). It is noteworthy that these states were initially proposed to represent either pre-active or desensitized states, and that these two possibilities could not be distinguished without ambiguity. However, indirect experiments of substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) suggested that desensitization involves weak reorganizations of the upper part of the channel that holds the activation gate, arguing for the pre-active state hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>). Combined SCAM and VCF data thus provide compelling evidence for annotation as pre-active state. Interestingly, during the revision of this article, several cryo-EM structures of m5-HT<sub>3A</sub> in complex with partial agonists SMP-100 and ALB-148471 were published. In full agreement with our VCF data, partial agonists are found to stabilize the protein in both active and pre-active-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Felt et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Intermediate conformations are also observed on many occasions for the sensors near the orthosteric site. This is the case with the var partial agonist on S204C, which produces a lower maximum current variation (ΔImax) than that caused by 5-HT but a higher ΔFmax. The phenotype is exacerbated in the presence of N101K, 5-HT, and mCPBG showing intermediate conformations at sub-saturating concentrations, while var promote no current while still evoking robust ΔF. Of note, on this mutant, mCPBG is the most efficient agonist, but it remains possible that it has a partial agonistic character due to the strong loss-of-function N101K mutation. In this context, the sensor I160C/Y207W shows a loss-of-function phenotype resembling that of S204C/N101K with comparable relative position of the ΔI and ΔF dose-response curves. Correlating the motions at the orthosteric site with known cryo-EM structures is, however, difficult. Indeed, two hypotheses can be sustained by these results: the intermediate conformations revealed by these sensors can correspond either to those stabilized by setrons or to the pre-active conformations discussed above.</p><p>Altogether, VCF data highlight a progressive propagation of the signal following ligand binding. Setrons elicit local reorganizations shown by the sensors located around the orthosteric site, partial agonists elicit local reorganizations at the four sensors indicating a motion of the whole ECD with partial pore opening, and strong agonists elicit reorganizations detected by all four sensors together with channel opening. VCF data thus identify four families of conformations endowed with distinct ΔI/ΔF signatures contributing to signal transduction: resting-like apo, setron-inhibited, partial agonist-elicited pre-active and active states. The topological information given by the various sensors are remarkably consistent with the gallery of high-resolution structures solved thus far. Indeed, the data from fluorescence partners are consistent with respectively apo, setron-bound, 5-HT-bound-closed, and 5-HT-bound-open conformations. This provides important information allowing reasonable functional annotation of the various structures to physiological states in a membrane environment, at least regarding the ECD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a speculative four-state model as a framework integrating the whole set of data. In addition, VCF data give insights in the action of partial agonists, that do not exclusively stabilize the active state and document the phenotypes of various allosteric mutations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical integrative model of voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) data.</title><p>Schematic representation of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R representing two subunits in side-view with the orthosteric site and ion channel M2 helices highlighted.

It is noteworthy that single-channel kinetic analyses of pLGICs early showed that the activation transition pathway involves multiple intermediated states. Analysis of numerous mutants of the muscle nAChR analyzed by REFERs (rate equilibrium linear free energy relationships) suggested a multistep reorganization that initiates in the orthosteric site and progressively spreads to the ion channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grosman et al., 2000</xref>). Analysis on GlyRs and nAChRs detected late intermediate states called ‘flip’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burzomato et al., 2004</xref>) or ‘primed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>), that are favored by loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plested et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lape et al., 2012</xref>), while a non-conducting intermediate state has been proposed from kinetic models of a high-conductance mutant of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corradi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>More recently, fluorescence and VCF studies identified intermediate conformations for nAChRs, α1-GlyRs, and the bacterial homolog GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mourot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lefebvre et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, pre-active intermediates were unraveled by a fluorescence quenching pair at strictly homologous positions at the ECD-TMD interface of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R and α1-GlyRs. Indeed, residues R219C/Y140W are homologous to another sensor pair Q219C/K143W engineered on the α1-GlyR. MTS-TAMRA-labeled Q219C/K143W also reports a non-conducting intermediate in the pathway toward activation, with a fluorescence variation revealing an early reorganization of the ECD-TMD interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2023</xref>). Molecular dynamic simulations starting from a taurine-bound-closed cryo-EM structure was found to recapitulate the pharmacological properties observed by VCF, suggesting that the intermediate conformations correspond to a highly dynamic family of conformations featuring an active-like ECD but a resting-like pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, VCF shows that virtually all pLGICs appear to share a common global mechanism of gating where the proteins visit a family of structurally dynamic intermediates showing an active-like ECD and a resting-like TMD conformation. The present work thus extends this idea to the 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>R, together with providing structural blueprints for cryo-EM structural annotation.</p><p>In conclusion, by monitoring simultaneously electrophysiologically silent and active conformations of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R, VCF allowed to characterize the mechanisms of action of allosteric effectors and allosteric mutations. We found that the strength of the agonist correlated to a degree with propagation of this fluorescence change beyond the local site of neurotransmitter binding, unraveling intermediate conformations allowing proposing a structure-based functional annotation of known high-resolution structures. Besides validating the mechanism underlying inhibition by setrons, these data unravel a unique mode of action of partial agonists to promote distinct intermediate conformations. The various fluorescence sensors developed will be valuable in future mutational analysis and characterization of drugs acting at the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R that hold promise for clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

To perform recordings, microelectrodes (borosilicate glass with filament BF150-110-7.5, WPI) of resistances comprised between 0.2 and 2 mΩ (pipette puller PC-10, Narishige) were used and oocytes were clamped at –60 mV for all the experiments. Recordings are performed with a GeneClamp 500 voltage patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) and a 1400  A digitizer (Axon Instruments) with Clampex 10.6 software (Molecular Devices). Recorded currents were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 500 Hz. The fluorescence emission was recorded via a FF01-543_22 bandpass filter (Semrock) and collected by a photo-multiplicator (H10722, Hamamatsu). The intensity of irradiation of the LEDs (pE-4000 CoolLED) and of the sensitivity of detection of the PMT were kept at the same level for all the experiments. For the screening experiment, 5-HT at 50 and 100 µM were perfused (around 10 s).

VCF approach with controls for comparing the functionality of WT vs. mutants, and labeled with unlabeled receptor, is well explained and satisfying. The finding that desensitization involves little change in ECD conformation makes sense. It is somewhat surprising, at least superficially, to find that competitive antagonists promote changes in fluorescence in the same 'direction' and amplitude as strong agonists, however, this is indeed consistent with the structural biology, and with findings from other groups testing different labeling sites. Importantly, the team finds that antagonist-binding changes in deltaF do not spread beyond the region near the neurotransmitter site. The finding that most labeling sites in the ECD, in particular those not in/near the neurotransmitter site, fail to report measurable fluorescence changes, is noteworthy. It contrasts with findings in GlyR, as noted by the authors, and supports a mechanism where most of each subunit's ECD behaves as a rigid body.</p><p>Specific questions/comments:</p><p>I am confused about the sensor current kinetics. Results section (2) states that all sensors share the same current desensitization kinetics, while Results section (5) states that the ECD-TMD site and the vestibule site sensors exhibit faster desensitization. SF1C, right-most panel of R219C suggests the mutation and/or labeling here dramatically changes apparent activation and deactivation rates measured by TEVC. Both activation and deactivation upon washout appear faster in this one example. Data for desensitization are not shown here but are shown in aggregate in earlier panels. It is a bit surprising that activation and deactivation would both change but no effect on desensitization. Indeed, it looks like, in Fig. 1G, that desensitization rate is not consistent across all constructs. Can you please confirm/clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>TEVC and VCF recordings in this study show a significant variability concerning both the apparent desensitization and desactivation kinetics. This is illustrated concerning desensitization in TEVC experiments in figure S2, where the remaining currents after 45 secondes of 5-HT perfusion and the rate constants of desensitization are measured on different oocytes from different batches. Therefore, the differences in desensitization kinetics shown in fig 1.G are not significant, the aim of the figure being solely to illustrate that no variation of fluorescence is observed during the desensitization phase. A sentence in the legend of fig 1.G has been added to precise this point. We also revised the first paragraph of result section 5, clearly stating that the slight tendency of faster desensitization of V106C/L131W and R219C/Y140W sensors is not significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An alternative to the conclusion-like title of Results section (2) is that the ECD (and its labels) does not undergo notable conformational changes between activated and desensitized states.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we have added a sentence at the end of results section 2 to present this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find the discussion paragraph on partial agonist mechanisms, starting with &quot;However,&quot; to be particularly important but at times hard to follow. Please try to revise for clarity. I am particularly excited to understand how we can understand/improve assignments of cryo-EM structures using the VCF (or other) approaches. As examples of where I struggled, near the top of p. 11, related to the partial agonist discussion, there is an assumption about the pore being either activated, or resting. Is it not also possible that partial agonists could stabilize a desensitized state of the pore? Strictly speaking, the labeling sites and current measurements do not distinguish between pre-active resting and desensitized channel conformations/states. However, the cryo-EM structures can likely help fill in the missing information there- with all the normal caveats. Please try to explicitly distinguish between a closed pore and a resting or desensitized state of the pore, to help in clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the section, and hope it is clearer now. We notably state more explicitly the argument for annotation of partial agonist bound closed structures as pre-active, mainly from kinetic consideration of VCF experiments. We also mention and cite a paper by the Chakrapani group published the 4th of January 2024 (Felt et al, Nature Communication), where they present the structures of the m5HT3AR bound to partial agonists, with a set of conformations fully consistent with our VCF data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This statement likely needs references: &quot;...indirect experiments of substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) and VCF experiments suggested that desensitization involves weak reorganizations of the upper part of the channel that holds the activation gate, arguing for the former hypothesis.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reference Polovinkin et al, Nature, 2018, has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I respectfully suggest toning down this language a little bit: &quot;VCF allowed to characterize at an unprecedented resolution the mechanisms of action of allosteric effectors and allosteric mutations, to identify new intermediate conformations and to propose a structure-based functional annotation of known high-resolution structures.&quot; This VCF stands strongly without unclear claims about unprecedented resolution. What impresses me most are the findings distinguishing how agonists/partial agonists/antagonists share a conserved action in one area and not in another, the observations consistent with intermediate states, and the efforts to integrate these simultaneous current and conformation measurements with the intimidating array of EM structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for his positive comments.
