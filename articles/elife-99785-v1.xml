expression frequently drives antibiotic resistance in bacteria. We had previously (Patel and Matange, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2021) shown that, in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, mutations at the <italic>mgrB</italic> locus were beneficial under trimethoprim exposure and led to overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), encoded by the <italic>folA</italic> gene. Here, we show that DHFR levels are further enhanced by spontaneous duplication of a genomic segment encompassing <italic>folA</italic> and spanning hundreds of kilobases. This duplication was rare in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, its frequency was elevated in a <italic>lon</italic>-knockout strain, altering the mutational landscape early during trimethoprim adaptation. We then exploit this system to investigate the relationship between trimethoprim pressure and <italic>folA</italic> copy number. During long-term evolution, <italic>folA</italic> duplications were frequently reversed. Reversal was slower under antibiotic pressure, first requiring the acquisition of point mutations in DHFR or its promoter. Unexpectedly, despite resistance-conferring point mutations, some populations under high trimethoprim pressure maintained <italic>folA</italic> duplication to compensate for low abundance DHFR mutants. We find that evolution of gene dosage depends on expression demand, which is generated by antibiotic and exacerbated by proteolysis of drug-resistant mutants of DHFR. We propose a novel role for proteostasis as a determinant of copy number evolution in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>trimethoprim</kwd><kwd>dihydrofolate reductase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/20/2/505181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matange</surname><given-names>Nishad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Mutations that increase copy numbers, termed as gene duplications and amplifications (GDAs), are implicated in diverse biological phenomena including cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dürrbaum and Storchová, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spielmann et al., 2018</xref>), speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pascual-Anaya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ting et al., 2004</xref>), reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maclean and Greig, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuellig and Sweigart, 2018</xref>), and antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>). GDAs are important for rapid adaptation since their frequencies of occurrence can be higher by several orders of magnitude than point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seaton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonti and Roth, 1989</xref>). Following the initial GDA mutation, however, amplified genes could be lost over time, pseudogenised, sub-functionalised, or neo-functionalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzmin et al., 2022</xref>). Which of these possibilities is realised depends on the nature and strength of selection imposed by the environment, as well as the fitness cost associated with maintaining multiple gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzmin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, GDA mutations are frequently encountered during adaptation to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>) or heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hufnagel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">von Rozycki and Nies, 2009</xref>). They occur by RecA-dependent nonequal recombination as well as RecA-independent processes and often involve repeat sequences such as in IS-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi and Liu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reams and Neidle, 2003</xref>). Amplified genes in drug-resistant bacteria code for effectors of resistance such as drug inactivating enzymes, drug target modifiers, or ‘bypass’ mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Min et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vinella et al., 2000</xref>), but may also compensate for resistance-associated fitness costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nilsson et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, the view that GDAs are less stable than point mutations has emerged. For instance, transient alterations in gene dosage are a common mechanism of heteroresistance, i.e., resistant subpopulations within a drug-sensitive bacterial isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hufnagel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicoloff et al., 2019</xref>). Further, it is estimated that as many as 20% of cells in a bacterial population may harbour a duplication of some genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). These copy number polymorphisms create within-population heterogeneities in gene expression, serving as a bet-hedging strategy with adaptive value in fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a ubiquitous enzyme crucial for growth and division. It catalyses the NADPH-dependent reduction of tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. DHFR is coded by an essential gene in most organisms and its deletion or pharmacological inhibition results in cell death or growth stasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>). Not surprisingly, antifolates are effective therapeutic agents for diverse pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gangjee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gangjee et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, methotrexate, used in the treatment of cancers and autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huennekens, 1994</xref>), pyrimethamine, used as an antimalarial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plowe, 2022</xref>), and trimethoprim, used as an antibacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gleckman et al., 1981</xref>), are all competitive inhibitors of DHFR. Interestingly, copy number amplification and consequent overexpression of DHFR confers resistance in all three systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brochet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Göker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inselburg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morales et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the gene dosage of DHFR appears to be tightly regulated across evolutionarily distant organisms, making it a useful system to understand the principles underlying selection and evolutionary fate of GDA mutations.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DHFR is coded by <italic>folA</italic>. Several point mutations that confer trimethoprim resistance have been identified in this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baym et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Matange, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watson et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, mechanisms that transcriptionally upregulate <italic>folA</italic> expression are also known in trimethoprim-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>. These include <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter and <italic>trans</italic>-acting loss-of-function mutations in <italic>mgrB</italic>, which upregulate <italic>folA</italic> transcription in a PhoQP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baym et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Matange, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toprak et al., 2011</xref>). Earlier work from our group identified Lon, a conserved quality control protease in bacteria, as a posttranslational regulator of trimethoprim resistance. Lon degraded mutant DHFRs and reduced their half-lives in vivo, directly affecting genotype-phenotype relationships of resistance-conferring mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matange, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we first compare early mutational events in wild-type and Lon-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> challenged with trimethoprim. We show that a large genomic duplication encompassing <italic>folA</italic> confers trimethoprim resistance in both genetic backgrounds, though its frequency of occurrence is elevated in <italic>lon-</italic>knockout <italic>E. coli</italic>. We then use this system to ask what factors determine the fate of duplicated <italic>folA</italic> gene copies during evolution at different trimethoprim pressures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A large IS-flanked duplication encompassing <italic>folA</italic> mediates rapid adaptation to trimethoprim in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>We had previously evolved five replicate populations of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 in 300 ng/mL of trimethoprim (~0.3× MIC) for 25 generations. We then isolated and sequenced the genome of a dominant trimethoprim-resistant clone from each population (designated as WTMPR1–5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These sequencing results have been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Matange, 2021</xref>). Briefly, all isolates harboured loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>mgrB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that resulted in PhoQP-dependent overexpression of <italic>folA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Matange, 2021</xref>). Additionally, isolates WTMPR1, 3, and 5 had mutations at the active site of DHFR, while WTMPR4 harboured a large genomic duplication of ~0.6 Mb encompassing <italic>folA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We performed similar evolution experiments starting with an isogenic <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> strain to ask if early adaptation to trimethoprim was altered by Lon deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type and <italic>lon</italic>-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> have similar MIC for trimethoprim, though the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout has a higher inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matange, 2020</xref>). Among trimethoprim-resistant isolates derived from <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic>, designated as LTMPR1–5, three harboured mutations at the <italic>mgrB</italic> locus (LTMPR1–3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). LTMPR4 and LTMPR5 harboured mutations in <italic>pitA</italic>, coding for a metal-phosphate symporter, that have been reported earlier in trimethoprim adapted <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinchhi et al., 2023</xref>). LTMPR5 had a deletion encompassing <italic>pitA</italic>, indicating that loss of PitA was beneficial in trimethoprim. A knockout of <italic>pitA</italic> indeed showed greater colony formation on trimethoprim-supplemented media demonstrating that mutations in this gene were adaptive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), though the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown at present. Interestingly, none of the LTMPR isolates had mutations in DHFR or its promoter. Instead, LTMPR2–4 had evolved GDA mutations similar to WTMPR4, while LTMPR1 had a duplication in an overlapping but shorter genomic stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adaptation to antibiotics by large genomic duplications is favoured in <italic>lon</italic>-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental pipeline used to compare the mutation repertoire of adaptation to trimethoprim in wild-type or <italic>lon</italic>-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic>.

To understand the global transcriptional burden imposed by this amplification, we analysed the gene expression profiles of WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 using RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Since both isolates had loss-of-function mutations in <italic>mgrB</italic>, which cause large changes in global gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinchhi et al., 2023</xref>), we also analysed the transcriptomes of <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic> and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic> strains for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Transcript level of <italic>folA</italic> was higher in LTMPR1 (2.3-fold) and WTMPR4 (5.7-fold) over respective controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Other duplicated genes were mildly overexpressed by ~1.7-fold on average in LTMPR1 (over <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic>) and ~1.3-fold in WTMPR4 (over <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, there was large variation in expression level among duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that increase in gene dosage did not necessarily result in enhanced expression levels. Instead, global gene expression profiles of WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 were correlated with <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic> and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and most of the top 50 up/downregulated genes in WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 could be attributed to loss of <italic>mgrB</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In line with this result, strains with and without genomic amplifications had comparable fitness costs (~20%) in drug-free media, similar in magnitude to the cost of <italic>mgrB</italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Further, the fitness cost was alleviated in growth media supplemented with high Mg<sup>2+</sup>, i.e., by inhibiting the PhoQP pathway, confirming the source of this cost to be loss of <italic>mgrB</italic> rather than the GDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

For LTMPR1, these trends were explained by a decline in DHFR expression levels over evolution and reversion to a single <italic>folA</italic> copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The GDA-2 mutation was apparently lost and regained multiple times during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a dynamic maintenance in the population rather than fixation.

Interestingly, some of the isolates that did not harbour GDA-2 had evolved mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in RpoS are fixed at late time points during adaptation to trimethoprim and enhance the fitness of <italic>E. coli</italic> without conferring resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Matange, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vinchhi et al., 2023</xref>). We also sequenced a few randomly picked isolates from WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 evolved lines (two from each of the three replicate lineages in each case) to check for the presence of GDA-2 and <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations. As expected, clones derived from WTMPR4 had reverted to a single copy of <italic>folA</italic>, while WTMPR5 retained its ancestrally inherited <italic>folA</italic> mutation. None of them had evolved the GDA-2 mutation, while a few of the isolates from WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 lines had acquired <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with earlier studies, and the role of mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> in general fitness enhancement in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we found that an LTMPR1-derived isolate with mutant <italic>rpoS</italic> recovered fitness in drug-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, an isolate with the GDA-2 mutation had also recovered fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since GDA-2 occurred only in a <italic>lon</italic>-deficient background, and GDA-2 and <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations were mutually exclusive, we wondered whether the fitness enhancing effects of GDA-2 were also mediated by reduced RpoS activity. Lon is known to reduce the levels of RpoS during the exponential growth phase of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranquet and Gottesman, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that at least some targets of RpoS would be overexpressed in a <italic>lon</italic>-knockout. To test this prediction, we analysed the transcriptome of <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> and specifically looked at the expression levels of 168 known targets of RpoS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Of these, 41 genes were overexpressed in the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout by at least 1.5-fold over wild-type, including genes induced in the stationary phase and by various stresses such as <italic>poxB</italic>, <italic>aidB,</italic> and <italic>cbpA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Levels of <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA were however unaffected in this strain. Next, we compared the expression levels of these 41 RpoS targets in LTMPR1 and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic> with <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> as the reference and found that most had similar expression levels in these three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Indeed, a few of these genes showed higher expression levels in LTMPR1 and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic>, which was not unexpected since loss of <italic>mgrB</italic> is known to stabilise RpoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). We checked their expression in isolates derived from LTMPR1 which harboured either GDA-2 or <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations. In both isolates RpoS target genes were downregulated, indicating a resetting of RpoS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Finally, deletion of <italic>rpoS</italic> from <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> enhanced the fitness of the strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, evolution of LTMPR1 in antibiotic-free media was characterised by rapid reversal of GDA-mediated resistance and acquisition of mutations that enhanced fitness by reducing the levels of RpoS-transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lower RpoS activity leads to fitness enhancement of LTMPR1 in drug-free media.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative fitness (w) of isolates with the indicated genotypes derived from LTMPR1 evolution in antibiotic-free media (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) calculated using a competitive growth assay using <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔlacZ</italic> as the reference strain.

In Line C too we found that isolates that had lost the ancestral GDA had evolved a point mutation in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter (+TG<sub>-30</sub>) or a Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg mutation in DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We found similar results in sequenced isolates from WTMPR4 lineages, i.e., loss of GDA and gain of a point mutation either in <italic>folA</italic> or its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). WTMPR5-derived isolates did not accumulate additional mutations in <italic>folA</italic> but did acquire mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Interestingly, two isolates from LTMPR1 Lines B and C had evolved new GDA mutations encompassing <italic>folA</italic>. In one of the Line B isolates (Isolate 2), the ancestral GDA was replaced by 5× amplification of a shorter genomic region (~12 kb) encompassing <italic>folA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both ends of this newly amplified region were flanked by IS1 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, one of the Line C isolates (Isolate 5) had an expanded duplication beyond what was originally found in LTMPR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Also, both copies of <italic>folA</italic> in this isolate coded for DHFR-Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the original GDA was lost and an extended GDA mutation was gained after fixation of the mutant <italic>folA</italic> allele.</p><p>Based on these results we concluded that even under drug pressure, GDA mutations were reversed in most bacteria. Notably, reversion to a single <italic>folA</italic> copy was slower than in drug-free media as it first required the fixation of point mutations at the <italic>folA</italic> locus. However, in a smaller subpopulation, more than one <italic>folA</italic> gene copy was maintained. This maintenance was dynamic and likely involved repeated loss and gain of GDA mutations.</p><p>To further investigate the replacement of GDA by point mutants, we checked to see if point mutants could invade a population harbouring GDA mutations under drug pressure. We allowed LTMPR1-derived isolates with point mutations in <italic>folA</italic> (marked with Δ<italic>lacZ::Cat</italic>) to compete with a GDA-harbouring isolate from the same time point in evolution and asked how rapidly the former could invade a population of the latter. We performed these competitions with a contemporary GDA-harbouring isolate rather than the ancestor to nullify the effects of other media adaptations such as <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations that may have been acquired over evolution. Since for this assay we used point mutant strains genetically marked with Δ<italic>lacZ::Cat</italic> we verified the neutrality of the Δ<italic>lacZ::Cat</italic> marker by checking if the marked isolate could invade its unmarked parent. In the presence of trimethoprim (300 ng/mL), point mutants were enriched over the GDA mutant in coculture by about 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) recreating the results of our evolution experiment. A possible explanation for this finding may be higher resistance level conferred by <italic>folA</italic> point mutations than GDA. Indeed, some isolates with <italic>folA</italic> point mutations had higher IC50 values compared to a contemporary GDA-harbouring isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, regardless of IC50 values, all isolates also had similar doubling times in the presence of 300 ng/mL trimethoprim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, though there were no large observable differences in growth rate between isolates, point mutants could indeed invade and outcompete GDA mutations, reflecting either subtle differences in fitness between them or their relative stabilities in culture.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Invasion of gene duplication and amplification (GDA)-dominant populations by point mutations under trimethoprim pressure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Competition between isolates with point mutations in <italic>folA</italic> and an isolate that harboured a <italic>folA</italic> duplication derived from the same time point of LTMPR1 evolution (upper panel).

To address this question, we first asked what the advantage of <italic>folA</italic> duplication was in the two different mutational trajectories. Isolates from Line A had similar IC50 values for trimethoprim regardless of whether they had one or two copies of <italic>folA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). On the contrary, isolates from Line B that harboured only one copy of mutant <italic>folA</italic> (coding for DHFR-Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp) displayed ~3.5-fold lower IC50 than those that harboured two copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Immunoblotting showed that isolates from Line A had similar expression level of DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, DHFR protein level was significantly compromised by the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutation combination and double the number of <italic>folA</italic> gene copies restored this defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, higher gene dosage of DHFR was dispensable once a promoter upregulatory mutation was fixed.

This affects the expression level of DHFR, resulting in lower cellular abundance that limits the resistance level conferred by mutations at Trp<sub>30</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matange, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matange et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, residue Tyr<sub>151</sub> lies in the same hydrophobic pocket as Trp<sub>30</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). To test the effect of combination of mutations at these sites on trimethoprim resistance and DHFR expression, we first heterologously expressed wild-type DHFR, Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg, or Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp single mutants and the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp double mutant in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). As expected, DHFR Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg expression increased the IC50 of trimethoprim. Surprisingly, neither DHFR Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp nor the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp double mutant conferred resistance to the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Indeed, both mutants conferred lower IC50 values than wild-type DHFR. This effect was due to loss of hydrophobicity at the Tyr<sub>151</sub> position, as DHFR-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Leu and DHFR-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Phe conferred similar IC50 values as wild-type DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Since the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutation combination had evolved in a <italic>lon</italic>-deficient background, we next expressed these mutants in <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Here too, DHFR Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg conferred trimethoprim resistance, while the Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Strikingly, the combination of Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg and Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp conferred very high-level trimethoprim resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), demonstrating synergistic epistasis that was contingent on the absence of Lon protease. The levels of expression of DHFR mutants in wild-type and <italic>lon</italic>-deficient bacteria mirrored trimethoprim resistance levels indicating that clearance by Lon altered their genotype-phenotype relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Based on these data, we concluded that the action of proteostatic machinery generated additional demand for expression by clearing mutant-DHFR proteins. This additional demand drove the maintenance of <italic>folA</italic> duplications in bacteria evolving at very high drug pressures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ohno’s hypothesis, proposed in 1970, provided a conceptual framework to think about the evolution and eventual fate of duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Several theoretical and experimental studies have built upon the original idea to delineate the evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Long et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, experimental evolution of microbes has been used to test some of the suggestions made by Ohno and others. This approach has the inherent advantage of greater control over the selection pressure applied and availability of genetic tools to interrogate molecular mechanisms. In most studies, an artificial system was constructed and then evolved under defined selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holloway et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kugelberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naseeb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomanek and Guet, 2022</xref>). Our study began with serendipitous isolation of spontaneous trimethoprim-resistant mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> that overproduced DHFR because of a <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication. We exploited this system to understand the relationship between selection pressure and gene duplication in the context of drug resistance evolution. The selection pressure for higher gene expression, i.e., ‘expression demand’, can be understood as the amount of a gene product that is required to maintain fitness in a particular environment. Antibiotics directly increase expression demand by inhibiting the activity of their targets. Our study shows that increasing gene dosage is a rapid, but transient evolutionary response to ensure that expression demand is met. On the other hand, point mutations are relatively stable routes to mitigating expression demand. Over short timescales, changes in gene dosage can counter the effects of antibiotic. However, their inherent instability results in almost inevitable replacement with phenotypically equivalent point mutations. Thus, continued antibiotic exposure delayed but could not prevent reversion to low gene copy number in most of our experiments. Further, we discover a novel association between proteostasis and gene dosage evolution. In <italic>E. coli</italic> evolving at high trimethoprim pressure, bacterial protein quality control exacerbated expression demand by clearing mutant DHFR-s. As a result, drug-resistant mutants of DHFR with low proteolytic stability drove the maintenance of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Based on these findings we propose that a combination of factors, which include environmental and physiological, alter the relationship between gene copy number and fitness, and drive gene dosage evolution.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of expression demand induced selection of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication, followed by replacement by phenotypically equivalent point mutants.</title><p>Expression demand for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is generated by trimethoprim pressure, which results in the selection of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplications. Gene duplication is inherently unstable and reverses to a single copy of wild-type <italic>folA</italic> when drug pressure is withdrawn. Under drug pressure, <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication is maintained until a point mutation that confers resistance arises in one of the copies of <italic>folA</italic> (promoter or coding region). Upon acquisition of a point mutation, reversal of gene duplication ensues unless additional expression demand is generated by the action of proteostatic machinery on unstable drug-resistant DHFR mutants.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99785-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A key finding from our study was the twofold influence that proteostatic machinery had on gene copy number. Firstly, Lon protease deficiency promoted GDA mutations, possibly by allowing accumulation of IS-tranposase proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This observation resonates with earlier work by Nicoloff and coworkers who found that large IS-element flanked genomic duplications in tetracycline-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> were commonly preceded by spontaneous mutations that inactivated <italic>lon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicoloff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicoloff et al., 2006</xref>). Further, the role of Lon protease in regulating IS-element mobility by a similar mechanism has been previously demonstrated for IS1 and IS903 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derbyshire et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rouquette et al., 2004</xref>). We note however that other mechanisms by which Lon may modulate the frequency of IS-mediated GDAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> cannot be ruled out. For instance, Lon protease homologs from several organisms directly bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlowicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sonezaki et al., 1995</xref>), though the role of this binding in DNA transactions is unclear. Similarly, Lon is a regulator of the recombination protein, RecA, by its action on LexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breidenstein et al., 2012</xref>) and in <italic>Salmonella</italic> RecA stimulated the rate of gene duplications mediated by IS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reams et al., 2012</xref>). The second impact of protein quality control on GDA was the action of proteases on trimethoprim-resistant mutants of DHFR, which promoted gene duplication by generating additional demand for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Importantly, which of these two effects dominated was determined by a combination of environment, i.e., drug concentrations, and other mutations acquired at the <italic>folA</italic> locus during evolution. In particular, mutations in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter could alleviate expression demand and hence reduce selection for high gene copy number.</p><p>The interplay between GDA and point mutations during evolution that we report here agrees in many respects with a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomanek and Guet, 2022</xref>. They use an elegantly designed artificial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomanek and Guet, 2022</xref>) in which expression of the <italic>galK</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> was driven by a very low activity promoter. This strain was then allowed to evolve in different concentrations of galactose. Like the present study, they found that the activity of IS-elements biased evolutionary trajectories in favour of duplications. They also showed that co-occurrence of duplications and point mutations was selected only at high expression demand, in agreement with our findings. Finally, they argued that gene duplication events may constrain evolution by point mutations. Our study corroborates these results at the short term in that the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout which showed a higher propensity for GDA mutations did not evolve point mutations in <italic>folA</italic> at early time points of evolution. However, given the relative low stability of large GDAs, these were inevitably lost over longer duration of evolution and replaced with point mutations. Thus, it is likely that the different mutational profiles of GDA-biased populations may be relevant only at short durations of evolution. It is important to note that though we have focused on the effects of mutations at the <italic>folA</italic> locus, which are directly under trimethoprim pressure, many of the isolates from our evolution experiments also harboured additional mutations at other loci. For instance, mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> were seen throughout our evolution lines and at least in drug-free media were significant contributors to bacterial fitness. It is not yet clear what the role of other mutations are likely to be under antibiotic selection, though it may be envisaged that these additional mutations play the role of media adaptations. We did not take their effects into this study account since we expected them to be minor contributors to fitness, especially during evolution under trimethoprim selection. However, their role in modulating the stability and selection of GDA mutations in drug-free/low drug environments may be more significant and remains to be investigated in the future.</p><p>In summary, the present study uncovers the complex relationship between gene copy number, point mutations, and environment, and identifies proteostasis as a regulator of gene dosage evolution in bacteria. These findings open up the possibility of alternative explanations for how gene duplications may be maintained over long periods of evolution and provides insight into how gene expression demand is mitigated by multiple mechanisms in bacteria. Moreover, our findings relating proteostasis in general and Lon in particular, to adaptive mutations add to a growing body of literature that define a causal link between protein quality control and mutational paths of evolution. For DHFR itself, decreasing the stringency of protein quality control changes the fitness landscape of single mutations and their combinations, altering the mutational repertoires accessible during adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matange, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guerrero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>). Similar effects of protein homeostatic machinery on mutant fitness are reported from a diverse range of proteins that influence phenomena like viral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2023</xref>) and the fate of horizontally acquired genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bershtein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Standley et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, a central role for protein quality control machinery in molecular and organismal evolution is reflected in conserved signatures of the proteostatic network across the different kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koutsandreas et al., 2024</xref>). These links may be important to consider for a new wave of potential antibacterials that target proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khodaparast et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lupoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Won et al., 2024</xref>). It appears critical to ensure that the impact of changes in evolvability are considered when designing such strategies for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Prof. Manjula Reddy, CCMB, India</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI:txid511145</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-DHFR<break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matange et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">(100 ng/mL)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-FtsZ<break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Prof. Manjula Reddy, CCMB, India</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:50,000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pPRO-<italic>folA</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matange et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid for<break/>expression of DHFR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Trimethoprim</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

While this question has been worked on (for example by Tomanek and Guet) the authors add several important aspects relating to resistance against antibiotics and they clarify the ability of Lon protease to reduce duplication formation (previous work was more indirect).</p><p>A key finding Jena et al. present is that point mutations after significant competition displace GDA. A second one is that alternative GDA constantly arise and displace each other (see work on GDA-2 in Figure 3). Finally, the authors found epistasis between resistance allele that was contingent on lon. Together this shows an intricate interplay of lon proteolysis for the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance by gene duplication.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study has several important strengths: (i) the work on GDA stability and competition of GDA with point mutations is a very promising area of research and the authors contribute new aspects to it, (ii) rigorous experimentation, (iii) very clearly written introduction and discussion sections. To me, the best part of the data is that deletion of lon stimulates GDA, which has not been shown with such clarity until now.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Previously raised minor weaknesses and technical questions have been adequately resolved in the revised manuscript. As the experiments and their results are described in great detail the interested reader needs stamina. The details will, however, be informative to the specialist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99785.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an important paper that investigates the relationship between proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target enzyme and the evolution of antibiotic resistance via increased gene copy number. The target of the antibiotic trimethoprim is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, DHFR is encoded by folA and the major proteolysis housekeeping protease is Lon (lon). In this manuscript, the authors report the result of the experimental evolution of a lon mutant strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic trimethoprim then investigate the relationship between proteolytic stability of DHFR mutants and the evolution of folA gene duplication. After 25 generations of serial passaging in a fixed concentration of trimethoprim, the authors found that folA duplication events were more common during evolution of the lon strain, than the wt strain. However, with continued passaging, some folA duplications were replaced by a single copy of folA containing a trimethoprim resistance-conferring point mutation. Interestingly, evolution of the lon strain in the setting of increasing concentrations of trimethoprim resulted in evolved strains with different levels of DHFR expression. In particular, some strains maintained two copies of a mutant folA that encoded an unstable DHFR. In a lon+ background, this mutant folA did not express well and did not confer trimethoprim resistance. However, in the lon- background, it displayed higher expression and conferred high-level trimethoprim resistance. The authors concluded that maintenance of the gene duplication event (and the absence of Lon) compensated for the proteolytic instability of this mutant DHFR. In summary, they provide evidence that the proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target protein is an important determinant of the evolution of target gene copy number in the setting of antibiotic selection.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of this paper is identifying an example of antibiotic resistance evolution that illustrates the interplay between the proteolytic stability and copy number of an antibiotic target in the setting of antibiotic selection.

While this question has been worked on (for example by Tomanek and Guet) the authors add several important aspects relating to resistance against antibiotics and they clarify the ability of Lon protease to reduce duplication formation (previous work was more indirect).</p><p>A key finding Jena et al. present is that point mutations after significant competition displace GDA. A second one is that alternative GDA constantly arise and displace each other (see work on GDA-2 in Figure 3). Finally, the authors found epistasis between resistance alleles that was contingent on lon. Together this shows an intricate interplay of lon proteolysis for the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance by gene duplication.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study has several important strengths: (i) the work on GDA stability and competition of GDA with point mutations is a very promising area of research and the authors contribute new aspects to it, (ii) rigorous experimentation, (iii) very clearly written introduction and discussion sections. To me, the best part of the data is that deletion of lon stimulates GDA, which has not been shown with such clarity until now.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The minor weaknesses of the manuscript are a lack of clarity in parts of the results section (Point 1) and the methods (Point 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We also appreciate the succinct summary of primary findings that the Reviewer has taken cognisance of in their assessment, in particular the association of the Lon protease with the propensity for GDAs as well as its impact on their eventual fate. We have now revised the manuscript for greater clarity as suggested by Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this strong study, the authors provide robust evidence for the role of proteostasis genes in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, and moreover, for stabilizing the proteome in light of gene duplication events.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This strong study offers an important interaction between findings involving GDA, proteostasis, experimental evolution, protein evolution, and antimicrobial resistance. Overall, I found the study to be relatively well-grounded in each of these literatures, with experiments that spoke to potential concerns from each arena. For example, the literature on proteostasis and evolution is a growing one that includes organisms (even micro-organisms) of various sorts. One of my initial concerns involved whether the authors properly tested the mechanistic bases for the rule of Lon in promoting duplication events. The authors assuaged my concern with a set of assays (Figure 8).</p><p>More broadly, the study does a nice job of demonstrating the agility of molecular evolution, with responsible explanations for the findings: gene duplications are a quick-fix, but can be out-competed relative to their mutational counterparts. Without Lon protease to keep the proteome stable, the cell allows for less stable solutions to the problem of antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The study does what any bold and ambitious study should: it contains large claims and uses multiple sorts of evidence to test those claims.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the general argument and conclusion are clear, this paper is written for a bacterial genetics audience that is familiar with the manner of bacterial experimental evolution. From the language to the visuals, the paper is written in a boutique fashion. The figures are even difficult for me - someone very familiar with proteostasis - to understand. I don't know if this is the fault of the authors or the modern culture of publishing (where figures are increasingly packed with information and hard to decipher), but I found the figures hard to follow with the captions. But let me also consider that the problem might be mine, and so I do not want to unfairly criticize the authors.</p><p>For a generalist journal, more could be done to make this study clear, and in particular, to connect to the greater community of proteostasis researchers. I think this study needs a schematic diagram that outlines exactly what was accomplished here, at the beginning. Diagrams like this are especially important for studies like this one that offer a clear and direct set of findings, but conduct many different sorts of tests to get there. I recommend developing a visual abstract that would orient the readers to the work that has been done.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comments regarding data presentation are well-taken. Since we already had a diagrammatic model that sums up the chief findings of our study (Figure 9), we have now provided schematics in Figures 1, 3, 5 and 8 to clarify the workflow of smaller sections of the study. We hope that these diagrams provide greater clarity with regards to the experiments we have conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, I will make some more specific suggestions. In general, this study is well done and rigorous, but doesn't adequately address a growing literature that examines how proteostasis machinery influences molecular evolution in bacteria.</p><p>While this paper might properly test the authors' claims about protein quality control and evolution, the paper does not engage a growing literature in this arena and is generally not very strong on the use of evolutionary theory. I recognize that this is not the aim of the paper, however, and I do not question the authors' authority on the topic. My thoughts here are less about the invocation of theory in evolution (which can be verbose and not relevant), and more about engagement with a growing literature in this very area.</p><p>The authors mention Rodrigues 2016, but there are many other studies that should be engaged when discussing the interaction between protein quality control and evolution.</p><p>A 2015 study demonstrated how proteostasis machinery can act as a barrier to the usage of novel genes: Bershtein, S., Serohijos, A.

Protein homeostasis imposes a barrier to functional integration of horizontally transferred genes in bacteria. PLoS genetics, 11(10), e1005612</p><p>A 2019 study examined how Lon deletion influenced resistance mutations in DHFR specifically: Guerrero RF, Scarpino SV, Rodrigues JV, Hartl DL, Ogbunugafor CB. The proteostasis environment shapes higher-order epistasis operating on antibiotic resistance. Genetics. 2019 Jun 1;212(2):565-75.</p><p>A 2020 study did something similar: Thompson, Samuel, et al. &quot;Altered expression of a quality control protease in <italic>E. coli</italic> reshapes the in vivo mutational landscape of a model enzyme.&quot; Elife 9 (2020): e53476.</p><p>And there's a new review (preprint) on this very topic that speaks directly to the various ways proteostasis shapes molecular evolution:</p><p>Arenas, Carolina Diaz, Maristella Alvarez, Robert H. Wilson, Eugene I. Shakhnovich, C. Brandon Ogbunugafor, and C. Brandon Ogbunugafor. &quot;Proteostasis is a master modulator of molecular evolution in bacteria.&quot;</p><p>I am not simply attempting to list studies that should be cited, but rather, this study needs to be better situated in the contemporary discussion on how protein quality control is shaping evolution. This study adds to this list and is a unique and important contribution. However, the findings can be better summarized within the context of the current state of the field. This should be relatively easy to implement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their encouraging assessment of our manuscript as well as this important critique regarding the context of other published work that relates proteostasis and molecular evolution. Indeed, this was a particularly difficult aspect for us given the different kinds of literature that were needed to make sense of our study. We have now added the references suggested by the reviewer as well as others to the manuscript. We have also added a paragraph in the discussion section (Lines 463-476) that address this aspect and hopefully fill the lacuna that the reviewer points out in this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the relationship between the proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target enzyme and the evolution of antibiotic resistance via increased gene copy number. The target of the antibiotic trimethoprim is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, DHFR is encoded by folA and the major proteolysis housekeeping protease is Lon (lon). In this manuscript, the authors report the results of the experimental evolution of a lon mutant strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic trimethoprim and then investigate the relationship between proteolytic stability of DHFR mutants and the evolution of folA gene duplication. After 25 generations of serial passaging in a fixed concentration of trimethoprim, the authors found that folA duplication events were more common during the evolution of the lon strain, than the wt strain. However, with continued passaging, some folA duplications were replaced by a single copy of folA containing a trimethoprim resistance-conferring point mutation. Interestingly, the evolution of the lon strain in the setting of increasing concentrations of trimethoprim resulted in evolved strains with different levels of DHFR expression. In particular, some strains maintained two copies of a mutant folA that encoded an unstable DHFR. In a lon+ background, this mutant folA did not express well and did not confer trimethoprim resistance. However, in the lon- background, it displayed higher expression and conferred high-level trimethoprim resistance. The authors concluded that maintenance of the gene duplication event (and the absence of Lon) compensated for the proteolytic instability of this mutant DHFR. In summary, they provide evidence that the proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target protein is an important determinant of the evolution of target gene copy number in the setting of antibiotic selection.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of this paper is identifying an example of antibiotic resistance evolution that illustrates the interplay between the proteolytic stability and copy number of an antibiotic target in the setting of antibiotic selection. If the weaknesses are addressed, then this paper will be of interest to microbiologists who study the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the proposed mechanism is highly plausible and consistent with the data presented, the analysis of the experiments supporting the claim is incomplete and requires more rigor and reproducibility. The impact of this finding is somewhat limited given that it is a single example that occurred in a lon strain and compensatory mutations for evolved antibiotic resistance mechanisms are described. In this case, it is not clear that there is a functional difference between the evolution of copy number versus any other mechanism that meets a requirement for increased &quot;expression demand&quot; (e.g. promoter mutations that increase expression and protein stabilizing mutations).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their in-depth assessment of our work and appreciate their concerns regarding reproducibility and rigor in analysis of our data. We have now incorporated this feedback and provided necessary clarifications/corrections in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major Points:</p><p>(1) The authors show that a deletion of lon increases the ability for GDA and they argue that this is adaptive during TMP treatment because it increases the dosage of folA (L. 129). However, the highest frequency of GDA occurred in drug-free conditions (see Figure 1C). This indicates either that GDA is selected in drug-free media and potentially selected against by certain antibiotics. It would help for the authors to discuss this possibility more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this astute observation. It is indeed striking that the GDA mutation (i.e. the GDA-2 mutation) selected in a lon-deficient background does not come up in presence of antibiotics. To probe this further, we have now measured the relative fitness of a representative population of lon-knockout from short-term evolution in drug-free LB (population #3) that harbours GDA-2 against its ancestor (marked with DlacZ). These competition experiments were performed in LB (in which GDA-2 emerged spontaneously), as well as in LB supplemented with antibiotics at the concentrations used during the short term evolution.</p><p>Values of relative fitness, w (mean ± SD from 3 measurements), are provided below:</p><p>LB: 1.4 ± 0.2</p><p>LB + Trimethoprim: 1.6 ± 0.2</p><p>LB + Spectinomycin: 0.9 ± 0.2</p><p>LB + Erythromycin: 1.3 ± 0.3</p><p>LB + Nalidixic acid: 1.5 ± 0.2</p><p>LB + Rifampicin: 1.4 ± 0.2</p><p>These data show an increase in relative fitness in drug-free LB as would be expected. Interestingly, we also observe an increase in relative fitness in LB supplemented with antibiotics, except spectinomycin. This result supports the idea that GDA-2 is a “media adaptation” and provides a general fitness advantage to the lon knockout. However, as the reviewer pointed out, we should expect to see GDA-2 emerge spontaneously in antibiotic-supplemented media as well. We think that this does not happen as the fitness advantage of drug-specific mutations (GDAs or point mutations) far exceed the advantage of a media adaptation GDA. As a result, we only see the specific mutations that provide high benefit against the antibiotic at least over the relatively short duration of 20-25 generations. It is noteworthy the GDA-2 mutation does come up in LTMPR1 when it is passaged over &gt;200 generations in drug-free media, but shows fluctuating frequency over time. We expect, therefore, that given enough time we may detect the GDA-2 mutations even in antibiotic-supplemented media.</p><p>We note, however, that a major caveat in the above fitness calculations is that we cannot be sure that the competing ancestor has no GDA-2 mutations during the course of the experiment. Thus, the above fitness values are only indicative and not definitive. We have therefore not included these data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear if the isolates WTMPR1 - 5 and LTMPR1 - 5 were pure clones. The authors write in L.488 &quot;Colonies were randomly picked, cultured overnight in drug-free LB and frozen in 50% glycerol at -80C until further use.&quot; And in L. 492 &quot;For long-term evolution, trimethoprim-resistant isolates LTMPR1, WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 were first revived from frozen stocks in drug-free LB overnight.&quot; From these descriptions, it is possible that the isolates contained a fraction of cells of other genotypes since colonies are often formed by more than one cell and thus, unless pure-streaked, a subpopulation is present and would in drug-free media be maintained. The possibility of pre-existing subpopulations is important for all statements relating to &quot;reversal&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid concern. As far as we can tell all our initial isolates (i.e. WTMPR1-5 and LTMPR1-5) are pure clones at least as far as SNPs are concerned. This is based on whole genome sequencing data that we have reported earlier in Patel and Matange, eLife (2021), where we described the evolution and isolation of WTMPR1-5 and the present study for LTMPR1-5. All SNPs detected were present at a frequency of 100%. For clones with GDAs, however, there is no way to eliminate a sub-population that has a lower or higher gene copy number than average from an isolate. This is because of the inherent instability of GDAs that will inevitably result in heterogeneous gene copy number during standard growth. In this sense, there is most certainly a possibility of a pre-existing subpopulation within each of the clones that may have reversed the GDA. Indeed, we believe that it is this inherent instability that contributes to their rapid loss during growth in drug-free media.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Points:</p><p>(1) L. 406. &quot;allowing accumulation of IS transposases in <italic>E. coli</italic>&quot; Please specify that it is the accumulation of transposase proteins (and not genes).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) L. 221 typo.

To simplify the understanding of our data, we have provided small schematics at various points in the paper to clarify the experimental pipelines used by us. We have also provided additional discussion situating our study in the emerging area of proteostasis and molecular evolution. We hope that our revisions have addressed these lacunae in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major Points:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is generally a bit difficult to follow. The writing is overly complicated and lacks clarity at times. It should be simplified and improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made several revisions to the text, as well as provided schematics in some of our figures which hopefully make our paper easier to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I cannot find the raw variant summary data for the lon strain evolution experiment in trimethoprim (after 25 generations). Were there any other mutations identified? If not, this should be explicitly stated in the text and the variant output summary from sequencing included as supplemental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this oversight. We have now provided these data as Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) What is the trimethoprim IC50 of the starting (pre-evolution) strains (i.e. wt and lon)? I can't find this information, but it is critical to interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We had reported these values earlier in Matange N., J Bact (2020). Wild type and lon-knockout have similar MIC values for trimethoprim, though the lon mutant shows a higher IC50 value. We have now mentioned this in the results section (Line 100-101) and also provided the reference for these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) What was the average depth of coverage for WGS? This information is necessary to assess the quality of the variant calling, especially for the population WGS.</p></disp-quote><p>All genome sequencing data has a coverage at least 100x. We have added this detail to the methods section (Line 580-581).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Five replicate evolution experiments (25 generations, or 7x 10% daily batch transfers) were performed in trimethoprim for the wt and lon strains. Duplication of the folA locus occurred in 1/5 and 4/5 experiments, respectively. It is not entirely clear what type of sampling was actually done to arrive at these numbers (this needs to be stated more clearly), but presumably 1 random colony was chosen at the end of the passaging protocol for each replicate. Based on this result, the authors conclude that folA duplication occurred more frequently in the lon strain, however, this is not rigorously supported by a statistical evaluation. With N=5, one cannot rigorously conclude that a 20% frequency and 80% frequency are significantly different. Furthermore, it's not entirely clear what the mechanism of resistance is for these strains. For example, in one colony sequenced (LTMPR5), it appears no known resistance mechanism (or mutations?) were identified, and yet the IC50 = 900 nM, which is also similar to other strains.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we agree with the reviewer that we don’t have the statistical power to rigorously make this claim. However, since the lon-knockout showed us a greater frequency of GDA across 3 different environments we are fairly confident that loss of lon enhances the overall frequency for GDA mutations. This idea in also supported by a number of previous papers that related GDAs and IS-element transpositions with Lon, viz. Nicoloff et al, Antimicrob Agent Chemother (2007), Derbyshire et al. PNAS (1990), Derbyshire and Grindley, Mol Microbiol (1996). We have therefore not provided further justification in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We had indeed sampled a random isolate from each of the 5 populations and have added a schematic to figure 1 that provides greater clarity.</p><p>Having relooked at the sequencing data for LTMPR1-5 isolates (Table 1), we realised that both LTMPR4 and LTMPR5 harbour mutations in the pitA gene. We had missed this locus during the previous iteration of this manuscript and misidentified an mgrB mutations in LTMPR4. PitA codes for a metal-phosphate symporter. We have observed mutations in pitA in earlier evolution experiments with trimethoprim as well (Vinchhi and Yelpure et al. mBio 2023). Interestingly, in LTMPR5 there was a deletion of pitA, along with 17 other contiguous genes mediated by IS5. To test if loss of pitA is beneficial in trimethoprim, we tested the ability of a pitA knockout to grow on trimethoprim supplemented plates. Indeed, loss of pitA conferred a growth advantage to <italic>E. coli</italic> on trimethoprim, comparable to loss of mgrB, indicating that the mechanism of resistance of LTMPR5 may be due to loss of pitA. We have added these data to the Supplementary Figure 1 of the revised manuscript and provided a brief description in Lines 103-108. How pitA deficiency confers trimethoprim resistance is yet to be investigated. The mechanism is likely to be by activating some intrinsic resistance mechanism as loss of pitA also conferred a fitness benefit against other antibiotics. This work is currently underway in our lab and hence we do not provide any further mechanism in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Although measurement error/variance is reported, statistical tests were not performed for any of the experiments. This is critical to support the rigor and reproducibility of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statistical testing wherever appropriate to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Lines 150-155 and Figure 2E: Putting a wt copy of mgrB back into the WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 strains would be a better experiment to dissect out the role of mgrB versus the other gene duplications in these strains on fitness. Without this experiment, you cannot confidently attribute the fitness costs of these strains to the inactivation of mgrB alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our claim was based on a correlation alone. We have now added some new data to confirm our model (Figure 2 E, F). The costs of mgrB mutations come from hyperactivation of PhoQP. In earlier work we have shown that the costs (and benefit) of mgrB mutations can be abrogated in media supplemented with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which turns off the PhoQ receptor (Vinchhi and Yelpure et al. mBio, 2023). We use this strategy to show that like the mgrB-knockout, the costs of WTMPR4, WTMPR5 and LTMPR1 can be almost completely alleviated by adding Mg<sup>2+</sup> to growth media. These results confirm that the source of fitness cost of TMP-resistant bacteria was not linked to GDA mutations, but to hyperactivation of PhoQP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 3F and G: Does the top symbol refer to the starting strain for the 'long-term' evolution? If so, why does WTMPR4 not have the mgrB mutation (it does in Figure 1)? Based on your prior findings, it seems odd that this strain would evolve an mgrB loss of function mutation in the absence of trimethoprim exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this error out. We have made the correction in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 6A: If the marker is neutral, it should be maintained at 0.1% throughout the 'neutrality' experiment. In both plots, the proportion of some marked strains goes up and then down. This suggests either ongoing evolution (these competitions take place over 105 generations), or noisy data. I suspect these data are just inherently noisy. I don't see error bars in the plots. Were these experiments ever replicated? It seems that replicating the experiments might be able to separate out noise from signal and perhaps clarify this point and better confirm the hypothesis that the point mutants are more fit.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were indeed noisy and the apparent enrichment is most likely a measurement error rather than a real change in frequency of competing genotypes. We have now provided individual traces for each of the competing pairs with mean and SD from triplicate observations at each time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 6A: Please indicate which plotted line refers to which 'point mutant' using different colors. These mutants have different trimethoprim IC50s and doubling times, so it would be nice to be able to connect each mutant to its specific data plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now colour coded the different strain combinations as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Lines 284-285: I disagree that the IC50s are similar. The C-35T mutant has IC50 that is 2x that of LTMPR1. Perhaps more telling is that, compared to the folA duplication strain from the same time-point (which also carries the rpoS mutation), all of the point mutants have greater IC50s (~2x greater). 2-fold changes in IC50 are significant. It would seem that the point-mutants were likely not competing against LTMPR1 at the time they arose, so LTMPR1 might not be the best comparator if it was extinguished from the population early. I'm assuming this is why you chose a contemporary isolate (and, also, rpoS mutant) for the competition experiments. This should be explained more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, the reviewer is correct about the rationale behind the use of a contemporary isolate and we have provided this clarification in the revised manuscript (Line 287-289). Also, the reviewer is correct in pointing out that a two-fold difference in IC50 cannot be ignored. However, the key point here would be in assessing the differences in growth rates at the antibiotic concentration used during competition (i.e. 300 ng/mL). We are unable to see a direct correlation between the growth rates and enrichment in culture indicating that the observed trends are unlikely to be driven by ‘level of resistance’ alone. We have added these clarifications to the modified manuscript (Lines 299-301)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Points:</p><p>(1) Line 13: Add a comma before 'Escherichia'</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 14: Consider changing &quot;mutations...were beneficial in trimethoprim&quot; to &quot;mutations...were beneficial under trimethoprim exposure&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 32: Is gene dosage really only &quot;relative to the genome&quot;?

This needs to be clarified because it is confusing how a mutation that causes DHFR proteolytic instability would lead to an increase in trimethoprim IC50. So, you also need to mention that some mutations can cause both increased trimethoprim inhibition and lower proteolytic stability simultaneously. It seems the Trp30Arg mutation is an example of this, as this mutation is associated with a net increase in trimethoprim resistance despite the competing effects of the mutation on enzyme inhibition and DHFR levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that the text in the original manuscript did not fully convey the message.
