Proteasome function is vulnerable to environmental insults, cellular protein imbalance and targeted pharmaceuticals. Yet, mechanisms that cells deploy to counteract inhibition of this central regulator are little understood. To find such mechanisms, we reduced flux through the proteasome to the point of toxicity with specific inhibitors and performed genome-wide screens for mutations that allowed cells to survive. Counter to expectation, reducing expression of individual subunits of the proteasome's 19S regulatory complex increased survival. Strong 19S reduction was cytotoxic but modest reduction protected cells from inhibitors. Protection was accompanied by an increased ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes, preservation of protein degradation capacity and reduced proteotoxic stress. While compromise of 19S function can have a fitness cost under basal conditions, it provided a powerful survival advantage when proteasome function was impaired. This means of rebalancing proteostasis is conserved from yeast to humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08467.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08467.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08467.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have numerous methods for removing proteins that have been damaged or are no longer needed. One of these methods is carried out by a large protein complex called the proteasome. Because of its central role in maintaining protein balance, drugs that stop the proteasome functioning often kill cancer cells grown in dishes. However, these proteasome inhibitors tend not to work against most tumors in patients. Moreover, tumors that do respond to these drugs ultimately become resistant to them.</p><p>Tsvetkov <italic>et al</italic>. used a genetic screen to find the mutations that allowed cancer cells to withstand exposure to proteasome inhibitors.

Protein chaperone systems and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are essential components of the global architecture that sustains protein homeostasis. The importance of these systems is underscored by the fact that perturbation of protein homeostasis is central to diverse human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). In neurodegenerative diseases, cells succumb to an overload of toxic protein aggregates. Whereas in cancer, malignant cells co-opt protein quality control systems to accommodate the severe proteotoxic stresses that arise from high mutation loads, relentless biomass accumulation and protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deshaies, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scherz-Shouval et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because the ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major mechanism regulating protein turnover, cells are highly vulnerable to insults that impair the function of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varshavsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petrocca et al., 2013</xref>). Proteasome function can be hampered in many ways. For example, a multitude of environmental stresses cause the toxic accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gidalevitz et al., 2011</xref>). Such proteins can bind the proteasome and stabilize an inactive closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deriziotis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayyadevara et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, chemically diverse natural product inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are elaborated by organisms as diverse as terrestrial and marine bacteria, fungi, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kisselev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneekloth and Crews, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>). These proteasome inhibitors can thwart the proliferation of neighboring organisms and thereby provide a competitive growth advantage.</p><p>Applying this lesson from nature toward the treatment of cancer has been an effective strategy. Malignant cells in which the rates of protein synthesis outstrip proteasome degradation capacity are exceedingly vulnerable to proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cenci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deshaies, 2014</xref>). Targeting the 26S proteasome with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) is particularly effective in hematopoietic tumors. Indeed, it is broadly applied as a therapy for patients with myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crawford and Irvine, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The 26S proteasome is an elaborate multi-subunit protein complex that is present in all eukaryotes. This complex is comprised of a 20S catalytic core that orchestrates peptide bond cleavage and a 19S regulatory complex that can be attached to either or both ends of the 20S core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Besche et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). The 19S complex recognizes ubiquitin-tagged substrates, cleaves ubiquitin chains, unfolds substrates and translocates the unfolded proteins into the catalytic chamber of the 20S core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hochstrasser, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Finley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matyskiela et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite an exquisitely detailed understanding of proteasome function and of the mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors, we have a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that cells deploy to resist the cytotoxic effects of reduced flux through the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kale and Moore, 2012</xref>). Such an understanding is of great importance in the dynamics of natural ecosystems in the face of diverse proteotoxic stresses and in the clinic, where pre-existing intrinsic resistance and acquired resistance following drug exposure have limited the effectiveness of bortezomib as a therapeutic.</p><p>To gain insights into the mechanisms that allow cells to withstand reduced flux through the proteasome, we took advantage of highly specific chemical inhibitors. While proteasome function can be impaired by many factors, none can be controlled with the dosage-dependent precision of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and the peptide aldehyde MG132. These inhibit both 20S and 26S proteasomes by targeting the core proteolytic catalytic activity of the 20S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kisselev et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldberg, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We used these inhibitors at toxic levels in an unbiased, genome-wide screen. We selected for cells that were resistant to the inhibitors from a library of 100 million gene-trap insertions, using a human cell line that is haploid for all chromosomes except chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carette et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011a</xref>). This approach is analogous to screens so broadly and effectively used in haploid yeast and identifies loss-of-function events that allow human cells to survive diverse toxic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guimaraes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reiling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carette et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winter et al., 2014</xref>). The results of our screen led us to the discovery of a surprising and highly conserved strategy by which organisms can protect themselves from the toxic effects of reduced flux through the proteasome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbiased mammalian screen identifies 19S subunits as key determinants of resistance to proteasome inhibitors</title><p>For our screens, we used a library of near-haploid human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (KBM7) containing approximately 100 million retroviral gene-trap insertions that target over 98% of transcribed genes.

Surprisingly, all insertions that reached a high level of statistical enrichment (p-value &lt; 1 e<sup>â7</sup>) lay in genes encoding subunits of the proteasome 19S regulatory complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These included both ATPase subunits (<italic>PSMC2, PSMC3, PSMC4, PSMC5</italic>, and <italic>PSMC6</italic>) as well as non-ATPase subunits (<italic>PSMD2, PSMD6, PSMD7</italic>, and <italic>PSMD12</italic>). No insertions were recovered in genes encoding subunits of the 20S catalytic core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the bortezomib resistance screen, we recovered 538 independent insertions. The results of the 2 screens were remarkably similar with seven of the ten most highly enriched genes encoding subunits of the 19S complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Such strikingly similar results from 2 unbiased screens with chemically distinct proteasome inhibitors strongly indicated that altering the 19S complex can protect cells against compounds that inhibit the 20S catalytic core. From the resistant pools of cells, we then attempted to isolate stable clones that contained 19S subunit gene insertions. We were unable to do so. Next, we attempted to delete PSMD12 in a near-haploid fibroblast cell line (HAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carette et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Essletzbichler et al., 2014</xref>). With this targeted approach using CRISPR constructs, we were only able to recover diploid cell variants in which just one of the two PSMD12 alleles was disrupted.</p><p>Finally, from a collection of haploid mouse embryonic stem cells that harbor reversible gene-trap cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elling et al., 2011</xref>), we identified two clones with cassettes located in the first intron of the <italic>PSMC2</italic> or <italic>PSMD12</italic> genes.

In contrast, the effects of knocking down several different 19S subunits had opposing effects, depending on the absence or presence of the inhibitor. In its absence, 19S subunit reduction had a fitness cost and decreased cell viability; in its presence, 19S subunit reduction provided a survival advantage and increased viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>).</p><p>To investigate further, we sought to recover stable clones with reduced levels of 19S subunits. Long-term 19S subunit reduction impeded the growth of most cells, but we were able to propagate two lines that proliferated normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). These lines stably expressed shRNA targeting either PSMC5 or PSMD2. In both cases, the lines had only a modest reduction in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).

Bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity was not observed in control cells at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, star). In cells with reduced levels of either PSMC5 or PSMD2, 26S proteasome complexes were reduced and 20S proteasome complexes were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panel). These changes persisted in the presence of bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we assayed 20S proteasome complex activity with a fluorescently labeled substrate on native gels. Exposing control cells to 12 nM bortezomib for 24 hr led to a nearly complete inactivation of 20S proteasome function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). Cells with reduced levels of either PSMC5 or PSMD2 maintained a significant level of 20S proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To validate our findings, we selected four additional cell lines each with a different shRNA driving modest reduction in PSMD2 protein levels.

One major response to such inhibition is the activation of NRF1, a transcriptional regulator of proteasome gene expression that increases the expression of proteasome subunits, elevates proteasome content, and promotes resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>). A second major response to proteasome inhibitors is activation of heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of the heat-shock response, which increases levels of HSP70 and other protein chaperones.</p><p>Surprisingly, in the four cell lines with modest reductions of PSMD2, we did not detect constitutive activation of NRF1, and correspondingly, the expression of 20S subunits was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, HSF1 was not activated as reflected by the stable expression of HSP70, the protein that is most highly responsive to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with these findings, polyubiquitinated proteins did not accumulate in the PSMD2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) suggesting that modestly reducing 19S subunit levels did not itself induce a cytoprotective stress response.</p><p>Not only were stress response pathways not activated, but the response to bortezomib was blunted in cells with reduced PSMD2 levels. The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins was reduced relative to control cells treated with the inhibitor. The activation of NRF1 was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We obtained very similar results in cells with PSMC5 knockdown except in this case HSP70 levels were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the protective effect of 19S subunit reduction was specific to the toxicity caused by proteasome inhibitors.

In the absence of bortezomib, transiently reducing PSMD2 lowered rates of proteolysis by the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1I</xref>), but it did not affect protein degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This suggests that the 26S proteasome is normally present in excess.</p><p>To measure rates of protein synthesis, cells were pulse labeled with tritiated-phenylalanine for 1 hr. Reducing PSMD2 levels resulted in a significant and reproducible 7% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, even though PSMD2 knockdown did not reduce protein degradation capacity, it did trigger a reduction in protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), a change that may contribute to lowering basal levels of proteotoxic stress.</p><p>Next, we measured protein degradation and synthesis rates after a 20-hr treatment with bortezomib. The rate of protein degradation sharply decreased in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Rates of proteolysis by the lysosome remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). Transiently reducing PSMD2 strongly counteracted the inhibition of proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Reducing the levels of 19S subunits partially preserved proteasome complex levels following the inhibition of flux through the proteasome by bortezomib. Correspondingly, it partially preserved 20S activity and the cells overall ability to degrade proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2, 4D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Following bortezomib treatment, the rate of protein synthesis also sharply decreased in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This drop reflects the global repression of protein synthesis that normally follows strong proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shalgi et al., 2013</xref>). Transiently reducing PSMD2 protein levels strongly counteracted the bortezomib-mediated suppression of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, reducing PSMD2 levels counteracts the effects of bortezomib on both protein degradation and protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Lower 19S subunit expression levels correlate with increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors across a broad spectrum of cancer cells</title><p>Human cancer cell lines have a broad range of sensitivities to proteasome inhibition.

Very surprisingly, when the proteasome is inhibited to toxic levels, suppressing individual components of the 19S regulatory complex increases cell survival. While strong reduction of any of these subunits is not tolerated, modest reduction is protective.</p><p>In this partially protective state, 26S proteasomes decrease and the levels and activity of 20S proteasomes sharply increase. In the absence of proteasome inhibitors, the change in 20/26S proteasome complex ratios does not reduce protein degradation, polyubiquitinated substrates are not elevated, and hallmark stress responses are not activated. Moreover, at concentrations of proteasome inhibitors that normally unleash these responses, they are suppressed.</p><p>A number of mechanisms could potentially mediate this protective effect. Our data support a significant role for shifts in the ratio of 20S/26S proteasome complexes. Normally, bortezomib treatment suppresses proteasome catalytic activity. We find that bortezomib treatment also leads to a sharp decrease in the levels of proteasome complexes. Remarkably, the protection against bortezomib that is conferred by reducing 19S subunits correlates with a preservation of both the activity of the proteasome and of the levels of the proteasome complexes themselves. Other mechanisms that may contribute include the induction of autophagy, the induction of alternative proteasome regulatory components, or the disruption of normal gating and drugâtarget interaction affinities. These possibilities require further investigation. However, our general findings on the surprising ability of 19S subunit reductions to increase resistance to proteasome inhibitors are complementary to those of D Acosta-Alvear, P Walter, JS Weissman, and M Kampmann (Personal Communication) who arrived at this conclusion through very different approaches.</p><p>While changes in the ratio of 20S/26S proteasomes have not previously been shown to protect cells from inhibition of flux through the proteasome, it is well documented that they occur. Indeed, a broad range of genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors can elicit such changes. In human stem cells, manipulation of just a single subunit of the 19S regulatory complex modified the 20S/26S proteasome ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vilchez et al., 2012</xref>). In cancer cells, many chromosomal regions are recurrently lost, and these often harbor genes that encode 19S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nijhawan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davoli et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, mining data from a survey of 310 cancer cell lines, we find that those that have increased resistance to proteasome inhibitors have strongly reduced expression of at least one but often of several genes encoding 19S subunits.</p><p>The metabolic and environmental factors that can elicit reversible shifts in the 20S/26S proteasome ratio are many and varied. For example, nutrient depravation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>), the activation of glutamate receptor signaling in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tai et al., 2010</xref>), mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Livnat-Levanon et al., 2014</xref>), and various states of increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Livnat-Levanon et al., 2014</xref>) can all increase the levels of 20S proteasome complexes. The ratio of proteasomes can also be regulated by cellular levels of NADH, a co-enzyme that directly binds 19S subunits and influences 26S proteasome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsvetkov et al., 2014</xref>). Further, the ratio is shifted by post-translational modifications mediated by NAD<sup>+</sup> ADP-ribosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ullrich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho-Park and Steller, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The modest reductions in 19S subunits in our experiments did not reduce the overall rates of protein degradation and did not activate proteotoxic stress responses suggesting that these cells normally have a buffer, or excess, of 26S proteasomes. Such a buffer has been recently described in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano et al., 2015</xref>), and if true more broadly, might generally allow cells to tolerate reductions in 19S subunit expression without altering basal rates of proteolysis by the proteasome. In our hands, 19S subunit reduction was accompanied by accumulation of active 20S proteasome complexes. These complexes are highly effective in degrading oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinheckel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grune et al., 2003</xref>) and intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsvetkov et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiggins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</xref>) in an ubiquitin-independent manner. Our results suggest that cells with expanded 20S capacity might be even more broadly positioned to cope with toxic products that accumulate following inhibition of the proteasome.</p><p>The increase in 20S proteasomes may also have other, pleiotropic effects that contribute to the protective state. First, these complexes mediate the endoproteolytic cleavage of translation initiating factors eIF4G1, eIF4F, and eIF3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baugh and Pilipenko, 2004</xref>), which could directly contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis that occurs following 19S subunit reduction. Second, 20S proteasomes preferentially degrade newly synthesized substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsvetkov et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, 20S proteasome complexes degrade numerous intrinsically disordered proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, cell cycle control, and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jariel-Encontre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</xref>). The degradation of such 20S substrates could underlie the robust anti-proliferation response that follows bortezomib treatment of cells with reduced 19S subunits. Such a shift into a quiescent-like state likely triggers adaptive cytoprotection. This is reminiscent of yeast that transition into stationary phase when nutrients are exhausted. In this setting, there is also a reversible reduction in protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuge et al., 1994</xref>) and levels of 26S proteasomes sharply decrease in favor of active 20S proteasomes, which are essential for viability during prolonged periods of nutrient depravation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the protective mechanism that is generated upon 20S formation is likely conserved from yeast to human and may be part of the natural transitions used to established stress-resistant quiescent states.</p><p>In our experiments, this mechanism for increasing resistance was revealed by the use of highly controllable chemical compounds. However, in nature, mechanisms for rebalancing the 20S/26S proteasome ratio most likely emerged to help cells contend with perturbations that cause protein misfolding. In fact, intracellular and environmental insults that generate large protein aggregates are known to impair the proteolytic function of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deriziotis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayyadevara et al., 2015</xref>). Such mechanisms may have also helped organisms withstand naturally occurring 20S proteasome inhibitors that are elaborated by microorganisms cohabiting their niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneekloth and Crews, 2011</xref>). Such selective pressures could have shaped the evolution of this ancient survival mechanism, one that emerged long before the advent of the use of proteasome inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutics. In agreement with our results indicating that yeast cells are protected from proteasome inhibitors by reducing 19S subunits, Breslow et al. found that reducing 19S subunits can rescue yeast strains that are growth inhibited by reductions in 20S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Suppressing the expression of many different 19S subunits provided resistance to proteasome inhibitors and there are many potential routes for suppressing their expression (e.g., genetic, metabolic, epigenetic, environmental). This raises the intriguing possibility that large populations of cells might harbor functional heterogeneity for surviving altered flux through the proteasome. At one extreme, some cells might be highly proliferative yet highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition, while at the other extreme, some cells could be slowly proliferative yet highly resistant to proteasome inhibition. Because of their slower proliferation capacity, the latter would have generally reduced relative fitness, analogous to the small populations of drug-tolerant âpersisterâ cells that reside within tumor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glickman and Sawyers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knoechel et al., 2014</xref>).

Libraries were barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB). Libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500, with paired-end 100bp reads. Paired-end reads were aligned to UCSC human transcriptome 19 (hg19) using TopHat (Bowtie v2.0.9). Alignment quality and read distribute was assessed via SAMtools (v0.1.19). Transcript assembly was conducted using cufflinks (v2.2.1). Normalized expression data were generated from aligned BAM files using cuffnorm and cuffdiff. Transcripts with zero values for FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped) across all samples were removed.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Jeffery W Kelly, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The Lindquist Laboratory exposed cells to pharmacologic proteasome inhibitors and performed genome-wide screens for mutations that allowed the cells to remain viable. Survival was increased by reduced expression of subunits comprising the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome, thereby increasing the ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes. The central question both reviewers would like discussed in the paper is: how is it that a reduction of 19S would render the cells less sensitive to inhibition by bortezomib?</p><p>The main concern of the expert reviewer has to do with the hypothesis put forward by the authors to explain why cells with diminished 19S cap are more resistant to bortezomib and/or MG132. The chief argument appears to be that a subset of the 20S is refractory to inhibition in these cells. However, there are some problems with the experiments that show this. In the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> panel F), there is indeed less 20S activity in WT cells treated with bortezomib compared with 19S-deficient cells.

It would also be much better to do this experiment with epoxomicin or carfilzomib because BTZ can potentially dissociate during the native gel electrophoresis, given that the t1/2 has been reported to be in the range of 100 minutes. Finally, it would be desirable to see this effect quantified (e.g. with an LLVY-AMC assay or similar). Please address as many of these suggestions as possible when revisiting your paper for serious consideration for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This very well written paper entitled âCompromising the 19S proteasome complex protects cells from reduced flux through the proteasomeâ is competitive for space in <italic>eLife</italic> from this reviewer's perspective.</p><p>The Lindquist Laboratory exposed cells to pharmacologic proteasome inhibitors and performed genome-wide screens for mutations that allowed the cells to remain viable. Survival was increased by reduced expression of subunits comprising the 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome, thereby increasing the ratio of 20S to 26S proteasomes. While this cellular alteration has fitness costs in the absence of stress (stable cell lines could not be isolated under basal conditions), this means of counteracting reduced flux through the proteasome under stressful conditions is conserved from yeast to humans. All insertions that reached a high level of statistical enrichment occur in genes encoding subunits of the proteasome 19S regulatory complex. These included both subunits that hydrolyze ATP (<italic>PSMC2</italic>, <italic>PSMC3</italic>, <italic>PSMC4</italic>, <italic>PSMC5</italic>, and <italic>PSMC6</italic>) subunits that are not ATPases (<italic>PSMD2</italic>, <italic>PSMD6</italic>, <italic>PSMD7</italic>, and <italic>PSMD12</italic>). No insertions were recovered in genes encoding subunits of the 20S catalytic component of the proteasome. The Bortezomib screen uncovered less loss-of-function hits, consistent with its superior selectivity relative to MG-132 that hits many targets in addition to the 20S proteasome. ShRNA targeting of the PSMD2 subunit of the 19S regulatory subunit rendered cells much more resistant to Bortezomib without activating the heat shock response or the NRF2 transcription factor-this treatment did not ameliorate ER stress or Hsp90 inhibition or non-proteasome flux stresses. In cells with reduced levels of PSMD2, bortezomib treatment strongly repressed genes involved in DNA replication. This heightened anti-proliferation response suggests that cells with reduced 19S subunits are primed to enter a protected, quiescent-like state when flux through the proteasome is reduced. Moreover, reducing PSMD2 levels maintained proteasome degradation flux upon bortezomib treatment and maintained the normal rate of protein synthesis. These phenotypes in mammalian cells are preserved in yeast, identifying a mechanism preserved over a billion years of evolution. In cancer cell lines, proteasome resistance is often coupled to reduction in the expression of one or more genes encoding the 19S subunits of the proteasome, speaking to significance. The central questions I have are:</p><p>1) How is it that a reduction of 19S regulatory subunit of the proteasome would render the cells less sensitive to inhibition by proteasome inhibitors?</p><p>2) How the 20S subunit increases relative to the 26S subunit is not clear to me mechanistically; please address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This is a very interesting paper that makes the surprising observation that knockdown of subunits of the proteasome 19S cap renders cells moderately resistant to CFZ. This is a very counter-intuitive observation that could be of considerable importance as it sheds new light on regulatory mechanisms that enable cells to deal with proteotoxic stress.</p><p>Overall, I find this to be worthy of serious consideration for publication in <italic>eLife.</italic> My main concern has to do with the hypothesis put forward by the authors to explain why cells with diminished 19S cap are more resistant to bortezomib and/or MG132. The chief argument appears to be that a subset of the 20S is refractory to inhibition in these cells. However, there are some problems with the experiments that show this. In the first experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> panel F), there is indeed less 20S activity in WT cells treated with bortezomib compared with 19S-deficient cells, However, there is also much less proteasome. Where is the proteasome going in the WT control? Is this simply a consequence of cell death? But compare with panel 2B â cell number actually seems to be increasing over the first 24h. This experiment would benefit from being repeated as a time-course, so that it is possible to evaluate proteasome activity at a time before the proteasome has largely disappeared from the WT cells. It would also be much better to do this experiment with epoxomicin or carfilzomib because BTZ can potentially dissociate during the native gel electrophoresis, given that the t1/2 has been reported to be in the range of 100 minutes. Finally, it would be desirable to see this effect quantified (e.g. with an LLVY-AMC assay or similar). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel C, a similar experiment is done with transiently depleted cells. Unlike <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, there is not dramatic loss of proteasome in 19S-depleted cells. However, there is essentially undetectable level of 20S activity in the cells treated with BTZ. A time-course and/or dose-titration would be informative. Together, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2B and 4C</xref> are key results for the paper, but the existing data are just not all that compelling.</p><p>The second major point is that I would have liked to see more of a discussion regarding possible mechanisms. How is it that a reduction of 19S would render the cells less sensitive to inhibition by bortezomib? There are several possible explanations, some of which are testable, but the authors are relatively silent on this salient point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08467.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have added additional experiments as requested (and also one that was not requested but further clarifies our points). We have also made modifications to the text. We believe we have thoroughly addressed all concerns and hope you will agree.</p><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we failed to make an important point clear: the increase in 20S proteasome complexes occurs in cells with reduced 19S subunits without an increase in the expression of the individual 20S subunit mRNA or protein levels. We have rearranged the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to better highlight this point. There are sharp changes in 20S complex levels in the native gel panels while total subunit levels remain unchanged in the corresponding SDS PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E ad 2F</xref>).</p><p>We share the reviewersâ interest in the decrease in 20S proteasome complexes in control cells following bortezomib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figure 2C, 2E and 4D</xref>). As the reviewer points out, the decrease is not due to cell death. The analysis had been done at 24 hours after the addition of bortezomib, a time point when cells retained full viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The text and the figure legend now make this point more explicitly. In addition, as the reviewer suggested, we performed a time course, monitoring 20S proteasome complexes (native gel) and total subunit levels (SDS Page gel) at 3, 6 and 18 hours after exposure to bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1G and H</xref>). A significant decrease in the 20S proteasome <italic>complex</italic> occurred by 6 hours, but again, protein <italic>subunit</italic> levels were stable. Notably, the 19S subunit knockdown preserves the levels of 20S proteasome complexes throughout the bortezomib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>We did not suggest that a subset of 20S proteasome complexes is inherently refractory to proteasome inhibition after 19S subunit knockdown. This is certainly an interesting possibility that is now mentioned in the text. It may simply be that cells with 19S knockdown start with such high levels of 20S complex that a significant fraction remains active at the concentrations of bortezomib that we used. To further investigate the increase in 20S complex levels and activity, we fractionated cell lysates using glycerol gradients with and without 19S subunit reduction and with and without bortezomib treatment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The analysis of gradient fractions for proteasome subunit content and activity support our observations from native gel analysis and from the protein degradation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figure 2C and 4D</xref>). The 19S subunit reduction increases the 20S proteasome levels and activity and preserves proteasomal function in the presence of bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>As per the reviewersâ suggestion, we have included an additional paragraph in the Discussion describing additional possible mechanisms for our observations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
