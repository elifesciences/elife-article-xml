hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. This regeneration process is called ductular reaction (DR), which is accompanied by dynamic remodeling of biliary tissue. Although the DR shows apparently distinct mode of biliary extension depending on the type of liver injury, the key regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Lutheran (Lu)/Basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) regulates the morphogenesis of DR depending on liver disease models. Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells isolated from injured liver exhibit opposite phenotypes in cell motility and duct formation capacities in vitro. By overexpression of Lu, Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells acquire the phenotype of Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells. Lu-deficient mice showed severe defects in DR. Our findings reveal a critical role of Lu in the control of phenotypic heterogeneity of DR in distinct liver disease models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36572.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bile is a green to yellow liquid that the body uses to break down and digest fatty molecules.

The next step would be to clarify how different liver conditions coordinate the amount of Lutheran in biliary cells to create the right type of remodeling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>progenitor</kwd><kwd>remodeling</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26110007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Minoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26253023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miyajima</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26110001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohmuraya</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17be0304201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Minoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lutheran is a novel marker for classification of bile duct remodeling in distinct liver injury, and an interesting functional molecule for investigating the nature of liver stem/progenitor cells during regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The liver is known to possess high capacity for regeneration upon injury. In acutely injured or surgically resected livers, regeneration is usually achieved by proliferation and hypertrophy of residual hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fausto and Campbell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyaoka et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, under chronic or severe liver injury that impairs the proliferation of hepatocytes, liver progenitor cell (LPC) has been postulated to contribute to liver regeneration by differentiating into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), also known as cholangiocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorgeirsson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fausto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyajima et al., 2014</xref>). This response is known as ductular reaction (DR), in which LPC/biliary cell with BEC marker expression proliferates from the portal areas of injured livers, forming pseudo-ductular structures. DRs are frequently observed in human chronic liver diseases and rodent models including fatty liver disease and cholangiopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shafritz and Dabeva, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roskams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gouw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wood et al., 2014</xref>). In zebrafish models, biliary cells have been reported to contribute to regenerating hepatocytes after substantial loss of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). In mouse models, accumulating evidence by in vitro assay or transplantation experiments of biliary cells supports the presence of potential LPC with clonogenicity and bi-lineage differentiation capacity in the biliary compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suzuki et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okabe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dorrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a recent study using in vivo genetic lineage tracing experiment demonstrated that biliary cells can regenerate hepatocytes as facultative LPC under impaired hepatocyte regeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raven et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, DR is considered as a process of liver regeneration in chronically injured liver. In fact, genetically manipulated mice with defects in DR have been reported to show impaired recovery from chronic liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takase et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To explore the nature of LPC in DR, several mouse injury models have been developed previously. In particular, two dietary models using 3,5-Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine supplemented (DDC) diet and choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet have been extensively utilized to characterize LPC in mice for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Preisegger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhurst et al., 2001</xref>). Although both models induce massive DR, the pathological features resulting from these two methods are quite distinct; CDE-induced injury is thought to be a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with extensive hepatic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knight et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni-Simon et al., 2011</xref>), while DDC-induced injury is considered as a model of chronic cholangiopathy with portal biliary damage and severe cholestasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fickert et al., 2007</xref>). Considering the different pathological features of these two models, DR is assumed to be regulated depending on the severity and type of liver injury. In fact, it has been reported that morphological and functional heterogeneity of ductal cells is evident in DRs originating from many different pathological conditions in human patients and rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Priester et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to such previous observations, CDE- and DDC-induced DR exhibited quite distinct morphology; the former extends outwards away from the portal vein, showing primitive ductules with spindle-like shape, while the latter remains around the portal vein, forming obvious bile duct-like structures. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms accounting for the phenotypic difference of DR among liver disease models.</p><p>In the present study, we identified Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu) as a crucial molecule to control the morphological heterogeneity of DR. Lu, also known as Basal Cell Adhesion Molecule (BCAM) or CD239 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is composed of five Ig-like domains on the extracellular site, a single transmembrane domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons et al., 1995</xref>). Lu is known as a laminin receptor, which has been studied in context of sickle cell disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Udani et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Nemer et al., 1999</xref>), and is capable of binding to laminin-511/521 via laminin alpha5 (Lama5) chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parsons et al., 2001</xref>). It has been reported that Lu/BCAM is widely expressed in cells and tissues including hematopoietic cells, placenta and kidney, and is developmentally regulated in human liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons et al., 1995</xref>). However, the expression profile of Lu in mouse LPCs remains to be investigated. Here, we show that Lu is a robust marker to discriminate between CDE-induced and DDC-induced DR; Lu is highly expressed in proliferating biliary cells in the CDE model, but downregulated in the DDC model. By using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), we have isolated Lu-positive and Lu-negative biliary cells from injured liver. By comparison of both biliary cells in scratch assay and cyst formation assay, we revealed a role for Lu in regulating the morphological heterogeneity of DR. Further analysis using Lu-deficient mice demonstrated that the extension of biliary tree was significantly suppressed during DR in the CDE-induced liver injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Lu functionally regulates the remodeling of biliary tissue during liver regeneration, and provide new insights into the heterogeneity of LPCs among liver disease models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lutheran is differentially expressed in CDE- and DDC-induced DR</title><p>We have previously identified Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) as a marker for murine LPC/BEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okabe et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate the difference in DRs between the CDE and DDC models, immunohistochemical analysis of EpCAM was performed. Both protocols of feeding CDE and DDC diet for 3 weeks induced robust DR accompanied by biliary cell expansion. However, the appearance of propagating ducts exhibited strikingly distinct features between two models; CDE-induced biliary cells displayed primitive capillary-like morphology, invading into the parenchymal area extensively, while DDC-induced biliary cells exhibited remarkable duct-like structure, remaining around the periportal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, immunostaining of CK19, another LPC marker, showed a pattern similar to that of EpCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because most known LPC markers are uniformly expressed in both types of DR, these molecules may not account for the heterogeneity of LPC. Therefore, we examined the expression profile of Lu in both injury models, because we have identified Lu as a marker for hepatoblasts, a fetal type LPC during liver development. Co-staining of liver sections using anti-EpCAM and anti-Lu antibodies revealed that Lu was detected in extending biliary cells of the CDE-fed liver, whereas we could not find such signals in biliary cells of DDC-fed liver except intense signal in EpCAM<sup>-</sup> ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As reported by the previous paper that Lu is stained in hepatic arteries and portal vein of adult human liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons et al., 1995</xref>), co-staining of Lu and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), an endothelial marker, in the DDC-fed liver revealed that the EpCAM<sup>-</sup> duct with strong fluorescence is hepatic artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, to compare the expression level of Lu in biliary cells, we performed flow cytometric (FCM) analysis using anti-EpCAM and anti-Lu antibodies. In untreated normal liver, FCM and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that most EpCAM<sup>+</sup> biliary cells showed moderate expression of Lu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). By contrast, approximately 35% of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in CDE-fed liver showed high expression of Lu, whereas nearly half of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in DDC-fed liver exhibited low or negative expression of Lu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These opposing expression profiles of Lu in the CDE and DDC models led us to hypothesize that Lu might regulate the morphological heterogeneity of expanding biliary cells between these distinct injury models.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36572.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic difference of DR and biliary cells between the CDE model and DDC model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical analysis of CDE-fed and DDC-fed mouse liver sections for EpCAM.

Because Lu is known to be a receptor for Lama5 and bind to Laminin-511 and -521, we next investigated the expression of Lama5 in CDE- and DDC-injured livers. Intriguingly, double staining of EpCAM and Lama5 revealed that most expanding biliary cells are fully surrounded by Lama5 in both liver injury models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Considering the accumulation of Lama5 in the vicinity of biliary cells, it is plausible that Lama5 may be secreted from biliary cell itself rather than the environmental niche cell. Indeed, the expression of <italic>Lama5</italic> mRNA was verified in both EpCAM<sup>+</sup> biliary cells isolated from CDE- and DDC-injured livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), implying the involvement of Laminins in Lu-driven regulation. While Lu is capable of binding to Laminin-511/521 via Lama5, these laminins are also known as a ligand for Integrinα3β1/α6β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kikkawa et al., 2007</xref>). It has been reported that Lu binds to Lama5 competitively with Integrinα3β1/α6β1 and promotes tumor cell migration by modulating Integrin-mediated cell attachment to Laminin-511 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kikkawa et al., 2013</xref>). Taking these evidences into account, Lu may regulate the morphogenesis of DR via an Integrin-mediated manner. Given that Lu plays a role in the competitive inhibition against Laminin-511/521 and Integrinα3β1/6β1 axis in biliary cell as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, high expression of Lu would be reproduced by inhibition of integrinβ1 (Itgb1) signaling. To address this possibility, we first investigated the expression of <italic>Integrinα3</italic> (<italic>Itga3</italic>), <italic>Integrinα6</italic> (<italic>Itga6</italic>) and <italic>Itgb1</italic> in Lu<sup>-</sup> BC and Lu<sup>+</sup> BC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, all integrin components were expressed in Lu<sup>-</sup> BC and Lu<sup>+</sup> BC, indicating that Lu<sup>-</sup> BC and Lu<sup>+</sup> BC are potentially competent to cell signaling via Integrinα3β1/α6β1-Laminin-511/521 axis. We next examined the effect of neutralizing antibody against Itgb1 on the motility and duct formation capacity of Lu<sup>-</sup> BC in vitro. Although the inhibition of Itgb1 signaling did not affect the expression of Lu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), it dramatically changed Lu<sup>-</sup> BC to Lu<sup>+</sup> BC-like phenotype in both scratch assay and cyst formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Conversely, we investigated the effect of Itgb1 activation on Lu<sup>+</sup> BC. Because TS2/16 antibody has been reported to activate Itgb1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rozo et al., 2016</xref>), we added it to the 3D culture of Lu<sup>+</sup> BC. As a result, Lu<sup>+</sup> BC acquired cyst formation capacity by the activation of Itgb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

A number of anatomical and histological analyses of human and rodent liver tissues have supported the notion that DR represents the expansion of LPC for supplying transit-amplifying cells to replenish the damaged hepatic cells. However, the origin and the role of LPC in liver regeneration is still under intensive debate. Recent lineage tracing experiments in mice have revealed that the hepatocytic differentiation of LPCs derived from the biliary compartment is negligible in DDC-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Español-Suñer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarlow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodrigo-Torres et al., 2014</xref>). This is reasonable because DDC-injury is a model of chronic cholangiopathy, which requires replenishment of cholangiocytes or bile ducts to be recovered. In fact, it has been reported that mice with impaired DR causes severe jaundice in the DDC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takase et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, we observed many bile ducts with an obvious luminal structure in the DR of DDC-fed liver. Therefore, the downregulation of Lu in LPC may represent a process of cholangiocytic differentiation and reinforcement of duct formation for bile excretion in the DDC model.</p><p>In contrast to the DDC-model, it is still controversial whether LPC may contribute to hepatocyte regeneration in other chronic liver injury models. The contribution of LPC derived from biliary component to hepatocyte regeneration has been reported in the CDE model using two different lineage tracing approaches based on BEC marker genes, <italic>Osteopontin</italic> (<italic>Spp1</italic>) and <italic>Hnf1β</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Español-Suñer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodrigo-Torres et al., 2014</xref>), although to a much lesser extent. The valid but low contribution of LPC of biliary origin to hepatocytic differentiation may be explained by robust proliferation of mature hepatocytes, because hepatocyte-mediated regeneration is not inhibited in the CDE model. This notion is strongly supported by a more recent report from Forbes’s group suggesting that a combination of CDE-injury and inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation causes physiologically significant and higher contribution of biliary cells to hepatic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raven et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, Lu-mediated high motility of LPC in the CDE model may contribute to the rapid delivery of hepatic progenitor cells to the damaged parenchymal area far from the portal vein.</p><p>In the DR, environmental factors play crucial roles in the regulation of LPC proliferation and differentiation. Several immune cell-derived cytokines such as TNF-related WEAK inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), interleukin-6 and interleukin-22 have been shown to be pro-mitotic for LPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jakubowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeoh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Cell signaling pathways including Wnt, Notch, HGF and EGF are reportedly responsible for fate decisions of LPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiorotto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitade et al., 2013</xref>). Although the regulatory mechanism of Lu expression in LPCs is unclear, these signaling pathways may be worthy of investigating.</p><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) is also known to serve a niche for LPC regulation in chronic liver injury as well as liver development. Of note, laminin is an important component of LPC niche affecting cell fate decision. It has been reported that the escape of LPCs from the laminin basement favors their hepatocytic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Español-Suñer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paku et al., 2004</xref>), while laminin aids maintenance of LPC and biliary cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lorenzini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulter et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, it has been reported that Lama5 KO mice show defects in bile duct formation during liver development and that Itgb1 signaling is required for cholangiocytic differentiation from hepatoblast, a fetal-type LPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanimizu et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore highly probable that Itgb1 signaling in the context of laminin/integrin axis is crucial for biliary regeneration and duct formation from LPC. Our in vitro data also supported the idea that Itgb1 signaling modulated by Lu expression may govern DR, depending on liver injury type.</p><p>It remains undetermined whether high expression of Lu in biliary cells is an essential step for hepatocytic differentiation. Alternatively, the up-regulation of Lu may provide LPC with a cue to escape from ECM-rich periportal area, as evidenced by <italic>Bcam</italic> KO phenotype in the CDE model. We showed that the downregulation of Lu in ductular reactive cells facilitated the cystogenic phenotype. However, the loss of Lu would be also expected for the hepatocytic differentiation from LPC because mature hepatocytes do not express Lu. In line with the idea, intriguingly, the expression of Lu seemed to be downregulated in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells at the tip of DR in the CDE model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The discrepancy may be explained by the microenvironment surrounding LPCs; the periportal region is rich in ECM including laminin whereas the parenchymal region is poor in it. Taking such microenvironment into consideration, the loss of Lu in parenchymal area may be a sign of hepatocytic differentiation by the escape of LPC from laminin deposition. Further expression analysis of Lu and Laminin with a combination of lineage tracing experiment will uncover the mechanism underlying LPC-mediated liver regeneration depending on the microenvironment.</p><p>In addition to the signaling molecules and ECM, several non-parenchymal cells have been shown to be involved in the microenvironment for LPC. Intriguingly, Hul et al. reported that prolonged Kupffer cell (KC) depletion did not influence the proliferation of LPCs but reduced their invasive behavior in the CDE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Hul et al., 2011</xref>). The LPCs of KC-depleted mice exhibit phenotype resembling cells of biliary lineage with rounder morphology. More interestingly, the LPCs remain closer to the portal area, in places delineating a pseudo-lumen. This phenotypic change of LPCs by KC depletion closely resembles that of <italic>Bcam</italic> KO mice in the CDE diet. On the other hand, Boulter et al. reported that hepatic macrophage played a role in promoting LPC specification to hepatocytes by expressing Wnt3a in the CDE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulter et al., 2012</xref>). These evidences suggest that hepatic macrophages may be a key regulator of Lu expression in a process of LPC specification. Further studies using a lineage tracing experiment in <italic>Bcam</italic> KO mice under various types of chronic liver injuries will provide a clue to better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic heterogeneity, as well as fate determination of LPCs during liver regeneration.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the expression profile of Lu in biliary cells dramatically changes during DR depending on the type of liver injury, which in turn dictates the morphological characteristics of biliary cells such as cell motility and duct formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This molecular mechanism would be expected to be conserved in human liver diseases. Thus, Lu is a novel marker for classification of DR and an interesting functional molecule for investigating the nature of LPCs. Our findings will provide new insights into the significance of biliary cell heterogeneity in liver regeneration.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36572.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract of this study.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36572-fig8-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-EpCAM (rat monoclonal)</td><td>PMID: 19429791</td><td/><td>(1:100–500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-EpCAM (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam:ab71916; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1603782">AB_1603782</ext-link></td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Lutheran (rat monoclonal)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Sca1 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>BioLegend:108107; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_313344">AB_313344</ext-link></td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD24 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>MB:130-102-731; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2656573">AB_2656573</ext-link></td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD71 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>MB:130-109-632; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2659126">AB_2659126</ext-link></td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD44 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>MB:130-110-117; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2658152">AB_2658152</ext-link></td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-FcR (rat monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>BioLegend:101320; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1574975">AB_1574975</ext-link> <break/>and BioLegend:101302; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_312801">AB_312801</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CK19 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>PMID:12665558</td><td/><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Lama5 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>PMID:9151674</td><td/><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Ki67 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>ThermoFisher:14-5698-80; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10853185">AB_10853185</ext-link></td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-PECAM (rat monoclonal)</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>BD:553373; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_394819">AB_394819</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD31 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Novus</td><td>NB:NB100-2284; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10002513">AB_10002513</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD239 (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam:2994–1; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2065309">AB_2065309</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD29 (hamster monoclonal)</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>BD:555002; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_395636">AB_395636</ext-link></td><td>5 μg/mL for 3D culture</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CD29 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Biolegend:303010; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_314326">AB_314326</ext-link></td><td>50 μg/mL for 3D culture</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Hamster IgM, λ1 isotype <break/>(hamster monoclonal)</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>BD:553957; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_479639">AB_479639</ext-link></td><td>5 μg/mL for 3D culture</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse IgG1, κsotype <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>BioLegend:401404</td><td>50 μg/mL for 3D culture</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Plat-E (Platinum-E)</td><td>PMID: 10871756</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_B488">CVCL_B488</ext-link></td><td>Cell line established in <break/>T.

The exact number of biological samples was described in each figure legend and source data. There was no exclusion of outliers in all experiments. Group allocation was performed without any bias. A statistical method of sample size calculation was not used during study design.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Jeffrey H Miner (Washington University, St Louis, MO) for supplying anti-Laminin alpha5, and Dr. Toshio Kitamura (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) for providing a retroviral vector, pMxs/IRES-GFP.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Holger Willenbring (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Miura et al. investigates the ductular reaction, an extension of the biliary system found in most types of chronic liver injury. It has previously been shown that the morphology of ductular reaction depends on the type of liver injury, for example, preferential injury to cholangiocytes or hepatocytes. However, the mechanism underlying the different modes and morphologies of ductular reactions is not known. The authors identify Lutheran (Lu), a laminin receptor, as a regulator of ductular morphology, using mouse models in which ductular reactions are induced by feeding a diet containing CDE or DDC, which injures the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, respectively. They show that Lu expression is high in ductular reactive cells following CDE diet and low following DDC diet, and that Lu<sup>+</sup> cells are more motile but less efficient in duct formation than Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells, using in vitro assays and new Lu knockout mice. The authors provide evidence that Lu may function by competing with integrins for binding to laminin alpha5.</p><p>Overall, the data are well presented, the figures are of very good quality and the findings are of importance, not only for the liver field. However, a number of deficiencies need to be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The expression of Lu needs to be better characterized.</p><p>- Lu is stated to be expressed in hepatic artery in Figure 1B but a co-staining needs to be provided to support this statement. Also, the authors should show the expression of Lu in control untreated liver by means of a EpCAM/Lu costaining.</p><p>- In the CDE model, some of the cells of the ductular reaction are Lu<sup>+</sup> (high), others not. What is the topography of the Lu<sup>+</sup> cells ? Lu<sup>+</sup> cells indeed appear to be closer to the portal area and Lu<sup>-</sup> deeper in the parenchyma. Quantification may confirm this.</p><p>- A large population of ductular reactive cells have normal Lu expression in CDE-treated mice, and half of the ductular reactive cells in DDC-treated animals do not show detectable Lu as compared to controls. Can the authors speculate on the reason for heterogeneous expression of Lu in the ductular reactive cells in CDE- and DDC-treated mice?</p><p>2) The authors propose that Lu and Integrin alpha3 beta1/alpha6 beta1 compete for binding to laminin alpha5 (Lama5), because inhibition of Integrin beta1 in cultured Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells mimics the effects of Lu overexpression. The concept of competition between Integrin and Lu should be strengthened and additional controls are required:</p><p>- Can the authors overexpress the alpha3 (or alpha6) and beta1 integrin subunits in cultured Lu<sup>+</sup> cells and verify if the cells are converted to a cystogenic phenotype?</p><p>- Is the expression of Integrin alpha3 beta1/alpha6 beta1 similar in vitro in Lu</p><p>and Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells?</p><p>- The authors should provide information on the expression of Lu in Lu<sup>-</sup> cells incubated with Integrin beta1 neutralising antibodies.</p><p>3) The expression of Lama5 raises several questions.</p><p>- Lama5 is detected in vivo around ductular reactive cells in both CDE (Lu high) and DDC (Lu low) models, yet Figure 5B suggests that Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells express more Lama5 than Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells. Is the difference shown in Figure 5B statistically significant?</p><p>- Macrophages play a major role in laminin deposition during liver disease, including in DDC-treated livers. The authors should compare the mRNA expression of Lama5 also in this cell type.</p><p>- In the CDE model, laminin appears to predominantly co-localise with ductular reactive cells into the parenchyma, while the Lu (high) population is restricted to a more proximal periportal zone (see comment #1). As per the authors' theory, when the cells lose Lu, laminin binding to integrin should be facilitated. Hence the cells should re-adopt a tubular, pseudo-ductular conformation, which is not the case. What is the authors' explanation?</p><p>- Stuart Forbes' group demonstrated that anchorage of liver progenitor cells to a laminin sheet maintains the biliary phenotype of the cells while loss of laminin favors hepatocyte differentiation. Also, in vivo, laminin degradation favors the differentiation of liver progenitor cells in the CDE model (PMID:22922013). Can the authors explain how they reconcile their data with the literature?</p><p>4) Lu is proposed to control cell motility and cyst formation. The experiments in Figures 3 to 5 require additional controls:</p><p>- In the DDC model, ductular reactions expands as bile duct like shape in vivo. Do the Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells in vitro have the same shape of a control cholangiocytes? In other words, control cholangiocytes should be added as control in Figure 2.</p><p>- An additional biliary marker like EpCAM in Figure 4A would confirm that the observed changes are due to Lu expression and not to contamination with other cell types. Were these cells freshly isolated or passaged?</p><p>- Concluding that Lu<sup>+</sup> cell have higher motility than Lu-/low cells requires excluding higher proliferation in Figure 3A.</p><p>- Cyst size and cyst formation efficiency should be quantified in Figures3C, 4C and 5D.</p><p>5) A number of statements need to be clarified and additional information on the methods should be provided:</p><p>- In the subsection “Isolation of biliary cells with a distinct level of Lu from chronically injured liver”, the authors state that Lu (high)-derived biliary cells continued to express Lu at high levels. Information on the number of passages in Figure 2C should be given.</p><p>- The statement &quot;proliferating biliary cell with high expression of Lu in the CDE model&quot; requires information about proliferation markers in Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-/low</sup> cells.</p><p>- Since Lu is also expressed in arterial branches, the authors have to describe the FACS gating strategy used to sort the biliary cells and to exclude contamination by arterial endothelial cells. Similarly, it is shown in Figure 6E that hepatocytes in the CDE model express EpCAM. How are those hepatocytes excluded from sorting ? Are those hepatocytes also Lu (high)?</p><p>6) Lutheran knockout livers treated with CDE do only show very low numbers of EpCAM<sup>+</sup>/HNF4<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to wild-type CDE-treated livers. The authors conclude from this experiment that high expression of Lutheran &quot;might be a process of hepatocytic differentiation of liver progenitor cells&quot;. Such conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the data, since co-expression of EpCAM and HNF4 does not provide solid evidence for hepatocyte differentiation of progenitors to hepatocytes. The reviewers suggest to remove Figure 6E which is quite preliminary.</p><p>7) It is not clear what the authors refer to by &quot;slight dilation of duct-like structures was observed in Lu KO mice (Figure 6D and F)&quot;. Better images are required to support this statement.</p><p>8) It would considerably expand the impact of the paper if some information is provided about the expression of Lu in ductular reaction in human liver disease.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36572.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The expression of Lu needs to be better characterized.</p><p>- Lu is stated to be expressed in hepatic artery in Figure 1B but a co-staining needs to be provided to support this statement.

To support the idea, we have performed a co-staining of Lu and PECAM (CD31), an endothelial cell marker. As expected, Lu was stained in PECAM<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells including hepatic artery and portal vein. Notably, Lu was detected in hepatic artery most intensely, indicating that the Lu<sup>+</sup>EpCAM<sup>-</sup> vessel around the portal vein is hepatic artery. We have added the immunohistochemical data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. In addition, we performed a EpCAM/Lu costaining in control untreated liver and added the data in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 according to the reviewer’s comment. Basically, the aim of Figure 1B was to compare the expression level of Lu in ductular reaction between CDE and DDC models. Therefore, the photographic sensitivity was adjusted to the most intense fluorescence of hepatic artery without saturation, and these images were acquired at the same time of exposure on the same day. In those immunohistochemical settings, not only low/negative but also middle level of Lu in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cell shown by Figure 1C was not visible in the DDC-liver, whereas the high level of Lu in ductular reaction was detected in the CDE-liver. Thus, the undetected signal of Lu in this experimental setting does not necessarily mean no expression of Lu. Consistently, as shown in Figure1—figure supplement 3, a weak signal of Lu was detected in EpCAM+ bile duct by longer exposure while the Lu signal was saturated in hepatic artery or intensely detected in portal vein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the CDE model, some of the cells of the ductular reaction are Lu<sup>+</sup> (high), others not.

Quantification may confirm this.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, several EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells apart from the portal vein seem to be lacking in Lu signal. If it was interpreted favorably, this image may reflect the hepatocytic differentiation process of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells at the tip of ductules. It is consistent with the lack of Lu expression in mature hepatocyte. Although the idea is very attractive, the quantification of EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Lu<sup>-</sup> cells is difficult for some reasons mentioned below. 1) The invisible signal of Lu does not necessarily mean no Lu expression as mentioned above. Because the signal of Lu is faint even in the bile duct originally expressing Lu (Figure1—figure supplement 3), it is difficult to set the threshold of Lu<sup>-</sup>negative cell by immunohistochemical analysis. 2) EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Lu<sup>-</sup> cells seem to appear as a part of ductular reaction, i.e. the tip of extending ductules. Because the tip in ductular reaction is diverse and not always apart from the portal vein in the injured liver, the quantification based on the distance from the center of portal vein may bring a misleading result. From these reasons, we think that such quantification base on immunohistochemistry should be carefully treated in terms of topography. However, the reviewer’s comment is implicative, and the expression of Lu seems to be “downregulated” apart from the portal vein. Therefore, we have added such a description about the possible topography of the Lu<sup>+</sup> cells without quantification in the Discussion section (fifth paragraph). We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A large population of ductular reactive cells have normal Lu expression in CDE-treated mice, and half of the ductular reactive cells in DDC-treated animals do not show detectable Lu as compared to controls. Can the authors speculate on the reason for heterogeneous expression of Lu in the ductular reactive cells in CDE- and DDC-treated mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is unclear whether the reviewer inquires after the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of Lu or the origin of ductular reactive cells, we speculated the reasons as follows. As shown in the FACS data on normal diet (Figure 1C), most of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells with middle expression of Lu must be normal bile duct around the portal vein. Therefore, we speculate that approximately a half of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells with middle expression of Lu in the CDE- and DDC-injured liver may correspond to the original bile ducts, whereas the Lu<sup>+</sup> (high) or Lu<sup>-</sup> cells may be derived from expandable progenitor cells. However, we have no evidence about the speculation at present, because there is no method to specifically label only ductal cells with characteristic of liver progenitor. Further study using a novel lineage tracing experiment will be required to prove the idea. Regarding the transcriptional mechanism, Lu has been originally identified as an antigen of human erythropoietic lineage, and there are consensus CACC-binding sites, a GATA-1 binding site and multiple E-boxes in the Lu promoter. Although the implication of KLF1 transcription factor in Lu expression has been previously reported in red blood cell disease, the transcriptional regulation of Lu in the other tissues remains largely unknown. We speculate that some kinds of factors implicated in each pathology, e.g. damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from damaged hepatocytes or bile acids may regulate the expression of Lu. However, we have no evidence about the opposite regulatory mechanisms of Lu expression between CDE- and DDC-injuries at present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors propose that Lu and Integrin alpha3 beta1/alpha6 beta1 compete for binding to laminin alpha5 (Lama5), because inhibition of Integrin beta1 in cultured Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells mimics the effects of Lu overexpression. The concept of competition between Integrin and Lu should be strengthened and additional controls are required:</p><p>- Can the authors overexpress the alpha3 (or alpha6) and beta1 integrin subunits in cultured Lu<sup>+</sup> cells and verify if the cells are converted to a cystogenic phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to strengthen the concept of competition between integrin and Lu. However, the suggested experiment may be difficult. We think that integrin signals are basically complicated due to many factors, e.g. a variety of combination patterns of alpha and beta subunits, distinct affinity to various ECM, and complex intracellular signaling including Fak and p130Cas pathways. Because we cannot control each expression level of two distinct transfected genes, the balance between alpha and beta subunits are supposed to be out of order in this experiment. In addition, it is unclear whether the transfected integrins can work well, because we could not find such experiments in the previous papers. Alternatively, it may be straightforward to show that the activation of beta1 integrin changes the phenotype of Lu<sup>+</sup> cells into a cystogenic one. Therefore, we performed the addition of agonistic anit-beta1 integrin antibody to Lu<sup>+</sup> cells in the 3D culture. As expected, Lu<sup>+</sup> cells were converted to a cystogenic phenotype. We have added the new data in Figure 5—figure supplement 4.</p><p><italic>- Is the expression of Integrin alpha3 beta1/alpha6 beta1 similar</italic> in vitro <italic>in Lu<sup>-</sup> and Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells?</italic></p><p>We have compared the transcriptional level of Integrin alpha3 beta1/alpha6 beta1 between Lu<sup>-</sup> and Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells by real-time RT-PCR.

We have added the new data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should provide information on the expression of Lu in Lu<sup>-</sup> cells incubated with Integrin beta1 neutralising antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we investigated the expression of Lu by real-time RT-PCR. As a result, there was no change of Lu expression after the incubation with neutralizing antibody. We have added the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The expression of Lama5 raises several questions.</p><p>- Lama5 is detected in vivo around ductular reactive cells in both CDE (Lu high) and DDC (Lu low) models, yet Figure 5B suggests that Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells express more Lama5 than Lu<sup>+</sup> biliary cells. Is the difference shown in Figure 5B statistically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the information on statistical analysis in Figure 5B was included in a source file “Figure 5B_Mann-Whitney.xlsx” at 1<sup>st</sup> submission, we forgot to mention it in the main figure. Therefore, we have specified “n.s.” in the revised Figure 5B. The scattering value of Lama5 expression in DDC samples may be due to the quality of freshly isolated EpCAM+ cells because DDC model causes cholangiopathy resulting in the damage or activation of EpCAM+ biliary cells. Considering the expression of Lama5 at a protein level in Figure 5A, we think that there is no apparent difference of Lama5 expression in most of ductular reactive cells between CDE and DDC models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Macrophages play a major role in laminin deposition during liver disease, including in DDC-treated livers. The authors should compare the mRNA expression of Lama5 also in this cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we isolated macrophages from injured livers as CD45+Ly6G-F4/80+CD11b+ fraction by FACS, and examined mRNA expression of Lama5 in those cells by real-time RT-PCR. Compared to the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> biliary cells, the expression level of Lama5 was marginal or not detected in each macrophage isolated from CDE- and DDC-injured livers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Although macrophages play a major role in ECM deposition during liver disease, we concluded that macrophages per se are not a producer of Lama5, but rather an activator of ECM-producing cells as reported in our paper (PMID:28779552, Matsuda et al. Hepatology 2018).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36572.031</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36572-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the CDE model, laminin appears to predominantly co-localise with ductular reactive cells into the parenchyma, while the Lu (high) population is restricted to a more proximal periportal zone (see comment #1). As per the authors' theory, when the cells lose Lu, laminin binding to integrin should be facilitated. Hence the cells should re-adopt a tubular, pseudo-ductular conformation, which is not the case. What is the authors' explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the discrepancy may be explained by a different microenvironment surrounding the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells between in vivo and in vitro. It is known that the extracellular matrix such as laminins and collagens are rich around the portal vein in vivo, while it is relatively poor in the parenchymal area. By using the 3D culture system that is ECM-rich condition including collagens and Matrigel, we evaluated the “cystogenic capacity” of Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-</sup> cells in vitro. However, the amount and composition of ECM would be quite distinct between at the deeper area in the parenchyma and the periportal zone in vivo. Therefore, the microenvironment in the parenchyma would be unsuitable for solid tubular formation. We think that the liberation of biliary cells from ECM-rich periportal zone into ECM-poor parenchymal area is a most important role of Lu as evidenced by Lu KO phenotype. As mentioned above, we think that the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells losing Lu at the tip of ductular reaction may be differentiating into hepatocytic cells. If the expression of Lama5 is also downregulated in those cells, the integrin signal via Laminin-511 may be attenuated, which is not the case with Lu<sup>-</sup> BC in ECM-rich periportal area of the DDC model. In either case, the morphological phenotype of ductular reaction would be controlled by not only Lu expression but also the microenvironment in vivo. We have discussed about the importance of microenvironment in the Discussion section (fifth paragraph). We believe that Lu orchestrates the complicated integrin signaling depending on the microenvironment surrounding ductular reactive cells.</p><p><italic>- Stuart Forbes' group demonstrated that anchorage of liver progenitor cells to a laminin sheet maintains the biliary phenotype of the cells while loss of laminin favors hepatocyte differentiation. Also,</italic> in vivo<italic>, laminin degradation favors the differentiation of liver progenitor cells in the CDE model (PMID:22922013). Can the authors explain how they reconcile their data with the literature?</italic></p><p>We basically agree with the idea, and our paper is consistent with the previous works referred to by the reviewer. As previously reported by us (Kaneko et al., 2015), ductular reactive cells substantially function as bile duct to drain bile. As shown in this paper, extending ductular reactive cells are basically surrounded by Lama5, suggesting that laminin sheet is required to maintain the biliary phenotype. By contrast, Lu seems to be downregulated in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells at the tip of ductular reaction. If such EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells are differentiating into hepatocytic cells, the downregulated Lu may contribute to the decrease of laminin deposition surrounding those cells. We have added the speculation in the Discussion section (fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lu is proposed to control cell motility and cyst formation. The experiments in Figures 3 to 5 require additional controls:</p><p>- In the DDC model, ductular reactions expands as bile duct like shape in vivo. Do the Lu<sup>-</sup> biliary cells in vitro have the same shape of a control cholangiocytes? In other words, control cholangiocytes should be added as control in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what cells the reviewer considers “control cholangiocytes” in this comment. If the reviewer considers EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from untreated normal liver as control cholangiocytes, we do not think it is a suitable control for comparison with Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-</sup> BC. In this study, Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-</sup> BCs were proliferative and used for every assay after at least 3 passages. On the other hand, as previously reported (Okabe et al., 2009), approximately 0.5% of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (50 cells per 10,000 cells) in normal liver can survive and proliferate to form a colony in this culture. We demonstrated that the colony forming cells include the cell having LPC-like properties. In other words, most of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells i.e. mature cholangiocytes will be dead or excluded at a relatively early stage under this culture condition. Because the passaged EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in the same manner do not represent normal cholangiocytes, such cells will be inappropriate for control cholangiocytes. Alternatively, we investigated the shape of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from untreated normal liver after 7 days of primary culture. Although most of cholangiocytes were dead during the culture, the attached and survived cells showed a mixture of round and indefinite shape. Although we are not sure whether this data would be informative in this study, we have added the data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- An additional biliary marker like EpCAM in Figure 4A would confirm that the observed changes are due to Lu expression and not to contamination with other cell types.

We have added the information about the passage number in the legend of newly assigned Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The statement &quot;proliferating biliary cell with high expression of Lu in the CDE model&quot; requires information about proliferation markers in Lu<sup>+</sup> and Lu<sup>-/low</sup> cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Because Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the ductular reactive cells in the CDE model as shown in Figure 6B, we have described &quot;proliferating biliary cell” unintentionally. We have no intention of claiming the correlation between cell proliferation and Lu expression at all. In fact, as shown in Figure 6B, the ratio of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells per EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells was equivalent between WT and Lu KO mice, strongly suggesting that Lu expression is not involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Because this sentence may be misleading for now, we have deleted “proliferating” in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Since Lu is also expressed in arterial branches, the authors have to describe the FACS gating strategy used to sort the biliary cells and to exclude contamination by arterial endothelial cells. Similarly, it is shown in Figure 6E that hepatocytes in the CDE model express EpCAM. How are those hepatocytes excluded from sorting ? Are those hepatocytes also Lu (high)?</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s advice, we have added the FACS gating strategy in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. For FACS, we used only non-parenchymal cell (NPC) fraction, of which the hepatocyte fraction was removed by repeated centrifugation at 100g for 2 minutes. Although the information is described in the reference (Okabe et al., 2009), we have added it in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Liver Perfusion and Cell Sorting”). In addition, we have added FACS data of triple staining with anti-EpCAM, anti-Lu and anti-PECAM antibodies in order to clarify no contamination of endothelial cells in the purified EpCAM+ cell fraction (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These data demonstrated that a contamination of endothelial cells was highly unlikely. In addition, our culture condition is not suitable for passage of endothelial cells because it does not contain VEGF.</p><p>Regarding the Lu expression in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> hepatocyte-like cells, a co-staining of the liver tissue was technically difficult because Lu staining required acetone fixation, which spoiled HNF4α staining at the same time.

Such conclusion is not sufficiently supported by the data, since co-expression of EpCAM and HNF4 does not provide solid evidence for hepatocyte differentiation of progenitors to hepatocytes. The reviewers suggest to remove Figure 6E which is quite preliminary.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewers’ suggestions. According to the comments, we have removed Figure 6E.
