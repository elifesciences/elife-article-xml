Macrophages derived from human blood-circulating monocytes were polarised using established protocols and metabolically challenged using small molecules to validate their responding metabolic actions in extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. Large field-of-view images of individual polarised macrophages were obtained using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). These were challenged in real time with small-molecule perturbations of metabolism during imaging. We uncovered FLIM parameters that are pronounced under the action of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), which strongly stratifies the phenotype of polarised human macrophages; however, this performance is impacted by donor variability when analysing the data at a single-cell level. The stratification and parameters emanating from a full field-of-view and single-cell FLIM approach serve as the basis for machine learning models. Applying a random forests model, we identify three strongly governing FLIM parameters, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) value of 0.944 and out-of-bag (OBB) error rate of 16.67% when classifying human macrophages in a full field-of-view image. To conclude, 2P-FLIM with the integration of machine learning models is showed to be a powerful technique for analysis of both human macrophage metabolism and polarisation at full FoV and single-cell level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FLIM</kwd><kwd>multiphoton</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>cellular metabolism</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16/RI/3403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monaghan</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/S02347X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monaghan</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/RC/2073_P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monaghan</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunne</surname><given-names>Aisling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human blood derived macrophage polarisation can be classified by proxy of their metabolism, using advanced microscopy techniques generating single-cell parameters that are clustered and validated using machine learning classification models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2P-FLIM) is a non-destructive modality that can interrogate exogenous and endogenous fluorophores. 2P-FLIM provides high spatial and temporal resolution to image murine and human cell types, 2D and 3D cell cultures, and biopsies in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skala et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okkelman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neto et al., 2020</xref>). 2P-FLIM allows reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD<sup>+</sup>) to be studied and quantified using 2P-FLIM, giving insight into cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakowicz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skala et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neto et al., 2020</xref>). The average time for a fluorophore to return to the ground state from the excited state while emitting fluorescence is known as the fluorescence lifetime. NADH and NADPH fluorescence properties are identical, and hence NAD(P)H refers to these intracellular pools combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). NAD(P)H is noted as having a long fluorescence lifetime when enzyme-bound and a short fluorescence lifetime when free in the cytoplasm. NAD(P)H fluorescence properties offer extended information into NAD(P)H protein/enzyme binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakowicz et al., 1992</xref>). 2P-FLIM facilitates the quantification of NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetimes and their respective proportions. In addition, 2P-FLIM can be used as a microscopy-based spatial approach and applied to limited cell numbers, which is beneficial in assessing limited sample numbers or validating metabolism-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shields et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages are essential components of the host immune response and key regulators of homeostatic function. In addition to host defence, macrophages are intimately involved in tissue homeostasis and play a key role in pathologies including heart failure, diabetes, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>). Macrophages adopt specific polarisation states, ranging in a spectrum, to accomplish various functions and mechanisms of action. Here, classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages occupy opposite ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mosser and Edwards, 2008</xref>). In vitro, M1 macrophage behaviour can be evoked using IFNÎ³ and/or microbial products such as LPS. M1 macrophage phenotype is defined by secretion of a significant amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² enhanced endocytosis and ability to kill intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>M2 macrophage behaviour exists more heterogeneously and can be triggered by IL-4 or IL-13, IL1-Î², TGF-Î², IL-6, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, or association with a tumour microenvironment, respectively, generating M2a, M2b, M2c, M2f, and tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mantovani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mantovani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graney et al., 2020</xref>). M2 macrophages exhibit decreased expression of protein membrane markers, such as CD14 and CCR5, and increased fibronectin-1 production. In addition, M2 macrophages are also characterised by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gratchev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez et al., 2008</xref>). Most often, macrophage behaviour is assessed by endpoint assays using cytokine measurements, gene analysis, and staining of surface markers. However, there is a gathering shift towards non-invasive modalities to speed up this process and obtain spatio-temporal analysis. Two recent examples of this include the use of Raman microscopy to map the lipidomic spatial signature of polarised macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feuerer et al., 2021</xref>), and the use of average fluorescent lifetime parameters to discern murine macrophage phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfonso-GarcÃ­a et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We use an imaging-based approach, primarily focusing on metabolic machinery characteristically employed by polarised human macrophages. Macrophage metabolism poses a huge potential in the next generation of therapeutics for inflammatory disease. Human macrophage function and metabolism are inextricably linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van den Bossche et al., 2017</xref>). IFNÎ³-activated human macrophages (IFNÎ³-M1) are primed for enhanced inflammatory responses by stabilising HIF1Î± levels, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, and increased production of IL-1Î², all of which are dependent on enhanced levels of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively activated human anti-inflammatory macrophages, most often observed in vitro through stimulation with IL-4 (IL-4-M2), are defined by an intact tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), enhanced OxPhos, increased fatty acid synthesis (FAS), and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van den Bossche et al., 2017</xref>). In a nutshell, IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages are more active in glycolysis, while IL-4-M2 macrophages are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for their energy production. When assessing metabolism and bioenergetics, most methods are based on extracellular flux assays, measurement of cellular oxygen consumption, exogenous staining, radio-labelling nutrients, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Metabolism probing methods require a substantial amount of sample processing yet still pose limitations due to short-lived oxidative metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vivekanandan-Giri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>2P-FLIM imaging of NAD(P)H acquires five fluorescence lifetime variables (Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, Î±<sub>1</sub>, Î±<sub>2</sub>, Ï<sub>avg</sub>) and one fluorescence intensity-based variable (optical redox ratio [ORR]) descriptive of the polarisation linked-metabolic state of IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophage phenotypes. Furthermore, additional information can be obtained from these measurements by real-time perturbation of basal metabolism and metabolic capacity. To achieve this, sequential knockdown of intercellular pathways and uncomplexing of mitochondrial coupling is performed in this study via metabolic inhibitors.</p><p>For data visualisation purposes, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximate and Projection (UMAP) technique, in favour over principal component analysis (PCA), due to its processing speed, capability to preserve the global and local structures of the data, and ability to use non-metric distance functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). For in-depth statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms are employed for classification/supervised pattern recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mohri and Rostamizadeh, 2012</xref>). Machine learning algorithms have been used to characterise DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, determine genetic and epigenetic contributions of antibody repertoire diversity, and classify chronic periodontitis patients based on their immune cell response to ex vivo stimulation with ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alipanahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Culos et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, machine learning algorithms can be used to group samples into different classes (e.g., in this study IFNÎ³-M1 vs. IL-4-M2 based on 2P-FLIM variables) whilst determining which variables are the most important for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Touw et al., 2013</xref>). For our work, we employed the random forests algorithm for the classification task due to its high prediction accuracy, robustness to outliers, and ability to obtain the relative importance of each variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breiman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Verikas et al., 2011</xref>). Another advantage of the random forests model is that we can use the out-of-bag (OOB) error estimate to determine the values of the hyper-parameters, no need to set aside an independent dataset for validation. This makes random forests especially suitable for small datasets, where we do not have additional data for validating the model. The hyper-parameters of the random forests model are the number of trees (<italic>ntree</italic>) and the number of variables selected for the best split at each node (<italic>mtry</italic>). The OOB error of the final optimal random forests model serves as the estimate of the modelâs prediction error.</p><p>The trained random forests model will be used to distinguish between the different populations of macrophages and to measure which 2P-FLIM variables are the most important for this differentiation. In our study, we used all data points obtained from both full field-of-view (FoV) and donor-specific single-cell images for training and validating the random forests model. Thus, there is no extra data available for testing our trained model. Therefore, to demonstrate the predictive ability and efficiency of the trained model, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), in which the specificity and sensitivity of the trained model are plotted. The ROC-AUC statistic is a performance evaluation metric for (binary) classification models. ROC curves plot the true positive rate against the false-positive rate at various threshold values. The AUC is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between two classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. An ROC-AUC value less than 0.5 suggests no discrimination, 0.7â0.8 is considered acceptable, 0.8â0.9 is considered excellent, and more than 0.9 is considered outstanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandrekar, 2010</xref>). Similar applications of machine learning methods have been explored by Walsh et al. for classification of activated t-cells and Qian et al. for quality control of cardiomyocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qian et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesise that 2P-FLIM of NAD(P)H and FAD<sup>+</sup> provides quantitative information to evaluate and identify human-derived macrophage polarisation by proxy of their metabolism. 2P-FLIM of NAD(P)H and FAD<sup>+</sup> has strong clinical potential fuelled by the emergence of metabolic approaches to treat disease and inflammation. To test our hypothesis, we derived human macrophages from blood-circulating monocytes and polarised them into IFNÎ³-M1 or IL-4-M2 macrophages. We confirmed human macrophage cytokine and gene expression-related polarisation, while human macrophage metabolic behaviour was assessed via traditional extracellular flux assays. Finally, 2P-FLIM was applied during which real-time responses of photonic variables to metabolism-challenging small molecules were measured. This study establishes 2P-FLIM as a method to discriminate IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages, which is most pronounced by macrophagesâ differential responses when treated with carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). This allows the accurate classification of macrophage polarisation using machine learning methods, for example, the random forests model, and to evaluate single-cell heterogeneity. Our work reports, for the first time, the classification of human macrophages by random forests using data obtained from real-time metabolic perturbations triggered during 2P-FLIM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macrophage polarisation with IFNÎ³ and IL-4 induces metabolic reprograming</title><p>Human blood-derived macrophages were polarised by incubating in cell culture media containing IFNÎ³ (M1) or IL-4 (M2) for 24 hr.

Cellular metabolic activity was analysed using a sequence of metabolic enzyme inhibitors, and the inhibitorsâ effect was measured by extracellular acidification ratio (ECAR), oxygen consumption ratio (OCR), and 2P-FLIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of experimental work.</title><p>Image created using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com">biorender.com</ext-link>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77373-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A slightly higher amount of TNFÎ± production was obtained for IFNÎ³-M1 when compared with IL-4-M2 macrophages. Regarding IL-10, a statistically higher production was measured in IL-4-M2 when compared with IFNÎ³-M1 and untreated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). For gene expression, a higher amount of CXCL9 and a statistically significant increase in CXCL10 in IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In addition, MRC1 and CCL13 were further expressed in IL-4-M2 macrophages when compared with untreated and IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages have a higher dependence on aerobic glycolysis, whilst IL-4-M2 macrophages are more reliant on oxidative phosphorylation. We used ECAR and OCRs to certify this metabolic behaviour, which is linked to macrophage polarisation. For ECAR and OCR, we used four different metabolic modulators in succession, oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone + antimycin A (Rot+AA), and 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (2-DG), to evaluate cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The polarisation of human macrophages is often crudely described as two opposite phenotypes: classical activation (IFNÎ³-M1-macrophages) and alternative activation (IL-4-M2 macrophages). The higher production of TNFÎ± in IFNÎ³-treated human macrophages and low IL-10 production are evidence of a macrophage classical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tokunaga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In contrast, treating human macrophages with IL-4, an increase in IL-10 production and higher expression of MRC1 and CCL13, are characteristic of an alternative activation of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artyomov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâF</xref>). Furthermore, we performed flow cytometry of polarised macrophages using antibodies to detect CD80, CD86, CD163, and CD206 surface markers, further validating the intended macrophage polarisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Extending from this, extracellular flux analysis was performed. Extracellular flux measurements revealed a higher acidification ratio (ECAR) and a lower OCR for IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages during the different stages of metabolic inhibition when compared with IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and J</xref>). By calculating the basal glycolysis rate and maximum glycolysis, IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages presented higher glycolytic rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). The acidification (from ECAR) is linked with the production of lactate as a by-product of glycolysis, which reduces extracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Regarding IL-4-M2 macrophages, a reduced ECAR and increased OCR during the extracellular flux treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and J</xref>), together with a higher max respiration potential, were observed when compared with untreated macrophages. However, no difference was observed at the basal respiration measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). ECAR and OCR calculated results are associated with a higher dependence of OxPhos as a more active metabolic machinery in IL-4-M2 macrophages. In order to fuel the upregulation of the TCA cycle and the ETC, the mitochondria need to consume more oxygen at the complex IV site of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van den Bossche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to underline 2P-FLIM as a complimentary and, more advantageously, a non-invasive spatial evaluation of macrophage metabolism reflecting macrophage-induced polarisation. Recapitulating the sequence of metabolic enzyme inhibition which formed a basis of the extracellular flux analysis, sequential 2P-FLIM micrographs of IFNÎ³- or IL-4-polarised macrophages were acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A reduced Ï<sub>avg</sub>, observed with IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages, reflects a higher relative amount of free NAD(P)H (which has characteristic short fluorescence lifetimes), indicative of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perottoni et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, IL-4-M2 macrophages had higher Ï<sub>avg</sub>-reflective of OxPhos due to increased proportion of longer lifetime, protein-bound NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okkelman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Varying interpretations of ORR are reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>), and for this study, we adopt a lower ORR reflecting a higher fraction of NAD(P)H and a lower FAD<sup>+</sup> associated with upregulation of OxPhos (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neto et al., 2020</xref>). IL-4-M2 macrophages exhibited a lower ORR across the treatments in contrast with IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages, validating a higher dependency of IL-4-M2 macrophages on OxPhos when compared with IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages. A heatmap overviewing the 2P-FLIM output variables was compiled, showcasing the shifts promoted by the different treatments in both phenotype-directed human macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). With IL-4-M2 macrophages, there is a noticeable increase in Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, and Ï<sub>avg</sub> and an appreciable decrease in ORR when compared with IFNÎ³-M1-treated macrophages. The trending increase of NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetimes is further exacerbated after treatment with FCCP in IL-4-M2 macrophages. Indeed, given the ability of FLIM to imaging and measure NAD(P)H and FAD<sup>+</sup>, others have employed small molecules to gain further information about the dynamics of metabolic machinery in states of disease and differentiation. For instance, during stem cell osteogenic differentiation, Guo et al. tested oligomycin A (mitochondrial respiration inhibitor) as an experimental treatment in parallel to standard osteogenic media. A decrease in NAD(P)H average lifetime was calculated reflective of reduced oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, oligomycin A treatment promoted an increase in lactate production, lower oxygen consumption, and lower osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). The heterogeneous response towards metabolic inhibitors by IFNÎ³-M1 or IL-4-M2 macrophages yields clustering patterns in the two-dimensional projected space via the UMAP method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When analysing each treatment individually, measurements emanating from the FCCP treatment yielded the highest segregation across all donors between IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, our phasor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>) also demonstrates a higher segregation of IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages when using FFCP treatment. Albeit, the limitation in pre-defining values for the fluorescence lifetime variables such as Ï<sub>1</sub> and Ï<sub>2</sub> can mask important predictors for the classification problem.</p><p>Higher NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetimes such as Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, and Ï<sub>avg</sub> are attributable to two major factors: increases in NADPH concentrations and microenvironmental shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>). FCCP functions as an uncoupler of mitochondria inner membrane allowing unhinged proton flux to the mitochondria matrix. Consequently, this proton flux causes a reduction of mitochondrial pH, increasing effectively the fluorescence lifetime of NAD(P)H. The unhinged proton flux due to FCCP compliments existing studies whereby Schaefer et al. reported an increased NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime due to reduced mitochondria pH elicited by FCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blinova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>). Another consequence of FCCP treatment is an increase in ETC activity indicated by increased oxygen consumption of IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Increased ETC activity promotes an increase of NADH and FAD<sup>+</sup> directly impacting the ORR. One would have expected the ORR to increase after the FCCP treatment as observed in IFNÎ³ macrophages. However, for IL-4-M2 macrophages, the ORR begins to decrease. FCCP induction of maximal ETC activity increases the demand for NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> causing a concomitant increase of the FAO and TCA cycle activity already upregulated in IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ludtmann et al., 2014</xref>). This demand results in a reduced pool of FAD<sup>+</sup> and an increase of NADH, effectively reducing ORR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ludtmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akie and Cooper, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Viola et al., 2019</xref>). The higher heterogeneity in FCCP response is due to the effect of FCCP on the mitochondrial membrane and the higher dependence of FAS/FAO on IL-4-M2 macrophages basally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>). Blacker et al. reported the FCCP impact in great detail where, when seeking to separate NADH and NADPH fluorescence in live cells and tissues using FLIM, inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in wild-type HEK293 cells using rotenone (10âÎ¼M) or uncoupling using FCCP (1âÎ¼M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacker et al., 2014</xref>). The study of Blacker et al. provides excellent insights into NADH and NADPH dynamics and separation, and the treatment of FCCP has a similar effect on HEK293 cells as the IL-4-M2 macrophages reported in our study. Here, FCCP uncoupling promotes higher ETC, higher TCA activity impacting the ORR and, at the same time, a decreased mitochondrial pH increases the fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blinova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages, their lower dependence on ETC, TCA, FAO, and lower mitochondria membrane potential while producing most of ATP by glycolysis makes the impact of FCCP on the mitochondria and fluorescence lifetimes less pronounced.</p><p>Random forests models were applied to study the endpoint variables of the 2P-FLIM obtained during the FCCP treatment of IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages and IL-4-M2 macrophages. 2P-FLIM measurements contain a minimum of 24 cells per FOV and culminate in a total of 36 data points used for random forests training. For the trained random forests model, a low OBB error estimate and a high ROC-AUC value were achieved when classifying a population of IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). When the random forests model was trained using only three predictors, Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, and Ï<sub>avg</sub>, the ROC-AUC classification accuracy decreased slightly from 0.944 to 0.934 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The feature importance ranking based on mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in Gini indicates that Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, and Ï<sub>avg</sub> are the most important 2P-FLIM variables for classifying an IFNÎ³-M1 or an IL-4-M2 macrophage when subjected to the FCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The relative importance of the three features, Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, and Ï<sub>avg</sub>, implies that these FLIM features are divergent in IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages. This outcome agrees with our previous results showing that FCCP highly impacts the NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetimes in IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The high predictive power of 2P-FLIM variables for classifying cell phenotype compliments the machine learning approach of Walsh et al., on classifying CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Precise regulation of macrophage activation state is key to understanding disease control, tissue homeostasis, and implant response, with this regulation shown to be directly related to macrophage intracellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, impaired macrophage metabolism results in compromised homeostasis such as the case of diabetes, the foreign body response to biomaterials, obesity, or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mantovani and Sica, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McNelis and Olefsky, 2014</xref>). Depending on the investigation being applied, shifts observed in cellular metabolism, cytokine production, or gene expression are typically a cumulative output from a broad population. We investigated the clustering pattern of IFNÎ³-M1 macrophages and IL-4-M2 macrophages using single-cell data within individual donors and found that the IFNÎ³-M1 macrophage and IL-4-M2 macrophage appeared as separate clusters within each donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Classifying IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages at a single-cell level yielded some varied results, with four donors providing acceptable predicting performance (OOB &lt; 31%; ROC-AUC &gt; 0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). There is some cell-to-cell variability which could stem from the uptake capacity of FCCP and other treatments in our experiments as well as the underlying health of the donors which is not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smiley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stiebing et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, for the four donors with the most superior performance during classification, Ï<sub>1</sub>, Ï<sub>2</sub>, Ï<sub>avg</sub>, and Î±<sub>2</sub> are the most relevant variables for the classification problem, which agrees with the case of full FoV analysis. Future efforts to improve single-cell classification include increasing the overall number of cells analysed to ensure a stronger classification. In addition, by observing phenotypic IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophage cell surface markers (examples include CD80, CD86, CD163, and CD206, respectively) during the imaging process by immunofluorescence or other modes of tagging, it would be possible to improve the classification efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murray et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>2P-FLIM imaging has several advantages when compared with traditional metabolic assays and methods to classify and validate macrophage metabolism. 2P-FLIM enables spatial and temporal resolution in a non-invasive manner, allowing single-cell and cell-to-cell evaluations into cellular heterogeneity in a basal and interrogated mode. 2P-FLIM requires no fixation nor staining of cells and can be performed in real time with only a small number of cells. In this work, we demonstrated the feasibility of using 2P-FLIM as a tool to distinguish and classify opposing human macrophage polarisation states based on cellular metabolism and fluorescence lifetimes variables. Visualisation of the data showed a clear clustering pattern of IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages in response to FCCP during real-time imaging in a full FoV. The excellent performance of machine learning models, applied on the data extracted from the non-invasive technique, underlines further the efficiency of this workflow. This workflow can be easily adapted to non-invasively characterising macrophage polarisation in in vivo models and in vitro multicellular organoid models. These organoid models can be developed to study foreign body interactions, biomaterial assessment, pharmaceutical research and screening, and clinical applications such as disease diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human blood monocyte-derived macrophage isolation</title><p>This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 9.00 (GraphPad Software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77373-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files (uploaded as source data).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>NN is supported by a Trinity College Dublin, Provostâs PhD Award, and the TCD FLIM core unit directed by MM is supported by a SFI Infrastructure Programme: Category D Opportunistic Funds Call (16/RI/3403).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Non-Invasive classification of macrophage polarisation by 2P-FLIM and machine learning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sergi Padilla-Parra (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please, produce more data utilising the Phasor plot.</p><p>2) Produce 2D graphs clearly showing the number of photons (per pixel) vs lifetime.</p><p>3) Show all pictures of your cells with the different parameters.</p><p>4) If photons are limited leading to artifacts, increase the resolution of all your images (utilise a higher magnification/higher NA objective) and collect more photons per cell.</p><p>5) Figure 2 â Please indicate n number. Is this data from all 6 donors?</p><p>6) Figure 3 â In D, E and F, please indicate what each bar or point represents. Is this single-cell, an imaging field or200 cells? Please indicate for each panel.</p><p>7) The authors should make clear if the ROC AUC value of 0.944 is for single cells or a population? If not signal cell, how many cells are needed to reach this level?</p><p>8) The authors cite KrÃ¶ger et al.'s 2021 preprint that uses lifetime parameters to classify human macrophages in vivo. Are the results here consistent with this kind of accuracy without the application of metabolic inhibitors? In this case, does in vivo environment likely serve as a discriminative condition that might separate the cells by FLIM better than the excess of oxygen in the in vitro setting?</p><p>9) The study could be strengthened further by looking at the phenotypic markers of polarisation at the single-cell level, for example, by immunofluorescence in a manner that could be correlated with the FLIM measurements. This might reveal how much the accuracy of the methods is related to some failure of macrophages to polarise in a population, rather than a true error in classification. This could be discussed as a future effort.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting the paper entitled &quot;Non-Invasive classification of macrophage polarisation by 2P-FLIM and machine learning&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. We are sorry to say that we have decided that this submission will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the revisions were appreciated, they reinforced concerns about S/N. Your response related to importance of machine learning the classification led to a deeper analysis of this machine learning approach, which also suggests several weaknesses. We hope both sets of comments will be helpful in going forward with development of a robust approach to this important and interesting problem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comments on machine learning approach-</p><p>Doing large grid sweeps when cross-validating is not exactly best practice as you will be optimising for performance on the test set. Data should instead be split into train-test-val: grid sweeps should be evaluated on the test set, but final performance should be evaluated on a validation set. Otherwise, these parameters may have been overfitted to test set and may not generalise to other validation sets.</p><p>line 110 â t-SNE cannot be used for dimension reduction as it doesnât learn a function that can be re-applied.</p><p>Given there only appear to be 6 variables used, PCA will likely be useful and faster than UMAP, and the principal components will be highly interpretable. The main utility of UMAP over PCA is that it is a non-linear transformation. PCA should still be explored to see what features make up the principal components.</p><p>139 â ROC-AUC is a bit subjective based on the number of cases: true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative should be reported too.</p><p>In figure 3: is 3F a reapplication of the UMAP learned in E, or is it a new UMAP?</p><p>Figure 4B does not at all look convincing: the M1 and M2 groups do not appear to be separated. Furthermore, was the UMAP used in this figure re-trained on this patient's data, or was it pre-trained on a different dataset? It is not clear.</p><p>There's a lot going on in figure 4: Was a new model trained for each patient, or was each patient tested on the same model? In either case, A variability of 0.937 ROC-AUC to 0.650 ROC-AUC, does not suggest that this classification model is robust.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, It is not apparent where this score of 0.944 comes from â is this the max of cross-validation or the mean? is it on a dataset that collates all the data, or only on a subset? In particular, there is no link to the findings shown in figure 4.</p><p>This could be extended by doing âcross-validationâ when one of the patients is held out each time and generalisation performance is evaluated on the held-out patient.</p><p>Line 235: 'it is noticeable that single-cell classification performance is affected by donor variability during the FCCP 236 treatment' â this should be emphasised in the abstract â it is a weakness of the paper.</p><p>In Table 1 it looks like mtry and ntree are the wrong way around â having only 2-5 trees in a random forest is in no way stable, and given there are 6 features, mtry can not be more than 6 (instead of the reported range of 100 to 300).</p><p>If the researchers are doing cross-validation they should report the mean and standard deviation/S.E. for their ROC-AUC scores along with their TP/TN/FP/FN. It's not apparent if they've picked the highest ROC-AUC score they got in the cross-validations or the mean</p><p>their analysis of feature importance is fairly ad-hoc: a method like SHAP should be explored.</p><p>It appears that in the fluorescence some features are combinations of other features.</p><p>Line 486: if SVMs and logistic regressions have been done these must be reported along with their confidence intervals. Logistic regressions will also be highly interpretable. It does not appear cross-validation has been done on this data, however.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have performed a number of analysis to try to respond to my questions. They have produced the Phasor plot for some of the data and have also presented pixel by pixel images and the photon histograms which is really valuable to understand how reliable is the data.</p><p>I have to say that after examining these data I am not convinced that the signal to noise and the limited photon collections is not affecting the results:</p><p>Figure 3 supplement 1 all figures are the same!!! There is no difference in pixel by pixel values for all conditions! The same can be seen in Figure 3 supplement 2. All figures regardless treatment conditions look the same to me. In the case of the phasor plot the differences might come from S/N as the shift in the plot is minimal and might be equivalent to your error (a few ps). In Figure 3 Supplement 4, the average lifetime clearly shows that for lower number of photons you have a shift in the lifetime which suggests that your changes in lifetime are affected by your poor signal. If you are considering the average lifetime as the mean value from a double exponential, still this shows that your calculations are affected by poor photon collection. You might consider non-fitting approach at all (for instance photon arrival time) and the number of photons would still be important. This would be better shown in a graph in which you do not bin the average lifetimes to a particular lifetime value (histograms) but instead you plot directly each photon value versus its corresponding lifetime value (dispersion plot). If you do this pixel by pixel instead of averaging your results per cell you will get a bid distribution of lifetimes that are pretty much affected by poor photon collection and you will have to determine which is the minimal amount of photons that gives a reliable lifetime.</p><p>I am sorry to say that this vision is strengthened when examining the pixel by pixel images provided with different treatments.

We have calculated the number of photons per pixel of all images acquired across all fluorescence lifetime and intensity measurements. We plotted these in histograms, so the distribution of the data can be observed. For all measurements, normality tests were conducted and all data except Ï<sub>avg</sub> had a normal distribution. Since Ï<sub>avg</sub> is not a raw variable but instead derived from other fluorescence lifetime variables, we believe the double Gaussian distribution is likely due to two different populations analysed in this work (IFNÎ³-M1 and IL-4-M2 macrophages). In addition, while fitting these Gaussian curves we also provide their amplitude, mean, standard deviation and R<sup>2</sup> value. All of these results can be found in supplementary figure 3.

Are the results here consistent with this kind of accuracy without the application of metabolic inhibitors? In this case, does in vivo environment likely serve as a discriminative condition that might separate the cells by FLIM better than the excess of oxygen in the in vitro setting?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, KrÃ¶ger results have a similar accuracy to this work without resorting to metabolic inhibitors and surely, an in vivo environment can play a role on making the phenotype of M1 and M2 macrophages more distinguishable by FLIM. As described in that same work, M1 macrophages are actively engaging in phagocytosis which generates ROS leading to metabolic stress. In addition, nutrient availability, 3D environment with a complex ECM structure and the cross-talk between different cell types present in the human dermis can trigger further metabolic changes that can make it easier to evaluate macrophage polarisation using FLIM. This does evoke an age old debate- in vivo versus in vitro and absolutely the two are not directly comparable whereby even the most advance in vitro conditions (3D, bioreactors, multicellularity, ECM) do not fully capture in vivo environmental conditions, never mind those that are diseased or infected. However, our platform serves as a powerful tool for in vitro analysis and non-discriminative classification of human macrophage behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The study could be strengthened further by looking at the phenotypic markers of polarisation at the single-cell level, for example, by immunofluorescence in a manner that could be correlated with the FLIM measurements. This might reveal how much the accuracy of the methods is related to some failure of macrophages to polarise in a population, rather than a true error in classification. This could be discussed as a future effort.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and have added this point to the Discussion section.</p><p>We agree with this point and have included it in the discussion and a new reference which showcases fluorescent markers that could be used to determine macrophage phenotype.

Data should instead be split into train-test-val: grid sweeps should be evaluated on the test set, but final performance should be evaluated on a validation set. Otherwise, these parameters may have been overfitted to test set and may not generalise to other validation sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our data is comprised of small datasets with limited number of datapoints. We decided to use all of these data-points to train and validate the random forests model using cross-validation. Therefore, we do not have extra data to test our model. When we trained the random forests, we tuned the hyperparameters to achieve the smaller OBB error. The OOB allows us to estimate to the predicative error of our random forests models. In addition, we calculate the ROC curves and corresponding AUC values to evaluate the predictive ability and efficiency of the trained models. We corrected the manuscript to include this explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 110 â t-SNE cannot be used for dimension reduction as it doesnât learn a function that can be re-applied.</p><p>Given there only appear to be 6 variables used, PCA will likely be useful and faster than UMAP, and the principal components will be highly interpretable.

We have now generated new dispersion plots to show directly each photon value (photon/pixel) to their corresponding FLIM and intensity variable. As suggested by the reviewer we are doing this in a pixel by pixel manner. We acquire our data in a 2P-FLIM system equipped with a specific objective designed for multiphoton excitation (25x, 1.05NA) and TCSPC detectors. In addition, we strive to reduce the noise of our imaging by performing it in a dark room with physical obstructions (closed system) to reduce light interference. Besides this the image is acquired during 30 seconds with an appropriate power to generate images with adequate photon counts for fitting of a multiexponential decay curve with Ï<sup>2</sup> values below 1.4. After imaging, we remove the background of the images obtained by using a proprietary tool of Symphotime which removes all of pixels with low photon counts in pre-determined value of photons. Referring to the new dispersion plots we do not have values below 450 photon/pixel, an observable consequence of the background removal by the user assisted by the software.</p><p>Regarding the average lifetime plot in figure 3 âfigure supplement 4, we believe that the separation observed was due to the presence of two metabolically opposed cell populations. As showed in the feature importance data, Ï<sub>avg</sub>, Ï<sub>1</sub> and Ï<sub>2</sub> are the most important parameters to distinguish both cells populations and since Ïavg is a mathematical combination of four fluorescence parameters, the difference of both cellular populations is estimated to be higher in the Ï<sub>avg</sub> plot. In addition, in the average lifetime plot, there are similar frequency values for lower and higher lifetimes. Therefore, if lower photon counts were directly impacting average fluorescence lifetimes measurements, we would observe a skewed trend towards higher frequency values revolving a particular lifetime range. Furthermore, there seems to be no trend on the other non-derived 2P-FLIM parameters.</p><p>Nonetheless, with the new dispersion plots the trend described by the reviewer is no longer present. We have randomised distributions in which we can observe that either high values of photons/pixel (2000 photons/pixel) can result in lower FLIM variables values and vice-versa. Specifically, regarding average fluorescence lifetime referred by the reviewer we no longer observe any trends. We have in our data values with 1000 photons/pixel and corresponding lifetimes of 0.95ns as well 1000 photons/pixel with 1.2ns lifetimes. With these new plots we are confident on the data being measured and on the values obtained.
