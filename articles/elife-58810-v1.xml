to intra-tumoral heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. However, the binary concept of universal BCSCs co-existing with bulk tumor cells is over-simplified. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that Neu, PyMT and BRCA1-null mammary tumors each corresponded to a spectrum of minimally overlapping cell differentiation states without a universal BCSC population. Instead, our analyses revealed that these tumors contained distinct lineage-specific tumor propagating cells (TPCs) and this is reflective of the self-sustaining capabilities of lineage-specific stem/progenitor cells in the mammary epithelial hierarchy. By understanding the respective tumor hierarchies, we were able to identify CD14 as a TPC marker in the Neu tumor. Additionally, single-cell breast cancer subtype stratification revealed the co-existence of multiple breast cancer subtypes within tumors. Collectively, our findings emphasize the need to account for lineage-specific TPCs and the hierarchical composition within breast tumors, as these heterogenous sub-populations can have differential therapeutic susceptibilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>single-cell transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA211066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Jun-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL111829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Long Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS094144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Jun-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL073394</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Jun-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The unraveling of distinct mammary tumor hierarchies in various mouse models of breast cancer emphasizes the need to account for specific cell states with potentially varying therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammary gland is a bi-layered epithelial organ which consists of basal as well as myoepithelial cells in the outer layer. The inner epithelium comprises of luminal cells which can be broadly classified into the hormone-sensing lineage (estrogen receptor + or progesterone receptor +, ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup>) and the secretory alveolar lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2017</xref>). As with most other organs, a hierarchical relationship can be established between the differentiation states of the distinct cell lineages within the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Visvader and Clevers, 2016</xref>). During embryonic developmental stages, bipotent mammary stem cells (MaSCs) with hybrid basal-luminal gene expression patterns and the ability to give rise to both layers of the developed mammary epithelium have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wuidart et al., 2018</xref>). Postnatally, the hybrid basal-luminal gene signatures diminish and eventually leads to the bifurcation of unipotent basal and luminal lineage stem/progenitor cells respectively by the onset of puberty in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraddi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wuidart et al., 2018</xref>). Recent insights from lineage tracing in mouse experiments have also revealed that the ER+ and ER- luminal lineages can respectively self-sustain, through multiple cycles of pregnancy, lactation and involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Keymeulen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, there is cumulative evidence to support the existence of primitive bipotent fetal-MaSCs (fMaSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wuidart et al., 2018</xref>), quiescent adult-MaSCs (aMaSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rios et al., 2014</xref>), basal-lineage SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shackleton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>), ER<sup>-</sup> luminal SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and ER<sup>+</sup> luminal SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Keymeulen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) at varying timepoints of mammary gland development in the mouse. As such, there is a milieu of long-lived SCs/progenitors within the mouse mammary gland that could be candidates for transformation and potential tumor-initiating cells, but each with properties that are unique to a particular lineage or developmental timepoint. Alternatively, neoplastic transformation of cells can also lead to plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molyneux et al., 2010</xref>) and the acquisition of any one of the aforementioned stem/progenitor-like states could have a unique role in tumor progression.</p><p>In the context of cancer, it has been proposed that differentiation hierarchies also exist among tumor cells, with cancer stem cells (CSCs) residing at the apex of the hierarchy within tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>). Although much progress has been made since the initial prospective isolation of CSCs in breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>), major gaps remain in the conceptual framework of breast CSCs (BCSCs), particularly in light of recent insights from the normal mammary differentiation hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Keymeulen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wuidart et al., 2018</xref>). An additional confounding factor has been the description of multiple distinct markers that can enrich for BCSC populations such as CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</xref>), ALDH<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginestier et al., 2007</xref>), HER2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ithimakin et al., 2013</xref>), CD29<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouros-Mehr et al., 2008</xref>) and side population cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> and ALDH<sup>+</sup> markers identify minimally overlapping populations and each of these sub-populations exhibit epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)-like and mesenchymal to epithelial (MET)-like characteristics, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Distinct BCSC populations have also been shown to have differential preferences for signaling and metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roarty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting the need to account for these BCSC populations separately when it comes to therapeutic targeting. It is also important to note that not all previously characterized BCSC markers have been investigated concurrently in an exhaustive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang-Verslues et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the possibility that more non-overlapping markers that enrich for other distinct BCSC populations remain to be determined. Since some of the previously described BCSCs that have increased tumor propagating potential may exist in a progenitor or EMT state that does not strictly correspond to mammary stem cells, we will utilize the term tumor propagating cells (TPCs) when referring to cells with increased tumorigenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraddi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mammary differentiation hierarchy has also been pivotal in guiding the stratification of breast cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Visvader and Clevers, 2016</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 receptor enables a crude association with the hormone-sensing lineage (ER<sup>+</sup>, PR<sup>+</sup>) and basal-like (ER<sup>-</sup>, PR<sup>-</sup>, HER2<sup>-</sup>) subtypes of breast cancer. Parallels between the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prat et al., 2010</xref>) and mammary differentiation states can also be observed with basal-like breast cancers being associated with mouse fMaSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spike et al., 2012</xref>), claudin-low breast cancers with mouse aMaSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2017</xref>) and luminal-A breast cancers with the hormone-sensing lineage. By extension, TPCs which occupy a less-differentiated cell state could correspond to a different breast cancer subtype relative to bulk tumor cells. This raises the question of whether multiple breast cancer subtypes co-exist within a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeo and Guan, 2017</xref>). An increasing number of observations support this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roarty et al., 2017</xref>) but breast cancer subtype heterogeneity within mouse models of breast cancer has not been well characterized.</p><p>In this study, using molecular profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of multiple mouse models of breast cancer, we demonstrated that various tumors driven by different oncogenic events contained tumor cells spanning distinct spectra of cell states within the mammary epithelial hierarchy. We further showed that each of these mammary tumors contained putative lineage-specific TPCs, rather than a universal BCSC population. Accordingly, we utilized CD14 to isolate alveolar progenitor-like TPCs from Neu tumors based on the newly revealed hierarchy of cell states within the tumors. Importantly, the hierarchical heterogeneity that was observed in these tumors was accompanied by the co-existence of cells associated with multiple PAM50 breast cancer subtypes within each of the tumors examined.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tumor cells from different mouse models of breast cancer cluster separately with distinct signatures of mammary lineage markers</title><p>To gain insights into the heterogeneity within mammary tumors, we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling of tumor cells from multiple mouse models representing both luminal and basal-like subtypes of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both MMTV-Neu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guy et al., 1992b</xref>) and MMTV-PyMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 1992a</xref>) driven tumors (designated as Neu and PyMT tumors, respectively) have been well-characterized and used extensively to illuminate the roles of various oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways that are relevant in Her2<sup>+</sup> and other luminal breast cancers. Essentially, the MMTV-Neu tumors examined were ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> while the MMTV-PyMT tumors were ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup>/HER2<sup>lo</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Complementarily, <italic>Brca1<sup>F/F</sup> Trp53<sup>F/F</sup> Krt14-Cre</italic> mice develop mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) (designated as BRCA1-null tumors) which mimic basal-like breast cancers and were ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup>/HER<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In these experiments, PyMT, Neu and BRCA1-null tumors were derived and extracted from congenic FvB background mice when tumors were approximately 1000 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumors were dissociated into single-cell suspensions before sorting for epithelial CD24<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>-</sup> (CD31<sup>-</sup> CD45<sup>-</sup> Ter119<sup>-</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), to enrich for tumor cells and reduce stromal cell contamination. Consequently, isolated tumor cells from the three different tumor types were subjected independently to the Chromium 10x droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNAseq) platform, before pooling together cDNA libraries from all tumors for sequencing. Biological replicates for each tumor type were sequenced independently in a second batch. A total of 11842 cells were sequenced from all three tumor types and after rigorous quality control filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), 9983 cells (4154, 3545 and 2284 cells for Neu, PyMT and BRCA1-null tumors, respectively) were retained for subsequent analyses. On average, between 2205 to 3363 unique genes were detected for cells from each tumor sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Despite sequencing the tumor replicates in a separate batch, initial analysis of cells through dimensionality reduction algorithms (Bioconductor: scran) revealed that cells from both replicates were overlapping to a large degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, replicates of respective tumor types were clustering together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and had a high degree of concordance (Pearson correlation coefficients &gt; 0.97 between respective replicates for all tumor types, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–E</xref>), indicating that batch effects were minimal. Among these cells, the majority were more closely associated with a G1 cell cycle state and less than 2.5% of cells were either in G2/M or S phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). Additionally, normal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) contamination was inferred to be minimal among the cells examined (Cells without CNV in Neu: 0.4%, PyMT: 0%, BRCA1-null: 8.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tumor cells from distinct mouse models of breast cancer cluster separately and can be differentiated by the expression of mammary lineage markers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of workflow for the isolation of mammary tumor cells from BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu tumors for scRNA-seq.

These three main groups could be further subdivided into six clusters upon unsupervised clustering analysis by a shared nearest-neighbor clustering approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To broadly characterize the different clusters, a gene expression heatmap comprising the top-ranked differentially upregulated genes between each cluster was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The basal-like BRCA1-null cells had increased expression of basal-associated genes such as <italic>Krt14, Vim</italic> and <italic>Sparc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Intriguingly, the BRCA1-null tumor cells could be segregated further into cells with basal (Cluster 4) and mesenchymal (Cluster 5) features, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cluster 4 cells expressed higher levels of epithelial genes (<italic>Cldn4, Cldn3, Epcam</italic>) whereas Cluster 5 was defined by expression of mesenchymal genes (<italic>Vim, Sparc, Col3a1, Bgn</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A very small proportion of PyMT cells can also be found within both of these clusters and the presence of basal cells (KRT14<sup>+</sup> leader cells or CD29<sup>hi</sup> cells) have been described in this tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>).

The expression of <italic>Col4a1</italic> is relatively higher in C13:Bsl-G cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), differentiating them from C12:Bsl associated tumor cells. In addition, BRCA1-null cells also clustered amongst C10, alveolar progenitors during gestation (C10:AvP-G), C15, PROCR+ cells that arise during lactation (C15: Prc) and C18, fibroblasts with mesenchymal features (C18:Fibroblasts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The expression of <italic>Col1a2</italic> was evidently higher in C18:Fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is typical of their extracellular matrix deposition functions and fits with our earlier observation of cluster 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which exhibit increased mesenchymal gene expression. It is also worth noting that a spectrum of BRCA1-null tumor cells can be found distributed between clusters C12:Bsl and C10:AvP-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These cells could represent a population with hybrid basal-alveolar gene expression, which have also been documented by Bach et al. and were designated as C20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2017</xref>). This highlights the extensive degree of cell state heterogeneity within BRCA1-null tumors.</p><p>As for PyMT tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), they primarily clustered between C6, luminal progenitors from nulliparous glands (C6:LP-NP) and C7, luminal progenitors during involution (C7:LP-PI), consistent with their association with a luminal progenitor gene expression signature seen in our initial analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A small proportion of PyMT cells were also converging with C10, alveolar progenitors during gestation (C10:AvP-G), indicating the priming of these luminal progenitor-like cells towards the alveolar lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, PyMT tumor cells that were proximal to the C6:LP-NP cluster exhibited elevated <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), whereas there was an enrichment of cells with high <italic>Mfge8</italic> expression towards the C7:LP-PI cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that the post-involution state is associated with increased <italic>Mfge8</italic> expression.</p><p>Comparison of Neu tumor cells with the various clusters in Bach et al.’s dataset showed that they were mostly clustered between C9, alveolar differentiated cells during lactation (C9: AvD-L) and C11, alveolar progenitor cells of lactating glands (C11:AvP-L)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). A portion of tumor cells adjacent to C11 also extend into and overlap with C7, luminal progenitor cells from post-involution (C7:LP-PI). We also noted Neu tumor cells scattered between C8, alveolar differentiated cells during gestation (C8:AvD-G) and C10, alveolar progenitor cells during gestation (C10:AvP-G). These results were consistent with the initial analyses for Neu tumor cells that exhibited a secretory alveolar gene expression signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and also suggested these Neu tumors contained cells which corresponded to a spectrum of differentiation states within the secretory alveolar lineage (i.e. C7:LP-PI → C11 and C10: AvP → C9 and C8: AvD). The increasing level of differentiation in this cascade among the population of Neu tumor cells was also supported by the gradual change in expression of the milk protein gene <italic>Csn1s2a</italic> in the main cluster of Neu tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Additionally, the distinct pattern of <italic>Col9a1</italic> expression among Neu tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) suggested the clustering of alveolar cells from gestation and lactation timepoints respectively. Overall, this analysis utilizing Seurat v3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was robust and stable, as evidenced by the same pattern of overlap between tumor and normal cells from two other independent iterations, utilizing independent sampling of random cells from Bach et al.’s dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to provide a clearer definition of cells with similar gene expression patterns, standard graph-based clustering approach was applied on the combined dataset of tumor and normal cells and this integrated analysis resulted in 17 clusters (Cluster 0–16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Tumor cells were clustered with certain normal cells through this analysis, indicating shared gene expression patterns between tumor cells and certain cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Based on the heatmap of genes defining these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it was apparent that the clustering was influenced largely by genes that define mammary cell lineages or states such as <italic>Spp1, Ltf, Acta2, Lalba, Wap, Prlr, Areg</italic> and <italic>Col1a2</italic>. Accordingly, the number of tumor cells that were assigned into clusters with normal cells of a particular cell state could be determined in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The majority of BRCA1-null cells were assigned into clusters 5 and 8 (41.5% and 20.6% of total BRCA1-null cells respectively), which contained C12:Bsl, C13:Bsl-G and C20 cells. The other cell states that were associated with more than 1% of BRCA1-null cells were LP, AvP, AvD, C14:Myoepithelial, C15:Prc and C18:Fibroblasts. In the case of PyMT tumor cells, 93% of cells were assigned into cluster 0, which corresponded to the luminal progenitor populations C6:LP and C7:LP-PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most of the remaining PyMT tumor cells were assigned into clusters 3 and 4, that were associated with C7:LP-PI, AvP and AvD cells. Neu cells were also assigned into Clusters 3 and 4 (33% and 7.7% of total Neu cells respectively), further affirming the alveolar lineage association of these tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The bulk of Neu tumor cells (58%) were assigned into cluster 2, corresponding to C8:AvD-G cells. Overall, the association between tumor and normal cells through clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) corroborated the observations from t-SNE plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), alleviating complications that may arise when interpreting distances in low dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, t-SNE). Taken together, our comparative analyses of various tumor cells superimposed with a recently described single-cell transcriptome dataset of normal MECs revealed the unique segments of the mammary differentiation spectrum occupied by each tumor type, with potentially distinct lineage-specific TPCs in each of the tumors examined.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Clustering of tumor and normal datasets reveal distinct spectrums of cell states within each tumor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) t-SNE plots of tumor and normal datasets colored by clusters 0–16.

Neu-3 cells had increased expression of milk production related genes such as <italic>Lalba</italic> and can be defined by higher expression of <italic>Cited4, Cd36</italic> and <italic>Aqp5</italic> which corresponded to the AvD cell state <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata6">Figure 4—source datas 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata7">7</xref>). Although cells within the Neu-2 cluster also exhibited increased milk production related genes, this population had elevated expression of <italic>Cd14, Tnfrsf12a, Nfkbia, Bcl3</italic> and <italic>Osmr</italic>. The increased expression of <italic>Cd14</italic> in this Neu-2 cluster led us to the inference that these were AvP cells, since <italic>Cd14</italic> has been described as a marker for progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2017</xref>). Neu-1 cells did express <italic>Cd14</italic> along with increased LP-associated genes such as <italic>Cldn10, Malat1,</italic> and <italic>Krt18.</italic> Moreover, this cluster had lower expression of milk production genes, which indicated that these cells were most closely associated with C7:LP-PI cells. Neu-4 was a smaller cluster of proliferating cells characterized by elevated <italic>Birc5, Tyms</italic> and <italic>Pcna</italic>. The presence of Neu-4 cells in opposing ends of t-SNE dimension one suggested that there were distinct cell states with proliferative potential in this tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Although multiple bioinformatics analyses of sc-RNAseq datasets from three tumor models did not reveal a universal BCSC population from the tumors examined, all these studies suggested the possibility that the less differentiated progenitor-like cells could act as lineage-specific TPCs in each particular tumor. We therefore took an experimental approach to test this idea using the Neu tumor due to its best-defined hierarchical structure from LPs (Neu-1) to AvPs (Neu-2) to AvDs (Neu-3). Both Neu-1 and Neu-2 clusters expressed higher levels of the luminal progenitor marker, <italic>Cd14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asselin-Labat et al., 2011</xref>), along with other STAT3 target genes (<italic>Bcl3, Osmr</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarkson et al., 2004</xref>]) and <italic>Nfkbia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It is worth noting that the STAT3 pathway has been associated with acquisition of BCSC properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). We can also detect the presence of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in a sub-population of Neu tumor cells by immuno-histochemistry, validating the scRNA-seq observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In order to evaluate the potential of CD14 as a cell surface marker for the isolation of putative TPCs in the Neu model, we generated a cell line (designated as N148 cells) from one of the Neu tumors that were analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. Through fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS), we isolated CD14<sup>hi</sup> and CD14<sup>lo/-</sup> populations from N148 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and characterized these populations. Consistently, levels of <italic>Cd14, Bcl3, Osmr</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic> were significantly increased in the CD14<sup>hi</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The increased expression of STAT3 target genes in the CD14<sup>hi</sup> population was also accompanied by elevated phospho-Stat3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). When transplanted into syngeneic FvB mice at limiting dilutions, the CD14<sup>hi</sup> population also exhibited increased tumorigenic potential with an estimated TPC frequency of 1/278 compared to 1/2295 for CD14<sup>lo/-</sup> cells (Chi-squared test, p=0.00134) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Since tumor cells corresponding to distinct cell states were observed within the respective tumors examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we postulated that distinct intrinsic breast cancer subtypes would co-exist within such tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeo and Guan, 2017</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we utilized PAM50 and claudin-low signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prat et al., 2010</xref>), which are routinely used for intrinsic molecular subtyping of breast tumors, to classify single mammary tumor cells using the Bioconductor package, genefu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gendoo et al., 2016</xref>). Single cells were assigned intrinsic subtypes according to their respective correlations with claudin-low and PAM50 centroids (nearest centroid classifier). This approach has been utilized for single-cell analysis of human breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the Neu, PyMT and BRCA1-null tumors each comprised of cells which corresponded to several intrinsic breast cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The BRCA1-null tumors had larger proportions of claudin-low and basal-like tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), whereas Neu and PyMT tumors contained more luminal A and normal-like subtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In general, this reflects the characteristics of the bulk tumors that were more basal-like (BRCA1-null) and luminal (Neu and PyMT) respectively. The presence of mesenchymal populations in BRCA1-null tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>) was also concordant with the assignment of claudin-low subtypes in this tumor type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Altogether, the observation of multiple breast cancer subtypes within a tumor warrants further investigation into its potential clinical significance.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Single-cell intrinsic molecular subtype assignment of mammary tumor cells and model for the distribution of cell states within each mammary tumor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar charts showing the % of cells representing claudin-low (navy blue), basal-like (orange), Her2 (blue), luminal A (yellow), luminal B (purple) and normal-like (green) breast cancer subtypes within BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu tumors.

Interestingly, we found that tumor cells from these distinct models corresponded to minimally overlapping spectra across the mammary differentiation hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In exact, BRCA1-null tumor cells corresponded to mesenchymal, basal and AvP lineages. On the other hand, PyMT tumor cells were associated with LPs of nulliparous and involution timepoints, whereas Neu tumor cells spanned the spectrum from LPs to AvPs to AvD cells. In a scenario with universal BCSCs, the universal BCSCs from different tumor models should cluster together in t-SNE analyses but this was not apparent from our analyses. However, the results presented here do not exclude the possibility of the existence of universal BCSCs, because they may exist at frequencies that were not detectable based on the cell numbers examined (&lt;0.5%). The sorting of CD24<sup>+</sup> cells may also exclude cells that have undergone EMT but we utilized a less stringent CD24<sup>+</sup> gating strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that still enabled the identification of mesenchymal populations, especially in the BRCA1-null tumors. Despite these potential limitations, our observations indicated that each of the tumors investigated were likely to contain lineage specific TPCs respectively. To illustrate this in the Neu tumor, we isolated LP-like and AvP-like cells through enrichment of CD14<sup>hi</sup> cells and showed that these cells exhibited increased tumorigenic potential in limiting dilution experiments, which fits the operational definition of TPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These CD14<sup>hi</sup> cells in the Neu tumors could be highly enriched for parity induced-MECs, that have been previously described to be BCSCs in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asselin-Labat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henry et al., 2004</xref>). In light of recent lineage-tracing studies showing that the basal, luminal ER<sup>+</sup> and luminal ER<sup>-</sup> MEC populations can respectively self-sustain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Keymeulen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), it is not too surprising if distinct TPCs contribute to the propagation of particular tumor subtypes/lineages.</p><p>We anticipate that tumors spanning a similar differentiation spectra (tumors with LP, AvP and AvD cells) will contain identical TPCs that can be isolated by the surrogate marker CD14. However, the illumination of distinct hierarchical patterns in the varying tumor types indicates that this marker will not be universally applicable to all tumor types. As an example, all the tumor cells within the PyMT model correspond to the LP cell state and in such a scenario CD14 is not differentially expressed between the tumor cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Accordingly, from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>), TPCs in PyMT-driven tumors can be demarcated by higher expression of the more specific, primitive LP marker, <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eirew et al., 2012</xref>). As for the BRCA1-null model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), it is likely that CD14 will demarcate LP cells that are of the pre-malignant stages before these cells trans-differentiate toward a more basal/mesenchymal cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and this will be an interesting prospect to be addressed in our future work. It is possible that Cluster BRCA1-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were also trans-differentiated mesenchymal tumor cells because they were mutually exclusive from cells that had normal copy number variation (CNV) predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Cells from cluster BRCA1-3 were classified as tumor because they were predicted to harbor chromosomal amplification or deletion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In order to examine whether there were any potential associations between the genes expressed by BRCA1 clusters with breast cancer patient survival, we used the aggregated mean expression of the top 50 differentially expressed genes for each BRCA1 cluster to analyze potential associations between survival of patients with high or low gene signatures for each cluster, respectively, utilizing KM-plotter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Györffy et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, this analysis revealed that patients expressing higher levels of the genes differentially expressed by clusters BRCA1-1 (Proliferating) and BRCA1-4 (Alveolar Progenitor-like) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), were associated with poorer relapse-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). While the association between proliferation (cluster BRCA1-1) and poor prognosis may not be too surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Diest et al., 2004</xref>), the observation that alveolar progenitor-like (cluster BRCA1-4) gene expression was associated with poorer survival is interesting and worthy of further examination in future work. Since CD14 protein expression can be detected in a subset of BRCA1-null mouse tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as human breast cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), further work will be necessary to validate its potential significance in human breast cancer. In general, our finding of distinct patterns of cell state heterogeneity accentuates the need to specifically select and utilize markers to isolate relevant populations based on the respective tumor hierarchies, instead of universally employing surrogate TPC markers across all tumor types.</p><p>Importantly, our proposed model incorporates the elaborate intricacy of the mammary differentiation hierarchy, which is a conceptual leap from the focus on just universal BCSCs that reside at the apex of the tumor hierarchy. As in the case of the Neu tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), progenitor-like cells and other intermediary states within the tumor hierarchy could also be relevant. Even the more differentiated cell states may have a role in supporting tumor growth through a paracrine manner and similar mechanisms of cooperativity between tumor sub-populations have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marusyk et al., 2014</xref>). The clinical implications of our proposed model are that we cannot assume the presence of universal BCSCs in every tumor and prescribe universal BCSC targeting drugs without considering the specific stem/progenitor TPCs that may be driving them. The composition (hierarchical heterogeneity) of breast tumors may need to be accounted for to determine the combination of therapeutic agents that can effectively eliminate all the tumor sub-populations with discrete susceptibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeo and Guan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>With regard to that, intrinsic molecular subtyping of breast cancers can be associated with particular tumor differentiation cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Visvader and Clevers, 2016</xref>) and single-cell intrinsic molecular subtyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeo and Guan, 2017</xref>) could potentially play a role in illuminating the spectrum of hierarchical heterogeneity within tumors. As we and others have shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), multiple breast cancer subtypes can co-exist within a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) and there also appears to be some concordance between the tumor cell states and intrinsic molecular subtypes that were present. Even then, stratification strategies for single-cell classification will require further refinement because of the influence from cell-cycle-related genes. It would also be interesting to determine if tumor subtype composition at the single-cell level have prognostic value in breast cancer patients. Altogether, diagnosing the intra-tumoral breast cancer subtype heterogeneity may provide an indication of the hierarchical heterogeneity within tumors and guide the selection of combinatorial therapeutic regimens.</p><p>In summary, the data that was generated in this study provides insights into the degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity within several mouse models of breast cancer. Although we have only analyzed these tumors under ‘steady state’ conditions, the single-cell data can serve as an important reference point for future studies which perturb the dynamics of the sub-populations. It would be interesting to investigate the changes in sub-populations after treatment, genetic manipulation, in secondary tumor sites and the degree of plasticity between these populations. In light of a hierarchical model for metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawson et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that certain sub-populations from these tumor models would be enriched in circulation, along the metastatic cascade. Although we did observe a more mesenchymal sub-population in BRCA1-null tumors and the process of EMT has been shown to confer stem-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaffer et al., 2013</xref>), it would be interesting to identify other potential factors that may regulate tumor cell plasticity in some of the other tumor sub-populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dravis et al., 2018</xref>). Crucially, our results unraveled the distinct spectrum of differentiation states within mammary tumors and indicate that these tumors contain lineage-specific stem/progenitor-like TPCs. This emphasizes the need to account for the distinct spectrum of differentiation states within breast tumors to prevent therapeutic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>FVB/NJ</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>001800</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:001800">IMSR_JAX:001800</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>BALB/cJ</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>000651</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000651">IMSR_JAX:000651</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-neu)202Mul/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>002376</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:002376">IMSR_JAX:002376</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>002374</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:002374">IMSR_JAX:002374</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>FVB/N-Brca1<sup>f/f</sup>Trp53<sup>f/f</sup> Tg(Krt14-Cre)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td>Jos Jonkers <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3762188">MGI:3762188</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>N148</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Primary cell line derived from Neu tumor.

Brca1<sup>F/F</sup> P53<sup>F/F</sup> K14-Cre mice that have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) were a kind gift from Dr. Jos Jonkers. MMTV-PyMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 1992a</xref>) and MMTV-Neu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guy et al., 1992b</xref>) strains were originally procured from Jackson Laboratory and were crossed with FIP200<sup>F/F</sup> mice as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). FF99WT cells were derived from an autochthonous MMTV-PyMT tumor with FIP200 floxed alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2011</xref>) (essentially wild-type without Cre recombinase). FF99WT cells were used to generate the PyMT transplant tumors that were analyzed by scRNA-seq. For transplantation experiments, cells were prepared in DMEM:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and the required number of cells (4T1 = 10,000 cells; FF99WT = 1,000,000 cells) were injected in a 50 μl volume orthotopically into the fourth inguinal mammary fat pads. Wild-type FVB/NJ mice or BALB/C female mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory for syngeneic transplantation of MMTV-PyMT tumor cells and 4T1 cells, respectively. 4T1 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. 4T1 cells were transduced with pLenti-GFP (LTV-400, Cell Biolabs) before transplantation experiments. All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma monthly and were negative for contamination. The resulting tumors from spontaneous models (BRCA1-null and MMTV-Neu) along with transplant models (PyMT and 4T1) were harvested when tumor sizes were about 1000 mm<sup>3</sup> and isolated as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tumor dissociation into single-cell suspension</title><p>Dissected primary tumors were cut and minced and then incubated in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% FBS, 1x antibiotic-antimycotics, gentamycin (20 µg/mL) (all from Invitrogen), collagenase (300 units/mL), and hyaluronidase (100 units/mL) (Worthington Biomedical) for 2 hr at 37°C. They were then centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed with PBS, and suspended in 0.05% trypsin/0.025% EDTA (Invitrogen) before incubated for 5 min at 37°C. An equal volume of DMEM/F12 containing 5% FBS and DNase I (20 units/ml, Roche) was then added to stop the digestion. After filtering through a 40 µm nylon mesh (BD Biosciences), the cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min and re-suspended in ACK lysis buffer (Invitrogen) to lyse red blood cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>Cells were suspended in flow buffer (HBSS with 0.1% FBS and DNAse I) for analysis and sorting. Tumor single-cell suspensions were incubated with CD24-PE (553262, BD Biosciences), the endothelial cell marker, CD31-APC (102410, Biolegend), the leukocyte marker, CD45-APC (103112, Biolegend), and the erythrocyte marker, Ter119-APC (116212, Biolegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions for 20 min at 4°C. Following that, cells were rinsed and resuspended in flow buffer before sorting or analysis by FACSAria or FACSCanto instruments (BD Biosciences). The gating strategy for tumor cell sorting was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>. For isolation of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, CD14-APC/Cy7 (123317, Biolegend) antibody was used and the gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Single-cell cDNA libraries were prepared using the 10x Chromium single-cell kit (3’ gene expression platform version two chemistry) according to manufacturer’s instructions for each tumor on separate chips. The aim was to capture about 2000 cells for each biological replicate and include two independent biological replicates for BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu tumor models, respectively. Tumor libraries (BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu) were then pooled and sequenced in a flow cell across two lanes using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer with the following parameters; read 1: 27 cycles; i7 index: eight cycles, i5 index: 0 cycles; read 2: 147 cycles. Independent biological replicates of tumor libraries were pooled and sequenced in a second batch. Library preparation and DNA sequencing were carried out by the CCHMC Gene Expression Core and CCHMC DNA Sequencing Core, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA-sequencing data processing and quality control</title><p>The 10x Genomics workflow was followed to process the raw sequencing data. The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite was used for demultiplexing, barcode assignment and UMI quantification. The pre-built annotation package of mm10 reference genome was obtained from the 10x Genomics website and used as reference for read alignment by STAR. To combine data from seven sample libraries, the outputs of each sample were aggregated using ‘cellranger aggr’ with –normalise set to ‘none’. All together 13,745 cells were identified from four samples (1903 in 4T1, 3102 in BRCA1-null, 4173 in PyMT, 4567 in Neu).</p><p>For cell quality control, we excluded cells in which the number of genes detected and total number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were three median absolute deviations (MAD) below the median of each sample, as well as total less than 1000 molecules or less than 500 genes detected. In addition, all cells with 20% or more of UMIs mapping to mitochondrial genes were defined as non-viable or apoptotic and removed from the analysis. We also avoided the effect of index swapping (non-unique barcodes) by excluding cells with barcodes that appeared in more than one sample. After quality control, there were a total of 11639 cells (1656 in 4T1, 2284 in BRCA1-null, 3545 in PyMT and 4154 in Neu). Pearson correlation test on the mean gene expression profiles showed high reproducibility between two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To classify the cells into cell cycle phases, the function ‘cyclone’ from ‘scran’ package was applied using a pre-trained set of marker pairs for mouse data, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buettner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scialdone et al., 2015</xref>. A score for each phase was assigned for each cell corresponding to the probability that the cell is in that phase, and cells were classified based on the phase score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In order to determine the percentage of normal mammary epithelial cells in the sample, copy number variation (CNV) calling was performed using the R package; CONICSmat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the mouse chromosome region coordinates were obtained from mm10. The genes expressed in less than five cells were filtered out. The noisy regions of CNVs were filtered based on the results of the likelihood ratio test (LRT adjusted p-value&lt;0.01) and BIC for each region (BIC difference &gt;2000). By thresholding on the refined posterior probabilities at 0.8, the matrix is converted to binary where one represents the presence of CNV (tumor) and 0 the absence (normal).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Clustering and differential expression analysis</title><p>The Bioconductor package ‘scran’ was used for the single cell RNAseq data processing. Three tumor types of the same genetic background were analyzed together and 4T1 tumor data were analyzed individually to exclude any potential confounding effects caused by differences in genetic background. Specifically, for three tumor types (BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu), the gene expression counts in each cell were firstly scaled by size factors estimated by the ‘computeSumFactors’ function with default parameters in order to normalize the cell-specific bias. The normalized counts were log-transformed for downstream applications. For dimension reduction, the highly variable genes (HVGs) that drive biological heterogeneity were identified by modeling per gene variance and decomposing the total variance of each gene into its biological and technical components. Genes with the highest biological variant components were then examined and genes driven by technical noise were removed. Specifically, a mean-variance trend was fitted to the normalized log-expression values with ‘trendVar’ function to exhibit technical noise, and this value was subtracted from total variance to obtain biological components for each gene. The genes with biological variance ≥0 and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values&lt;0.1were selected as HVGs. Altogether 3178 HVGs were identified and used as features for PCA and top 50 PCs were used for t-SNE projection. The t-SNE embedding was computed using the ‘Rtsne’ package with default setting and perplexity set to 50.</p><p>The cells were clustered by a shared-nearest neighbor graph (SNN graph)-based method with default parameters. A shared nearest neighbor graph was first built with the expression data of the cells and the walktrap algorithm was used to identify clusters. The marker genes were identified using the ‘findMarkers’ function in ‘scran’ by testing for differential expression between clusters to identify the top upregulated genes in each cluster. The identified markers that ranked top 10 across all comparisons were selected to visualize by heat-map. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Superimposing tumor dataset with normal mammary cell dataset</title><p>To characterize the hierarchical composition of each tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we overlaid the cells with mouse epithelial cells by Bach et al. 12000 cells were randomly sampled from the published dataset (GES106273). The QC was conducted following the original processes and 11637 cells were left, consistent with the sample size of our data. The integration of normal and tumor data was implemented by Seurat v3, in order to identify common cell types and enable comparative analysis. Specifically, Seurat objects were built individually for the tumor dataset and reference normal dataset and top 2000 variant genes in each object were identify as variable features. The cell pairwise correspondences between single cells between datasets, called ‘anchors’, were identified using ‘FindIntegrationAnchors’ by taking the Seurat objects list of tumor and normal using 20 dimensions, which jointly reduced the dimensionality of both datasets using diagonalized Canonical Component Analysis and L2-normalization. 5916 anchors were identified and used to integrate the two datasets by transforming the datasets into a shared space regardless of technical and biological difference.</p><p>To analyze the integrated dataset, PCA was applied for dimensionality reduction and t-SNE was used for visualization following the standard workflow. Clustering was also conducted by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm using default parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The up-regulated gene markers of each cluster were identified using function ‘FindAllMarkers’ with log fold change threshold set as 1, and the markers ranked top five were selected to visualize by heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The cells that were assigned to each cluster were also annotated by their tumor origins (BRCA1-null, PyMT or Neu) or original clustering identities from Bach.et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Diffusion maps, cell state trajectory and pseudo-time analyses</title><p>In order to explore the lineage profile of the different tumors and infer the differential trajectory, diffusion maps were built using ‘Monocle3’ with standard setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Intra-tumoral heterogeneity analysis</title><p>To identify the intra-tumoral heterogeneity, four tumor samples were also analyzed individually using ‘scran’ following the standard workflow of normalization, dimension reduction and clustering. For three tumors with two replicates (BRCA1-null, PyMT or Neu), a batch correction process using function ‘fastMNN’ in ‘scran’ was applied on the two replicate samples, and the corrected values in low dimensional subspace were used for downstream analysis of clustering by SNN-graph clustering and visualization by t-SNE. The number of clusters (BRCA1-null = 5, PyMT = 3, Neu = 4 and 4T1 = 3) were selected based on differential expression of genes defining cell states. Cluster numbers were adjusted if a cluster did not express genes that could be correlated with a particular cell state or biological process. This justification provides a meaningful narrative for the clusters in each tumor type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene set and pathway analysis</title><p>The gene set enrichment analysis based on gene ontology (GO) terms was conducted to characterize the signature gene sets representing each cluster in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The top 50 significantly upregulated genes in each cluster were compared to all the genes tested for differential expression in each tumor sample using ‘topGO’ with default setting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Intrinsic breast cancer molecular subtype assignment</title><p>To characterize the intrinsic molecular subtype of single cells in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we compared the mouse single-cell expression data to human breast cancer molecular subtype assignment. Firstly, the genes that are one-to-one homologues between human and mouse were mapped according to Homologene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/homologene.data">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/homologene.data</ext-link>). The symbol of mouse genes were mapped to human gene symbols and 10,855 out of 12438 genes were uniquely mapped. The ‘genefu’ package was used to assign the cell type of each single cell by PAM50 and claudin-low subtype assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gendoo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting</title><p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned (5 µM) and stained for respective antigens as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). Slides were heated in citrate buffer in a pressure cooker for antigen retrieval. Antibodies used for immuno-staining included CD14 (PA5-78957, Invitrogen), Erbb2 (CST2165, Cell Signaling), Irf1 (CST8478, Cell Signaling) and Mki67 (M3062, Spring Bioscience). Immunoblotting experiments were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeo et al., 2016</xref>). Antibodies used for immunoblotting were p-STAT3 (CST9145, Cell Signaling), STAT3 (CST9139, Cell Signaling) and beta-Actin (A5441, Sigma Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

These insights stress the need for a deeper interrogation on the hierarchical composition of different breast cancer subtypes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of mammary tumors reveal distinct patterns of hierarchical and subtype heterogeneity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wilbert Zwart as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Luca Magnani (Reviewer #2); Rachael Natrajan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors have analyzed &gt;11K cells from three mouse models of breast cancer and have utilized previous knowledge of mammary development to explore the idea of a &quot;normal-inspired hierarchy&quot; within each tumour. Overall, the data are quite descriptive, with the exception of the re-validation of CD14 as a putative marker in basal like tumours. The final set of analysis are designed to identify heterogeneity within each tumor by classifying single cells into widely accepted human breast cancer subtypes. While the dataset is interesting, my opinion is that the manuscript falls a bit short from its initial question: are different cancer subtypes driven by a common stem cells which then differentiate toward different phenotypes? This was a hard question and I think the results here support quite clearly the most prevalent view which state that different tumor subtypes are likely originating in different cell of origin within the normal breast architecture.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are some missing piece of data which I believe are required. The authors suggest that BRCA, Neu and PyMT recapitulate somehow Basal (TNBC), HER2 and Luminal cancer. It would be helpful if the authors could stain their samples for the classical marker used in the clinic: ER, PR and HER2. This is especially important for the interpretation of Figure 6, which is rather overstated at the moment (since PyMT and Neu are basically identical while only BRCA1B shows somehow distinct composition). BRCA1B and A have been profiled at very different levels (S2 E).</p><p>2) The hierarchy in Figure 6 is also over-speculative, since the authors themselves state that they could not really reconstruct it for BRCA1 and PyMT mices. This would have to be addressed. Also, what is the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2 here? Isn't is strange that the MMTV-Neu model does not show increase in HER2 subtype on PAM50?</p><p>3) Could the authors explain their choices of gating for the CD14 transplantation experiment? Was it somehow informed by the single cell level of expression of CD14? Also, could the authors stain some Basal Human cancers for CD14 to check it's expression? Or do they believe this is a mouse-specific finding?</p><p>4) The authors state that &quot;In summary, the data that was generated in this study provides a comprehensive level of insight into the degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity&quot;. With about 2K cells per tumor model profiled at 2.5K genes per cell, I think this statement is inappropriate. A much bigger effort is required to achieve a comprehensive insight of heterogeneity (just an example, mapping at single cell level about 10K CD14 cells and CD14<sup>-</sup> cells just for the BRCA model). Furthermore, the authors did not really attempt to perform more sophisticated corrections to exclude differences driven by cell cycle or other confounding factor.</p><p>5) The authors state &quot;Levels of some alveolar differentiation genes such as Cited4 and <italic>Tspan8</italic> were marginally higher in Cluster 1.&quot; What do they mean by marginal? Is this not significant?</p><p>6) &quot;On the other hand, BRCA1-3 cells expressed the highest levels of genes associated with fibroblasts (Figure 4B) and this would fit with our previous observations of a sub-population of BRCA1 null cells with mesenchymal characteristics (Figures 1-3).&quot; Can the author's rule out that these cells are not fibroblasts?</p><p>7) Do the BRCA1 clusters identified have clinical relevance in human breast cancers?</p><p>8) It is not really clear from the title, nor from the Introduction, that the study is basically a basic science report: do different GEMM models of breast cancer have distinct or overlapping subpopulations of tumor cells? I'd recommend the authors change the title and Introduction accordingly, as especially the title now conveys a rather clinical message, that the study simply doesn't deliver.</p><p>9) The BRCA1 model is K14-CRE driven, while the other two are MMTV. Could this difference have an impact on the observed differences on cell populations? Now, the study is comparing three difference mouse models with different drivers, and states the tumors that develop are also different. But without a confirmation on a second independent mouse model representing the same subtype of breast cancer (but with a different genetic background, or a different promoter driving the phenotype), one cannot state whether the differences that are found, are due to the different tumor drivers, tumour subtypes or different models. I feel this is an important issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58810.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors have analyzed &gt;11K cells from three mouse models of breast cancer and have utilized previous knowledge of mammary development to explore the idea of a &quot;normal-inspired hierarchy&quot; within each tumour.

On the other hand, BRCA1-null tumors were ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup>/HER<sup>-</sup> (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and this is consistent with Neu and PyMT tumors designated as luminal, whereas BRCA1-null tumors were designated as basal. These additional descriptions and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A have been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is especially important for the interpretation of Figure 6, which is rather overstated at the moment (since PyMT and Neu are basically identical while only BRCA1B shows somehow distinct composition).</p></disp-quote><p>Both the MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PYMT tumors have a gene expression pattern that corresponds to luminal breast cancer (not Her2-enriched) (PMID: 17493263) and this would fit with their similar profiles in Figure 6. However, we realize that there are potential limitations of using PAM50 classification at the single-cell level, since this gene-list was originally developed for bulk tumors. Accordingly, we have stated in our Discussion that “Even then, stratification strategies for single-cell classification will require further refinement because of the influence from cell cycle related genes. It would also be interesting to determine if tumor subtype composition at the single-cell level have prognostic value in breast cancer patients.” to tone down our interpretations related to Figure 6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>BRCA1B and A have been profiled at very different levels (S2 E).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the BRCA1 tumors were profiled at different levels but this was due to unexpected technical difficulties since we aimed to capture similar amount of cells for the BRCA1-null tumor replicates using the Chromium 10X system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hierarchy in Figure 6 is also over-speculative, since the authors themselves state that they could not really reconstruct it for BRCA1 and PyMT mices. This would have to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The model shown in Figure 6 is an illustration to summarize the overlaps between tumor and normal mammary epithelial cell populations based on observations in Figures 1 to 3, so we do not think it is over-speculative. Although we are showing the cell states that are present in each tumor type, we did not specifically stipulate the TPCs for each model. To clarify further, we did not state that the hierarchies cannot be reconstructed for the BRCA1 and PyMT mice, but rather it was more difficult to infer TPCs from the hierarchies in these other models. To address this, we have now changed the statement to:</p><p>“They also provided interesting information for each cluster of cells within individual tumors, although the TPCs and putative markers to be used for isolation could not be deduced easily based on the current analysis so far, except for that in Neu cells discussed below.”</p><p>In PyMT mice, the reason was because the hierarchy was very shallow (illustrated by Figure 6A), since the tumor consisted largely of a luminal progenitor-like component (Figures 2B and 2F). However, we have previously shown that more primitive ALDH<sup>+</sup> populations (primitive luminal progenitors) can be isolated amongst the bulk of luminal progenitor-like cells and the ALDH<sup>+</sup> populations were more tumorigenic than bulk PyMT tumor cells (Yeo et al., 2016).</p><p>In the case of BRCA1-null tumors, the hierarchy is more complex with luminal progenitor-like, basal-like, hybrid alveolar-basal cells and mesenchymal populations (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and Figure 4A-B, it is likely that CD14 will demarcate luminal progenitor-like cells, which are found in early stage BRCA1-null tumors before these cells trans-differentiate towards more basal/mesenchymal cells (Wang et al., 2019). Thus, it is unclear whether CD14<sup>+</sup> cells within this tumor type are the most tumorigenic (TPCs) or least differentiated. Hence, we will continue to identify markers that would allow us to isolate distinct basal, mesenchymal and luminal progenitor populations in this tumor model to compare their tumorigenic potentials as part of our future work. The combination of CD14 with a basal marker to potentially identify cells with hybrid alveolar-basal cells (presumably more stem-like and bipotent) in this tumor model is also an interesting prospect that we are looking into.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what is the difference between BRCA1 and BRCA2 here?</p></disp-quote><p>The BRCA1 A and BRCA1 B are two independent tumor samples from separate mice. Since the BRCA1-null model is more heterogeneous (PMID: 22396490), due to genomic instability (loss of BRCA1 and p53), it makes sense that there is a wider range of variation for this model, as previously reported. Even so, the cell states that are present in both replicates are similar, albeit their proportions being different (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Isn't is strange that the MMTV-Neu model does not show increase in HER2 subtype on PAM50?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to point 1, the MMTV-Neu tumors have a gene expression pattern that corresponds to luminal breast cancer (PMID: 17493263). Thus, it may not be strange that the Neu model does not show higher numbers of cells corresponding to the Her2-enriched subtype. Furthermore, the PAM50 classification for the Her2-enriched subtype includes genes such as Grb7, which are frequently co-amplified with Her2 due to their proximity. Thus, co-amplification events are likely required along with Her2 over-expression to give rise to the Her2-enriched subtype (PMID: 12941816). Essentially, the MMTV-Neu model corresponds to the histological derived subtype of HER2<sup>+</sup> but not the intrinsic subtype of HER2-enriched (PMID: 17493263).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Could the authors explain their choices of gating for the CD14 transplantation experiment? Was it somehow informed by the single cell level of expression of CD14?</p></disp-quote><p>The gating for CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>-</sup> in Figure 5C was spaced out to minimize potential spillover of the two populations during the cell sorting process. However, it was not informed by the expression levels from the scRNAseq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, could the authors stain some Basal Human cancers for CD14 to check its expression? Or do they believe this is a mouse-specific finding?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to the summary above and point #2 (third paragraph), CD14 was defined as a putative marker for TPCs in the Her2<sup>+</sup> Neu tumors and not basal-like tumors. Nonetheless, we expect to see CD14 staining in tumors of various subtypes, since BRCA1-deficient basal-like human cancers have also been shown to originate from luminal progenitor cells (PMID: 27322743, 21336547). This would also be reflective of the mRNA expression patterns of CD14 in BRCA1-null, PyMT and Neu tumors (Figures 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E), where sub-populations of CD14 expressing cells were present in BRCA1-null and Neu tumors, whereas PyMT tumors exhibited more homogenous expression of CD14. We have now included Figure 5—figure supplement 1A to corroborate the CD14 mRNA data at the protein level by immuno-histochemistry.</p><p>In addition, we have also stained a panel of human breast cancer samples for CD14 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C) and CD14 expression can be found across different histological subtypes without an association with a particular subtype in human breast cancer.</p><p>Overall, we agree that at present, the CD14 findings need to be confirmed in human breast cancer, hence we have changed the title of the manuscript to reflect that our study is focused on mouse models of breast cancer (Point #8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that &quot;In summary, the data that was generated in this study provides a comprehensive level of insight into the degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity&quot;. With about 2K cells per tumor model profiled at 2.5K genes per cell, I think this statement is inappropriate. A much bigger effort is required to achieve a comprehensive insight of heterogeneity (just an example, mapping at single cell level about 10K CD14 cells and CD14<sup>-</sup> cells just for the BRCA model). Furthermore, the authors did not really attempt to perform more sophisticated corrections to exclude differences driven by cell cycle or other confounding factor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the statement, based on the reviewers’ advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state &quot;Levels of some alveolar differentiation genes such as Cited4 and Tspan8 were marginally higher in Cluster 1.&quot; What do they mean by marginal? Is this not significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the term marginal because there was a 1.88 fold and 1.55 fold difference in the levels of Cited4 and Tspan8 respectively between Clusters 1 and 2. In contrast, the fold change between Clusters 1 and the other (3-6) clusters were much higher (Figure 1D). For both these genes, the p-values were 1.13 x 10<sup>-104</sup> and 6.89 x 10<sup>-93</sup> respectively (pairwise t-test between Clusters 1 and 2), which is statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;On the other hand, BRCA1-3 cells expressed the highest levels of genes associated with fibroblasts (Figure 4B) and this would fit with our previous observations of a sub-population of BRCA1 null cells with mesenchymal characteristics (Figures 1-3).&quot; Can the author's rule out that these cells are not fibroblasts?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in pointing out that we cannot completely rule out that these are bona fide fibroblasts. However, we now provide additional data (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A) to show that Cluster BRCA1-3 cells are mutually exclusive from cells that had normal copy number variation (CNV) predictions. In line with this, cells from cluster BRCA1-3 were classified as tumor because they were predicted to harbor chromosomal amplification and/or deletion events (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). This suggests that cells from this cluster may have undergone trans-differentiation.</p><p>In support of this view, recent tracing experiments in combination with single-cell RNA sequencing of BRCA1-null mouse mammary tumors has also revealed that trans-differentiation of tumor epithelial cells into mesenchymal populations does indeed occur upon BRCA1 deletion (Wang et al., 2019). This point has now been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do the BRCA1 clusters identified have clinical relevance in human breast cancers?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to examine whether there were any potential associations between the genes expressed by BRCA1 clusters with patient survival, we used the aggregated mean expression of the top 50 differentially expressed genes for each BRCA1 cluster to analyze potential associations between survival of patients with high or low gene signatures for each cluster respectively. This was carried out with KM-plot (PMID: 20020197). Interestingly, this analysis revealed that patients expressing higher levels of the genes differentially expressed by clusters BRCA1-1 (Proliferating) and BRCA1-4 (Alveolar Progenitor-like) respectively (Figure 4B), were associated with poorer relapse free survival (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). While the association between proliferation (cluster BRCA1-1) and poor prognosis may not be too surprising (van Diest et al., 2004), the observation that alveolar progenitor-like (cluster BRCA1-4) gene expression was associated with poorer survival is interesting and worthy of further examination in future work. This description has been added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is not really clear from the title, nor from the Introduction, that the study is basically a basic science report: do different GEMM models of breast cancer have distinct or overlapping subpopulations of tumor cells? I'd recommend the authors change the title and Introduction accordingly, as especially the title now conveys a rather clinical message, that the study simply doesn't deliver.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have edited the title as well as Introduction to better reflect that the manuscript is basic science oriented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The BRCA1 model is K14-CRE driven, while the other two are MMTV. Could this difference have an impact on the observed differences on cell populations? Now, the study is comparing three difference mouse models with different drivers, and states the tumors that develop are also different. But without a confirmation on a second independent mouse model representing the same subtype of breast cancer (but with a different genetic background, or a different promoter driving the phenotype), one cannot state whether the differences that are found, are due to the different tumor drivers, tumour subtypes or different models. I feel this is an important issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point made by the reviewer and agree that the variables mentioned could contribute to the different cell states that were present in each tumor model. However, we did not state that these differences were specifically due to a particular variable such as driver oncogene or promoter and that was not the point we were trying to make.</p><p>Our main aim was to utilize these diverse mouse models to illustrate and exemplify a sampling of “mouse patients”. Accordingly, our findings showed that each of them had distinct patterns of cell state heterogeneity. This general observation itself is very important because one of the prevailing views regarding breast CSCs/TPCs is that they are universally the same entity (the stem-like cell on top of the mammary differentiation hierarchy), and the same entity is presumed to be present in all breast tumors. Our findings indicate otherwise as shown in Neu tumors, where CD14<sup>+</sup> luminal progenitor-like cells (not stem-like) which occupy an intermediate state (not the apex) in the mammary differentiation hierarchy were shown to be TPCs. This would advocate for the need to account for potentially unique hierarchies in a particular mammary tumor rather than assuming universal breast CSCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
