However, not all patients benefit from DMF. We hypothesized that the variable response of patients may be due to their diet. In support of this hypothesis, mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, did not benefit from DMF treatment when fed a lauric acid (LA)-rich diet. Mice on normal chow (NC) diet, in contrast, and even more so mice on high-fiber (HFb) diet showed the expected protective DMF effect. DMF lacked efficacy in the LA diet-fed group despite similar resorption and preserved effects on plasma lipids. When mice were fed the permissive HFb diet, the protective effect of DMF treatment depended on hydroxycarboxylic receptor 2 (HCAR2), which is highly expressed in neutrophil granulocytes. Indeed, deletion of <italic>Hcar2</italic> in neutrophils abrogated DMF protective effects in EAE. Diet had a profound effect on the transcriptional profile of neutrophils and modulated their response to MMF. In summary, DMF required HCAR2 on neutrophils as well as permissive dietary effects for its therapeutic action. Translating the dietary intervention into the clinic may improve MS therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/810331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prévot</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><name><surname>Nogueiras</surname><given-names>Ruben</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwaninger</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHW 416/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwaninger</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE 2891/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wettschureck</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Outlive-CRC-01KD2103A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Künstner</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name><name><surname>Busch</surname><given-names>Hauke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The therapeutic effect of dimethyl fumarate in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis depends on the diet of mice and is mediated by the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR2 in neutrophils.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Orally available disease-modifying agents have made significant progress in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). One of the most commonly prescribed drugs is dimethyl fumarate (DMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kern and Cepeda, 2020</xref>). DMF and the recently approved diroximel fumarate are prodrugs of monomethyl fumarate (MMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoogendoorn et al., 2021</xref>). Besides MS, MMF or its prodrugs are also marketed for psoriasis and investigated for other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoogendoorn et al., 2021</xref>). Randomized clinical trials and post-marketing studies have proven the efficacy of MMF or its prodrugs in relapsing-remitting MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mallucci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miclea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zecca et al., 2020</xref>). While DMF has a favorable safety profile compared to intravenous disease-modifying therapies, not all patients benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ontaneda et al., 2019</xref>). In phase-III trials of DMF treatment, 64.9% of patients showed no signs of disease activity after 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Havrdova et al., 2017</xref>), but conversely, about one-third of patients did not completely respond to DMF. Therefore, understanding the factors that determine the response to DMF is imperative and may help improve MS therapy. A polymorphism in the NOX3 gene that generates reactive oxygen species predicts DMF response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlström et al., 2019</xref>). Another study found that a rare population of memory T helper cells expressing high levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines and CXCR3 reflects DMF response in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diebold et al., 2022a</xref>). Although these studies have revealed interesting mechanisms, their practical consequences for MS therapy remain unclear.</p><p>MMF, the active metabolite of DMF, activates the antioxidant transcription factor NRF2 by covalently binding to the regulatory factor KEAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linker et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, NRF2 inhibits the transcription of inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>), a process that may contribute to the therapeutic effects of MMF. In addition, MMF is an agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR2 (GPR109A) in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, keratinocytes, and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, HCAR2 is required for the therapeutic efficacy of DMF in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS, and in two mouse models of inflammatory skin diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suhrkamp et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wannick et al., 2018</xref>). In line with <italic>Hcar2</italic> expression in myeloid cells, DMF treatment reduced neutrophil extravasation into CNS or skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wannick et al., 2018</xref>). A growing body of evidence supports a key role for neutrophils in MS. Myelopoiesis in the bone marrow is stimulated, and circulating neutrophils show signs of activation in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rumble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, cell-specific targeting of neutrophils improved pathology in EAE models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest the hypothesis that HCAR2 on neutrophils mediates DMF effects in EAE, but direct evidence is missing.</p><p>Initially, HCAR2 was identified as a receptor of nicotinic acid, a lipid-lowering drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tunaru et al., 2003</xref>). Via HCAR2, nicotinic acid reduces serum levels of free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tunaru et al., 2003</xref>). DMF treatment in MS patients has similar effects on serum lipids as nicotinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhargava et al., 2019</xref>), supporting the notion that DMF activates HCAR2. In the meantime, further evidence has accumulated showing that HCAR2 is a key regulator of metabolism. An endogenous agonist of HCAR2 is the fasting metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Offermanns, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taggart et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, HCAR2 activation protects against diet-induced obesity, and the metabolic effects of HCAR2 activation depend on diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that diet may influence therapeutic DMF effects also in MS, providing a possible explanation for why DMF does not benefit all patients. To test this hypothesis, we modified the dietary supply of fatty acids to mice in EAE, as medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to influence the course of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haghikia et al., 2015</xref>). DMF treatment improved the neurological deficit in EAE if mice were fed a high-fiber (HFb) diet that leads to intestinal SCFA production but not a diet rich in lauric acid (LA), a medium-chain fatty acid. The DMF effect on HFb diet was lost in mice with a cell-specific deletion of <italic>Hcar2</italic> in neutrophils, suggesting that the diet may modulate neutrophil responses to DMF treatment. Indeed, diet had a marked effect on the transcriptional profile of neutrophils, and MMF inhibited neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) if mice were on HFb diet but less so on LA diet. Overall, the data demonstrate that diet determines the response of neutrophils to MMF and its therapeutic efficacy in experimental MS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diet modulates DMF efficacy in EAE</title><p>To test the impact of diets on the protective effects of DMF in EAE, we fed mice with LA diet, normal chow (NC) diet, or HFb diet starting 14 days before immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

When we performed LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics on plasma samples obtained on day post-immunization (dpi) 28 in EAE and analyzed the data by sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA), it became evident that key diet-induced differences (components 1 and 2) consisted of higher levels of medium-chain lipids and lower plasma levels of non-saturated lipids on LA diet than on HFb or NC diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, plotting the relative change of lipids on LA or HFb diet versus the number of double bonds demonstrated that saturated lipids preferentially increased on the LA diet while non-saturated lipids decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast, mice on the HFb diet were characterized by higher levels of phospholipids containing non-saturated fatty acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, component 2). As an example of a non-saturated fatty acid, plasma concentrations of FAs 18:2 including linoleic acid, the precursor of arachidonic acid, increased in the order of LA, NC, and HFb diet, in parallel with the functional response to DMF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, this reflects different concentrations of linoleic acid in the diets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Plasma concentrations of the SCFA acetic acid or propionic acid did not change in DMF-treated groups or between diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and butyrate concentrations were below the limit of quantification.</p><p>Although DMF did not improve the clinical EAE score in combination with LA diet, it had metabolic effects in mice fed this diet. DMF significantly changed plasma lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Particularly in animals fed LA diet, DMF lowered triglycerides, mimicking the HCAR2-mediated effect of nicotinic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tunaru et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, DMF increased some sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). DMF effects on plasma lipids were more pronounced when mice were on LA diet than on NC or HFb diet, as also shown by the separation based on component 3 of sPLS-DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) only for LA diet groups. Even when DMF did not have marked effects on the lipid profile in mice fed an HFb diet, it protected against EAE, indicating that the lipid-lowering effects are not responsible for the protection in EAE. In addition, this observation supports the drug monitoring data showing that LA diet did not interfere with DMF resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of diet and DMF on small hydrophilic metabolites in plasma</title><p>To further characterize the interaction of DMF treatment and diet, we performed LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics of plasma samples obtained on dpi 28 in EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Diet had a significant impact on small hydrophilic metabolites in plasma as shown by sPLS-DA of the metabolomics dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, components 1 and 2). Component 1 metabolites included glycitein, an isoflavone, and equol, an isoflavone metabolite produced by gut bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Glycitein and equol levels were elevated in NC diet-fed mice, indicating that this diet is enriched in isoflavones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Isoflavones and equol are protective in EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2021</xref>), but DMF treatment did not significantly change their plasma levels. The diet also affected metabolites of component 2, including <italic>N</italic>-acetyltyrosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). Plasma levels of <italic>N</italic>-acetyltyrosine were higher in the HFb diet group than in the LA diet group, similar to the clinical response to DMF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To explain diet-dependent therapeutic efficacy, we wondered whether DMF-induced microbiota effects depend on diet. Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing of feces sampled on dpi 27 demonstrated diet-associated changes in microbiota at the level of phylum, genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), and operational taxonomic unit (OTU). In accordance with others’ observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantu-Jungles and Hamaker, 2023</xref>), in our experiment, HFb diet reduced α-diversity, a measure of bacterial diversity within individual hosts, in comparison to LA and NC diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). DMF did not affect α-diversity. Also, β-diversity analyses, a measure of dissimilarity between groups, showed significant differences between the diets, but no effects of DMF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In comparison to LA and NC diets, HFb diet increased butyrate-producing bacteria while lowering pro-inflammatory species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Compared to LA or NC diets, HFb diet was associated with a higher abundance of the butyrate producers <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroides</italic>, which may correct altered levels of these bacteria reported in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Correale et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

However, not all patients benefit from MMF or DMF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Havrdova et al., 2017</xref>); therefore, this treatment strategy needs to be improved. Here, we report that diet critically determines the efficacy of DMF. DMF was most effective in EAE, the mouse model of MS, when animals were fed an HFb diet. Translating these findings into the clinic could improve MS therapy. To enable this process, we examined how dietary factors interact with DMF treatment.</p><p>Preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that oral administration of DMF leads to the activation of HCAR2, a G protein-coupled receptor activated by the DMF metabolite MMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubrall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). In support of this, DMF mimicked the HCAR2-mediated effects of nicotinic acid on triglycerides in mice subjected to EAE and in human MS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhargava et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tunaru et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, the therapeutic effects of DMF in EAE depended on HCAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), because only wild-type but not HCAR2-deficient animals were protected by DMF treatment. Guided by the high expression of <italic>Hcar2</italic> in neutrophils, we deleted <italic>Hcar2</italic> in this cell type. In the absence of neutrophilic HCAR2, DMF did not have a protective effect in the EAE model, implicating neutrophils as a cellular target of DMF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Whether <italic>Hcar2</italic>-expressing microglia or monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the DMF action has to be determined in the future. Previous work had already indicated that DMF reduces neutrophil infiltration into the CNS during EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Although neutrophils have not been a traditional focus of research in MS or EAE, recent findings have revised this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casserly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rumble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). Neutrophils seem to be part of the early stages of the immune cascade that mediates neuroinflammation in EAE or MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, they are linked to the adaptive immune system at multiple levels, potentially explaining how DMF treatment modulates dendritic cell and lymphocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosales, 2020</xref>).</p><p>A central role for neutrophils in DMF action is supported by the observation that diet modulates the transcriptional profile of neutrophils and their response to MMF. On the HFb diet, neutrophils seem to be reprogrammed for several immune functions. Genes with GO terms related to cell activation were regulated. Although the expression of <italic>Hcar2</italic> was not altered by the diet, the response to MMF was stronger in mice fed an HFb diet, indicating a mode of action how the HFb diet may exert a permissive effect on DMF treatment. Of note, additional targets of DMF on cell types other than neutrophils have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linker et al., 2011</xref>) and may enhance HCAR2-mediated neutrophil effects.</p><p>As diets are complex interventions, the identification of essential ingredients or actions is difficult. There are several ways in which diet might affect neutrophil function, however. Effects of HCAR2 in neutrophils may be blocked by the medium-chain fatty acid LA or saturated lipids derived from LA. A previous study reported that LA diet aggravates the untreated course of disease in EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haghikia et al., 2015</xref>), but this effect was not evident in our experiments, perhaps because of a shorter time on this diet before immunization. Alternatively, SCFAs are candidates to mediate the effect of HFb diet because they are produced from dietary fibers and stimulate HCAR2, at least butyrate in high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taggart et al., 2005</xref>). Since SCFAs were either unaltered or undetectable in the plasma of the HFb diet-fed mice, a systemic effect is unlikely, but we cannot exclude a local effect of butyrate in the gut wall. Indeed, HCAR2 mediates anti-inflammatory effects of HFb diet in the gut wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Offermanns, 2017</xref>). Moreover, the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly intestinal T cells, has been linked to EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duc et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haupeltshofer et al., 2019</xref>). Whether a local butyrate elevation in the gastrointestinal tract can modulate the effect of DMF treatment is unclear at present. Alternatively, dietary interventions had profound effects on other lipids and metabolites. Most conspicuous was the HFb diet-induced increase in non-saturated plasma lipids in DMF-responsive mice, when compared to LA diet-fed mice. Non-saturated lipids are substrates for the synthesis of immune-active components, such as resolvins that modulate neutrophil function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 1996</xref>). Finally, diet affects the gut microbiota, which in turn influences neutrophil function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lajqi et al., 2020</xref>). In line with the activity of DMF as an NRF2 stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linker et al., 2011</xref>), we found evidence that DMF treatment has antioxidant effects in vivo and that MMF treatment stimulates an antioxidant transcriptional program in neutrophils.</p><p>Whatever the underlying mechanisms, translation into the clinic could improve the efficacy of MMF or its prodrugs in the treatment of MS or other diseases. The effect of MMF seems to be supported by a diet low in medium-chain saturated fatty acids, such as those found in coconut or palm oil, but rich in dietary fiber. Clinical trials are needed to verify this link.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mouse lines were established on a C57BL/6 background.

In brief, SCFAs were extracted from plasma (30 µl) using ethanol (293.75 μl), and deuterated internal standard mix (6.25 µl, d4-acetic acid, d6-propionic acid, and d7-butyric acid, 4 g/l each, Sigma-Aldrich) was added. After homogenization, precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (10 min, 13,000<italic>×g</italic>). After transferring the supernatant to a fresh tube, NaOH (0.8 M, 5 μl) was added, followed by evaporation of solvents via vacuum centrifugation. After adding EtOH (50 μl) and succinic acid (10 μl, 0.6 M), samples were analyzed by GC-MS (TRACE 1310 gas chromatograph/ISQ 7000 mass selective detector; ThermoFisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) equipped with a Nukol Fused Silica Capillary Column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm film thickness) (Supelco/Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The injector, GC-MS transfer line, and ion source temperature were set to 200°C, 200°C, and 250°C, respectively. The flow rate of helium carrier gas initially started at 1.3 ml/min, was kept there for 0.2 min before dropping to 1.1 ml/min at a rate of 1 ml/min. Until minute 6.2, the flow rate was kept constant at 1.1 ml/min and was then ramped to 2.6 ml/min at a rate of 1 ml/min where it was kept for 5.1 min. Samples (1 μl) were introduced by splitless injection. The initial column temperature was set to 55°C and held for 1 min, followed by a ramp-up to 105°C at a rate of 11°C/min where it was held for 3 min. Finally, the column temperature was increased to 190°C at a rate of 30°C/min and kept at this temperature for 4 min. Total runtime was 16 min. The ionization was carried out in the electron impact mode at 70 eV. The analytes were quantified in the timed selected ion monitoring mode using the target ion and verified by confirmative ions. The instrument was operated, data were acquired, and analyzed using Chromeleon software. Quantification of SCFA was achieved by comparing internal standard normalized peak areas of analytes to the respective normalized peak areas from external calibration curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neutrophil isolation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed by decapitation.

The authors found that DMF treatment led to reduced EAE clinical scores if mice were on a High Fiber diet (HFb) but not a diet with increased lauric acid (LA). Building on their prior observations that DMF acts via HCA2 on neutrophils, the authors found that the benefit of DMF treatment depended on neutrophil HCA2 expression. These findings will be valuable to the field of neuroimmunology.</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript include addressing complex interactions of DMF and diet, as well as the solid lipidomics and microbiota studies. The authors also nicely show that the diet does not alter MMF levels in vivo. The weaknesses of the manuscript include a lack of detailed immune cell analysis in EAE and small effect sizes on EAE scores in some figures.</p><p>1. Some of the EAE clinical scores are of small effect sizes that make clear interpretations difficult by examining EAE scores alone. For example, the treatment effect of DMF in NCD mice in Figure 1 appears much smaller than in the prior report (Chen et al., J Clin Invest 2014). The EAE scores in vehicle treated Hca2-/- mice in Figure 3a are lower than in WT and make it difficult to determine if there was any benefit from DMF in these mice. In Figure 6, the clinical scores and area under the curve measures look similar in both DMF treated groups. It may be helpful to expand on the point that other targets of DMF on additional cell types other than neutrophils have been previously described, such as in Linker et al., Brain 2011 and Kornberg et al., Science 2018.</p><p>2. Figure 5C shows MMF increases calcium flux in Hca2FL/FL control mice but there is no conditional knockout control. This should be included to show that MMF targets neutrophils in a HCA2-dependent manner.</p><p>3. Analysis of immunologic markers of interest in EAE are often performed on cells from the spleen, draining lymph node, or CNS tissue instead of blood. If neutrophils are the dominant HCA2-mRFP expressing cells in any of these tissues, it would help solidify that neutrophils are main cell type responsible for this effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, authors hypothesize that the variable response of MS patients to the drug DMF may be due to a diet effect. They show that mice subjected to EAE did not benefit from DMF treatment when fed a lauric acid-rich diet. On the other hand, mice on normal chow diet and on high-fiber (HFb) diet showed the expected protective DMF effect. DMF lacked efficacy in the LA diet-fed group despite similar resorption and preserved effects on plasma lipids. The effect observed in mice fed with the permissive HFb diet was abrogated when the hydroxycarboxylic receptor 2 (HCA2) was deleted. Furthermore, deletion of Hca2 in neutrophils was sufficient to neutralize DMF protective effects in EAE. In summary, authors showed that DMF required HCA2 on neutrophils as well as permissive dietary effects for its therapeutic action.</p><p>This is a well-organized and written manuscript, and data is presented in a clear and logical manner. Experiments are rigorously controlled, and well described. On the other hand, I have some comments and suggestions on the manuscript itself, and some concerns about the generalizability of these findings to humans.</p><p>– Use of DMT in MS vary by country. Suggest moderating the statement that DMF is the most used therapy as this may not be extensible to all places.</p><p>– EAE is typically scored using &quot;EAE score&quot; or &quot;clinical score&quot; (I've never seen it called neuro score) and it is graded in a scale of 1-5. Please adjust the Y axis to represent the entire range, so that readers can appreciate the severity. Also, the lines representing SEM are barely visible.</p><p>– Lipidomic profiles between DMF-treated and vehicle mice are more different for LAD than for HfbD. This finding seems unsupportive of the hypothesis that the effectiveness of DMF is mediated by HfbD</p><p>– Authors mention neuroprotection and neurological deficit (pages 6 and 7) although there is no evidence of that. EAE is largely an immune mediated process, and the lack of clinical activity does not imply neuroprotection, but rather failure of activated T cells to cause damage in the CNS.</p><p>– The sentence &quot;these findings provide evidence that HCA2 mediates DMF function&quot; is misleading, since, as authors acknowledge, this had been already reported.</p><p>– If HCA2 is required for DMF function (as shown in the null mice) and HCA is primarily expressed by neutrophils, the conclusion that &quot;HCA2 stimulation in neutrophils is required for DMF therapeutic effects&quot; (page 8) seems rather obvious.</p><p>– The effect of diet on neutrophils' transcriptome is interesting, but likely other cells would be impacted by diet too.</p><p>Authors describe these findings as a potential mechanism of variable therapeutic effect of DMF in humans. However, given that the data presented is exclusively in experimental models, that conclusion seems a too optimistic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98970.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 5C shows MMF increases calcium flux in Hca2FL/FL control mice but there is no conditional knockout control.

Microglia, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived macrophages expressed <italic>Hca2-mRFP</italic>. The standardized RFP signal as a measure of <italic>Hca2</italic> expression per cell was not affected by diet or DMF treatment in the brain as in the blood, with the exception of microglia which contained a higher <italic>Hca2-mRFP</italic> signal in the DMF-treated mice on HFb diet than on LA diet. The data confirm that in addition to neutrophils microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages express <italic>Hca2</italic>. Whether they contribute to the effects of DMF in EAE needs to be tested in future experiments. So far, our experiments show a role for HCA<sub>2</sub> in neutrophils. The new data have been added to the revised manuscript as Figure 6 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, authors hypothesize that the variable response of MS patients to the drug DMF may be due to a diet effect. They show that mice subjected to EAE did not benefit from DMF treatment when fed a lauric acid-rich diet. On the other hand, mice on normal chow diet and on high-fiber (HFb) diet showed the expected protective DMF effect. DMF lacked efficacy in the LA diet-fed group despite similar resorption and preserved effects on plasma lipids. The effect observed in mice fed with the permissive HFb diet was abrogated when the hydroxycarboxylic receptor 2 (HCA2) was deleted. Furthermore, deletion of Hca2 in neutrophils was sufficient to neutralize DMF protective effects in EAE. In summary, authors showed that DMF required HCA2 on neutrophils as well as permissive dietary effects for its therapeutic action.</p><p>This is a well-organized and written manuscript, and data is presented in a clear and logical manner. Experiments are rigorously controlled, and well described. On the other hand, I have some comments and suggestions on the manuscript itself, and some concerns about the generalizability of these findings to humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive evaluation and have addressed the reviewer’s concerns as outlined below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Use of DMT in MS vary by country. Suggest moderating the statement that DMF is the most used therapy as this may not be extensible to all places.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have changed the statement as follows: “One of the most commonly prescribed drugs is dimethyl fumarate (DMF)” (page 3, line 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– EAE is typically scored using &quot;EAE score&quot; or &quot;clinical score&quot; (I've never seen it called neuro score) and it is graded in a scale of 1-5. Please adjust the Y axis to represent the entire range, so that readers can appreciate the severity. Also, the lines representing SEM are barely visible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and have exchanged the term “neuroscore” to “clinical score”. Due to animal welfare rules, we have to euthanize animals with a clinical score above 3.5 and used an immunization protocol that did not induce higher scores than 3. Therefore, we limited the range of the scale to 0 – 3.0. This point has been clarified in the revised manuscript (page 16, lines 4-6). As suggested by the reviewer, we have increased the thickness of the line representing SEM in Figures 1, 5 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lipidomic profiles between DMF-treated and vehicle mice are more different for LAD than for HfbD. This finding seems unsupportive of the hypothesis that the effectiveness of DMF is mediated by HfbD</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Indeed, DMF had a more pronounced effect on lipid profiles when mice were fed an LA than an HFb diet. The lipid-lowering action of DMF that it shares with the other clinically used HCA<sub>2</sub> agonist, nicotinic acid, became most pronounced with a lipid-rich diet that induced some form of hyperlipidemia. However, the immune effect of DMF in EAE was independent of the lipid-lowering effect, although both effects are mediated by HCA<sub>2</sub>. Even when DMF did not have marked effects on the lipid profile, it protected against EAE in mice fed a HFb diet, indicating that the lipid-lowering effects are not responsible for the protection in EAE. In addition, this observation supports the drug monitoring data showing that the absorption of DMF was intact on LA diet. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have improved the discussion of this issue in the manuscript (page 6, lines 21-24).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors mention neuroprotection and neurological deficit (pages 6 and 7) although there is no evidence of that. EAE is largely an immune mediated process, and the lack of clinical activity does not imply neuroprotection, but rather failure of activated T cells to cause damage in the CNS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and have exchanged the term “neuroprotection” (page 6, line, 14; page 8, line 26).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The sentence &quot;these findings provide evidence that HCA2 mediates DMF function&quot; is misleading, since, as authors acknowledge, this had been already reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. We have revised the sentence to “These findings confirm that HCAR2 mediates the DMF action, also on HFb diet” (page 9, line 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If HCA2 is required for DMF function (as shown in the null mice) and HCA is primarily expressed by neutrophils, the conclusion that &quot;HCA2 stimulation in neutrophils is required for DMF therapeutic effects&quot; (page 8) seems rather obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this comment. We understand the point and have reworded the sentence to “Interestingly, this effect was lost in <italic>Hcar2<sup>nKO</sup></italic> mice (Figure 8A, B), demonstrating that HCAR2 stimulation of neutrophils is required for DMF therapeutic effects” (page 10, line 14). While neutrophils show the highest expression of HCA<sub>2</sub>, the receptor is also present in monocytes and microglia. Therefore, the experiment was necessary to prove the involvement of HCAR2 in neutrophils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The effect of diet on neutrophils' transcriptome is interesting, but likely other cells would be impacted by diet too.</p></disp-quote><p>As the current manuscript focusses on neutrophils, we limited the transcriptome study to this cell type. Although we agree with the reviewer that other cells could also be affected, we prefer to refrain from speculating about this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors describe these findings as a potential mechanism of variable therapeutic effect of DMF in humans. However, given that the data presented is exclusively in experimental models, that conclusion seems a too optimistic.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this caveat and have added it as a final sentence (page 14, line 7).</p></body></sub-article></article>
