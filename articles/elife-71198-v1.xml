Conflicting models have been proposed regarding the mechanisms of SV endocytosis, most notably clathrin/adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2)-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent ultrafast endocytosis. Partitioning between these pathways has been suggested to be controlled by temperature and stimulus paradigm. We report on the comprehensive survey of six major SV proteins to show that SV endocytosis in mouse hippocampal neurons at physiological temperature occurs independent of clathrin while the endocytic retrieval of a subset of SV proteins including the vesicular transporters for glutamate and GABA depend on sorting by the clathrin adaptor AP-2. Our findings highlight a clathrin-independent role of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the endocytic retrieval of select SV cargos from the presynaptic cell surface and suggest a revised model for the endocytosis of SV membranes at mammalian central synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>AP-2</kwd><kwd>pHluorin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (19H03330)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takamori</surname><given-names>Shigeo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core-to-Core Program A.

Following exocytosis, SVs are locally reformed via compensatory endocytic retrieval of membrane and its protein constituents (i.e., SV proteins) from the cell surface in order to keep the presynaptic surface area constant and to ensure sustained neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>).

Subsequent studies in neurons and in nonneuronal models showed that CME occurs on a timescale of many seconds and crucially depends on clathrin and its essential adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitsunari et al., 2005</xref>), a heterotetramer comprising α, β2, μ2, and σ2 subunits, as well as a plethora of endocytic accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Südhof, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>). These and other works led to the view that SVs are primarily, if not exclusively, recycled by clathrin/AP-2-dependent CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Granseth et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies using high-pressure freezing EM paired with optogenetic stimulation have unraveled a clathrin-independent mechanism of SV endocytosis (CIE) in response to single action potential (AP) stimuli that selectively operates at physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). This ultrafast endocytosis (UFE) pathway is distinct from kiss-and-run or kiss-and-stay exoendocytosis observed in neuroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alés et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shin et al., 2018</xref>), operates on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, and results in the generation of endosome-like vacuoles (ELVs) from which SVs can reform via clathrin-mediated budding processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). Temperature-sensitive, clathrin-independent SV endocytosis has also been observed by presynaptic capacitance recordings at cerebellar mossy fiber boutons and by optical imaging at small hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>) and is compatible with the accumulation of postendocytic presynaptic vacuoles upon acute or sustained genetic perturbation of clathrin at stimulated fly neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasprowicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasprowicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>) and at mammalian central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imig et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that SV endocytosis under physiological conditions is primarily mediated by CIE (e.g., UFE), while the function of clathrin and clathrin adaptors such as AP-2 is limited to the reformation of functional SVs from internal ELVs rather than acting at the plasma membrane proper.</p><p>While this model can provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed speed of SV endocytosis, the key question of how SV proteins are sorted to preserve the compositional integrity of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>) remains unresolved. Four points pertaining to this question are to be considered. First, optical imaging-based acid quench experiments in hippocampal neurons indicate that the capacity of UFE is limited to single or few APs, while the majority of SV proteins appear to be internalized on a timescale of several seconds following AP train stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Ryan, 2009</xref>), that is a timescale compatible with either CME or CIE. Second, as high-pressure freezing EM experiments have not been able to reveal the fate and time course of endocytosis of SV proteins, it is formally possible that UFE proceeds under conditions of clathrin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>), while SV proteins remain stranded on the neuronal surface. Third, mutational inactivation of the binding motifs for the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the vesicular transporters for glutamate (VGLUT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (VGAT) severely compromises the speed and efficacy of their endocytic retrieval at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foss et al., 2013</xref>), arguing that at least under these conditions (e.g., low temperature when UFE is blocked) these SV proteins may be retrieved from the cell surface via clathrin/AP-2. Finally, genetic inactivation of clathrin/AP-2-associated endocytic adaptors for the sorting of specific SV proteins, for example Stonin 2, an adaptor for the SV calcium sensor Synaptotagmin, or AP180, an adaptor for Synaptobrevin/VAMP2, causes the accumulation of their respective SV cargos at the neuronal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cousin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaempf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori and Takamori, 2017</xref>). These data could be interpreted to indicate that at least some SV proteins are endocytosed via CME, whereas others may use CIE mechanisms such as UFE. However, such a model bears the problem of how CME and CIE pathways are coordinated and how membrane homeostasis is then maintained.</p><p>To solve the question how SV protein sorting is accomplished and how this relates to CME- <italic>vs</italic> CIE-based mechanisms for SV endocytosis, we have conducted a comprehensive survey of six major SV proteins in primary hippocampal neurons depleted of clathrin or conditionally lacking AP-2. We show that clathrin is dispensable for the endocytosis of all SV proteins at physiological temperature independent of the stimulation paradigm. In contrast, endocytic retrieval of a subset of SV proteins including VGLUT1 and VGAT depends on sorting by AP-2. Our findings highlight a clathrin-independent function of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the endocytic retrieval of select SV cargos from the presynaptic plasma membrane and suggest a revised model for SV endocytosis and recycling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Based on prior works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takei et al., 1996</xref>), three main models for the sorting and endocytic recycling of SV proteins at central mammalian synapses can be envisaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). According to the classical CME-based model of SV endocytosis, SV proteins exocytosed in response to AP trains undergo clathrin/AP-2-mediated sorting and endocytosis from the presynaptic plasma membrane or plasma membrane infoldings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takei et al., 1996</xref>) akin to CME in receptor-mediated endocytosis in nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>). This model predicts that loss of either clathrin or its essential adaptor AP-2 delays the endocytic retrieval of all major SV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A second model supported by elegant high-pressure freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>), electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>), and optical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>) experiments suggests that exocytosed SV proteins are internalized via clathrin- and AP-2-independent bulk endocytosis. In this model, SV protein sorting occurs from internal ELVs that are formed downstream of the endocytic internalization step. Hence, at physiological temperature the endocytic retrieval of all major SV proteins would proceed unperturbed in the absence of either clathrin or AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, it is conceivable that exocytosed SV proteins present on the neuronal surface are sorted by dedicated endocytic adaptors, for example the AP-2 complex, to facilitate their clathrin-independent internalization via CIE. Clathrin, possibly in conjunction with AP-2 and other adaptors then operates downstream of CIE to reform functional SVs from ELVs. In this case, loss of clathrin or AP-2 is predicted to result in distinct phenotypes: While endocytosis of SV proteins is unperturbed upon depletion of clathrin, loss of AP-2 would be expected to selectively affect the rate and efficacy of endocytosis of distinct SV cargos recognized by AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Possible roles of clathrin and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) in synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis and SV cargo retrieval.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model predicting that SV retrieval following neurotransmitter release is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) where AP-2 functions as bridge between SV cargos and clathrin to form clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at plasma membrane.

To analyze whether the observed kinetic delay in the endocytosis of dileucine mutant VGLUT1 and VGAT variants was caused by loss of their ability to associate with AP-2, we monitored their retrieval in AP-2μ KO neurons. Strikingly, loss of AP-2 not only phenocopied the effect of mutational inactivation of the dileucine motifs in VGLUT1 or VGAT but combined mutational inactivation of the dileucine motifs in VGLUT1 or VGAT and AP-2μ KO did not result in additive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–G</xref>).</p><p>These data show that AP-2 directly recognizes surface-stranded VGLUT1 and VGAT via acidic cluster dileucine motifs contained in their cytoplasmic domains to facilitate their endocytic retrieval from the plasma membrane via CIE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings based on lentiviral depletion of clathrin and conditional KO of AP-2 in hippocampal neurons reveal a crucial clathrin-independent function of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 in the endocytic sorting of a subset of SV proteins at central synapses. Several lines of evidence support this view: First, comprehensive survey of the endocytic retrieval of six major SV proteins by optical imaging conducted in two independent laboratories provides strong support for the emerging notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>) that SV endocytosis occurs independent of clathrin, corroborating the prevalence of CIE at physiological temperature. Second and most surprisingly, we find that the endocytic retrieval of a subset of these SV proteins including VGLUT1 and VGAT from the presynaptic plasma membrane depends on sorting by the clathrin adaptor AP-2. This conclusion from SEP- and CypHer5E-based imaging and acid quenching experiments of exogenously expressed or endogenous SV proteins is further corroborated by the observation that a fraction of endogenous VGLUT1 and VGAT molecules remain stranded on the presynaptic plasma membrane of AP-2μ KO neurons, a phenotype that is rescued upon silencing of neuronal activity. Impaired endocytosis of VGLUT1 in the absence of AP-2 may indirectly also impact on the kinetics of Synaptophysin and Synaptobrevin/VAMP2 retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>), consistent with the proposed function of VGLUT1 as a master orchestrator of the retrieval of a subset of SV proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). However, other possibilities such as a direct or indirect association of Synaptophysin and/or Synaptobrevin/VAMP2 with AP-2, cannot be ruled out. Finally, we show that AP-2-mediated efficient sorting of VGLUT1 and VGAT during CIE is achieved by the recognition of acidic cluster dileucine motifs by AP-2, in agreement with earlier biochemical and cell biological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Our data thus underscore the importance of AP-2-mediated sorting of select SV cargo during CIE, in the absence of which the compositional integrity of SVs becomes perturbed. This mechanism may also be of pathological relevance in humans. For example, defective endocytosis of VGAT and resulting defects in inhibitory neurotransmission may underlie developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by a pathogenic loss-of-function variant of AP-2μ in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helbig et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our findings are most consistent with and support a mechanism of SV recycling in which dedicated endocytic adaptors such as AP-2 and others (e.g., AP180, Stonin 2) operate at the presynaptic cell surface where they recognize and recruit SV proteins to sites of CIE. How AP-2 is targeted to presynaptic endocytic sites is unclear, but likely involves coincident detection of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a lipid selectively enriched at the plasma membrane, and cargo proteins (e.g., VGLUT1 or VGAT), possibly in conjunction with other endocytic factors. Clathrin assembly only occurs once endocytic vesicles have pinched off from the plasma membrane, that is downstream of CIE, to reform functional SVs by budding from internal ELVs. This process of SV reformation depends on AP-2 and other clathrin-associated endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Such an integrated model, in which AP-2 acts at two sites, endocytic sites on the presynaptic surface and on internal ELVs together with clathrin, not only explains previous observations pertaining to the speed of SV endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delvendahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) and the apparent lack of effect of clathrin loss on SV membrane internalization in various models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasprowicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>), but is also consistent with the slow kinetics of clathrin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>) and the accumulation of SV proteins on the neuronal surface in the absence of dedicated endocytic adaptors for SV proteins, for example Stonin 2, AP180/CALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cousin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaempf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori and Takamori, 2017</xref>), and AP-2 (this study). We speculate that the mechanism identified here also operates during UFE. Interestingly, recent quantitative proteomic analysis of rodent brain has revealed AP-2 but not clathrin to be highly enriched on SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taoufiq et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that AP-2 may interact with SV cargos prior to the <italic>bona fide</italic> endocytic process. This perpetual interaction of AP-2 with SV cargos might thus enable rapid sorting and endocytic internalization, that is during UFE or other forms of CIE. Of note, our findings are also consistent with recent data regarding a calcium-independent form of SV endocytosis that appears to operate independent of clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orlando et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An important question raised by our work is how AP-2-independent SV cargos such as Synaptotagmin 1 and SV2 are endocytically retrieved from the neuronal surface. While endocytic adaptors for SV2 have not been reported, studies in mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and in invertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stimson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Phillips et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung et al., 2007</xref>) have identified cargo-selective roles of Stonin 2 and the related SGIP1 protein in the endocytic retrieval of Synaptotagmin 1 from the presynaptic cell surface. Enigmatically however, it was shown that while loss of Stonin 2 causes the partial accumulation of Synaptotagmin 1 at plasma membrane sites near the AZ, the kinetics of SV endocytosis appeared to be even accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaempf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>). One possibility therefore is that Synaptotagmin 1 due to its comparably large presynaptic surface fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2015</xref>) does not require active endocytic sorting. Instead, it may reach sites of endocytosis either by lateral diffusion or via confinement near sites of exocytic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willig et al., 2006</xref>). SV2 could follow Synaptotagmin 1 via a piggy-back mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haucke and De Camilli, 1999</xref>), consistent with the finding that both proteins can form a stable complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaempf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lazzell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schivell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). A confinement-based mechanism may also support the endocytic retrieval of other SV proteins in the absence of their specific sorting adaptors (e.g., VGLUT1 or VGAT endocytosis in AP-2µ KO neurons). Future studies are needed to address this possibility in more detail.</p><p>From a more general perspective our findings dissent from the widely held view that AP-2 obligatorily associates with clathrin to execute its cell physiological functions, at least in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. While the most well-known function of AP-2 is its involvement in CME in mammalian cells and tissues, studies in higher fungi have uncovered a clathrin-independent role of fungal AP-2 in the polar localization of the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martzoukou et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, in this system AP-2 is seen to colocalize with endocytic markers and the actin-associated protein AbpA, but not with clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martzoukou et al., 2017</xref>). Because AP-2 also colocalizes with a fungal homolog of Synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martzoukou et al., 2017</xref>), and clathrin-independent SV endocytosis at hippocampal synapses depends on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>), our newly observed function of AP-2 might reflect an unexpectedly widely conserved endocytic mechanism. Conversely, studies in AP-2 KO cells have revealed AP-2-independent forms of CME in mammals that impact on receptor sorting and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pascolutti et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together our findings together with other studies suggest an unexpected plasticity of endocytic mechanisms in eukaryotes including the mammalian CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ICR wild type</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SLC Japan</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:5462094">MGI:5462094</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6N wild type</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leibniz Research Institute for Molecular Pharmacology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:5651595">MGI:5651595</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ap2m1<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> × inducible CAG-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Haucke Lab <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SEP-tagged VGLUT1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Takamori Lab <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SEP-tagged Syp</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L.

For experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, primary hippocampal neurons seeded on coverslips were fixed for 13 min with 4% PFA in PBS solution on ice and washed three times with PBS. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in blocking solution (PBS, 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 hr. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were incubated for 1 hr with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, followed by three washes in PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Immu-Mount (Thermo Fisher) with 1.5 mg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) to stain nuclei and were visualized routinely using the Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope LSM710.</p><p>To distinguish between surface and internal SV protein pool, hippocampal neurons (DIV13–15) were gently washed once using osmolarity-adjusted HBS (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) prior to live labeling surface-localized VGAT, Syt1, or VGLUT1 with specific antibodies against their luminal/extracellular regions (VGAT Oyster 488: SySy, #131103C2 or VGAT Oyster 568, SySy, #131103C3; Synaptotagmin 1: SySy, #105102; VGLUT1: SySy, #135304) for 20 min at 4°C. After washing twice, cells were fixed for 5 min at RT in 4% PFA and washed again three times for 3 min. Without permeabilization, neurons were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (except for VGAT which was previously incubated with an Oyster-labeled antibodies) for 45 min at RT, to visualize the surface pool of the corresponding SV protein. For labeling the internal population of those SV proteins in the same experiment, neurons were permeabilized for 10 min using 0.1% Triton X-100 and subsequently coverslips were incubated for 1 hr at RT with primary antibodies recognizing the cytosolic side of Synaptotamin 1 (SySy, #105011), VGAT (SySy, #131013), and VGLUT1 (SySy, #135304); and stained with Alexa Fluor 647 or 568 for 45 min at RT revealing the internal fraction of the SV protein pool. After four final washing steps of 3 min, the coverslips were mounted in Immu-Mount with DAPI to stain nuclei. Samples were visualized using the Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope LSM710 using a ×63 oil objective. All acquisition settings were set equally for all groups within each experiment. Surface and internal fluorescent intensities were individually quantified using ImageJ and the ratio between such surface and internal signals was calculated for WT and KO conditions.</p><p>For quantifying the levels of presynaptic proteins (VGAT, VGLUT1, and Syt1) in axons, Synapsin staining signals (SySy, #106004 or #106011) were used as a mask to restrict the quantified are to the shape of synapsin-positive boutons by applying thresholding using ImageJ. Values were normalized to WT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Transferrin uptake</title><p>Primary neurons expressing lentivirally delivered CHC-targeting shRNA or a scramble version (DIV14) were starved for 1 hr in osmolarity-adjusted NBA medium (Gibco) at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and treated with 25 μg/ml transferrin coupled to Alexa Fluor 647 (Tf-647, Life technologies) in NBA medium for 20 min at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To remove unbound Tf-647, neurons were washed twice with cold PBS, followed by 1 min of acid-wash at pH 5.3 (cold 0.1 M acetic acid supplemented with 0.2 M NaCl) to quench surface bound Tf-647 and finally twice with cold PBS prior to 30 min fixation at RT with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 4% sucrose in PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Immu-Mount with DAPI to stain nuclei and were visualized routinely using the Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope LSM710 and fluorescence intensities per cell were quantified using ImageJ. First, a threshold was set to extract the punctate signal from cytosolic background and Tf-647 fluorescence intensities were then normalized to the corrected total blue channel fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>GST-fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 cells overnight at 25°C after induction at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4–0.7 with 1 mM isopropyl β-<sc>D</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside.

For comparisons between two experimental groups, statistical significance was analyzed by two-sample, two-sided unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests. For comparisons between more than two experimental groups, statistical significance was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc test such as the Tukey post hoc test (see figure legends). One-sample, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for comparisons with control group values that had been set to one for normalization purposes and therefore did not fulfil the requirement of two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests or one-way ANOVA concerning the homogeneity of variances. GraphPad Prism v.8 software was used for statistical analysis. The level of significance is indicated in the figures by asterisks (*p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001) and provided in the figure legends as exact p values as obtained by the indicated statistic test. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes as sample sizes were not chosen based on a prespecified effect size. Instead, multiple independent experiments were carried out using several sample replicates as detailed in the figure legends. Whenever possible, data were evaluated in a blinded manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the corresponding contacts V.H.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. All of the reviewers were concerned about the extent of clathrin knockdown, so this will be important to address. The reviewers suggest that you carry out acid quenching for the clathrin RNAi and AP2 KO for an AP2-independent and AP2-dependent protein to show that loss of AP-2 affects endocytosis, not subsequent acidification, which it might also do, although it is hard to understand why this would be specific for certain SV proteins. Quenching surface pHluorin in the absence of clathrin as well as AP-2 should also reveal any effects of both on acidification, which presumably follows SV formation--this would provide an additional positive control for the clathrin knockdown. These do not need to be done for all of these proteins.</p><p>2. Please move the transferrin experiment up to Figure 2 as part of a main figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Maybe the authors could speculate more on how AP-2 exerts its function. I am particularly wondering how AP-2 can accumulate the synaptic vesicle proteins in the peri-active zone considering the fact that AP-2 itself undergoes endocytosis. Or in other words, who anchors AP-2? If the authors have any speculative thoughts on this question, it might be worth adding in the discussion.</p><p>Line 24: &quot;unified model&quot;</p><p>This statement could be toned down a bit. Alternatively, it should be made more explicit in the discussion, in which respect the data provide a unified model.</p><p>Line 62: &quot;First&quot;</p><p>Maybe mention explicitly which enumeration is to be expected.</p><p>Line 542: &quot;The fluorescence intensities following the time course of photobleaching were calculated experimentally for every time point of the recording and summed up to the mean fluorescence intensity at time t.&quot;</p><p>This sentence is difficult to understand. What is the meaning of &quot;calculated experimentally&quot; or &quot;summed up to the mean&quot;?</p><p>Line 669: &quot;of normally distributed data&quot;</p><p>The statement is not clear. Were all data normally distributed? Which test of normality was used?</p><p>Line 959: &quot;(F)&quot;</p><p>Change to (H)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A role for AP-2 independent of clathrin would be very interesting but the argument relies entirely on the differential effects of AP-2 and clathrin deficiency, and the inactivation of AP-2 (by lentiviral shRNA and cre-dependent knockout) appears more efficient than knockdown of clathrin. In fact, it is a little unclear how strong the knockdown of clathrin is-apparently to 25% by fluorescence but lower than that by western. The amplification involved in immunofluorescence may account for this discrepancy, and the authors show that loss of clathrin does affect endocytosis at room temperature and the transferrin receptor, providing controls for the knockdown. They also examine a range of stimulus conditions and endogenous as well as transfected reporters, increasing confidence in the results. But it would help to clarify the extent of clathrin knockdown or find a way to eliminate it altogether. This is all the more important because there are several implications that are difficult to understand, and the work does not address.</p><p>First, AP-2 and clathrin form SVs from an endosomal intermediate, presumably reflecting interactions with many SV proteins. So how does AP-2 promote the endocytosis of only the neurotransmitter transporters?</p><p>Second, how does AP-2 promote clathrin-independent endocytosis? Some of the known AP-2 interacting proteins might suggest a mechanism, but positive evidence of a role for machinery operating independent of clathrin would be much more convincing than the absence of a role for clathrin. In addition, some of the data presented here are not new, such as the role of AP-binding sites in endocytosis of the neurotransmitter transporters, and do not add to the accepted view that AP-2 is required for endocytosis, so new information about mechanism would help to understand its role and perhaps selectivity for the transporters, greatly enhancing the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should address the following concerns:</p><p>1. Clathrin. At the outset of this manuscript, appear data indicating that endocytosis of synaptic vesicle proteins is not dependent on clathrin. Even slow processes (operating after 30 seconds) are not clathrin-dependent. This conclusion is followed by data indicating that clathrin adaptors are required. These considerations probably led the authors to include the model in Figure 1, to move the argument away from clathrin to the role of AP-2 as a cargo adaptor. Demonstrating that clathrin is not required is essential for the conclusion that AP-2 is acting independently of clathrin.</p><p>A. RNA interference failure at 37degC. The concern is that RNAi for clathrin heavy chain is not effective at physiological temperatures. The control is to demonstrate that clathrin RNAi is effective at blocking transferrin uptake at physiological temperature. That experiment appears in the Supplement to Figure 5. It would be more forceful as a Supplement to Figure 2.</p><p>B. RNA interference at 22degC. Instead, the control the authors include in the Supplement demonstrates that clathrin is required for endocytosis of synaptophysin and VGLUT1 at room temperature. They later demonstrate that these two synaptic vesicle proteins require AP-2 for endocytosis, further entangling clathrin and endocytosis. Again, one then wonders if the RNAi at 37{degree sign}C is effective. If the authors have data demonstrating that clathrin RNAi slows endocytosis of synaptotagmin or SV2 at 22{degree sign}C, they should include those data. That would demonstrate that no SV proteins require clathrin at 37{degree sign}C but all require clathrin at room temperature. The requirement for AP-2 is what is variable.</p><p>2. Endocytosis vs reacidification. The authors interpret an extended pHluorin signal as a defect in endocytosis, but it may be simply a delay in regeneration of a synaptic vesicle from an endosome-like vacuole. Determining endocytic rates by fluorescence requires rapid quenching. Previously the authors used rapid quenching to demonstrate that 50% of synaptophysin was recovered with a time constant of 700 ms. The issue is important in regard to the AP-2 KO experiments. Is the defect caused by failure to bud synaptic vesicles from the endosome, or is it caused by failure of endocytosis. I recognize that the rapid quenching experiments are not easy; however, it would be useful to demonstrate that rates are similar between synaptophysin and one of the AP-2 dependent synaptic vesicle proteins, and that AP-2 strands the transporters on the surface in their pHluorin assay.</p><p>3. Endocytosis during stimulation. Even quenching assays underestimate endocytosis speeds because endocytosis is taking place during the stimulation train. The total fluorescence added to the surface can be determined by stimulating after an acute application of bafilomycin. The authors methodology should capture endocytosis of the readily retrievable pool as well. Together these experiments would provide the best determination of rates of synaptic protein endocytosis to date. Moreover, they represent an improvement over electrophysiological measures given the decrease in health of patch clamp at 37degC. This experiment is only suggested to determine the real speed of endocytosis, and are not essential for the claims of the paper.</p><p>4. Time constants. The authors previously found that the rate of endocytosis was fit significantly better by a two-time constants. This represents an easier solution to address the two problems described above.</p><p>5. Endocytosis in AP-2 KO. The time constant for initial endocytosis seems rapid even in the absence of AP-2. How are transporters being recovered in the absence of AP-2. It is likely that at least some of this is due to the 20% of AP-2 mu remaining after in these assays. Fitting time constants seems like it can provide insight into this issue as well.</p><p>6. Interdependence of vesicle recruitment. The authors demonstrate that AP-2 knockdown slows acidification of VGLUT1, VGAT, synaptophysin and synaptobrevin. Pan et al. (2015) demonstrated that VGLUT1 influences the retrievals kinetics of other cargos, namely synaptophysin and synaptobrevin. It is possible that AP2 is directly involved in the retrieval of VGLUT1, but that synaptophysin and synaptobrevin retrieval kinetics is mediated by VGLUT1. In the AP2 binding mutant of VGLUT1, is the retrieval of synaptophysin and synaptobrevin slowed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71198.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. All of the reviewers were concerned about the extent of clathrin knockdown, so this will be important to address. The reviewers suggest that you carry out acid quenching for the clathrin RNAi and AP2 KO for an AP2-independent and AP2-dependent protein to show that loss of AP-2 affects endocytosis, not subsequent acidification, which it might also do, although it is hard to understand why this would be specific for certain SV proteins. Quenching surface pHluorin in the absence of clathrin as well as AP-2 should also reveal any effects of both on acidification, which presumably follows SV formation--this would provide an additional positive control for the clathrin knockdown. These do not need to be done for all of these proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tackled the important issue whether the observed delay in the retrieval of pHluorin (SEP)-tagged VGLUT1 in AP-2 KO neurons is caused by reduced endocytosis kinetics rather than delayed vesicle re-acidification in two distinct ways. First, we used an established quench protocol (e.g. Atluri and Ryan, J Neurosci, 2006) in which acidic buffer is applied before and after neuronal stimulation with 200 APs (new Figure 3M-P) to probe the accessibility of exocytosed VGLUT1- or SV2A-SEP to externally added acid. These experiments showed that exocytosed VGLUT1-SEP accumulates on the surface of AP-2 KO neurons (new Figure 3M) as quantitatively evidenced by an increased DF2/ DF1 ratio (new Figure 3N). No difference in the fraction of surface-accumulated SV2A-SEP molecules was observed in AP-2 KO compared to WT neurons (new Figure 3O,P). In a second set of experiments, we have used a previously published assay (Soykan et al., Neuron 2017) that enables measurements of SV endocytosis independent of re-acidification by probing the acquisition of resistance of SEP fluorescence to externally added acid in the presence of the v-ATPase inhibitor folimycin. Using this assay, we report that even 30 s post-stimulation the vast majority of VGLUT1-SEP has not acquired acid resistance, i.e. remains stranded on the neuronal surface (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-F).</p><p>Collectively, these new data show that the apparent delay in VGLUT1-SEP quenching observed in conventional fluorescence recordings shown in Figure 3E,F is due to impaired VGLUT1 endocytosis, not a defect in post-endocytic re-acidification.</p><p>As for clathrin knockdown neurons, we have opted not to conduct additional technically challenging and time-consuming acid quench experiments, since clathrin-depletion by shRNA did not yield any apparent defects in endocytic decay of any of the six SV proteins analyzed in conventional optical recordings. To further address the possible function of clathrin in SV endocytosis, we conducted additional experiments not requested specifically by the referees to validate the effectiveness of clathrin knockdown. In these experiments, we have combined the best possible clathrin knockdown achievable without compromising neuronal viability with small molecule inhibition of clathrin function by Pitstop 2. The rationale is that clathrin molecules remaining after lentiviral knockdown (about 10-20% of control levels) can still suffice to mediate CME of all six SV cargos, and that the remaining clathrin would be functionally silenced further by pharmacological inhibition. We indeed confirm this prediction by demonstrating that CME of transferrin is potently inhibited down to background levels as shown in the new Figure 5J. In spite of the near complete block of CME, we find that endocytosis of endogenous VGAT probed by cypHer-labeled antibodies proceeds with unperturbed kinetics in response to stimulation with either 50 or 200 APs (new Figure 5F-I). These new data together with our observation (shown in Figure 5K,L) that clathrin knockdown effectively reduces the size of the readily releasable and recycling vesicle pools further corroborate our conclusion that the compensatory endocytosis of SV proteins is independent of clathrin at hippocampal synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please move the transferrin experiment up to Figure 2 as part of a main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now have included the transferrin uptake data as new panels A and B in figure 2 of the revised manuscript. As described above, we have conducted new experiments to address the role of clathrin further using combined pharmacological inhibition of clathrin by Pitstop 2 and its effects on transferrin uptake and endocytosis of endogenous VGAT in clathrin knockdown neurons. The new results confirm that clathrin function is effectively blocked by our manipulations, thereby supporting our conclusion that clathrin is dispensable for SV endocytosis at physiological temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Maybe the authors could speculate more on how AP-2 exerts its function. I am particularly wondering how AP-2 can accumulate the synaptic vesicle proteins in the peri-active zone considering the fact that AP-2 itself undergoes endocytosis. Or in other words, who anchors AP-2? If the authors have any speculative thoughts on this question, it might be worth adding in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the mechanism of AP-2 localization at sites of SV endocytosis remains an interesting question for future studies and note that even in non-neuronal cells, plasma membrane recruitment of AP-2 occurs independent of clathrin (Motley et al., J Cell Biol 2003). In the revised discussion on p.15, we now outline possible models for the mechanism of AP-2 recruitment and function. We also explicitly spell out that our data in conjunction with previous experiments (Kononenko et al., Neuron 2014) suggest that AP-2 acts at two distinct locations, endocytic sites on the presynaptic surface and on internal ELVs together with clathrin to reform functional SVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 24: &quot;unified model&quot;</p><p>This statement could be toned down a bit.

In fact, it is a little unclear how strong the knockdown of clathrin is-apparently to 25% by fluorescence but lower than that by western. The amplification involved in immunofluorescence may account for this discrepancy, and the authors show that loss of clathrin does affect endocytosis at room temperature and the transferrin receptor, providing controls for the knockdown. They also examine a range of stimulus conditions and endogenous as well as transfected reporters, increasing confidence in the results. But it would help to clarify the extent of clathrin knockdown or find a way to eliminate it altogether. This is all the more important because there are several implications that are difficult to understand, and the work does not address.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken this crucial point very serious and note that the extent of clathrin knockdown goes to the limits of what can be achieved without severely compromising neuronal viability. To address the issue at stake, we have combined the best possible clathrin knockdown achievable (down to about 10-15% of control levels based on quantitative immunoblotting, Figure 2 – Supplement 1) with small molecule inhibition of clathrin function by Pitstop2. The rationale is that clathrin molecules remaining after lentiviral knockdown (about 10-20% of control levels) are functionally silenced by pharmacological inhibition. We indeed confirm this prediction by demonstrating that CME of transferrin is potently inhibited down to background levels as shown in the new Figure 5J.

These new data further corroborate our conclusion that the endocytosis of SV proteins is independent of clathrin at hippocampal synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, AP-2 and clathrin form SVs from an endosomal intermediate, presumably reflecting interactions with many SV proteins. So how does AP-2 promote the endocytosis of only the neurotransmitter transporters?</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps, our original manuscript has not been clear with respect to the mechanism we envision: We propose that AP-2 (and possibly other endocytic adaptors, e.g. AP180, Stonin 2) operates at the presynaptic cell surface it recognizes and recruit SV proteins such as VGLUT1 and VGAT to sites of endocytosis. The actual endocytic reaction at the neuronal surface can proceed in the absence of clathrin. That said, our earlier data demonstrate that in addition to this activity, AP-2 also operates on internal endosome-like vacuoles (i.e. a distinct location) together with clathrin to reform SVs. This model is now described in more detail on p. 16 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, how does AP-2 promote clathrin-independent endocytosis? Some of the known AP-2 interacting proteins might suggest a mechanism, but positive evidence of a role for machinery operating independent of clathrin would be much more convincing than the absence of a role for clathrin. In addition, some of the data presented here are not new, such as the role of AP-binding sites in endocytosis of the neurotransmitter transporters, and do not add to the accepted view that AP-2 is required for endocytosis, so new information about mechanism would help to understand its role and perhaps selectivity for the transporters, greatly enhancing the impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we now discuss on p.15 possible models for the recruitment of AP-2 to sites of SV endocytosis on the neuronal surface (e.g. via lipids such as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and association with SV cargos such as VGLUT1 and VGAT). We further note that even in non-neuronal cells, plasma membrane recruitment of AP-2 occurs independent of clathrin (Motley et al., J Cell Biol 2003). Hence, our proposal is not inconsistent with previous data.</p><p>We agree that some of our data presented are in agreement with prior studies. The crucial point, however, is that we put these previous findings into context and now provide a molecular explanation for the observed physical association of AP-2 with VGLUT1 and VGAT. We hope that the referee agrees that this represents an important conceptual advance and helps to resolve previous discrepancies in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should address the following concerns:</p><p>1. Clathrin. At the outset of this manuscript, appear data indicating that endocytosis of synaptic vesicle proteins is not dependent on clathrin. Even slow processes (operating after 30 seconds) are not clathrin-dependent. This conclusion is followed by data indicating that clathrin adaptors are required. These considerations probably led the authors to include the model in Figure 1, to move the argument away from clathrin to the role of AP-2 as a cargo adaptor. Demonstrating that clathrin is not required is essential for the conclusion that AP-2 is acting independently of clathrin.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now have included the transferrin uptake data as new panels A and B in Figure 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>To further address the possible function of clathrin in endocytosis of endogenous SV proteins such as VGAT, we have conducted additional experiments not requested specifically by the referees.

RNA interference failure at 37degC. The concern is that RNAi for clathrin heavy chain is not effective at physiological temperatures. The control is to demonstrate that clathrin RNAi is effective at blocking transferrin uptake at physiological temperature. That experiment appears in the Supplement to Figure 5. It would be more forceful as a Supplement to Figure 2.</p><p>B. RNA interference at 22degC. Instead, the control the authors include in the Supplement demonstrates that clathrin is required for endocytosis of synaptophysin and VGLUT1 at room temperature. They later demonstrate that these two synaptic vesicle proteins require AP-2 for endocytosis, further entangling clathrin and endocytosis. Again, one then wonders if the RNAi at 37{degree sign}C is effective. If the authors have data demonstrating that clathrin RNAi slows endocytosis of synaptotagmin or SV2 at 22{degree sign}C, they should include those data. That would demonstrate that no SV proteins require clathrin at 37{degree sign}C but all require clathrin at room temperature. The requirement for AP-2 is what is variable.</p></disp-quote><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding as to how RNAi is achieved in primary hippocampal neurons. In brief, neurons cultured routinely at 37°C at all times are transduced with lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting clathrin heavy chain at DIV2 and analyzed at DIV14. The same neurons expressing a pHluorin tagged SV protein are then optically recorded at either 22°C or 37°C. At this time point, the lentiviral knockdown (which takes about 10 days to take effect!) has already been completed. The concern that RNAi for clathrin is not effective at physiological temperature is thus unwarranted.</p><p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that we indeed show that clathrin knockdown affects CME of transferrin and recycling and readily-releasable vesicle pool sizes, both of which indicate loss of clathrin function at 37°C (new Figure 5J-L, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Endocytosis vs reacidification. The authors interpret an extended pHluorin signal as a defect in endocytosis, but it may be simply a delay in regeneration of a synaptic vesicle from an endosome-like vacuole. Determining endocytic rates by fluorescence requires rapid quenching. Previously the authors used rapid quenching to demonstrate that 50% of synaptophysin was recovered with a time constant of 700 ms. The issue is important in regard to the AP-2 KO experiments. Is the defect caused by failure to bud synaptic vesicles from the endosome, or is it caused by failure of endocytosis. I recognize that the rapid quenching experiments are not easy; however, it would be useful to demonstrate that rates are similar between synaptophysin and one of the AP-2 dependent synaptic vesicle proteins, and that AP-2 strands the transporters on the surface in their pHluorin assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tackled the important issue whether the observed delay in the retrieval of pHluorin (SEP)-tagged VGLUT1 in AP-2 KO neurons is caused by reduced endocytosis kinetics rather than delayed vesicle re-acidification in two distinct ways.

Endocytosis during stimulation. Even quenching assays underestimate endocytosis speeds because endocytosis is taking place during the stimulation train. The total fluorescence added to the surface can be determined by stimulating after an acute application of bafilomycin. The authors methodology should capture endocytosis of the readily retrievable pool as well. Together these experiments would provide the best determination of rates of synaptic protein endocytosis to date. Moreover, they represent an improvement over electrophysiological measures given the decrease in health of patch clamp at 37degC. This experiment is only suggested to determine the real speed of endocytosis, and are not essential for the claims of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that determining the real speed of SV endocytosis using fast perfusion acid-quenching experiment is interesting and was conducted in our earlier 2017 study (Soykan et al., 2017). We hope that the referee agrees that repeating these technically challenging and laborious experiments here goes beyond the scope of the present manuscript. We also note that the focus of our study was to find out whether AP-2 function is limited to SV reformation from internal structures or, whether AP-2, in addition, can sort select SV cargo at the neuronal surface. We believe that our experiments provide strong evidence that this is the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Time constants. The authors previously found that the rate of endocytosis was fit significantly better by a two-time constants. This represents an easier solution to address the two problems described above.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed have previously used double exponentials to fit endocytosis rates determined by rapid acid quenching experiments of neurons stimulated with either 2 or 10 APs (Soykan et al., 2017). Given the caveat that ultrafast endocytosis cannot be detected by conventional pHluorin imaging technology (and likely would be a minor component, at least for 200 AP trains), we prefer to fit the observed fluorescence decays shown in Figures 2-4 and the rise in Figure 5 by single exponential functions. Previous attempts to fit such curves by double exponential functions in our opinion have not resulted in improved fits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Endocytosis in AP-2 KO. The time constant for initial endocytosis seems rapid even in the absence of AP-2. How are transporters being recovered in the absence of AP-2. It is likely that at least some of this is due to the 20% of AP-2 mu remaining after in these assays. Fitting time constants seems like it can provide insight into this issue as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed go to the highest possible efficacy of AP-2m depletion possible without severely compromising neuronal viability. The referee is right that we cannot exclude functional effects of the low number of remaining AP-2 molecules on VGLUT1 or VGAT endocytosis. That said, we kindly refer the referee to our analysis of the apparent rate of endocytosis of endogenous VGAT in Figure 5B-E. From this analysis, it appears that the initial rate of VGAT internalization is slowed quite substantially in the near absence of AP-2.</p><p>We also now discuss on p. 16 of the revised manuscript the possibility that confinement of exocytosed SV proteins including neurotransmitter transporters may account for the endocytic retrieval of SV proteins in the absence of their specific sorting adaptors (e.g. VGLUT1 or VGAT endocytosis in AP-2 KO neurons).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Interdependence of vesicle recruitment. The authors demonstrate that AP-2 knockdown slows acidification of VGLUT1, VGAT, synaptophysin and synaptobrevin. Pan et al. (2015) demonstrated that VGLUT1 influences the retrievals kinetics of other cargos, namely synaptophysin and synaptobrevin. It is possible that AP2 is directly involved in the retrieval of VGLUT1, but that synaptophysin and synaptobrevin retrieval kinetics is mediated by VGLUT1. In the AP2 binding mutant of VGLUT1, is the retrieval of synaptophysin and synaptobrevin slowed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have discussed this possibility on p.15 of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
