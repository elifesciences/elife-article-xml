morphology at each differentiation stage for proper spermatogenesis. The spermatogonia regulates its differentiation state by its own migration. The male germ cells differentiate and mature with the formation of syncytia, failure of forming the appropriate syncytia results in the arrest at the spermatocyte stage. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of male germ cell morphological regulation are unknown. Here, we found that EXOC1, a member of the Exocyst complex, is important for the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia and spermatocyte syncytia in mice. EXOC1 contributes to the pseudopod formation of spermatogonia by inactivating the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 and also functions in the spermatocyte syncytia with the SNARE proteins STX2 and SNAP23. Since EXOC1 is known to bind to several cell morphogenesis factors, this study is expected to be the starting point for the discovery of many morphological regulators of male germ cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>exocyst complex</kwd><kwd>cell morphology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H03566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yagami</surname><given-names>Ken-ichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mizuno</surname><given-names>Seiya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>EXOC1 contributes to the proper differentiation balance of spermatogonial stem cells and spermatocyte syncytia formation by regulating the morphology of male germ cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian testis, sperms are continuously produced in the seminiferous tubules throughout a male’s life. There are two types of cells in the seminiferous tubule, somatic cells (Sertoli cells) which support spermatogenesis and male germ cells which undergo various processes to become spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and eventually spermatozoa. Structurally, the Sertoli cell tight junction (SCTJ) divides the seminiferous tubule into two compartments, the basal compartment and the luminal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukita et al., 2008</xref>). Spermatogonia cells are located in the basal compartment and undergo proliferation and differentiation by mitosis. The cells that have differentiated into spermatocytes migrate to the luminal compartment and differentiate into haploid spermatocytes by meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Braun, 2012</xref>). These spermatocytes then undergo dynamic morphological changes to become mature sperms that are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. As this entire differentiation process is cyclical and continuous, long-term stable spermatogenesis is supported by spermatogonial stem cells.</p><p>Murine spermatogonia are heterogeneous in their differential state and can be classified as undifferentiated and differentiating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fayomi and Orwig, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). During spermatogenesis, germ cells undergo an incomplete cytoplasmic division. In most somatic cell types, daughter cells completely separate from each other, but in germ cells, the final separation is inhibited and they differentiate while maintaining intercellular bridges (ICBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwamori et al., 2010</xref>). Such structures, called syncytia, are thought to contribute to syncytial differentiation and maturation by the sharing of mRNAs and proteins that are halved during meiosis via ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morales et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fawcett et al., 1959</xref>). Undifferentiated spermatogonia are a morphologically heterogeneous population that includes A<sub>single</sub> as isolated cells, A<sub>pair</sub> as two connected syncytia, and A<sub>aligned</sub> as three or more connected cells. Furthermore, a large number of stem cells that contribute to long-term spermatogenesis are included within the GFRα1<sup>+</sup> undifferentiated spermatogonia (mainly A<sub>single</sub> and A<sub>pair</sub>, and fewer A<sub>aligned</sub>), although whether the stem cell compartment comprises of all or only a subset of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> population remains under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lord and Oatley, 2017</xref>). The GFRα1<sup>+</sup> cells produce NGN3<sup>+</sup>/RARγ<sup>+</sup> subset of undifferentiated spermatogonia (composed of more A<sub>aligned</sub>, and fewer A<sub>single</sub> and A<sub>pair</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakagawa et al., 2007</xref>) that differentiate into differentiating spermatogonia (Kit<sup>+</sup>) in response to retinoic acid. These undifferentiated spermatogonia move within the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation by competing for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that are secreted from deferent niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitadate et al., 2019</xref>). Although transplantation studies using in vitro cultured spermatogonial stem cells have reported that Rac1-mediated cell migration is important for spermatogonial stem cell homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takashima et al., 2011</xref>), the molecules that are involved in spermatogonia migration and their mechanisms have not been clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanamori et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>TEX14 is an important molecule for stability of ICBs, which are essential for maintaining the structure of syncytia. This protein localizes to germline ICBs and inhibits the final separation of the cytoplasm; in mice lacking this gene, the cytoplasm of male germ cells is completely separated causing spermatogenesis to be halted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenbaum et al., 2006</xref>). This result indicates that the formation of syncytium is essential for spermatogenesis. Seminolipids, which are sulfated glycolipids, are important for the sustenance of ICB in spermatocytes. This is evident in mice lacking the <italic>Ugt8a</italic> and <italic>Gal3st1</italic>, required for seminolipids synthesis, as they show an aggregation of spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honke et al., 2002</xref>). Although the detailed molecular mechanism is unknown, a similar phenotype was observed in mice lacking the <italic>Stx2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujiwara et al., 2013</xref>), which functions in the transport of seminolipids to the cell membrane. In humans, similar to that of mice, the loss of function of <italic>STX2</italic> results in the failure of spermatogenesis with spermatocyte aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we focus on the exocyst complex, a heterodimeric protein complex composed of eight subunits (EXOC1–EXOC8) that are widely conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koumandou et al., 2007</xref>). Exocyst-mediated vesicle trafficking is crucial for various fundamental cellular phenomena such as cell division, morphogenesis, and cell migration. In cytokinesis, the exocyst is localized to ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neto et al., 2013</xref>) and is required for the transport of factors required for the final separation of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). The exocyst has also been implicated in cell migration via the reconstitution of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although studies using gene-deficient mouse models have shown that the exocyst is important for embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedrich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fogelgren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>), its tissue-specific functions in adults are largely unknown. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> models, the exocyst plays an important role in the formation of both female and male gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giansanti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murthy and Schwarz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2019</xref>). In mice, all exocyst subunits are expressed in male germ cells at each stage of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green et al., 2018</xref>), and although it is predicted that these subunits may be involved in mammalian spermatogenesis, the function of these subunits is completely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we generated and analyzed a mouse model deficient in <italic>Exoc1,</italic> an exocyst subunit expressed in male germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EXOC1 expression in mouse testis</title><p>The expression of <italic>Exoc1</italic> mRNA has been observed in Sertoli cells and the germ cells of mouse testes at each stage: spermatogonia, spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To analyze the expression of EXOC1 at the protein level, we generated two types of genome-edited mice in which the <italic>PA-Tag</italic> sequence was knocked in at the C-terminus of <italic>Exoc1</italic> (<italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-C</sup></italic>) or the N-terminus (<italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N</sup></italic>) using the CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as immunofluorescence using commercially available antibodies for EXOC1 failed to detect any signal. The LG3 sequence, which is a flexible linker, was used as there was no successful case for producing a knock-in (KI) homozygous mutant implying that the functionality of EXOC1 has not been lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). In both strains, mice with the intended KI sequences were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and both heterozygous mutants showed no abnormal phenotypes. We attempted to produce homozygous mutants by intercrossing the hetero KI mutants of each strain. In the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-C</sup></italic> strain, no homozygous mutants were obtained (0/20). By contrast, in the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N</sup></italic> strain, homozygous mutants were obtained (9/27), and no abnormal phenotypes were found in them. Furthermore, progenies were obtained from crosses between <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N</sup></italic> homozygous mutants. As the <italic>Exoc1</italic> knock-out (KO) mice are early embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2015</xref>), this result suggests that the addition of the PA-tag connected to the N-terminus, linked by LG3, does not impair the function of EXOC1. We performed western blot analyses for the PA-tag in the testes of both <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-C</sup></italic> and <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N</sup></italic> adult (10–20-week-old) mice and confirmed a band of the molecular size as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The signal intensity of the band, on the western blot, was lower for <italic>Exoc1<sup>+/PA-N</sup></italic> than that for <italic>Exoc1<sup>+/PA-C</sup></italic>. This intensity difference may be due to differences in their kinetics, structure, subcellular localization, and so on. Since the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N</sup></italic> homozygous mutant, unlike the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-C</sup></italic> homozygous mutant, did not show a pronounced abnormal phenotype, we considered that EXOC1-PA-N is probably more similar in behavior and function to the wild-type EXOC1 than EXOC1-PA-C. In immunofluorescence, EXOC1-PA was also detected in all male germ cells observed in the <italic>Exoc1<sup>+/PA-C</sup></italic> adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while no signal could be detected in the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-N/PA-N</sup></italic> mice using any method. In <italic>Exoc1<sup>+/PA-C</sup></italic> adult mice, PA signals were also detected in Sertoli cells, which are located at the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and whose nucleus are euchromatic with a large nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">França et al., 2016</xref>). These data indicate that EXOC1 protein is expressed in male mouse germ and Sertoli cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Confirmation of EXOC1 expression in testes using the PA-Tag knock-in mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Generation of PA-Tag knock-in mice. In the <italic>Exoc1<sup>PA-C</sup></italic> allele, the LG3-linker connected PA-tag gene fragment was knocked-in just before the stop codon of <italic>Exoc1</italic> using CRISPR-Cas9.

When cell morphology was observed by H and E staining, although almost no spermatids and spermatozoa were observed in the testes of <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice, large multinucleated cells were observed in the lumen of seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). During spermatogenesis, male germ cells form syncytia and are interconnected via stable ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwamori et al., 2010</xref>).

As the observed multinucleated cells appeared to be aggregates of syncytia, they were named ‘AGS’ for the purpose of this study. To confirm the frequency of AGS in the <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO adult mice, H and E-stained sections of the seminiferous tubules were classified into three categories: sections containing neither AGS nor sperm, sections containing AGS, and sections containing sperm but no AGS; and counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). More than 70% of the sections contained AGS, and approximately 20% contained neither AGS nor sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Although less than 10% of the cross-sections contained sperms, these sperms were considered to be derived from spermatogonia that did not undergo Cre-LoxP recombination.

Although the exocyst contributes to pseudopod formation by promoting Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), Arp3 is not expressed in spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lie et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we focused on the Rho family GTPase Rac1, which regulates pseudopod elongation and cell migration by regulating the reconstruction of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004</xref>). The exocyst is required for the transport of SH3BP1, which converts Rac1 from its active to inactive form, and when the exocyst is impaired in cultured human cells, Rac1 is over-activated and pseudopod elongation and cell migration are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, immunofluorescence for active-Rac1 was performed to examine Rac1 activity in GFRα1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia of <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO adult mice, and as expected, the fluorescence intensity of active-Rac1 tended to be stronger for the plasma membrane of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia of <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>).

However, the presence of the next stage of differentiation, spermatocytes, suggests that abnormalities in the spermatogonia are not a direct factor in the failure of spermatogenesis exhibited by the <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice. In contrast, as spermatocytes failed to maintain ICB and aggregated, there were no germ cells observed after spermatid stage. Since chromosome synapsis is suggested to be normal in meiosis, the most significant factor in spermatogenesis failure may be the aggregation of spermatocytes. ICB complex proteins bind to small RNAs, suggesting that ICB may be involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the morphological formation of spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwamori et al., 2020</xref>); in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO spermatocytes, this epigenetic regulation may be responsible for the arrest of spermatogenesis.</p><p>There are three possible reasons for spermatocyte aggregation due to impaired vesicle transport via EXOC1, STX2, and SNAP23. First, the impaired transport of sulfated glycolipids: 90% of the glycolipids in the testes are seminolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishizuka, 1997</xref>), and there are spermatocyte aggregates even in mice lacking the genes required for seminolipid biosynthesis (<italic>Ugt8a</italic> and <italic>Gal3st1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fujimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honke et al., 2002</xref>). As the localization of seminolipids to the plasma membrane is impaired in spermatocytes of <italic>Stx2</italic><sup>repro34</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujiwara et al., 2013</xref>), similarly in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice, impaired seminolipid transport may have caused for the aggregation of the spermatocytes. Second, insufficient membrane addition: cytokinesis requires the expansion of the surface area of the cell with the formation of cleavage furrow. The exocyst localizes to ICB for local membrane addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neto et al., 2013</xref>), and mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which lacks <italic>Exoc8</italic> function, shows little expansion of spermatocyte surface area causing the emergence of a defective cytokinetic ring in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giansanti et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that spermatocyte aggregation in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice is due to an impaired supply of cell membranes to facilitate cytokinesis. Third, the impaired transport of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins that functions in cell separation: in cytokinesis, cells are separated by ESCRT proteins after the cleavage furrow is squeezed by a contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elia et al., 2011</xref>). In cultured human cells, depletion of EXOC3 and EXOC4 impairs the transport of CHMP2B and CHMP4B, subunits of the ESCRT III complex, to ICB and causes multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the exocyst complex is more important for recruitment of the ESCRT III complex to the ICB than for formation of ICB and that disruption of this recruitment in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO spermatocytes may be responsible for the impaired secondary ingression event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2013</xref>) in cytokinesis. On the Mouse Genome Informatics database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>), there are 10 genes encoding the ESCRT III complex subunit, and two of them (<italic>Chmp2b</italic> and <italic>Chmp4c</italic>) KO mice are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>). The function of the other eight genes in spermatogenesis has not been analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coulter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Further research will be needed to test these possibilities.</p><p>Analysis of the differentiation status of spermatogonia showed an increase in GFRα1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia and a decrease in RARγ<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice, suggesting that spermatogonia are biased toward undifferentiated maintenance. In addition, the pseudopod of the GFRα1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia was shorter in the <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice and the fluorescence intensity of active-Rac1 was stronger. The exocyst is required for the transport of SH3BP1, which converts Rac1 from its active to inactive form, and over-activation of Rac1 inhibits cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, EXOC1 may regulate pseudopod elongation and migration in the undifferentiated spermatogonia by inactivating Rac1 via SH3BP1 transport; since there are no reports of <italic>Sh3bp1</italic> KO mice, it will be necessary to investigate whether pseudopod elongation and migration are impaired when <italic>Sh3bp1</italic> is deficient in undifferentiated spermatogonia. In addition, since undifferentiated spermatogonia move within the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules and regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation by competing with each other for FGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitadate et al., 2019</xref>), undifferentiated spermatogonia migration may be important for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The disruption of this balance seen in <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO mice may have been caused secondary to impaired pseudopod elongation of the cells. In other words, undifferentiated spermatogonia, which normally move within the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, replicate themselves near FGFs-producing cells, and differentiate into differentiation-primed spermatogonia by leaving FGFs-producing cells via cell migration. In contrast, <italic>Exoc1</italic> deficiency results in insufficient inactivation of Rac1 in undifferentiated spermatogonia and impaired its pseudopod elongation. As a result, undifferentiated spermatogonia that are restricted by migration may remain physically close to FGFs-producing cells and thus repeatedly self-renew, limiting their differentiation. It is still unclear whether all GFRα1<sup>+</sup> cells are included in the self-renewing spermatogonial stem cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lord and Oatley, 2017</xref>). Moreover, at present, it is unclear whether Exoc1 contributes to the fate determination of all spermatogonial stem cells, and thus, further analysis is required.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Charles River Laboratories Japan</td><td>Stock No: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Crl:CD1(ICR)</td><td>Charles River Laboratories Japan</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Exoc1 flox</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>This is from the <italic>Exoc1<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</sup></italic>.

orchestrated pieces of machinery are required for this process. These morphological changes require a formation of syncytia, and the failure of forming it results in the arrested spermatogenesis and causes male infertility. The authors have conducted a series of well-designed and labor-intensive experiments using genome-edited mouse lines and provided evidence that EXOC1 gene, which encodes a member of the Exocyst complex, is essential for the morphological changes of male germ cells during spermatogenesis. They showed that EXOC1 inactivates the Rho family small GTPase Rac1, and also plays a role in syncytia formation acting together with SNARE proteins.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;EXOC1 regulates cell morphology of spermatogonia and spermatocytes in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Osawa and colleagues highlights interesting and highly desired aspects of spermatogonial physiology and clonal expansion. Specifically, the role of EXOC1, a factor involved in syncytial organization of cells, is explored and many novel aspects are described. The authors have conducted a series of well-designed and labor-intensive experiments using genome-edited mouse lines, and successfully evidenced that germ cell EXOC1 in the testis is essential for their morphological changes during spermatogenesis therein. This manuscript is focused on an understudied and critical pathway in the male germline and would be of interest to the field and of relevance for fertility. However, in its current state, the insight provided by the manuscript is somewhat limited. The authors need to perform a much more detailed characterization of the mouse models generated and revisit the model proposed for exocyst function in the germline. The manuscript is well written and clear but short of mechanistic points. In contrast to the strong genetic studies, however, the referees see some weakness in their biochemical, histological, and physiological studies as indicated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The macroscopic images for HE stained testicular sections should be included otherwise it is difficult to judge the effects of genetic ablation. And the authors should present how efficiently genes are inactivated in these mice.</p><p>2. Line 134 (Figure 1C): Authors are recommended to distinguish germ- and somatic-cells in testis.</p><p>3. The authors only showed representative images. Quantitative data need to be included.</p><p>4. Figure 3A is the only data showing EXOC1, STX2, and SNAP23. The authors should include negative control such as other proteins tagged with HA. More importantly, the authors are strongly recommended to show the interaction in vivo (IP with HA then detect by IB or MS analysis).</p><p>5. Line 301: The authors suggest three possible reasons to explain the phenotype. As shown in the previous study, the author can easily address if lipids accumulate in mutant cells.</p><p>6. Expression pattern of Exoc1 in the germline requires additional analysis. Expression of the PA tagged EXOC1 from knock in mice should be compared to known markers of germ cell and somatic cell populations. Expression in these populations also requires quantification and comparison to seminiferous epithelium stages. Previously published testis single cell RNA-Seq datasets should be analyzed to assess expression of Exoc1 and other exocyst complex proteins during spermatogenesis and in supporting somatic cells. The western blot of Figure 1B requires additional replicates and molecular weights of bands indicated.</p><p>7. Multiple conditional knockout mouse models have been developed for the manuscript. However, the efficiency of gene knockout in germline cells needs to be confirmed for each model. Inefficient gene knockout can affect interpretation of phenotype. For example, the mild phenotype shown by Snap23 knockout model.</p><p>8. The PA tagged EXOC1 model is a novel line generated by CRISPR-based methods for the manuscript. Additional evidence needs to be provided that the genomic sequence is correctly modified and tag sequence in frame etc. Further, why is the LG3 linker region included?</p><p>9. Phenotype of the conditional knockout Exoc1 and Snap23 models are intriguing. However, no quantification is provided for the analyses. How frequently are the multinucleate meiotic spermatocytes observed? What ages of animals are studied? Both prepubertal and adult mice need to be analyzed to account for defects in postnatal germline development. Distinct germ cell populations need to be quantified by use of known markers (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids). How many KIT+ cells were analyzed to check for cell aggregation? How many chromosome spreads of spermatocytes were analyzed for the Exoc1 knockout? Representative images of knockout and control spreads should be provided in the figure.</p><p>10. Based on EM analysis of multinucleate spermatocytes from Exoc1 knockout testis (please provide quantification for this result), the authors suggest that intercellular bridge (ICB) formation in spermatocytes is specifically disrupted. This proposed model for exocyst complex function a little confusing. For formation of an ICB, cytokinesis is initiated at the end of mitosis but recruitment of TEX14 to the midbody blocks abscission and mid-body components remain as components of the ICB. The exocyst complex has a known role in cytokinesis, suggesting that cytokinesis is not initiated in the knockout and multinucleate cells are therefore formed. ICBs are then of course not present but this reflects the role of EXOC1 in the cytokinesis pathway rather than ICB formation per se. The authors should clarify this model.</p><p>11. For IP analysis in figure 3, the reciprocal pull-downs need to be performed. For instance, IP anti-FLAG and anti-Myc tag and test for interactions. Molecular weights for proteins need to be included.</p><p>12. Roles for EXOC1 in pseudopod formation in GFRa1-positive SSCs are suggested (Figure 4). While very interesting, it seems that correctly identifying pseudopods based on GFRa1 membrane staining of sections might be challenging. Particularly as GFRa1 cells can be present as interconnected pairs of cells (and some 4 cell chains), which can disrupt the ability to identify pseudopods of individual cells. The authors should repeat this analysis using wholemount staining of seminiferous tubules and compare the distinct GFRa1-positive cell populations (single, pairs and aligned). This will allow better quantification of cell extensions. Can specific markers of pseudopods be used (even just actin staining etc)? The active-Rac1 staining in panel D also needs to be quantified. Wholemount analysis can also reveal whether EXOC1 plays a role in cytokinesis of spermatogonial populations.</p><p>13. Defects in migration of Exoc1 knockout GFRa1-positive SSCs are suggested to result in SSC accumulation and defects in production of differentiation-primed undifferentiated spermatogonia (Figure 5). Images shown in panel A indicate that clumps of GFRa1-positive cells accumulate, with some cells pushed off the basal layer of the seminiferous tubules. This is highly unusual as all spermatogonia should be adherent to the basement membrane. It seems unlikely that this phenotype is due solely to defects in migration. Additional data should be provided to support this model and exclude other potential defects. For example, can functional data (e.g. in vitro analysis) be provided to confirm issues with SSC migration? Also, as fewer differentiation-primed cells are generated, the numbers of differentiating spermatogonia should be reduced in the knockout. Is this the case?</p><p>14. The manuscript text should be checked carefully for accuracy throughout. For instance, in the introduction, second paragraph, spermatogonia are stated to be divided into undifferentiated, differentiation-primed and differentiated fractions. However, differentiation -primed cells are found within the undifferentiated population as are SSCs. The significance of markers used for different spermatogonial populations (e.g. GFRa1) should be included in the introduction for clarity. The discussion should be modified to account for new datasets and models.</p><p>15. Many datasets are not quantified (see specific points above). Statistics cannot be evaluated as for most experimental settings the basic information (N number, means and coefficient of Variation… ) is not provided.</p><p>16. Additionally, the actual study design is not described. Therefore, the validity of the findings is partially questionable. No Information is provided on the number of mice analyzed. Nature and size of experimental groups and controls are not mentioned. Strategies for histological analysis are poorly described. Did the authors use random systematic sampling approaches on sufficient number of samples? The excellent micrographs must be considered individual observations as generalization of the descriptions would only be valid if repetitions are reported. Similar concerns apply to the blotting results. To check for validity and statistically Sound analysis, the authors need to provide a flow chart or table of all experimental animals and the endpoints analyzed in specific groups.</p><p>17. The mouse models are not as well defined as the authors Claim. Snap23 k/O mice Show germ cell development up to spermatids (Figure 3). Can the authors elaborate more on the presence of multinucleated cells and spermatids at the same time? Was that stable in all animals of this genotype?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;EXOC1 plays an integral role in spermatogonia pseudopod elongation and spermatocyte stable syncytium formation in mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It was originally requested for the authors to assess the efficiency of floxed gene knockout in their models. While they have assessed whether remaining sperm in the Exoc1 conditional KO model are gene deleted, analysis of testis from this and other KO models described has not been performed. A simple qRT-PCR on total testis extracts or isolated testis cells could be used. It is important to define efficiency of gene knockout as the phenotype of some of the models is mild, e.g. Snap23 KO.</p><p>4. A new N-terminally PA tagged Exoc1 model is described in the revision as the C-tagged version clearly disrupts EXOC1 function, which is embryonic lethal. Confusingly, while the homozygous N-tagged mice are viable, indicating that EXOC1 function is retained, the authors could not detect expression of the N-tagged EXOC1 by immunostaining and suggest that it might be unstable. This seems counterintuitive and text should be modified to help resolve and discuss this issue. On a related point, lines 160-163 where rationale for use of the LG3 tag in the fusion construct is described – this should be reworded for clarity.</p><p>5. It is stated that while GFRa1+ spermatogonial pseudopods in the Exoc1 KO are shorter, those of the Stx2 KO are not, suggesting that EXOC1 operates independently of STX2 in this context. However, the pseudopods of Stx2 KO are strongly trending to be shorter and P value is quoted as 0.052.

This proposed model for exocyst complex function a little confusing. For formation of an ICB, cytokinesis is initiated at the end of mitosis but recruitment of TEX14 to the midbody blocks abscission and mid-body components remain as components of the ICB. The exocyst complex has a known role in cytokinesis, suggesting that cytokinesis is not initiated in the knockout and multinucleate cells are therefore formed. ICBs are then of course not present but this reflects the role of EXOC1 in the cytokinesis pathway rather than ICB formation per se. The authors should clarify this model.</p></disp-quote><p>I appreciate your valuable suggestion.

While very interesting, it seems that correctly identifying pseudopods based on GFRa1 membrane staining of sections might be challenging. Particularly as GFRa1 cells can be present as interconnected pairs of cells (and some 4 cell chains), which can disrupt the ability to identify pseudopods of individual cells. The authors should repeat this analysis using wholemount staining of seminiferous tubules and compare the distinct GFRa1-positive cell populations (single, pairs and aligned). This will allow better quantification of cell extensions. Can specific markers of pseudopods be used (even just actin staining etc)?</p></disp-quote><p>I have provided that information in Figure 4 D-G and described it in the main text, Lines 294-305.

Defects in migration of Exoc1 knockout GFRa1-positive SSCs are suggested to result in SSC accumulation and defects in production of differentiation-primed undifferentiated spermatogonia (Figure 5). Images shown in panel A indicate that clumps of GFRa1-positive cells accumulate, with some cells pushed off the basal layer of the seminiferous tubules. This is highly unusual as all spermatogonia should be adherent to the basement membrane. It seems unlikely that this phenotype is due solely to defects in migration. Additional data should be provided to support this model and exclude other potential defects. For example, can functional data (e.g. in vitro analysis) be provided to confirm issues with SSC migration?</p></disp-quote><p>I would like to thank you for your valued remarks. We measured the occurrence of such a multilayered cell population, but it was very low. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>.

For these reasons, we consider that the reason for the appearance of such a multilayered cell population is not that the undifferentiated state is disorganized, but rather that the physical pressure is reduced by the emptying of the lumen of the seminiferous tubule.

It was originally requested for the authors to assess the efficiency of floxed gene knockout in their models. While they have assessed whether remaining sperm in the Exoc1 conditional KO model are gene deleted, analysis of testis from this and other KO models described has not been performed. A simple qRT-PCR on total testis extracts or isolated testis cells could be used. It is important to define efficiency of gene knockout as the phenotype of some of the models is mild, e.g. Snap23 KO.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. This is due to our insufficient preparation, but we do not have live cKO mice, frozen samples, and mRNA stock, so we need more than 6 months to prepare for the experiments you kindly suggested. Although we thought your point was plausible, we believe that this RT-qPCR data is not necessarily needed in this study. The reasons for this are as follows.</p><p>EXOC1 has been shown to be expressed in spermatocytes and later stages of differentiation. These differentiated cells comprise the majority of all cells in the testis. Therefore, the fraction of each cell population that constitutes the testis drastically altered between the <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO and wild-type. In this situation, if RT-qPCR is performed with entire testis, it is not possible to determine whether the difference in <italic>Exoc1</italic> expression between the cKO and wild-type is due to the deletion of the gene or to the alteration in the fraction of the germ cell population. A further complication is that the transcripts are shared among the connected cells that comprise the syncytium. If recombination occurs after A<sub>pair</sub> but not A<sub>single</sub>, there might be a syncytia with a dilute gene dosage of <italic>Exoc1</italic> or <italic>Snap23</italic>. Moreover, although we cannot completely clarify whether it is complete or incomplete, we could well claim that the loss of <italic>Exoc1</italic> leads to abnormal pseudopodia formation of spermatogonia and aggregation of spermatocytes in many cases based on the data that we have presented so far (such as the data on the counting of seminiferous tubules).</p><p>The results of Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2B clearly showed that <italic>Snap23</italic> was involved in the formation or maintenance of spermatocyte syncytia. Since the phenotyping of the <italic>Snap23</italic> cKO was performed under almost the same conditions as that of the <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO (same Cre driver, same age at analysis, almost same floxed distance, and same genetic background), the requirement of <italic>Snap23</italic> for the formation or maintenance of the syncytium may be lower than that of <italic>Exoc1</italic>. However, since we do not have experimental data to deny the possibility that the recombination efficiency of <italic>Exoc1</italic> cKO and <italic>Snap23</italic> cKO may differ, we have revised the text as follows to include both possibilities.</p><p>Line 270-279</p><p>Before the revision:</p><p>“This suggests that <italic>Snap23</italic> is dispensable for spermatogenesis and that another protein in the SNAP family could be compensating for that function.

These issues are very fascinating and intriguing, but we think they are the next challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A new N-terminally PA tagged Exoc1 model is described in the revision as the C-tagged version clearly disrupts EXOC1 function, which is embryonic lethal. Confusingly, while the homozygous N-tagged mice are viable, indicating that EXOC1 function is retained, the authors could not detect expression of the N-tagged EXOC1 by immunostaining and suggest that it might be unstable.

It is stated that while GFRa1+ spermatogonial pseudopods in the Exoc1 KO are shorter, those of the Stx2 KO are not, suggesting that EXOC1 operates independently of STX2 in this context.
