essential regulator in reproductive development and fertility. But there has been emerging evidence of FSHR expression in extragonadal organs. This poses new questions and long-term debates regarding the physiological role of the FSH-FSHR, and underscores the need for reliable, in vivo analysis of FSHR expression in animal models. However, conventional methods have proven insufficient for examining FSHR expression due to several limitations. To address this challenge, we developed Fshr-ZsGreen reporter mice under the control of Fshr endogenous promoter using CRISPR-Cas9. With this novel genetic tool, we provide a reliable readout of Fshr expression at single-cell resolution level in vivo and in real time. Reporter animals were also subjected to additional analyses,to define the accurate expression profile of FSHR in gonadal and extragonadal organs/tissues. Our compelling results not only demonstrated Fshr expression in intragonadal tissues but also, strikingly, unveiled notably increased expression in Leydig cells, osteoblast lineage cells, endothelial cells in vascular structures, and epithelial cells in bronchi of the lung and renal tubes. The genetic decoding of the widespread pattern of Fshr expression highlights its physiological relevance beyond reproduction and fertility, and opens new avenues for therapeutic options for age-related disorders of the bones, lungs, kidneys, and hearts, among other tissues. Exploiting the power of the Fshr knockin reporter animals, this report provides the first comprehensive genetic record of the spatial distribution of FSHR expression, correcting a long-term misconception about Fshr expression and offering prospects for extensive exploration of FSH-FSHR biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FSH</kwd><kwd>FSHR</kwd><kwd>GFP</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>Leydig cells</kwd><kwd>osteoblasts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008549</institution-id><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exploiting the power of the Fshr reporter, the first comprehensive genetic record of the spatial distribution of FSHR expression offers prospects for extensive exploration of FSH-FSHR biology.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), secreted by anterior pituitary gonadotrophs, is recognized as a crucial regulator of male and female gonadal function; indeed, reproductive biology textbooks strongly emphasize its role in normal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simoni et al., 1997</xref>). FSH exerts its effects via a specific receptor, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), which belongs to the highly conserved family of G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrusciel et al., 2019</xref>). Traditional views hold that in females, FSHR is expressed in granulosa cells and controls the maturation of Graafian follicles, granulosa cell proliferation, and estrogen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simoni et al., 1997</xref>), while in males, FSHR is expressed in testicular Sertoli cells and regulates their metabolic functions, which are essential for proper spermatogenesis and germ cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asatiani et al., 2002</xref>). The large FSHR gene is located on chromosome 2p21 and comprises 10 exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minegishi et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that FSHR is also expressed in extragonadal tissues, such as endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilley and Segaloff, 2018</xref>), monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), developing placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stilley et al., 2014</xref>), endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sacchi et al., 2018</xref>), malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papadimitriou et al., 2016</xref>), bone, adipose, and neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhartiya and Patel, 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, blocking the interaction of Fsh with Fshr mitigates some degenerative disorders in mice, such as low bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2006</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and neurocognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). Fshr was reported to be expressed in osteoclasts in vitro, and global Fsh or Fshr knockout resulted in an increase in bone mass by inhibiting bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). Blocking the Fsh-Fshr interaction with either Fsh polyclonal or monoclonal specific antibodies triggered thermogenesis in adipose tissues, significantly reduced body weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and reduced Alzheimer’s symptoms in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Fshr</italic> expression is also found in the vasculature of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stilley et al., 2014</xref>) and is particularly high in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghinea, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the relevance of its extragonadal expression and functions have been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrusciel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar, 2014</xref>). Therefore, precisely defining the localization of <italic>Fshr</italic> expression remains an imperative challenge in FSH-FSHR biology due to the concern of the ‘non-specificity’ of available antibodies used to localize FSHR expression and the ‘quick turnover’ and ‘rapid degradation’ of Fshr transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrusciel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhartiya and Patel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tedjawirja et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, a suitable genetic approach to resolve this issue is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To address this challenge, we can utilize a GFP reporter driven by the endogenous promoter of <italic>Fshr</italic>, which enables the visualization of the expression of low-abundance transcripts in more accurate and context-specific ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chudakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 1996</xref>), when other approaches, e.g., antibodies and RT-PCR, are limited in their ability to detect <italic>Fshr</italic> expression. Therefore, in this study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated technology to create a novel Fshr-ZsGreen reporter mouse model for precisely clarifying <italic>Fshr</italic> expression. We believe that this powerful approach, as a reliable readout of <italic>Fshr</italic> expression at the single-cell level, should allow us to accurately capture <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in real time in a tissue-specific manner. We also used other techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Our results challenge the current understanding of <italic>Fshr</italic> expression and refine that Fshr has a wider expression profile than previously thought. The findings of Fshr in reproductive and nonreproductive tissues/organs will provide significant insights into new roles of Fsh and Fshr in physiology and pathology and have implications for the development of new therapies for reproductive and nonreproductive disorders, particularly metabolic diseases and degenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To precisely define Fshr expression in mice, we utilized several complementary strategies, including <italic>Fshr</italic> endogenous promoter driving ZsGreen knockin reporter mice, immunofluorescence (IF) staining with antibodies against tissue/cell type-specific markers and Fshr, droplet digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR) and single RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-smFISH), to comprehensively examine Fshr expression.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of Fshr-ZsGreen knockin reporter mice</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination was used to generate embryonic stem cell clones, in which a P2A-ZsGreen cassette was precisely inserted before the stop codon of the Fshr gene followed by the 3′ UTR of the <italic>Fshr</italic> allele, as described in the Methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This P2A-ZsGreen expression cassette under the control of endogenous <italic>Fshr</italic> regulatory elements ultimately generates ZsGreen proteins without disrupting <italic>Fshr</italic> expression. The 19 amino acids P2A sequences function to cause ribosomal ‘skipping’ during translation, resulting in a missing peptide bond and effectively separates the two proteins, e.g., Fshr and ZsGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trichas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luke and Ryan, 2018</xref>). The injected zygotes were transferred into oviducts of Kunming pseudopregnant females to generate F0 mice. F0 mice with the expected genotype were confirmed by tail genomic DNA PCR, DNA sequencing, and Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and then mated with C57BL/6J mice to establish F1 heterozygous mice with the germline-transmitted transgene. F1 heterozygous mice were further genotyped by tail genomic PCR, DNA sequencing and Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The results from these tail genomic PCR, DNA sequencing, and Southern blots in both F0 and F1 pups demonstrated that the targeted P2A-ZsGreen cassette was accurately inserted into the designed site between exon 10 and the stop codon of the <italic>Fshr</italic> gene before the 3’ UTR. We maintained heterogeneous Fshr-ZsGreen mice and used homogeneous mice for experiments. These mice were genotyped using primer sets specific to P2A-ZsGreen, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. Fshr and GFP are transcribed in a bicistronic mRNA but subsequently translated into two independent proteins rather than as a fusion protein. This design ensures unaffected Gαi3 transcription and function and simultaneous GFP expression as a reporter protein. All animals were fertile and showed normal behavior and no obvious abnormal phenotypes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Fshr-ZsGreen knockin reporter mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting strategy to generate Fshr-P2A-ZsGreen knockin mice.

The selected results from these databases are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>, which further support our findings of the widespread express pattern of Fshr described as above. In particular, Fshr expression was detected in Leydig cells by scRNA-seq as seen in DISCO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://immunesinglecell.org/genepage/FSHR">https://immunesinglecell.org/genepage/FSHR</ext-link>) and BioGPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2492">http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2492</ext-link>) for human cells.</p><p>Taken together, these data further confirmed Fshr-ZsGreen expression patterns from the Fshr-ZsGreen reporter line, convincingly demonstrating that Fshr is not limited to previously reported cells, tissues, or organs, such as the reproductive system, osteoclasts, adipose, endothelium in tumors, and neurons in the brain, but rather has a wide expression in the cells, tissues, and organs in the body, particularly in the lung, kidney, and heart, as well as Leydig cells in the testis, which has not previously been recognized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although numerous efforts have been made to characterize <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in tissues/cells, defining the locations of <italic>Fshr</italic> expression remains an imperative challenge in Fsh-Fshr biology, primarily because of concerns about the specificity of available antibodies against Fshr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrusciel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tedjawirja et al., 2023</xref>). In this case, we developed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated <italic>Fshr</italic>-ZsGreen knockin reporter mice to address this issue.</p><p>To maintain the integrity of the splicing acceptor, donor, and gene promoter regions, we designed and inserted the ZsGreen (ZsG) reporter into the C-terminus of Fshr by sequence-specific gRNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise genome modification with a long ssDNA template to create the <italic>Fshr</italic>-P2A-ZsG reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2020</xref>). Because of its high turnover of Fshr mRNA and a difficulty in detection of Fshr expression by RT-PCR and northern blotting, in this reporter line, we utilized ZsG as a GFP reporter, as ZsGreen, also called ZsGreen1, is an exceptionally bright green fluorescent protein derived from a <italic>Zoanthus</italic> sp. reef coral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matz et al., 1999</xref>) that has been modified for high solubility, bright emission, and rapid chromophore maturation. ZsGreen is the brightest commercially available green fluorescent protein - up to 4× brighter than EGFP with the half-life of 26 hr - and is ideally suited for whole-cell labeling and promoter-reporter studies to indicate the promoter activity of a gene of interest, which has been used in numerous GFP reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pippin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pippin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Büller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dewas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nazareth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaverina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fougère et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, we also employed a short and conserved picornavirus-derived ‘self-cleaving’ 2A peptide to allow bicistronic expression of Fshr and ZsG, as the 19-amino acid P2A has the highest cleavage efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The cleavage is triggered by ribosomal skipping of the peptide bond between the proline (P) and glycine (G) in C-terminal of P2A peptide, resulting in the peptide located upstream of the 2A peptide to have extra amino acids on its C-terminal end, while the peptide located downstream the 2A peptide will have an extra proline on its N-terminal end. Therefore, P2A can nearly equalize the expression of genes upstream and downstream. As a result, Fshr is normally expressed without interruptions and ZsG expression indicates Fshr promoter activity in the defined cells, demonstrated by the comparison of Fshr expression in the testes and ovaries between Fshr-ZsGreen and B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>The P2A-ZsGreen construct was precisely inserted into the site between the last exon (exon 10) and the stop codon of the Fshr locus, which was confirmed by integration detection PCR, sequencing of PCR fragments, and Southern blotting with Fshr locus-specific enzyme restriction digestions. Successful insertion allows the endogenous promoter of Fshr to drive ZsGreen reporter expression. Because of the site-specific insertion of the P2A ZsG vector to produce Fshr-ZsG reporter, we only used one founder line for characterizing Fshr-ZsG expression, rather than multiple founders when random insertions of a transgene were used previously for generating transgenic mice.</p><p>This approach greatly enhanced our understanding of this critical cellular pathway in several ways. First, employing the native regulatory element responsible for governing the expression of the target gene ensures that the expression pattern of the GFP reporter closely mirrors that of the gene of interest, Fshr, within its natural context. Consequently, this approach provides a more faithful representation of gene expression. Second, endogenous promoters often exhibit specific spatial and temporal expression patterns, driving gene expression in specific cell types or developmental stages. This capability facilitates the capture of the dynamic nature of gene regulation and enables the study of gene expression under diverse physiological conditions. Third, utilizing endogenous promoters minimizes potential perturbations to the native gene regulation machinery. It avoids the need to introduce exogenous elements or artificial constructs, reducing the likelihood of altering the gene’s expression behavior or interfering with its regulatory interactions. Unlike biochemical assays or immunostaining, using a tagged protein under endogenous regulation avoids fixation artifacts and allows detection of the target’s activity in live cells. Therefore, these distinct advantages of enhanced physiological relevance, precise spatiotemporal control, preservation of regulatory elements, and minimal perturbation provide us with a powerful tool to understand Fshr expression in more accurate and context-specific ways compared to other methods, such as using antibodies, northern blotting, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization.</p><p>In this study, we systemically investigated Fshr expression at the single-cell level in this reporter line with confocal fluorescence microscopy and further confirmed the location of Fshr-ZsGreen expression by IF staining, in situ hybridization, and ddRT-PCR. The results from this work demonstrate that as a receptor for Fsh, Fshr is widely expressed in virtually every cell at variable levels in the examined tissues/organs of mice.</p><p>As expected in the examined testis, we noticed Fshr expression in Sertoli cells in the testis and granular cells in the ovary. Surprisingly, we observed that <italic>Fshr</italic> was also more strongly expressed in Leydig cells than in Sertoli cells. This expression was also detected in spermatocytes, spermatids, spermatozoa, and spermatogonia. Although this finding is different from present thoughts that <italic>Fshr</italic> is only present in Sertoli cells but not in other cell types of the testis, our finding is in line with previous works in fishes (including African catfish, zebrafish, teleosts, and Japanese eels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-López et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levavi-Sivan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García-López et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauvigné et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohta et al., 2007</xref>, rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2022</xref>), dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kasimanickam and Kasimanickam, 2015</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonci et al., 2018</xref>) performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization. In humans, <italic>Fshr</italic> was also highly expressed in Leydig cells, although it was taken as non-specificity of the anti-Fshr antibodies. However, as shown in this study, this is not the case, because Fshr is widely expressed, as demonstrated in our work.</p><p>Furthermore, our findings are supported by a report of the failure of normal Leydig cell development resulting from the deficiency of <italic>Fshr</italic> but not Fsh-beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2003</xref>) and scRNA-seq studies in Hu sheep (originated from Mongolian sheep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su et al., 2023</xref>) and in human as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> (DISCO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://immunesinglecell.org/genepage/FSH">https://immunesinglecell.org/genepage/FSH</ext-link>) and BioGPS for human cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2492">http://biogps.org/#goto=genereport&amp;id=2492</ext-link>). Fshr expression in Leydig cells strongly indicates that Fsh-Fshr plays a role in the production of steroids in males. Unexpectedly, Leydig cell line TM3 expresses much lower Fshr, compared to the Leydig cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref>). It may provide an evidence on a reason that these cells do not respond well to FSH treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mather, 1980</xref>), and indicates that this cell line may not be a typical Leydig cell population and new Leydig cell lines should be established in the future.</p><p>In the ovary, <italic>Fshr</italic> is highly expressed in follicles at different stages, from primordial cells, primary follicles, and secondary follicles to mature/Graafian follicles and the corpus luteum. In addition to granulosa cells, Fshr expression was observed in oocytes of follicles. Taken together, these data indicate that Fshr plays an intragonadal role in the ovary and testis beyond the granulosa and Sertoli cells.</p><p>In the skeletal system, we observed <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in vivo not only in osteoclasts, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2012c</xref>), but also, interestingly, in osteoblast lineage cells, such as osteoblasts, bone lining cells, osteocytes, and progenitor cells of the periosteum, as well as in chondrocytes. In previous reports, <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in osteoclasts was detected only by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunostaining in cultures of primary murine precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2012c</xref>). Using the Fshr-ZsGreen reporter line, we visualized <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in multinucleated osteoclasts in frozen sections, clearly demonstrating <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in osteoclasts. Intriguingly, this powerful tool enabled us to examine <italic>Fshr</italic> expression in other cell types in bone. Surprisingly, we observed Fshr expression in cells of the osteoblast lineage, from osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts to osteocytes and bone lining cells. This finding indicates that Fsh may regulate not only osteoclast-mediated bone resorption but also osteoblasts for bone formation. To functionally prove the presence of Fshr in osteoblasts/osteocytes, we also deleted Fshr in osteocytes in an inducible model. The Fshr cKO induced in osteocytes significantly reduce Fshr expression and triggered an increase in the cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and a much more profound increase in bone mass and a decrease in fat mass than blockade by Fsh antibodies (unpublished data), illuminating Fshr expression in the osteoblast lineage.</p><p>In addition to its expression in the reproductive system and skeletal system, we also strikingly identified other cell types that highly express <italic>Fshr</italic>: endothelial cells in blood vessels and epithelial cells in the lung and kidney. In every examined tissue/organ, we found that endothelial cells stained positively for CD34 lining on the arterioles had a higher expression of Fshr-ZsGreen than other cell types. This bright Fshr-ZsGreen is more obviously seen in large arteries, such as the ascending aorta and others located in the heart. Similarly, Fshr was detected in vessels in solid malignant tumors by IHC or RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudureyimu et al., 2018</xref>). However, it was not seen in normal tissues or organs by these methods, possibly due to its rapid turnover, fast degradation, or selected antibodies. Strikingly, we detected the highest Fshr-ZsGreen expression in bronchial and bronchiole ciliated epithelial cells by both fluorescence microscopy and ddRT-PCR. It was also more highly expressed in other cell types in the lung, such as type I pneumocytes (alveolar lining cells), type II pneumocytes (great alveolar or septal cells), and gland cells. However, the role of this unexpectedly high Fshr expression in the lung remains unknown. Similarly, we also found the second highest expression of Fshr-ZsGreen in renal epithelial cells in proximal and distal convoluted tubules but weak expression in renal corpuscles. In addition, our finding of Fshr expression in adipose tissues is consistent with the observations from previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, Fshr expression was reported to be present in β-cells of the pancreas to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, further supporting our findings of the Fshr expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we established and validated an Fshr-ZsGreen protein reporter in vivo that faithfully recapitulates endogenous <italic>Fshr</italic> expression at single-cell resolution. Our compelling findings reveal that in addition to gonadal tissues, Fshr is also highly expressed in extragonadal systems, such as the lung, kidney, heart, and pancreas. This will provide insight to better understand the biology of the Fsh-Fshr axis and its roles in the physiology and pathology of these tissues/organs. In addition to the above described, we detected Fshr expression in cells of the teeth and brain; those findings are not presented here because of space limitations and will be published elsewhere, except that three representative areas of the brain are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>.</p><p>Although the Fshr-ZsGreen reporter line is a powerful tool for detecting the location of Fshr expression, it is limited in the definition of individual isoforms of Fshr transcripts and the detection of their turnover, which should be addressed by specific antibodies and determined by the rates of transcription and RNA degradation, including Xrn1 for 5'-to-3' degradation, exosomes for 3'-to-5' degradation, and nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wada and Becskei, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaverina et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Fshr-ZsGreen knockin reporter line</title><p>Fshr-P2A-ZsGreen knockin reporter mice were generated by a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach. Briefly, one sgRNA was designed by the CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>) to target the region of the stop codon in the transcript NM_013523.3 exon 10 of mouse <italic>Fshr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huhtaniemi et al., 1992</xref>), and then was screened for on-target activity using a Universal CRISPR Activity Assay (UCATM, Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals [Beijing] Co., Ltd). The targeting vector containing P2A-ZsGreen and two homology arms of left (1378 bp) and right (1493 bp) each was used as a template to repair the DSBs generated by Cas9/sgRNA. P2A-ZsGreen was precisely inserted before the stop codon of the Fshr locus. The <italic>T7</italic> promoter sequence was added to the Cas9 or sgRNA template by PCR amplification in vitro. Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and the targeting vector were co-injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage fertilized C57BL/6J eggs. The injected zygotes were transferred into oviducts of Kunming pseudopregnant females to generate F0 mice. F0 mice with the expected genotype as confirmed by tail genomic DNA PCR, DNA sequencing, and Southern blotting were mated with C57BL/6J mice to establish germline transmitted F1 heterozygous mice. F1 heterozygous mice were further genotyped by tail genomic PCR, DNA sequencing, and Southern blotting.

The primer sequences for genotyping are described in Appendix 2. All mice were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.

The approach is novel and interesting, with a potential to help understand the expression pattern of gonadotropin receptors. There has been a very long debate about the expression of gonadotropin receptors in other tissues other than gonads. While their expression of the Fshr in some of those tissues has been detected by a variety of methods, their physiological, or pathophysiological, function(s) remain elusive.</p><p>The authors in this manuscript assume that the expression of ZsGren and the Fshr are equal. While this is correct genetically (transcription-&gt;translation) it does not go hand in hand to other posttranslational processes.</p><p>One of the shocking observations in this manuscript is the expression of Fshr in Leydig cells. Other observations are in the osteoblasts and endothelial cells as well as epithelial cells in different organs. The expression of ZsGreen in these tissues seems high and one shall start questioning if there are other mechanisms at play here.</p><p>First, the turnover of fluorescent proteins is long, longer than 48h, which means that they accumulate at a different speed than the endogenous Fshr. This means that ZsGreen will accumulate in time while the Fshr receptor might be degraded almost immediately. This correlated with mRNA expression (by the authors) but does not with the results of other studies in single-cell sequencing (see below).</p><p>Then, the expression of ZsGreen in Leydig cells seems much higher than in Sertoli cells, this is &quot;disturbing&quot; to put it mildly. This is visible in both, the ZsGreen expression and the FISH assay (Fig 2 B-D).</p><p>The expression in WAT and BAT is also questionable as the expression of ZsGreen is high everywhere. What makes it difficult to actually believe that the images are truly informative? For example, the stainings of the aorta show the ZsGreen expression where elastin and collagen fibres are - these are not &quot;cells&quot; and therefore are not expressing ZsGreen.</p><p>FISH expression (for Fshr) in WT mice is missing.</p><p>Also, the tissue sections were stained with the IgG only (neg control) but in practice both the KI and the WT tissues should be stained with the primary and secondary antibodies.</p><p>The only control that I could think of to truly get a sense of this would be a tagged receptor (N-terminal) that could then be analysed by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The authors also claim:</p><p>To functionally prove the presence of Fshr in osteoblasts/osteocytes, we also deleted Fshr in osteocytes using an inducible model. The conditional knockout of Fshr triggered a much more profound increase in bone mass and decrease in fat mass than blockade by Fsh antibodies (unpublished data)</p><p>This would be a good control for all their images. I think it is necessary to make the large claim of extragonadal expression, as well as intragonadal such as Leydig cells.</p><p>Claiming that the under-developed Leydig cells in FSHR KO animals is due to a direct effect of the FSHR, and not via a cross-talk between Sertoli and Leydig cells, is too much of a claim. It might be speculated to some degree but as written at the moment is suggests this is &quot;proven&quot;.</p><p>We also do not know if this Fshr expressed is a spliced form that would also result in the expression of ZsGreen but in a non-functional Fshr, or whether the Fshr is immediately degraded after expression. The insertion of the ZsGreen might have disturbed the epigenetics, transcription or biosynthesis of the mRNA regulation.</p><p>The authors should go through single-cell data of WT mice to show the existence of the Fshr transcript(s). For example here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018192">https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018192</ext-link></p><p>Comments after revision:</p><p>The response by the authors does not seem sufficient or adequate, by any length, for what one would expect for a work having such a large claim as the expression of the Fshr in multiple cell types and organs. It is not the fact that Fshr might be expressed extragonadally or even by other cells in the gonads, but the surprising images where virtually every cell in the provided tissues, and not only cells but structures, glows green.</p><p>It is not possible to know, as a reviewer, whether the excitation intensity and exposure for all images is equal. We believe that they cannot be, as control organs such as fat, testes, ovaries, and vasculature have a natural fluorescence background.</p><p>Leydig cells cannot simply express more Fshr than Sertoli cells, that would go against what we have known for &gt;50 years in physiology. While it is scientific to question 'old' data, to make extraordinary claims there is a need for &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot;. There is very low expression in Sertoli cells (Fig 2) while Leydig cells and spermatozoa glow vividly.</p><p>Moreover, even the tails of spermatozoa glow! This is not cytoplasm and cannot contain a soluble fluorescent protein.</p><p>The controls should be shown side-by-side to the experimental images. It would be a lot more credible if the WT and the KI tissues were placed on the same slide, with images taken from them side by side not only for ZsGreen but antibody immunofluorescence staining.</p><p>Moreover, I noticed that the entire manuscript is based on a single founder mouse, which is not acceptable as an error - either multiple integrations other than in the correct locus or genetic instability created by the KI integration would result in promiscuous expression. The founder mouse is not well enough characterised as it is only performed by Southern blots and PCR, while additional integrations cannot be detected by such. Other methods should be used such as FISH or even whole genome sequencing. Yet, several lines should be used to ensure no other effects exist.</p><p>In Fig 5, the section of aorta shows low staining in the elastin/collagen fibres, while there is clearly in Suppl Data 2. In the same figure, the 2nd lung images show green fluorescence in the mucosa (centre) which should not be as there is no cells there.</p><p>The additional single-cell data does not truly support their claims, in the sense that while some of the data might go in line e.g. Leydig cells showing as high expression as &quot;tubules&quot;, there are many other cell types that show no expression such as hepatocytes and skeletal muscle, where the authors claim to have high expression of Fshr. Moreover, in the datasets presented organs like &quot;ovary&quot; have almost no Fshr expression, which should question the validity of such.</p><p>The authors use an Fshr antibody without enough validation. The Fshr KO animals should be used for this. In fact, one of the very first statements in the manuscript is that antibodies against GPCRs in general, and gonadotropin receptors more specifically, are unreliable. The fact that controls show the same pattern as transgenic animals questions the validity, as no single acceptable antibody against FSHR recognises Leydig cells.</p><p>The detection of Fshr in e.g. adipocytes of B6 mice is as questionable as many other claims of gonadotropin receptors in extragonadal tissues, which has been questioned a number of times by many researchers.</p><p>One question we should ask is, is there any tissue on these mice that does not 'express' (Fshr)-ZsGreen? Because from what I see every single tissue analysed has 'Fshr&quot;. Which might be the problem why it is so difficult to find.</p><p>Some images seem to be duplicated such as in Fig 2C where the first row and the 3rd row seem to be the same image.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93413.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hongqian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Hui-Qing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The 980th Hospital of the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shijiazhuang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jin-Tao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical Universityersity</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Shi-Yu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Li-Ben</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ming-Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Jian-Rui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ze-Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanx Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong-Hong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Maine Medical Center Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Scarborough</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanxi Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taiyuan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We would like to thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript and express our sincere appreciation for the valuable and thoughtful comments that led us to significantly improve the manuscript on Fshr-ZsGreen reporter mice.

We added new data on Fshr expression to prove the presence of Fshr in Leydig cells in B6 detected by immunofluorescence staining, RNA-smFISH and ddRT-PCR, as well as in TM3 cells-isolated Leydig cells from a male mice in the revise MS (Fig 2E, F and G), that demonstrate no interruptions of normal Fshr expression by insertion of P2A-ZsGreen vector into a locus located between exon10 and stop code.

We also cited a recent report on scRNA-seq analysis of Fshr expression in Hu sheep in the revised MS as Reference 65 (PMID: 37541020) 1, which also clearly showed Fshr expression in Leydig cells at single cell level in Hu Sheep.</p><p>We believe that the lack of Fshr expression in some single cell databases may be due to the degradation of Fshr transcript in cells during the process of single cell populations.

New data on Fshr expression in WAT and BAT of B6 mice by immunofluorescence staining and in the testis of B6 mice by immunofluorescence staining and RNA-smFISH are added to the revised MS (Fig.2D and E, and Fig. 4G), showing similar patterns to that of Fshr-ZsGreen mice. Furthermore, we provide more evidences as Supplementary Data 3 on Fshr expression obtained from 4 public single cell portables, showing FSHR expression in a widespread organs and tissues (including different fractions of adipose cells) of human, mice and rat at single cell levels. Please also check Fshr expression pattern in adipose tissues by immunostaining for Fshr in previous reports (Fig. 3a of PMID: 28538730 and Fig. 2 of PMID: 25754247) 2 3, which showed a similar expression pattern to our finding. These data should address your concerns on Fshr expression in WAT and BAT and other organs/tissues.</p><p>Regard of “For example, the stainings of aorta show the ZsGreen expression where elastin and collagen fibres are - these are not &quot;cells&quot; and therefore are not expressing ZsGreen.” We believe that you referred to the image of the aorta in Supplementary Data2. However, Please take a look at the images of the aorta in Figure 5-C, which shows positively stained the layer of ‘elastin and collagen fibres’ for EMCN and a-SMA colocalized with Fshr expression with stained DAPI at a 1000X magnification, indicating endothelial cells and the cellular membrane presented in this layer, not just ‘elastin and collagen’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also claim:</p><p>To functionally prove the presence of FSHR in osteoblasts/osteocytes, we also deleted FSHR in osteocytes using an inducible model.

As you suggested, we did add a result of reduced Fshr expression in osteocytes from DMP1-CreERT2+:Fshrfl/fl mice treated with tamoxifen to the revise MS, as shown in Figure 3D, demonstrating Fshr present in osteocytes and the specificity of Fshr antibody.

Yes, we took you critical advice to check Fshr expression through 4 single cell portals, including DISCO, GTEx, BioGPS and Human single cell portal, and present the collected data as Supplementary Data 3 in the revised MS, that strongly support our findings of the wider Fshr expression. Particularly, Fshr expression in Leydig cells is proved by scRNA-seq studies of human cells from DISCO and BioGPS, as well as a recent study in Hu sheep (PMID: 37541020) 1 and we cited it in the revised MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Is the FSHR expression pattern affected by the knockin mice (no side-by-side comparison between wt and GSGreen mice, using in situ hybridization and ddRTPCR, at least in the gonads, is provided)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. In the revised MS, we provided a set of new data on Fshr expression in the testis, ovary, WAT and BAT of B6 mice by immunofluorescence staining and by RNA-smFISH for Fshr expression, showing similar expression patterns. Additionally, we also performed ddRT-PCT to compare Fshr expression in the testes and ovaries between Fshr-ZsGreen and B6 mice, demonstrating equivalent expression of Fshr expression between Fshr-ZsGreen and B6 mice. Interestingly, we also observed an significantly higher Fshr expression in the testis than that in the ovary (more than 30 folds).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the splicing pattern of the FSHR affected in the knockin compared to wt mice, at least in the gonads?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. Please see our reply to the Reviewer 1 for the function of P2A peptide used for generation of GFP reporters. Although we didn’t directly assess the splicing pattern, we provide a result of comparison of Fshr expression in Figure 2F in the revised MS, indirectly showing no changes of the splicing pattern. We will assess the splicing pattern of Fshr in the future that has been neglected in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any additional off-target insertions of GSGreen in these mice?” and “Are similar results observed in separate founder mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the questions. As we describe it in the method section in detail in the MS, Fshr-ZsGreen reporter was produced by the a site-specific long ssDNA recombination of the P2A-ZsGreen targeting vector to the locus between Exon10 and stop code by CRIPRA/cas9, which was guided by site-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA). We showed the results of Southern blot, DNA sequencing and site-specific PCR, proving the site-specific insertion of P2A-ZsGreen as shown in Figure 1. Because of the site-specific recombination, professionally, only one funder line is required for the study and there are no additional off-target insertions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long is GSGreen half-life? Could a very long half-life be a major reason for the extremely large expression pattern observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. The half life of ZsGreen, also called ZsGreen1, is at least 26 h in mammalian cells or slightly longer due to its tetrameric structure, in contrast with the monomeric configuration of other well-known fluorescent proteins (PMID: 17510373) 4. The rationale for using this GFP protein is that ZsGreen is an exceptionally bright green fluorescent protein, which is up to 4X brighter than EGFP—and is ideally suited for whole-cell labelling, promoter-reporter studies, considering of the higher turnover and rapid degradation of Fshr transcript. In this study, we used ZsGreen as a monitor or an indicator of the active Fshr endogenous promoter, rather than a means for measuring the promoter activity. Therefore, regardless of its accumulation or not, ZsGreen driven by Fshr promoter, indicates the presence of active Fshr promoter in the defined cells. In stead, we used ddRT-PCR to measure Fshr expression degrees in this study. In addition, we also provide single cell sequence-based evidence from 4 public single cell portables to support our findings of the wide Fshr expression.
