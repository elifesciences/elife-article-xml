However, whether they modulate the specificity of immune responses, particularly immunodominant epitope responses, and the mechanisms of regulating antigen processing and presentation remain poorly defined. Here, using overlapping synthetic peptides, we screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post-vaccination with different adjuvants and found that the adjuvants altered the antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. MHC-II immunopeptidomes demonstrated that the peptide repertoires presented by APCs were significantly altered by the adjuvants. Unexpectedly, no novel peptide presentation was detected after adjuvant treatment, whereas peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in the control group were missing after adjuvant stimulation, particularly in the MPLA- and CpG-stimulated groups. The low-stability peptide present in the adjuvant groups effectively elicited robust T-cell responses and formed immune memory. Collectively, our results suggest that adjuvants (MPLA and CpG) inhibit high-stability peptide presentation instead of revealing cryptic epitopes, which may alter the specificity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dominant epitope responses. The capacity of adjuvants to modify peptide–MHC (pMHC) stability and antigen-specific T-cell immunodominant epitope responses has fundamental implications for the selection of suitable adjuvants in the vaccine design process and epitope vaccine development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>adjuvants</kwd><kwd>immunization</kwd><kwd>T-cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Nature Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82001751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Futian Healthcare Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTWS2021061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Futian Healthcare Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTWS2022063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Futian Healthcare Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTWS028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adjuvants, MPLA and CpG especially, modulate the peptide repertoires presented on the surface of APCs, preferring the presentation of low-affinity exogenous peptides rather than high-affinity peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adjuvants are an important composition of vaccines that enhance or prolong the immune responses to co-administered antigens post-vaccination. The most commonly used adjuvants stimulate antibody responses by relying on B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrovsky, 2015</xref>). B-cell priming and memory forming are dependent on the cognate help of antigen-specific T-cells. T-cells also have direct effector functions against pathogenic infections. Thus, antigen-specific T-cells play a vital role in shaping the immune response during vaccination. However, the mechanisms by which adjuvants regulate the specificity of antigen-specific T-cell responses remain poorly understood.</p><p>Antigen-specific T-cell responses mainly focus on several peptides derived from antigen amino acids called immunodominant epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sant et al., 2005</xref>). Although specific T-cell responses are provoked by the same antigen, their response epitopes may differ, leading to diverse effects. Peptides presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) provide the first major signal for T-cells priming and determining their specificity. Although adjuvants can activate APCs and increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules of APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pulendran, 2004</xref>), the effect of adjuvants on the peptide repertoires presented by APCs or modulation of epitope-specific T-cell responses remains unknown.</p><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infects more than half the global population and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT), and gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malfertheiner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2024</xref>). Studies in human and mouse models showed that the Th1 response provides more important protection against <italic>H. pylori</italic> than a humoral immune response. Unfortunately, no effective vaccines have been developed to drive T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedrich and Gerhard, 2023</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> provides an ideal experimental model to determine the mechanisms by which adjuvants regulate T-cell responses.</p><p>Studies on widely used adjuvants have found that some pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligand adjuvants can induce a strong T-cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tom et al., 2019</xref>). PRR ligand adjuvants that target PRRs on the surface of innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, promote cytokine secretion and upregulate co-stimulatory molecule expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Didierlaurent et al., 2017</xref>). Typical PRR adjuvants include MPLA, CpG, and MDP, which induce effective T-cell responses and have been successfully used in many vaccines such as HPV, HSV, and COVID-19 vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Giudice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iwicka et al., 2022</xref>). However, their impact on antigen processing and presentation on APCs and immunodominant epitope responses is unknown.</p><p>In this study, using MPLA, CpG, and MDP adjuvants and <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens, we demonstrated that immunodominant epitopes recognized by antigen-specific T-cells were altered by adjuvants. Furthermore, we showed that the adjuvants MPLA and CpG modulate the peptide repertoires present on the APCs surface. Surprisingly, instead of revealing cryptic epitopes or presenting high-stability peptides, peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II were restrained, and low-stability peptides were presented by APCs after adjuvant treatment. The low-stability peptide presented in the adjuvant groups effectively elicits a T-cell response. Thus, altering pMHC stability in APCs provides a fundamentally new mechanism for PRR adjuvants to regulate adaptive immunity. The implications of these observations are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunodominant T-cell epitope hierarchy varies in mice vaccinated with different adjuvants</title><p>To determine the influence of adjuvants on the specificity of immune responses, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with antigen UreB, an effective antigen for the <italic>H. pylori</italic> vaccine, combined with the adjuvants CpG, MDP, and MPLA.

Compared to that in the PBS-treated group, the IC<sub>50</sub> of the peptides binding to H2-IA and H2-IE alleles in the CpG- or MPLA-treated groups were much higher than those of the deficient peptides in the corresponding groups, which indicated that the peptides presented in the MPLA- and CpG-treated groups have lower binding stability for MHC-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Using an LC-MS/MS-based MHC-II immunopeptidome, the APCs-presented peptides of <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens under the stimulation of different adjuvants were analyzed. The peptide motifs binding to MHC-II were generally consistent following stimulation with adjuvants. However, the exogenous peptide repertoires of APCs changed. Low- and high-stability peptides were presented by APCs in the control group; however, fewer peptides were detected in the adjuvant groups, and peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in the control group were missing after adjuvant stimulation, particularly in the CpG group. The low-stability peptide presented in the adjuvant groups showed good immunoreactivity, effectively inducing effector and memory immune responses. Thus, our data suggested that adjuvants can restain pMHC-II stability in APCs to regulate dominant epitope-specific T-cell responses.</p><p>The protective effects of vaccines depend on the immune responses induced post-vaccination. For prophylactic vaccines, adaptive immune responses are important and restricted to a few epitopes. However, not all epitope-specific responses were protective as some epitope-induced immune responses exacerbate inflammation and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vanderlugt and Miller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mackay and Rowley, 2004</xref>). Some epitopes induce Treg expansion and relieve inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ooi et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the alteration of dominant epitope responses directly affects vaccine effectiveness. Maeda et al. characterized the modulation of adjuvants LT and LTB on antibody responses to a co-administered antigen, EDIII. They showed that LT- and LTB-adjuvanted specific antibodies displayed distinct linear epitope-binding patterns and recognized fewer peptides than the non-adjuvanted or alum-adjuvanted groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>). However, Borriello et al. showed that mannans formulated with alum as an adjuvant broadened the epitope responses of anti-spike neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borriello et al., 2022</xref>). Chung et al. reported that ISCOMATRIX adjuvant promotes HA1 antibodies against large conformational epitopes spanning the receptor-binding domain, while antibodies targeting the C-terminus of the HA1 domain are generated in the unadjuvanted group. However, the number of recognized epitopes did not differ between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2015</xref>). Although the capacity of adjuvants to modulate the epitope specificity of antibodies has been described, the effects of adjuvants on T-cell epitope specificity remain unclear.</p><p>Lo-Man R et al. reported that <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> expressing the MalE protein induced new CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to peptides silent in the purified Ag with adjuvant CFA administration group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo-Man et al., 2000</xref>). Andersen et al. showed that an adenovirus vector expressing Ag85B/ESAT-6 fusion proteins induced a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response against the ESAT-6 epitope, while a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to an epitope located in Ag85B was detected in the liposomal adjuvant group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennekov et al., 2006</xref>) These studies suggest that specific T-cell responses are variable and antigen delivery formulations can affect CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response specificity. In this study, using a series of synthesized overlapping peptides, we demonstrated that adjuvants modulate the hierarchy of epitope-specific Th1 responses post-vaccination.</p><p>Successful epitope-specific T-cell priming requires T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition by the pMHC on the APC surfaces. Adjuvants activate APCs and enhance co-stimulatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hodge et al., 2005</xref>). However, whether adjuvants can regulate the pMHC presentation on the APC surface lacks direct evidence. In this study, using LC-MS/MS-based immunopeptidomes, we confirmed that adjuvants affected the peptide repertoires presented by MHC-II molecules on APCs, and fewer peptides were presented by APCs after MPLA and CpG stimulation. A narrow peptide repertoire increases T-cell priming possibility and improves T-cell response specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santambrogio, 2022</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the adjuvants MPLA and CpG may enhance vaccine-induced immune responses by restricting the diverse epitope presentation of APCs rather than inducing cryptic epitope presentation. Furthermore, we found that peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II were restrained, and low-stability peptides were present on APCs after MPLA and CpG adjuvant treatment. Peptides with low MHC-II stability skew antigen-specific T-cell repertoires toward high TCR affinity clonotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>). Our data explain the findings of Baumgartner et al. that MPLA and CpG adjuvants induce high TCR affinity antigen-specific T-cell clonotype responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malherbe et al., 2008</xref>). T-cell clonotypes with high TCR affinity have excellent abilities against pathogenic infections and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busch and Pamer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spear et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lima et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we also observed robust T-cell responses induced by the peptide with low stability through the titration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), although no single T-cell clonotype was used. Unfortunately, only one peptide, recA #23, with low binding stability and induced significant Th1 responses, was identified in this study. To further confirm that low-stability peptides can induce stronger and higher TCR-affinity antigen-specific T-cell clonotype responses than high-stability peptides, further studies should monitor more peptides with different stabilities.</p><p>In this study, we found that the peptide repertoires presented by APCs were significantly affected by the adjuvants CpG and MPLA, but not MDP. All three adjuvants belong to the PRR ligand adjuvant family. CpG and MPLA bind to TLRs and MDP is recognized by NOD2. Although the receptors are different, many common molecules are involved both in TLR and NLD pathway activation. Unfortunately, we did not demonstrate why the MDP had different impacts on peptide presentation compared with other adjuvants. Further investigation is required to clarify the mechanism by which MPLA, CpG, and MDP adjuvants modulate the presentation of peptides with different stabilities.</p><p>APC subtypes differ in the expression of endolysosomal proteases and DO/DM molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoeckle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and exhibit different abilities to process Ag and present peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vidard et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van den Hoorn and Neefjes, 2008</xref>). Kanellopoulos et al. reported that DCs focused HEL-speciﬁc CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against an I-E<sup>d</sup>-restricted peptide HEL103-117, while B-cells presented an additional I-A<sup>d</sup>-restricted peptide HEL7-31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapin et al., 1998</xref>). Schnurr et al. showed that CD1c<sup>+</sup> blood DCs and MoDCs presented peptides of the antigen NY-ESO-1 on both MHC-I and MHC-II, while pDCs were limited to MHC-II presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schnurr et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, the antigen UreB adjuvanted with different adjuvants induced antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in vivo post-vaccination, whereas no UreB peptides presented by A20 cells were detected in vitro using LC-MS/MS, possibly due to the differences in APC types involved, with many APC subtypes involved in vivo, particularly DCs, but only the B-cell line (A20) used in vitro. Another reason may be that the UreB peptide abundance was below the detection limit of LC-MS/MS in vitro.</p><p>A high abundance of pathogenic proteins is often preferred as candidate antigens in vaccine design. However, the amount of pathogen antigens were not consistent with that of antigens phagocytosed and presented by APCs. Weingarten-Gabbay et al. found that nucleocapsid protein (N) was the most abundant viral protein in SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 and HEK293T cells, but only one HLA-I peptide from N was present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weingarten-Gabbay et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, antigens with high expression may be less presented than expected and induce poor T-cell responses. We found that proteins harboring more peptides compatible with the MHC-binding motifs were more likely to be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Screening dominant epitopes from all pathogen antigens is important for vaccine design. This is an advantage of immunopeptidomes based on LC-MS/MS. Several epitopes with good immunogenicity detected in this study may be used as candidates for epitope vaccine development.</p><p>Taken together, our results reveal that adjuvants influence the pMHC stability on APCs and change the epitope response specificity. In the process of adjuvant selection for vaccines, the adjuvant effect on immune response strength as well as response specificity, particularly for PRR ligand adjuvants, which mainly induce Th1- or CTL-biased responses, should be considered.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>First, the peptides screened in vitro using cell lines did not reflect the in vivo situation. The epitope presentation of APCs can be affected by the APC subtypes and inflammatory cytokines at the inoculation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiebiger et al., 2001</xref>), which are difficult to simulate and reproduce in vitro. Second, peptide abundance below the limit of detection may be missed when using LC-MS/MS-based assays, which may cause false negatives. The possibility that these peptides induce immune responses cannot be ruled out. Third, human MHC molecules are more complex than mouse MHC molecules. Thus, whether the conclusions of this study can be generalized to the human population requires further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

They found that use of MPLA or CpG influences the exogenous peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules. Additionally, their observations included the finding that peptides with low-stability peptide:MHC interactions yielded more robust CD4+ T cell responses in mice. These phenomena were illustrated specifically for 2 pattern recognition receptor activating adjuvants. This work represents a step forward for how adjuvants program CD4+ Th responses and provide further evidence regarding expected mechanisms of PRR adjuvants in enhancing CD4+ T cell responses in the setting of vaccination.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use a variety of systems to analyze this question. Initial observations were collected in an H pylori model of vaccination with a demonstration of immunodominance differences simply by adjuvant type, followed by analysis of MHC:peptide as well as proteomic analysis with comparison by adjuvant group. Their analysis returns to peptide immunization and analysis of strength of relative CD4+ T cell responses, through calculation of IC:50 values and strength of binding. This is a comprehensive work. The logical sequence of experiments makes sense and follows an unexpected observation through to trying to understand that process further with peptide immunization and its impact on Th responses. This work will premise further studies into the mechanisms of adjuvants on T cells</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While MDP has a different manner of interaction as an adjuvant compared to CpG and MPLA, it is unclear why MDP has a different impact on peptide presentation and it should be further investigated, or at minimum highlighted in the discussion as an area that requires further investigation.</p><p>It is alluded by the authors that TLR activating adjuvants mediate selective, low affinity, exogenous peptide binding onto MHC class II molecules. However, this was not demonstrated to be related specifically to TLR binding.

However, whether adjuvants modulate the epitope immunodominance and the mechanisms involved in adjuvant's effect on antigen processing and presentation are not fully characterized. In this manuscript, Li et al report that immunodominant epitopes recognized by antigen-specific T cells are altered by adjuvants.</p><p>Using MPLA, CpG, and MDP adjuvants and H. pylori antigens, the authors screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post-vaccination with different adjuvants and found that adjuvants altered antigen-specific CD4+ T cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. They show that adjuvants, MPLA and CpG especially, modulate the peptide repertoires presented on the surface of APCs. Surprisingly, adjuvant favored the presentation of low-stability peptides rather than high-stability peptides by APCs. As a result, the low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups elicits T cell response effectively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99173.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Taojun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Hanmei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li et al investigated how adjuvants such as MPLA and CpG influence antigen presentation at the level of the Antigen-presenting cell and MHCII : peptide interaction. They found that the use of MPLA or CpG influences the exogenous peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules. Additionally, their observations included the finding that peptides with low-stability peptide:MHC interactions yielded more robust CD4+ T cell responses in mice. These phenomena were illustrated specifically for 2 pattern recognition receptor activating adjuvants. This work represents a step forward for how adjuvants program CD4+ Th responses and provides further evidence regarding the expected mechanisms of PRR adjuvants in enhancing CD4+ T cell responses in the setting of vaccination.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use a variety of systems to analyze this question. Initial observations were collected in an H pylori model of vaccination with a demonstration of immunodominance differences simply by adjuvant type, followed by analysis of MHC:peptide as well as proteomic analysis with comparison by adjuvant group. Their analysis returns to peptide immunization and analysis of strength of relative CD4+ T cell responses, through calculation of IC:50 values and strength of binding. This is a comprehensive work. The logical sequence of experiments makes sense and follows an unexpected observation through to trying to understand that process further with peptide immunization and its impact on Th responses. This work will premise further studies into the mechanisms of adjuvants on T cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Comment 1. While MDP has a different manner of interaction as an adjuvant compared to CpG and MPLA, it is unclear why MDP has a different impact on peptide presentation and it should be further investigated, or at minimum highlighted in the discussion as an area that requires further investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We investigated the reasons for the different effects of MDP on peptide presentation compared with those of CpG and MPLA. We found that the expression of some proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation, such as CTSS, H2-DM, Ifi30, and CD74, was substantially lower in the MDP-treated group than in the CpG- and MPLA-treated groups. To further confirm whether these proteins play a key role during adjuvant modification of peptide presentation, we knocked down them using shRNA and then performed immunopeptidomics. The original mass spectra and peptide spectrum matches have been deposited in the public proteomics repository iProX (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.iprox.cn/page/home.html">https://www.iprox.cn/page/home.html</ext-link>) under accession number IPX0007611000. Unfortunately, the expected results for peptide presentation repertoires were not observed. Thus, we hypothesized that the different effects of MDP on peptide presentation might not result from differences in protein expression. We cannot exclude the possibility that some other proteins that may be important in this process were overlooked. We are still working on the mechanisms and do not have an exact conclusion. Thus, we did not present related data in this manuscript.</p><p>The related statements were added in the Discussion section on page 13, lines 292–299: “In this study, we found that the peptide repertoires presented by APCs were significantly affected by the adjuvants CpG and MPLA, but not MDP. All three adjuvants belong to the PRR ligand adjuvant family. CpG and MPLA bind to TLRs and MDP is recognized by NOD2. Although the receptors are different, many common molecules are involved both in TLR and NLD pathway activation. Unfortunately, we did not demonstrate why the MDP had different impacts on peptide presentation compared with other adjuvants. Further investigation is required to clarify the mechanism by which MPLA, CpG, and MDP adjuvants modulate the presentation of peptides with different stabilities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2. It is alluded by the authors that TLR activating adjuvants mediate selective, low affinity, exogenous peptide binding onto MHC class II molecules. However, this was not demonstrated to be related specifically to TLR binding. I wonder if some work with TLR deficient mice (TLR 4KO for example) could evaluate this phenomenon more specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. This is an important point that was overlooked in this study. Based on published research on the mechanisms of PRR adjuvants, CpG and MPLA, we believe that the effect of CpG and MPLA on APCs-selective epitope presentation needs to be bound to the corresponding receptor, although we did not give a definitive conclusion in the manuscript.</p><p>To confirm the TLR-activating adjuvants affecting peptides presented on MHC molecules specifically through TLR binding, we have used CRISPR-cas9 to knock out TLR4 and TLR9 of A20 cells and repeated the experiments, as suggested. We chose TLR4- and TLR9- knockout A20 cell lines instead of TLR-deficient mice because a large number of APCs are required for immunopeptidomics. Moreover, the data observed in this study were based on the A20 cell line. However, these experiments are time-consuming. Unfortunately, we were unable to provide timely data. In addition, we believe that elucidating the downstream molecular mechanisms of TLR activation is necessary, as mentioned in comment 1. All these data will be combined and reported in our upcoming publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3. It is unclear to me if this observation is H pylori model/antigen-specific. It may have been nice to characterize the phenomenon with a different set of antigens as supplemental. Lastly, it is unclear if the peptide immunization experiment reveals a clear pattern related to high and low-stability peptides among the peptides analyzed.</p><p>Q1: It is unclear to me if this observation is H. pylori model/antigen-specific. It may have been nice to characterize the phenomenon with a different set of antigens as supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. To confirm the effect of the adjuvant on the exogenous peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules, a set of antigens from another bacterium, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, was used, and the experiments were repeated. The A20 cells were treated with CpG and pulsed with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> antigens. Twelve hours later, MHC-II–peptide complexes were immunoprecipitated, and immunopeptidomics were performed. The data are shown below (Author response image 1). Information on the MHC-peptides from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is given in the Supplementary Table named “Table S3 Response to comment3”. A total of 713 and 205 bacterial peptides were identified in the PBS and CpG groups (Author response image 1A). The number of exogenous peptides in the CpG-treated group was significantly lower than that in the PBS-treated control group (Author response image 1B). A total of 568 bacterial peptides were presented only in the PBS group; 60 bacterial peptides were presented in the CpG-treated group, and 145 bacterial peptides were presented in both groups (Author response image 1C). We then analyzed the MHC-binding stability of the peptides present in the adjuvant-treated group and that of the peptide-deficient after adjuvant stimulation using the IEDB website. We found that the IC50 of the peptides in the adjuvant-treated group were much higher than those of the deficient peptides, which indicated that the peptides presented in the CpG-treated groups have lower binding stability for MHC-II (Author response image 1D). These results indicate that CpG adjuvant affects the presentation of exogenous peptides with high binding stability, which is consistent with the data reported in our manuscript. Using another set of antigens, we confirmed that our observations were not H. pylori model- or antigen-specific.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>MHC-II peptidome measurements in adjuvant-treated APCs pulsed with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> antigens.</title><p>(A) Total number of bacterial peptides identified in the PBS- and CpG-treated groups.

In addition to this method, tetramer staining and ELISA have been used to assess epitope-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Among these, tetramer staining is often used in studies involving model antigens. However, as many peptides were screened in our study, synthesizing a sufficient number of tetramers was difficult. However, we believe that the experimental data obtained in this study support the conclusion.

The related description in Figure 6 has been modified in the revised manuscript.

It is unclear to me why the A20 cell line is less preferred to the J774 line for the immunopeptidome analysis - can the authors expand on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly explaining this in the original manuscript. In fact, the A20 cell line is better than J774A.1 cell line for immunopeptidomics experiments. Compared to J774A.1 cells, more MHC-II peptides were obtained from a smaller number of A20 cells using immunopeptidomics. At the beginning of this study, we chose the J774A.1 cell line as it is a macrophage cell line. J774A.1 cells (up to 5×108) were pulsed with the antigens, and MHC-II–peptide complexes were eluted from the cell surface for immunopeptidomics. Unfortunately, only a few hundred peptides from the host were detected and no exogenous peptides were detected. Next, we tested the A20 cell line. In total, 108 A20 cells were used in this study. More than 3500 host peptides and approximately 50 exogenous peptides have been identified. These data indicate that the A20 cell line was better.</p><p>To investigate the reasons for this, we detected MHC-II expression on cell surfaces using FACS. Our purpose was to elute peptides from MHC–peptide complexes present on the cell surface. Low MHC expression resulted in the elution of a few peptides. We found the MFI of MHC-II molecules on J774A.1 cell is about 500; however, the MFI of MHC-II molecules on A20 cells is more than 300,000. These data indicate that MHC-II expression on A20 cells was much higher than that on J774A.1 cells. J774A.1 cell is a macrophage cell line. Macrophages have excellent antigen phagocytic capabilities; however, their ability to present antigens is relatively weak. MHC molecules on the macrophage cell surface can be upregulated in the stimulation of some cytokines, for example, IFN-γ. In this study, we used adjuvants as stimulators and did not want to use additional cytokine stimulators. Thus, J774A.1 cells were not used in the present study.</p><p>The related statements are reflected on page 6 lines 120–128 “We also selected another H-2d cell J774A.1, a macrophage cell line, for immunopeptidome analysis in this study. Briefly, 5×108 J774A.1 cells were used for immunopeptidomics. Moreover, fewer than 350 peptides were observed at a peptide spectrum match (PSM) level of &lt; 1.0% false discovery rate (FDR). However, more than 5500 peptides were detected in 108 A20 cells at FDR &lt; 1.0% (Figure S2A). CD86 and MHC-II molecule expression on J774A.1 cells was substantially lower than that on A20 cells (Figure S2B). Low MHC-II expression on J774A.1 cells could be the reason for the lack of peptides identified by LC–MS/MS. Thus, A20 cells instead of J774A.1 cells were used for the subsequent experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation 3. Lines 172-177, can more details be provided about the whole proteome analysis? The plots are shown for relative representation of protein expression to PBS, but it is unclear to me what examples of these proteins are (IFN pathway, Ubiquitination pathway). Could these be confirmed by protein expression analyses in supplemental?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In this study, we conducted whole proteome analysis to investigate changes in protein expression across different pathways in the adjuvant groups. Through KEGG enrichment analysis, we compared the differential expression of MHC presentation pathway proteins (such as H2-M, Ifi30, CD74, CTSS, proteasome, and peptidase subunits) between the PBS- and adjuvant-treated groups using our proteome data. In addition, we focused on IFN and ubiquitination pathways that play crucial roles in antigen presentation modification and immune response. The proteins and their relative expression in these pathways are shown in Figure S4B. Details regarding the protein names and expressions are provided in Supplemental Table S2 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The original statements in the results “Then, we analyzed the whole proteome data to determine whether the proteins involved in antigen presentation and processing were altered. We found that proteins involved in antigen processing, peptidase function, ubiquitination pathway, and interferon (IFN) signaling were altered post adjuvants treatment, especially in MPLA and CpG groups (Figure 5C; Figure S4B and S4C). These data suggest that adjuvants MPLA and CpG may affect the antigen processing of APCs, resulting in fewer peptides presentation.” This has been revised on page 8 lines 172–182 as “We then investigated whole-proteome data to determine the evidence of adjuvant modification of antigen presentation. We focused on the proteins involved in antigen processing, peptidase function, ubiquitination pathway, and IFN signaling. The ubiquitination pathway and IFN signaling play crucial roles in the modification of antigen presentation and immune responses. Through KEGG enrichment analysis, we found that many proteins involved in antigen processing, peptidase function, ubiquitination pathways, and IFN signaling were altered after adjuvant treatment, particularly in the MPLA- and CpG-treated groups (Figure 5C; Figure S4B). The expression of each protein is shown in Figure S4C and Supplementary Table 2. These data suggest that MPLA and CpG adjuvants may affect the antigen processing of APCs, resulting in fewer peptide presentations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation 4. Lines 212-218: I think there needs to be more discussion of interpretation here. Only one of the low-stability peptides required low concentrations for CD4+ T cell responses in vitro. What about the other peptides in the analysis? Perhaps if the data is taken together there is not a clear pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. In this study, epitope-specific CD4+ T-cells were expanded in vitro from the spleens of peptide-pool-immunized mice. T-cell responses to individual peptides were detected using ICS and FACS. Only one peptide, recA #23, with low binding stability, and one high-stability peptide, ureA #2, induced effective T-cell responses. Peptide ureA #3 with high stability induces low Th1 responses. The other peptides cannot induce CD4+ T-cell secreting IFN-γ (Data are shown in Author response image 2). Thus, we compared the strength of IFN-γ responses induced by these three peptides at a set of low concentrations. Data for other peptides without any response could not be taken together.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The expanded CD4+T cells from peptides immunized mice were screened for their response to the peptides in an ICS assay.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99173-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, we used a peptide pool containing four low-stability peptides to vaccinate mice; however, only one peptide induced an effective CD4+ T-cell response. We speculate that the possible reasons are as follows. First, the number of peptides used for vaccination is too small. Only four low-stability peptides were synthesized and used to immunize mice. Three of these could not induce an effective T-cell response, possibly because of their low immunogenicity. If more peptides are synthesized and used, more peptides that induce T-cell responses may be observed. Second, epitope-specific T-cell responses are variable. Responses to the subdominant peptides can be inhibited by the dominant peptide. The subdominant peptide can become dominant by changing the peptide dose or in the absence of the dominant peptide. Thus, we believe that responses to the other three peptides may be detected if mice are immunized with a peptide pool that does not contain a response epitope.</p><p>The corresponding statements have been added to the Discussion section on page 13 lines 287–291 as “Unfortunately, only one peptide, recA #23, with low binding stability and induced significant Th1 responses, was identified in this study. To further confirm that low-stability peptides can induce stronger and higher TCR-affinity antigen-specific T-cell clonotype responses than high-stability peptides, further studies should monitor more peptides with different stabilities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation 5.

It is interesting that there was no difference in IFNg responses induced by different adjuvants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. Possible reasons for the lack of difference in IFN-γ responses could be as follows. First, all adjuvants used in this study have been confirmed to effectively induce Th1 responses. Second, in this study, IFN-γ responses were examined using expanded antigen-specific T cells in vitro. The in vitro cell expansion efficiency may have affected these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation 2. The data to support the claim that changes in exogenous peptide presentation among adjuvant groups were not due to differences in antigen phagocytosis is insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. In this study, proteomics of A20 cells pulsed with antigens in different adjuvant-treated groups were used to determine exogenous antigens phagocytosed by cells. In addition, we used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled OVA to pulse APCs and detected antigen phagocytosis by APCs after treatment with different adjuvants. The MFI of FITC was detected by FACS at different time points. The data are shown below (Author response image 3). No obvious differences in FITC MFI were detected after adjuvant stimulation, indicating that antigen phagocytosis among the adjuvant groups was almost the same.</p><p>A20 cells, used as APCs, are the B-cell line. Antigen recognition and phagocytosis by B-cells depends on the B-cell receptor (BCR) on the cell surface. The ability of BCRs to bind to different antigens varies, leading to significant differences in the phagocytosis of different antigens by B-cells. Therefore, detecting the phagocytosis of a single antigen may not reflect the overall phagocytic state of the B-cells. Thus, in this study, we used proteomics to detect exogenous proteins in B-cells pulsed with H. pylori antigens, which contain thousands of components, to evaluate their overall phagocytic capacity.
