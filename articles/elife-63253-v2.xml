dysfunctions related to several neurodegenerative diseases. What makes these highly specialized BBB-TJs extremely restrictive remains unknown. Here, we use super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM) to uncover new structural and functional properties of BBB TJs. Focusing on three major components, Nano-scale resolution revealed sparse (occludin) vs. clustered (ZO1/claudin-5) molecular architecture. In mouse development, permeable TJs become first restrictive to large molecules, and only later to small molecules, with claudin-5 proteins arrangement compacting during this maturation process. Mechanistically, we reveal that ZO1 clustering is independent of claudin-5 in vivo. In contrast to accepted knowledge, we found that in the developmental context, total levels of claudin-5 inversely correlate with TJ functionality. Our super-resolution studies provide a unique perspective of BBB TJs and open new directions for understanding TJ functionality in biological barriers, ultimately enabling restoration in disease or modulation for drug delivery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain-barrier</kwd><kwd>tight-junction</kwd><kwd>super-resolution</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1882/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Zvi</surname><given-names>Ayal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2402/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Zvi</surname><given-names>Ayal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1890809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engelhardt</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

Endothelial cells (ECs) were identified as the core component of the mammalian BBB when electron microscopy (EM) allowed imaging of fine ultra-structural cell-biology components of BBB cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brightman and Reese, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>). Horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) used as an EM compatible tracer revealed that BBB ECs lack fenestrations (openings traversing the entire cell width) and exhibit extremely low rates of transcytosis (vesicular transport), both mediating intracellular permeability in peripheral ECs. A central discovery of these studies was that tight junctions (TJs) between neighboring ECs are responsible for intercellular restrictive barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brightman and Reese, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>). Ever since, BBB TJs became a major focus of the BBB research field; TJs modulation is explored as means to enhance brain drug delivery, and TJs damage is investigated to better understand underlying BBB dysfunctions implicated in diseases (neurodegenerative, neuro-inflammatory, trauma etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagan and Ben-Zvi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kealy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knowland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liebner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sweeney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zlokovic, 2008</xref>]).</p><p>Several gene families encoding integral membrane proteins (e.g. occludin, junctional adhesion molecules [JAMs], claudins, and tricellulins [LSR/Marveld]) and adaptors that link TJs to the cytoskeleton (such as zonula occludens [ZO]), participate in constructing BBB TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuse et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haseloff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knowland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MartÃ¬n-Padura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sohet et al., 2015</xref>). Immunofluorescence and imaging with conventional light microscopy provided insights into the molecular components of TJs. Nevertheless, these approaches do not enable proper resolution for nano-scale imaging of TJ architecture. Electron microscopy on the other hand, provides superb resolution to image cellular structures but is much less effective in simultaneously localizing multiple proteins and tracer molecules, limiting our ability to study the molecular architecture of TJs. In order to bridge the gap between these two imaging methodologies and overcome their limitations, we developed an approach to image the BBB with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van de Linde et al., 2011</xref>]) and study TJs at the nano-scale level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Super-resolution microscopy of endothelial tight junctions</title><p>We hypothesized that effective imaging of multiple TJ proteins organized in a very tight spatial localization could be achieved with dSTORM. To evaluate this approach we used bEND.3 cells (a mouse brain-derived endothelioma cell-line), cultured in vitro to form a confluent monolayer. These cells were shown to form TJs in a gradual process that includes translocation of claudin-5 from cytoplasmic and general membrane localizations to the cell boundaries in contact between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koto et al., 2007</xref>). We confirmed these observations with immunofluorescence labeling claudin-5 and ZO1 in several time points after the cultures reached confluence state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previous studies also demonstrated that during this process, claudin-5 expression is increased reaching maximal levels by 3 days post-confluence. The monolayer trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), a proxy for TJ function reflecting intercellular restrictive properties, is elevated reaching maximal levels by 7 days post-confluence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koto et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Super-resolution microscopy of endothelial tight junctions.</title><p>In vitro process of TJ maturation is accompanied by TJ architectural changes characterized by the formation of smaller, denser and more discrete clusters of TJ proteins.

This distance threshold used for quantifications was determined based on the following parameters: minimal distance could not be below 40 nm (see Materials and methods for antibody labeling strategy); BBB TJs covering continuous contact points, as we evaluated in published TEM imaging data, range approximately up to 100 nm.

Using antibodies against claudin-5 and ZO1 for immunofluorescence and dSTORM imaging, we demonstrated a new layer of complexity in TJ organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâe</xref>). Most TJ studies use the term âstrandsâ to describe the organization of TJ proteins in a continuous line around the boundaries of the cells (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Super-resolution imaging allowed us to demonstrate that both claudin-5 (green) and ZO1 (red) are not organized in continuous lines but rather in disrupted lines with discrete clusters, forming bead-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A pronounced change was found in the organization of the two TJ proteins at the cell-cell contacts: at post-confluence, signals along the membrane were more diffused, forming elongated clusters and ZO1 signals intermingled with claudin-5 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, arrows). In contrast, at super-confluence, claudin-5 signals along the membrane became concentrated in more discrete and shorter foci, flanking ZO1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p>Target proteins labeled with antibodies imaged with dSTORM produced resolved signals representing an amplification of actual target numbers (see Materials and methods for details). Resolution of approximately 20 nm allowed us to separate signals and to use these as proxies for the abundance of target molecules, which could be used to compare different states. To quantify the differences in TJ architecture during this in vitro process, we analyzed the images using a custom clustering Matlab code to measure cluster area and number of signals per cluster. These were used to calculate the signal densities for each cluster (see clustering simulation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and methods for details, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We could detect a clear shift towards smaller clusters with more claudin-5 signals per cluster at super-confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Clusters with higher numbers of signals were more abundant at this late state, especially in clusters with area smaller than 0.3 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>. Average signal density (per cluster) was also higher at the super-confluence state (~4 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>We further investigated nano-architectural changes in the in vitro context of claudin-5 expression and tight junction function. In line with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koto et al., 2007</xref>), we could confirm that total claudin-5 protein levels in bEND.3 cells rise with time in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that in general, bEND.3 monolayer trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) is relatively low (~40â100 â¦xcm2). Therefore, we turned to an alternative in vitro system that presents substantially superior barrier features with pronounced TJ function and TEER levels closer to those estimated for the in vivo levels: human iPSC differentiation into brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lippmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lippmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vatine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vatine et al., 2019</xref>). In our culturing conditions, TEER levels started at ~500â1000 â¦xcm2 already a day after seeding. We monitored TEER and upon a noticeable elevation of approximately an additional ~1000 â¦xcm2 (2â3 days in culture), we measured claudin-5 protein levels with western blot, permeability in transwells, and in parallel imaged cultures with STORM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We noticed that TJ function was improving, with TEER elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and flux decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), but could not detect noticeable changes in claudin-5 protein levels. STORM imaging revealed that only clustered organization of claudin-5 could be found in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and that pronounced change in nano-scale organization of claudin-5 clusters could be observed; clusters were smaller in area and denser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2dâf</xref>) along with improvement in TJ function. The majority of cluster areas were smaller than 0.1 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>, and the average signal density (per cluster) was higher with elevated TEER (~2.3 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, p &lt; 0.01).

We performed dSTORM imaging of cortical capillaries following injection of fluorescent tracers to the blood stream and used claudin-5 immunofluorescence to demarcate capillary boundaries and localize TJs in cortical tissues. Similar to the traditional HRP/EM approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>), dSTORM imaging enables detection of functional BBB TJs with the added value of TJ protein visualization and localization relative to tracer molecules.

Thus, we tested E12 TJ function with an in utero embryonic liver tracer injection method that we previously developed to assess BBB permeability during early mouse developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>).

E16 cortical capillaries were previously found to prevent leakage of 10 kDa tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Licht et al., 2015</xref>), also validated here with dSTORM imaging (middle-upper). Surprisingly, at this stage sulfo-NHS-biotin was not restricted to the vesselsâ lumen, evident also on the brain side (middle-lower arrowheads) and intermingling with claudin-5 clusters (arrows).

First, we validated that at E16 cortical TJs were indeed restrictive to the 10 kDa tracers (aligned with general permeability that we previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>]). TJs at this stage were functional and prevented tracer leakage across claudin-5 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, middle-upper). Surprisingly, the smaller tracer, sulfo-NHS-biotin, was not restricted to the vesselsâ lumen, and was evident also on the brain side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref> middle-lower, arrowheads). Therefore at this stage TJs were not as mature as P9 TJs and did not prevent smaller tracer leakage across claudin-5 clusters. These developmental changes in permeability are reflected in quantification of tracer signal density at the abluminal side of the junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and c</xref>). We conclude that BBB TJs might have different maturation time courses for different size selectivity properties and that the dSTORM approach is suitable for in depth investigations of this phenomena in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present here a new super-resolution imaging approach for BBB research. Using this approach, we revealed novel structural and functional features of BBB TJs through examination of TJ maturation of EC cultures, normal cortical mouse BBB development and claudin-5 null embryos. With super-resolution imaging, we could overcome the limitations of conventional microscopy, which is essential for BBB TJ investigations since it provides proper spatial resolution and enables sensitive quantifications of TJ proteins and tracer molecules.</p><p>We provide direct evidence of non-functional TJs in the early embryonic BBB. HRP-EM approaches were not useful for studying early embryonic stages; consequently direct evidence for the cellular pathway mediating leakage in early embryogenesis was missing. A recent mouse retina-vasculature study showed that developmentally, the TJ pathway is already restrictive before the vesicular pathway is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>) and studies in sheep demonstrated similar trends in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dziegielewska et al., 1979</xref>). We suggest that in mouse cortical vasculature, the course of barrier-genesis might be different. We found that there are different TJ maturation developmental time-courses for different size selectivities. Thus, even in later stages (E16), when vesicular activity is clearly diminished at the BBB (based on ultra-structural EM studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1993</xref>]), we found that TJs were not fully mature and mediate leakage of a low-molecular-weight tracer.</p><p>We focused on three major TJs components and found sparse occluding vs. clustered ZO1/claudin-5 molecular architecture. Since our current study did not include additional TJ components, we could not differentiate in our analyses between subtypes of TJs and therefore these might represent claudin-5 presumably localized to either bicellular or tricellular junctions.</p><p>TJ claudin-5 shifted into denser cluster organization along with in vivo BBB maturation, a finding which is in line with freeze-fracture EM data that suggested cluster organization of EC TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haseloff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morita et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that confocal imaging description of claudin-5 strands might be a misrepresentation of actual claudin-5 organization. Notably, dSTORM might give rise to some artificial clustering due to antibody staining and fluorophore overcounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgert et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, our clustering results of claudin-5 and ZO1 should be taken as relative changes in protein organization under the different tested conditions. In addition, our imaging included multiple stains (two different antibodies used for claudin-5 and testing several different fluorophores conjugated to secondary antibody combinations, all resulted in similar clustering data). Moreover, occludin did not show similar clustering properties and finally, we used algorithms to minimize fluorophore overcounting (see Materials and methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OvesnÃ½ et al., 2014</xref>]).</p><p>Previous TJ studies primarily investigated epithelial cells, which have considerably larger volumes than ECs. These studies emphasized a contentious organization of transmembrane proteins along the apical circumference of the cells, providing âsealing beltsâ. Our finding of disrupted lines with discrete clusters, forming bead-like structures does not support the concept that claudin-5 fully construct these âsealing beltsâ. We can think of three possible explanations for this discrepancy; first, we cannot exclude that our staining approach underrepresents the entire claudin-5 localizations (highly compacted foci might reduce antibodies accessibility). Second, TJ cleft directionality is variable especially in vivo and the 3D organization of the âsealing beltâ might be missed once imaged in 2D. This explanation is incomplete especially once examining the in vitro data where very flat coordinated orientation monolayers are imaged at the cell-glass contacts. Third and most exciting possibility is that other TJ proteins (yet to be discovered) occupy the gaps between claudin-5 clusters; these might be coordinately localized to complete the âsealing beltsâ. Such theory aligns with the findings that the claudin-5 null BBB has only partially perturbed sealing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our data supports the huge cellular claudin-5 abundance reported by other approaches (e.g. average of ~12,000 transcripts per capillary endothelial cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>, average of ~14,000 [E12] or ~3500 [P9] signals per cross section in our data). Total levels of junctional proteins/transcripts are presented in many studies (measured by western blot, conventional imaging, qPCR/RNAseq etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>]), and down regulation of these components are often used as an indicator for TJ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings that claudin-5 expression inversely correlates with BBB tightness in the developmental setting might be distinct from the situation in the adult BBB. Similar to our findings, dSTORM imaging of cultured alveolar epithelial cell TJs, shows increase claudin-5 in response to alcohol exposure together with an increase in paracellular leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlingmann et al., 2016</xref>). In pathological settings, a minimal threshold of claudin-5 expression might result in TJ leakage. Thus, it will be interesting to test if such a threshold is breached in disease (as suggested for the 22q11 syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greene et al., 2018</xref>]).</p><p>The differential size selectivity we found in E16 was reminiscent of the seminal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitta et al., 2003</xref> demonstrating that the BBB of E18.5 claudin-5 null mouse embryos was hyper-permeable to Hoechst (562 Dalton) and to gadolinium (~742 D) but not to 10 KDa dextran or to endogenous albumin (~66 KDa). Following this study, claudin-5 was considered the molecular component of BBB TJs responsible for restricting passage of low molecular weight substances ( &lt; 800 D). Our data indicates that despite the presence of claudin-5, TJs of E16 wild-type mice display similar differential size selectivity as E18.5 claudin-5 null TJs. Accordingly it seems that claudin-5 is not the sole component responsible for restricting passage of low molecular weight substances.</p><p>Further investigations are needed in order to evaluate the possible redundancy between different BBB TJ proteins. The increase in occludin expression we describe for claudin-5 null TJ could reflect a developmental compensatory mechanism that might obscure the full contribution of claudin-5 to TJ function. Nitta et al. also suggested that in the absence of claudin-5, claudin-12-based TJs in brain vessels would function as a molecular sieve restricting high-molecular-weight substances but allowing low-molecular-weight substances ( &lt; 800 kDa) to leak into the brain. Recent RNAseq data indicated low expression of claudin-12 in BBB endothelium (approximately 80 fold lower then claudin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>]), reports farther corroborated by a claudin-12 reporter mouse study indicating expression in many other CNS cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castro Dias et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our findings of unchanged cluster organization of ZO1 in the absence of claudin-5 might be explained by interaction of ZO1 with other TJ proteins (other than occludin which is not clustered) or by recent reports of ZO1 capability of self-organization into membrane-attached compartments via phase separation that can drive TJ formation in epithelia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutel et al., 2019</xref>). It also aligns with claudin-5 null embryos having no overt morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>). The other two ZO proteins might also participate in formatting TJ architecture. Based on scRNAseq data, ZO3 is not expressed at the BBB but ZO2 has lower but significant mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). It would be interesting to explore ZO2 nano-scale organization as it shares the same self-organization capacity as ZO1 and therefore might display similar clustering properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Further development of the BBB dSTORM approach will provide additional insights: the ability to image proteins together with membrane lipids and 3D reconstruction of super-resolution imaging are both important focus points for future studies. Deciphering BBB TJ biology with this new approach will aid in evaluating the potential of TJ manipulation for drug delivery and in identifying TJ abnormalities in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>ICR (CD-1, Envigo, Rehovot, Israel) mice were used for embryonic and post-natal BBB functionality assays and dSTORM imaging.

Five Î¼m brain slices were mounted on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips (no. 1.5 H, Marienfeld-superior, Lauda-KÃ¶nigshofen, Germany). dSTORM imaging was performed in a freshly prepared imaging buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl and 10% (w/v) glucose with an oxygen-scavenging GLOX solution (0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich)), 40 Î¼g/ml catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM cysteamine MEA (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% Î² mercaptoethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). A Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope was used. The N-STORM Nikon system was built on TIRF illumination using a 1.49 NA X100 oil immersion objective and an ANDOR DU-897 camera. 488, 568 and 647 nm laser lines were used for activation with cycle repeat of ~8000 cycles for each channel. Nikon NIS Element software was used for acquisition and analysis; analysis was also performed by ThunderSTORM (NIH ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OvesnÃ½ et al., 2014</xref>]). Images in 2D were Gaussian fit of each localization; in the N-STORM software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>dSTORM quantifications</title><p>The dSTORM approach we used is based on labeling the target protein with a primary antibody and then using a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore. Thus, resolved signals represent a location that is approximately 40 nm from the actual epitope (assuming the approximation of the two antibodiesâ length in a linear conformation). The number of signals represents an amplification of the actual target numbers. Amplification corresponds to the primary antibody in the case of a polyclonal antibody (assuming binding to several epitopes in the same protein, which could be reduced by the use of monoclonal antibodies). Amplification also corresponds to several secondary antibodies binding to a single primary antibody and to several fluorophores attached to a single secondary antibody. Nevertheless, resolution of approximately 20 nm allows us to separate signals and to use these as proxies to the abundance of target molecules, which can reliably be used to compare different states.</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Cellular expression level quantifications</title><p>We defined the capillary cross-section as an endothelial unit and quantified claudin-5 signals within capillary cross-sections as proxy to total cellular claudin-5 expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Cluster area, signal numbers, and signal densities</title><p>Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) results in point patterns having specific coordinates of individual detected molecules. These coordinates are typically summarized in a 'molecular list' (provided by ThunderSTORM analysis (NIH ImageJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OvesnÃ½ et al., 2014</xref>]). In order to define molecular clusters, we analyzed the molecular lists through a custom Matlab code (MathWorks) using the Matlab functions âClusterâ and âLinkageâ, as follows: First, our code calculated distances between each point and all other points in the point pattern of the SMLM image. Then, we set a distance threshold for defining molecules that belong to the same cluster: two points were defined to be clustered if their distance was smaller than the threshold distance (e.g. 70 nm). All points that were clustered with a specific point belong to one cluster (as defined by linkage function). Hence, a point could only be within one cluster. The code then defined and saved the properties of each cluster, such as the area of the cluster, the number of points within the cluster, and the number of clusters. Cluster densities were calculated as number of points divided by each cluster area. Finally, the point patterns were visualized, while showing all points that belong to the same cluster with the same identifying color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The 70 nm threshold distance used for quantifications was determined based on the following parameters: minimal distance could not be below 40 nm (see above antibody labeling strategy); BBB TJs covering continuous contact points, as we evaluated in published TEM imaging data, range approximately up to 100 nm; simulation of claudin-5 density in clusters, measured in different threshold distances between 50 and 100 nm did not yield significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Code availability - All custom codes used in this work are freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ShermanLab/Cluster-analysis">https://github.com/ShermanLab/Cluster-analysis</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shermanlab, 2021</xref>).

For the comparison between post confluence and super confluence, we used cluster densities across experiments, for the comparison between ZO1 paired and unpaired claudin-5 clusters we used cluster densities across experiments, for comparisons related to capillaries diameter and total claudin-5 levels we used capillaries across experiments and for comparisons of total occludin levels in wild-type and caludin-5 null embryos we used capillaries across experiments (for exact repetitions see figure legends). Sample size for all immunofluorescence experiments was determined empirically using standards generally employed by the field: a minimum of three animals per group in each experiment, a minimum of four tissue sections of each tissue and a minimum of 10 capillaries per group.

The study reveals some potentially novel findings that could have major importance for our understanding of the BBB associated TJ complexes. The role of claudin-5 at the BBB is central to the study and the pattern of expression and localisation of this molecule appears to shed more light on its role. The authors propose that the tightening of endothelial junctions during development is correlated with compaction of claudin-5 and ZO-1 into distinct junctional clusters that do not overlap at the matured tight junctions. Overall, this is an important study that will advance the field, although some conclusions are premature and will need more data to substantiate, especially the conclusions related to the reverse correlation of clauidn-5 levels and BBB functional integrity.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1. Provide in vitro data linking levels of Claudin-5 to tracer flux and TER to better understand relationship to BBB. It's also important to better understand the functionality of the immunoreactive claudin-5 at P9 compared to E12. For example, it is plausible that high levels of claudin-5 developmentally have nothing to do with TJ formation and are redundant for BBB integrity. An in vitro study similar to Figure 1 but examining the levels of claudin-5 and TJ function would be of value here.</p><p>2. Reanalyze some current data to provide context (i.e. zoom out to show topology) and controls. For example, it is difficult to orient the tight junctions in panels as no other subcellular information is included. Can the authors provide overview pictures to show the cellular context of the junctions? In addition, since not all junction organizations are the same between cells (for example bicellular or tricellular junctions), how did the authors decide which junctional sites to image for dSTORM? Are some of the immunoreactive spots claudin-5 protein within cell organelles? For example, in cross section, if there is an enrichment of clauidn-5 at a &quot;kissing point&quot;, are the other signals coming from claudin-5 being processed and trafficked to the TJ? It is important to show vessel orientation. For example, how does localization look in a sagittal view of an elongated vessel? How does the epifluorescence differ from STORM in this context? For controls, dSTORM imaging yielded a very high (within 20 nm) imaging resolution, so differences in fluorescent signal derived from Claudin-5 and ZO1 may be from the same complex that has changed conformation, leading to different orientation of protein epitopes. The estimated size of primary and secondary antibodies may generate a spacial difference up to 30 nm between the targeted proteins and their tag. In fact the ZO1 signal seems to follow the Claudin-5 condensates with an approximate equal distance in the images in Figures 3a and 3b. Is it possible to image with alternative antibodies that recognize other epitopes on the proteins? Can it be verified that epitope availability is unaffected by the tightening of junctions, to exclude it as explanation for interrupted junction patterns? Is the same localization of Claudin-5/ZO1 observed in superconfluent monolayers if FP-tagged overexpression constructs are taken along as reference?</p><p>3. Temper conclusions regarding biology to better fit the presented data, especially with reference to overall BBB function since much of the data is developmental and observational. It's very important to reconcile the results shown with the conclusions being drawn especially in relation to the claudin-5 levels correlating with TJ functionality. The data shown in Figure 2 relate to developmental TJ functionality and this should be clarified and conclusions tempered. For Figure 4, all conclusions need to reference that these data relate to the developmental and early post-natal BBB which will be distinct from the adult BBB.</p><p>Revisions Expected in follow up work:</p><p>1. Provide in vitro co-localization with other junction proteins to begin to address mechanism. For example, how does the compacted localization of Claudin-5, ZO1 and Occludin relate to the other junctional structures such as the adherens junctions? If ZO-1 does not colocalize with Claudin-5 (or Occludin), then which receptor does it bind to that would explain the clustering?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63253.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1.

In that study, Koto et al., already showed that bEND.3 cells have increasing levels of claudin-5 along days in culture in parallel to increasing TJ function (measured by TEER, Koto et al., Figure 1).</p><p>As suggested, we replicated this work and measured claudin-5 levels by western blot and confirmed the increasing levels of claudin-5 along days in culture (new Figure2âfigure supplement 1). We also attempted to replicate their observed elevation in TEER, but overall under several culturing conditions only modest TEER levels could be measured (~40-100 Î©xcm<sup>2</sup>). Therefore we turned to an alternative in vitro system of substantial superior barrier features with pronounced TJ function and TEER levels closer to these estimated for the in vivo levels:</p><p>We used human iPSC differentiation to brain microvascular endothelial-like cells (iBMECs). In our culturing conditions TEER levels starts at around 5001000 Î©xcm<sup>2</sup> already a day after seeding. We monitored TEER and upon a noticeable elevation of approximately an additional 1000 Î©xcm<sup>2</sup> (2-3 days in culture), we measured claudin-5 levels (with western blot), measured tracer flux and in parallel imaged cultures with STORM. Only clustered organization of claudin-5 could be found in these cells in both conditions (similar to the in vivo situation). We noticed that in parallel to TJ function improvement (TEER elevation and flux decrease), there was also pronounced change in nanoscale organization of claudin-5 clusters: clusters are smaller in area and denser (new Figure 2). This new data indeed helps to better understand the functionality of the immunoreactive claudin-5 at P9 compared to E12 as suggested by the reviewers:</p><p>âit is plausible that high levels of claudin-5 developmentally have nothing to do with TJ formation and are redundant for BBB integrityâ.</p><p>We also suggested a similar conclusion:</p><p>âtotal cellular amount of claudin-5 is not a strong predictor of TJ functionalityâ.</p><p>We are aware of recent published work regarding the iBMECs having epithelial properties in addition to their high barrier function and endothelial properties (Lu TM et al., PNAS 2021). Therefore we adopted the terminology of âendothelial-like cellsâ. We think that these cells, which express human claudin-5 together with unprecedented in vitro TJ function, serve our purpose of investigating the nano-scale architecture of barrier TJs together with TJ function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Therefore, we now clearly state the limitation of our observations and that all data and analyses might include claudin-5 presumably localized to either bicellular or tricellular junctions (lines 289-292).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Claudin-5 signals in close proximity to the tricellular marker LSR.</title><p>Cortical capillary cross-sections of P9 mice presented multiple claudin-5 clusters, of which the minority was in close proximity with the tricellular marker LSR.

Unfortunately, all the antibodies that we could find are targeted against the intracellular c-termini of the proteins.</p><p>With no available reagents, I am afraid we could not provide a clear answer. We are currently working on alternative approaches to label extracellular epitopes, but these will take at least another year to develop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can it be verified that epitope availability is unaffected by the tightening of junctions, to exclude it as explanation for interrupted junction patterns?

Densities distribution was very variable and we could not find significant difference in signal density between the two patterns. Therefore we could not conclude that failing to identify continuous junction patterns in super-confluent monolayers by antibody staining is due to limited epitope availability.</p><p>The differences in patterns observed between the eYFP and the endogenous claudin-5 might be due to over expressing the construct. Average claudin-5 density per cluster was considerably higher when imaged with eYFP (~15,000 signals/um<sup>2</sup>) compared to imaging with antibody staining of the endogenous claudin-5 (~4,000 signals/um<sup>2</sup>), but as mentioned, did not correlated with a certain junctional pattern. We could not exclude the possibility that higher eYFP density does not stem from over expression, nor from potential differences between the endogenous mouse claudin-5 gene and the over expressed human claudin-5 gene that we used. In this context, it should be noted that <italic>antibody staining of human claudin-5 clusters in iBMECs showed only clustered patterns and density per cluster reached ~33,141 signals/um<sup>2</sup> on average,</italic> demonstrating antibody accessibility to epitopes in clusters with density ~2 times higher than these of FP-tagged overexpression constructs (eYFP).</p><p>Since the FP-tagged overexpression approach did not provide conclusive answers, we decided not to include this new data in the manuscript but to keep our original discussion element reflecting our limited conclusions:</p><p>âwe cannot exclude that our staining approach underrepresents the entire claudin5 localizations (highly compacted foci might reduce antibodies accessibility)â.</p><p>If the reviewers and editor recommend including the data, we will be happy to do so.</p><p>A possible experimental setting that might answer this question would be to tag the endogenous protein in multiple locations and/or with linker-extensions and to test densities with antibody staining against the tags.

Temper conclusions regarding biology to better fit the presented data, especially with reference to overall BBB function since much of the data is developmental and observational. It's very important to reconcile the results shown with the conclusions being drawn especially in relation to the claudin-5 levels correlating with TJ functionality. The data shown in Figure 2 relate to developmental TJ functionality and this should be clarified and conclusions tempered. For Figure 4, all conclusions need to reference that these data relate to the developmental and early post-natal BBB which will be distinct from the adult BBB.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we adjusted our conclusions with reference to overall BBB function to better emphasize that since much of the data is developmental; there should be further exploration of our findings in the adult and in different settings affecting barrier function in health and disease (lines 328-335).</p><p>We now provide more accurate conclusions, especially in relation to the claudin-5 levels correlating with TJ functionality (related to data in old Figure 2 â see lines, 184-186, also see lines, 328-335), and clearly indicate that our data relate to the developmental and early post-natal BBB, which might be distinct from the adult BBB (related to data in old Figure 4- lines 184-186 and 263-264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions Expected in follow up work:</p><p>1. Provide in vitro co-localization with other junction proteins to begin to address mechanism. For example, how does the compacted localization of Claudin-5, ZO1 and Occludin relate to the other junctional structures such as the adherens junctions? If ZO-1 does not colocalize with Claudin-5 (or Occludin), then which receptor does it bind to that would explain the clustering?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion which are all highly relevant and intriguing.
