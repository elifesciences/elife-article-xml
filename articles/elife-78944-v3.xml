activity in a wide variety of regulatory environments. We performed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in 41 strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lacking known elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, chromatin modifiers, and remodelers. We found that the opposing effects of these factors balance transcription elongation and antisense transcription. Different sets of factors tightly regulate Pol II progression across gene bodies so that Pol II density peaks at key points of RNA processing. These regulators control where Pol II pauses with each obscuring large numbers of potential pause sites that are primarily determined by DNA sequence and shape. Antisense transcription varies highly across the regulatory landscapes analyzed, but antisense transcription in itself does not affect sense transcription at the same locus. Our findings collectively show that a diverse array of factors regulate transcription elongation by precisely balancing Pol II activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription elongation</kwd><kwd>Pol II pausing</kwd><kwd>antisense transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HG007173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchman</surname><given-names>L Stirling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 HG010570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lachance</surname><given-names>Kate C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NET-seq analysis of 41 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcription regulatory factors uncovers their differential and opposing effects on Pol II transcription elongation and antisense transcription, revealing that wild-type transcription is balanced by the joint impact of many regulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription is a highly regulated and conserved process that consists of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shandilya and Roberts, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Svejstrup, 2004</xref>). Post-initiation regulation is critical for co-transcriptional RNA processing, shaping the chromatin landscape, and preventing run-on transcription into downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Herzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Holmes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Proudfoot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rando and Winston, 2012</xref>). Transcription elongation is controlled across gene bodies by a wide variety of factors, including transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, chromatin assembly factors and chaperones, RNA processing factors, and histone variants. Understanding how these factors act separately and in concert to influence RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity will shed light on how transcription elongation and co-transcriptional processes are coordinated.</p><p>Transcription is a discontinuous process: periods of productive elongation are frequently interrupted by pauses. Pol II pausing was first observed in vitro in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> polymerase transcribing the <italic>lac</italic> operon and lambda DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dahlberg and Blattner, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gilbert et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kassavetis and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kingston and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lee et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Maizels, 1973</xref>). Observations of Pol II pausing in vivo provided the first evidence of promoter proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gariglio et al., 1981</xref>). These findings were extended by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies, which identified paused polymerase near the 5’ ends of certain <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bentley and Groudine, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eick and Bornkamm, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gilmour and Lis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Krumm et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nepveu and Marcu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rougvie and Lis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Spencer and Groudine, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Strobl and Eick, 1992</xref>).</p><p>The advent of high-throughput and high-resolution sequencing technologies has led to the development of sequencing methods such as NET-seq and precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) that measure Pol II density genome-wide at nucleotide resolution. Collectively, these techniques have highlighted the control of transcription elongation by regulatory factors. These approaches and other nascent RNA sequencing methods visualize the production of transcripts from RNA polymerases across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schwalb et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore are capable of revealing the immediate and direct effects of a perturbation on transcription. In addition, these assays capture unstable transcripts such as antisense RNAs, which can be critical to transcription regulation but are invisible by many techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Camblong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Uhler et al., 2007</xref>). The strand-specificity and high resolution of these methods are transforming our understanding of transcription elongation and regulation.</p><p>NET-seq, PRO-seq, and other high-resolution methods have revealed both regions of high Pol II density, such as promoter proximal pausing, and specific sites of Pol II pausing across gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferrari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kindgren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nojima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). Regions or peaks of high Pol II density, such as promoter proximal pauses, are created in part by a high density of pause sites that together create barriers to elongation and provide an opportunity for regulation and coordination of co-transcriptional events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bentley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rougvie and Lis, 1988</xref>). Myriad factors control Pol II peaks in vivo. For example, in yeast prominent peaks of Pol II density occur near polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harlen et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of Rtt103, a termination factor, causes a dramatic peak in Pol II density directly downstream of poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harlen et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, specific sites of Pol II pauses are reminiscent of pausing observed at single nucleotide positions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herbert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kassavetis and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kingston and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>). These in vitro pauses arise from intrinsic properties of the polymerase itself, interactions with the DNA template, and the presence of bound proteins (e.g. histones and transcription factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kassavetis and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kireeva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shaevitz et al., 2003</xref>). NET-seq analysis of Pol II pause sites in yeast and mammalian cells has revealed a similar connection to DNA sequence and histones, but has not been explored across different regulatory landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gajos et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Pol II transcribes much of the genome in all eukaryotes, yet only a fraction of its transcripts mature into stable, protein-coding RNA products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bertone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">David et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hangauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nagalakshmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smolle and Workman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Steinmetz et al., 2006</xref>). A major contributor to unstable noncoding RNA products is antisense transcripts, i.e., RNAs transcribed from the strand opposite the sense strand of a protein-coding gene. Originally identified in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spiegelman et al., 1972</xref>), antisense transcripts were soon discovered in eukaryotes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bibb et al., 1981</xref>). Since its discovery, antisense transcription has been detected opposite the vast majority of annotated genes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), arising initially as a natural consequence of open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Antisense transcription regulates gene expression at a number of yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Camblong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Houseley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lenstra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Uhler et al., 2007</xref>); however, a general genome-wide function has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Murray and Mellor, 2016</xref>). To better understand pervasive antisense transcription and its role in regulation, it is important to determine whether it is tunable by regulatory factors, which would help distinguish whether the levels of antisense transcription are tightly set or whether antisense transcription is simply a nuisance that the cell works to minimize.</p><p>To gain insight into the regulation of the production of coding and non-coding transcripts by Pol II, we used NET-seq to analyze 41 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutant strains lacking known elongation regulators. We investigated how each factor regulates nascent transcription, production of antisense transcripts, and pausing across gene bodies. Surprisingly, across these regulatory contexts, we find that antisense transcription at a locus does not affect its sense transcription. Metrics describing each transcription phenotype span a broad dynamic range with wild-type activity lying near the center. The loss of each factor revealed distinct sets of pause sites that we used to create machine learning models of Pol II pausing, highlighting which genomic features can classify pause positions. Together, our results show that Pol II transcription elongation is determined by the contrasting impacts of many regulatory factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reverse genetic screen for transcription regulators</title><p>To obtain insight into the transcription regulatory network of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we individually deleted 41 non-essential transcription elongation regulators, including RNA processing factors, transcription elongation factors, histone variants, chromatin modifiers, and chromatin remodelers and chaperones, and assessed the transcriptional effects of each deletion using NET-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Based on NET-seq data, we assessed the role of each factor in regulating nascent transcription, a more direct measurement of transcriptional phenotype than can be obtained from RNA-seq data. Nascent transcripts are produced antisense to the coding strand at substantial levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>), so to obtain a complete and accurate view of expression differences, we annotated the antisense version of all genes and included these in differential expression analysis with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

Deletion of the scaffolding Cdc39 subunit of the complex resulted in substantial pausing before poly(A) sites, followed by reduced Pol II density.

Loss of proteins more directly involved in transcription termination, such as Rtt103, resulted in Pol II stalling just downstream of poly(A) sites, suggesting that Pol II may slow down during recruitment of this termination factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In these deletion strains and others, the locations of 3’-end Pol II peaks varied, with some strains exhibiting a Pol II peak before poly(A) sites and others exhibiting a peak after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) indicating that Pol II is controlled both before and after poly(A) sites.</p><p>Pol II density increases around splice sites upon the loss of several transcription regulators. For example, pause indices increased most strongly when any of the CAF-I complex components (i.e. Cac1, Cac2, Cac3) were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). CAF-I promotes histone deposition onto newly synthesized DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>), and to the best of our knowledge has not been implicated in splicing. To determine whether splicing is altered upon loss of CAF-1, we analyzed <italic>cac2∆</italic> RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hewawasam et al., 2018</xref>).

Thus, CAF-1 decreases Pol II density at splice sites and regulates splicing, suggesting that the complex links Pol II pausing with splicing efficiency.</p><p>To quantify Pol II pausing at each site, we defined a pausing index (PI), a length-normalized metric comparing Pol II density in the region of interest to that in the rest of the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, genes with a high PI in one location did not tend to have a high index for other locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). Overall, at the per gene level, there was a poor correlation between all pausing indices in the wild-type strain (e.g. TSS PI vs poly(A) PI for each gene has R<sup>2</sup>=0.06; all R<sup>2</sup> ≤0.10, p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Even across each intron, pause indices differ at 5’- and 3’-splice sites although strong pausing occurs at 5’ splice sites as often as at 3’ splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, pause indices vary across each gene, from the TSS to poly(A) sites, suggesting that each region of high Pol II density is regulated in a different manner.</p><p>Across deletion strains, the median PI varied, with the wild-type indices lying near the middle of the dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–P</xref>, S4D-H).

Of the 10 strains with the highest TSS pausing indices, 9 were also in the top 10 for median antisense pausing indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–M</xref>). These strains tended to lack known elongation factors, such as Dst1 and Spt4, indicating the role of transcription elongation factors in relieving pausing at the start of transcription. In addition, factors that modulate pausing at splice sites tended to do so at both sites overall, but not at the same intron (R<sup>2</sup>=0.87, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, S4B). However, we did not observe similar relationships between other pause indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). For example, factors impacting pausing near the TSS do not have a similar impact at splice sites or at poly(A) sites, indicating that different mechanisms control Pol II pausing in different genic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Pol II pausing locations are affected by deletion of transcription regulators</title><p>Along with identifying regions of elevated Pol II density, NET-seq data pinpoints precise positions that Pol II pauses within regions of high Pol II density and elsewhere. Because NET-seq is performed in bulk on a population of cells, only the sites that consistently induce pausing are observed, and we refer to these as ‘stereotypical’ pause positions. These precise sites of Pol II pausing at single nucleotides are reminiscent of in vitro RNA polymerase pausing observed at specific positions of DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Galburt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kingston and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wang et al., 1998</xref>).

RT mispriming is far more likely to occur on nascent RNA derived from large genomes as there are many more sequences that could be recognized by the RT primer. Such events can be identified computationally and removed as the reads lack a unique molecular identifier sequence and align proximal to sites complementary to the RT primer. To reduce their occurrence in the first place a nested NET-seq library strategy has been employed to lessen mispriming in human NET-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gajos et al., 2021</xref>). In yeast, we found that the nested NET-seq library approach does not change the number of pauses identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) nor does it decrease the fraction of pause sites with adapter-like sequence downstream, which is expected at sites of mispriming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We similarly found that the number of pauses identified with and without removing reads with identical molecular barcodes (‘PCR duplicates’) shows virtually the same number of pause sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Before identifying the locations of pause sites, we computationally removed all reads that are due to RT mispriming, but to avoid possible distortions that occur during deduplication, we did not remove putative PCR duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Parekh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We calculated the pause site density, or the number of sites per kilobase, for genes that had sufficient coverage. The density varied widely across deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which cannot be explained by differences in sequencing depth across deletion strains (R<sup>2</sup>=0.003, p=0.743; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In the wild-type strain, we found Pol II pause sites every 33 bp on average. Some of the deletion strains exhibited more pausing overall at stereotypical pause sites; for example, upon loss of Rsc30, a subunit of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, 33% of all NET-seq reads mapping to highly expressed genes constituted pause sites, versus only 21% in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, the RSC complex obscures Pol II pause sites, which is likely related to its role in diminishing the nucleosomal barrier to Pol II elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carey et al., 2006</xref>). Perhaps unexpectedly, loss of canonical transcription elongation factors, such as Spt4 and Dst1, resulted in a lower pause site density relative to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, pause site density describes only one feature of Pol II elongation. The density includes only the stereotypical locations at which Pol II typically pauses in many cells, so it is not a measure of the absolute frequency of Pol II pausing. In addition, the densitiy is not related to the Pol II catalysis rate. Thus, these transcription elongation factors may facilitate other aspects of transcription elongation or they may act locally to influence Pol II during specific points of regulation, consistent with their impact on peaks of Pol II density only near TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).</p><p>The pause loci for each strain included many that were not observed in wild-type yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Indeed, when the sets of pause loci are used to cluster deletion strains by principal component analysis, the wild-type strain stands away from most strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). However, some deletion strains shared many pause sites with those observed under in the wild-type: 81% of pause sites identified in wild-type yeast were also identified in the <italic>htz1∆</italic> strain, consistent with its confined role at the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bagchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We wondered whether loss of related factors would lead to the same sets of pause sites. We first identified all pause sites observed in at least eight strains and used the presence or absence of these pauses in each strain to perform hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). <italic>dst1∆</italic> pause sites clustered far away from those in wild-type cells, consistent with the backtracking role of Dst1 that leads to downstream-shifted pause sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). H2B ubiquitination increases the nucleosomal barrier to Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), so alterations to histone ubiquitination might lead to new pause sites. Interestingly, pause sites after the loss of Rad6, Ubp8, Paf1, and Cdc73 all cluster together. Rad6 and Ubp8 ubiquitinate and deubiquitinate H2B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amerik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jentsch et al., 1987</xref>). Paf1 and Cdc73, members of the Paf1 complex, are responsible for recruiting Rad6 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kim and Roeder, 2009</xref>). The clustering of these factors indicates a role for H2B ubiquitination in determining the locations of many pause sites. Finally, we figured that differences in nucleosome positioning may lead to differential pause sites usage, so we inspected how pause sites change after the loss of different chromatin remodelers. Interestingly, we observed that loss of ISWI and CHD chromatin remodelers, Isw1, Isw2, and Chd1, leads to pause sites that cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For example, most of the pause sites observed in <italic>isw1∆</italic> (76%) were also observed in <italic>chd1∆</italic>, consistent with their joint roles in maintaining chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smolle et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, loss of INO80, SWR1, and SWI/SNF family remodelers, Ino80, Rsc30, and Swr1, all leads to distinct sets of pause sites consistent with their separate roles in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Singh and Mueller-Planitz, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Pol II pause sites in the wild-type strain were distributed evenly throughout gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). By contrast, deletion strains exhibited a range between twofold decreased and twofold increased Pol II pause sites in the 3’ regions of genes, with slightly less variability at the 5’ regions of genes relative to a scrambled control or wild-type pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The enrichment of pause sites at 5’ end and 3’ regions generally corresponds with our PI results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, L and N</xref>). For example, deletion of <italic>DST1</italic> approximately doubled pause loci in the 5’ regions at the expense of pausing in 3’ regions. This localized effect exemplifies how overall pause density (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) of a gene could be decreased in a deletion strain lacking a canonical elongation factor. However, in general, changes in 5’ vs 3’ pause sites in deletion strains were not correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We find substantially more pause sites at the 3’ regions of genes in <italic>rpb4∆</italic>. Rpb4 is a Pol II subunit that dissociates with the complex at the ends of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mosley et al., 2013</xref>) and is responsible for sustained transcription elongation through the 3’ ends of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Runner et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Rpb4 prevents Pol II from pausing at the 3’ regions of genes that may protect from premature termination before the canonical 3’ cleavage site is transcribed. Similarly, more 3’ pause sites are found in the <italic>ubp8∆</italic> strain, consistent with the global increase in this strain of H2B ubiquitination, a mark that increases the nucleosomal barrier to Pol II and is coincident with Pol II pausing at transcription termination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harlen et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these data show how the chromatin landscape and transcriptional regulatory network of the cell dictate stereotypical sites of Pol II pausing that in turn controls where and for how long Pol II pauses during elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chromatin and DNA features can accurately classify Pol II pausing locations in deletions strains</title><p>Given the number of reproducible pause sites we identified, we next investigated whether we could determine which genomic features, if any, were responsible for the stereotypical pause sites. In vitro studies have shown that Pol II pausing has many causes, including specific DNA sequences, nucleosomes, and histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kassavetis and Chamberlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kireeva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shaevitz et al., 2003</xref>). In vivo, the dominant factors globally associated with Pol II pause sites remain unclear, although sequence elements, transcription factors, nucleosomes, and CTD modifications have all been connected to Pol II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gajos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nojima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, DNA sequence and shape were shown to be important contributors to pause site locations in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gajos et al., 2021</xref>). We first asked whether specific DNA sequences were connected with Pol II pausing loci. Previous studies reported that Pol II has a strong bias toward pausing at adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>), which we also observed here. More specifically, we observed a 3.4-fold enrichment of real Pol II pause sites at T<underline>A</underline>T trinucleotide sequences relative to shuffled control sites in the same well-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The shape of the DNA itself, as predicted from sequence, also appears to inform the location and propensity for Pol II to stall: DNA low helix twist values were more common under real pause loci than in the shuffled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These observations were consistent, as the AT dinucleotide step has a low average twist angle of 32.1° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Ussery, 2002</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Chromatin and DNA features explain the location of some polymerase II (Pol II) pauses in wild-type yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap illustrating the relative frequency of each trinucleotide sequence surrounding real and shuffled control pauses centered on Pol II pauses identified in wild-type.

Notably, not all motifs are shared across strains, and upon deletion of some factors, new motifs were associated with Pol II pause sites. 13 of the 26 identified sequence motifs with high relative entropies significantly matched known transcription factor binding site motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Pol II pause sites can partially, but not fully, be explained by DNA sequence and/or proteins binding to DNA.</p><p>In addition to the structure of the DNA itself, chromatin features, such as nucleosome positions and histone modifications, are also connected to Pol II pausing behavior. To search broadly for genomic features underlying sites of Pol II pausing, we evaluated 51 features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), including nucleotide sequence, DNA shape, position of pauses within a gene, histone modifications, and Pol II CTD phosphorylation marks. 35 out of 42 exhibited a statistically significant difference between real wild-type pause sites and shuffled controls (the remaining 9 of the 51 are sequence features that cannot be compared on a numeric scale) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). For example, the MNase-seq signal around pause loci and the distance to the nearest nucleosome differed significantly between real and shuffled pause sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, S6A), consistent with observations of pauses at nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD did not differ relative to random positions, indicating that connections between Pol II phosphorylation and pausing at intron-exon boundaries are specific to pausing at those loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>). Among the features that differed significantly was DNA melting temperature, which was previously shown to influence Pol II stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To determine which features may underlie where Pol II pauses, we created a random forest classifier to discriminate between real and shuffled control Pol II pause sites based on the surrounding chromatin and DNA features. A random forest classifier using all 51 features performed well (AUC = 0.85, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) relative to a random model (AUC = 0.5) at classifying Pol II pauses in wild-type yeast. Which features contribute the most to the random forest classifier can help shape models for the molecular underpinnings of stereotypical Pol II pausing. The most critical features for accurate identification of Pol II pause sites were DNA sequence surrounding the pause locus and topology features of the DNA at that locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). A reliance on DNA sequence and DNA shape for determining pause sites was also observed in human NET-seq data despite a different DNA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gajos et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these analyses showed that DNA sequence and shape contribute strongly to Pol II pause locations, but their effects are enhanced by many other features.</p><p>To ask whether features underlying Pol II pausing vary in different regulatory and chromatin landscapes, we built random forest models for each deletion strain. Across all deletion strains, an AUC of at least 0.78 was attained. These AUC values were only partially correlated with the total number of pauses detected in each deletion strain (R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, p=0.000064; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although nucleotide sequence and DNA shape were the most important features for classifying Pol II pause loci in the wild-type and many deletion strains, models for a subset of strains (including <italic>cdc39∆, dst1∆, ubp8∆</italic>) revealed that wild-type chromatin modifications were more powerful for Pol II classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, S7B-E). We next performed a transfer of learning analysis to ask how each model would perform when classifying pauses in other strains. When trained on Pol II pause sites identified in wild-type yeast, the AUC when testing on pauses across all other strains ranged from 0.53 (<italic>cbc1∆</italic>) to 0.82 (<italic>vps15∆</italic>), revealing the differences across the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We previously observed that loss of Dst1 leads to ~75% of pause sites to shift downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>). Thus, training a model on <italic>dst1∆</italic> pause sites should not do well to classify pauses in another strain.

These models indicate that the nucleotide sequence, DNA topology, position within a gene, and chromatin landscape all play roles in determining the location of Pol II pauses during transcription elongation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Random forest classifiers identify polymerase II (Pol II) pause loci across deletion strains, with different feature importance values across deletion strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap illustrating the mean AUC for the random forest classifier when trained (75% of loci) and tested (25% of loci) on each deletion strain.

Nevertheless, this broad transcriptional activity is one of the most highly regulated processes within the cell. Multiple levels of regulation are orchestrated by DNA sequence, transcription factors, RNA processing factors, and chromatin modulators. Here, we used NET-seq to study 41 factors with connections to transcription elongation and discovered the remarkable tunability of transcription elongation. For all of the transcriptional phenotypes analyzed, the wild-type strain fell in the middle of the dynamic range observed across the deletion strains, revealing the intricate balance of transcriptional activity.</p><p>The 41 factors chosen for this study were previously annotated to regulate transcription elongation. However, loss of each factor had a unique impact on gene expression, suggesting that genes are differentially sensitized to perturbations of the transcription regulatory network. Levels of antisense transcription in the deletion strains vary across a broad dynamic range, revealing that antisense transcription is finely tuned by many factors. Interestingly, loss of 20 factors decreased antisense transcription in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that it is possible to suppress antisense transcription further than what is observed in wild-type. Conversely, loss of 14 factors increased antisense transcription. Together, these results imply that wild-type antisense transcription is balanced by the influence of many factors and, in turn, can be precisely controlled. The possibility of tight control of antisense transcription indicates that regulatory mechanisms can exist where antisense transcription impacts sense transcription, consistent with the mechanisms described thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Houseley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lenstra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Uhler et al., 2007</xref>).

Clearly, different mechanisms regulate Pol II pausing at different points during elongation. However, pausing around the TSS and pausing during antisense transcription were controlled by a similar set of factors that are highly enriched for established transcription elongation factors, such as <italic>SPT4</italic> and <italic>DST1</italic>.

The CAF-1 complex is characterized as a chromatin assembly factor that promotes nucleosome assembly on newly synthesized DNA, sets the size of nucleosome depleted regions, and suppresses divergent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fennessy and Owen-Hughes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Marquardt et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, our findings connect the complex to splicing. It is tempting to speculate that loss of the CAF-1 complex leads to poorly deposited nucleosomes near SS, which alters Pol II pausing and co-transcriptional splicing.</p><p>Within the regions of elevated Pol II density (e.g. TSSs and SS) and across gene bodies are discrete pauses at single nucleotides that represent locations where Pol II has a higher propensity to pause. This set of positions varies substantially across the deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that there are a large number of possible pause sites, but the presence of regulatory factors modulates the pausing landscape such that they are not utilized. Our machine learning models of pause site preferences found that DNA sequence and shape are the most influential, followed by the chromatin landscape. We propose that the DNA template presents a varying energy landscape to the elongating Pol II through sequence variation and that nucleosome positions alter the landscape by lowering or enhancing pausing energetics and the associated chance of Pol II pausing. We also found that some transcription factor binding sites are enriched near pause sites, indicating a possible role for DNA binding proteins in Pol II pausing. A future analysis of the role of transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and RNA structure in pausing would be an interesting avenue of investigation.</p><p>This work reveals the complex regulation of transcription elongation by a network of factors. In addition, it serves as a resource of NET-seq data to explore more specific hypothesis-driven research questions relating to individual factors and an open-source code base with which to analyze these data. Many of the transcription elongation regulators studied here are conserved in all domains of life, as are many of the transcriptional phenotypes we examined, including antisense transcription and Pol II pausing. These insights into transcription regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> will serve as a foundation for learning more about transcription in multicellular eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast mutant generation</title><p>To create deletion mutants of the 41 factors analyzed, the parent strain YSC001 (BY4741 <italic>rpb3::rpb3-3xFLAG NAT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>) was transformed with PCR products of the HIS3 gene flanked by 40 bp of homology upstream and downstream of the start and stop codons for the gene of interest.

To generate antisense heatmaps, the log<sub>2</sub> RPKM of NET-seq reads was used. Analysis at coding genes ranged from 250 bp upstream of the TSS to 4000 bp downstream of the coding TSS.

Pauses were defined as having reads higher than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding 200 nucleotides which do not contain pauses. Mean and standard deviation were calculated from a negative binomial distribution fit to the region of interest. Pauses were required to have at least two reads regardless of the gene’s sequencing coverage. Our analysis algorithm for identifying pause sites uses the IDR analysis, which is the standard for analyzing ENCODE ChiP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Landt et al., 2012</xref>). Here, many pause sites are identified in each replicate and ranked. The peaks in each biological replicate are compared, starting with the strongest. When the ranks of the peaks stop corresponding, a transition point is identified and the lower ranked peaks are marked as irreproducible. The methodology does not require an arbitrary cutoff, and all pause sites are considered in the comparison between replicates, reducing false negatives. Pauses were considered reproducible and used in downstream analyses when the IDR is &lt;1% between two replicates. To calculate the IDR of each pause, log<sub>10</sub> of pause strength (number of reads in pause) for each replicate was used as a proxy for pause score. IDR was calculated using the est.IDR function of the idr R package (mu = 3, sigma = 1, rho = 0.9, p=0.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Li et al., 2011</xref>).

To identify deletions that induced similar pausing patterns, 8644 pauses were found to be shared in at least eight strains and in regions sufficiently covered in multiple deletion strains. Shared pauses were visualized with a heatmap, clustered on both axes using the eisenCluster correlation clustering method in the hybridHclust R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chipman and Tibshirani, 2006</xref>), which takes into account missing data (where there was not enough coverage to confidently identify pausing in a particular deletion strain). Similarity in pause loci was also visualized as a scatter plot of the first two principal components. When calculating distribution of pauses across the gene body, all genes in which pauses were identified were normalized in length; the 5’ gene region was defined as the first 15% of each gene, the mid-gene region was defined as extending from the 15th percentile of gene length to the 85th percentile, and the 3’ gene region was defined as starting at 85% of gene length and extending to the annotated poly(A) site.

All reproducible Pol II pause loci were included in these analyses, as were an equal number of shuffled control loci. The shuffled control loci were selected to maintain the same number of real and control loci in each gene, controlling for effects of differential gene expression.

From the random forest classifier, feature importance scores were generated using a random forest classifier with 75% training and 25% testing sets; for wild-type yeast, this is 10,495 training and 3499 training loci.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Dynamics of transcription elongation are finely tuned by dozens of regulatory factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided to reject this manuscript. There are technical issues noted in the review below that would need to be resolved to support many of the conclusions. If these issues can be addressed in a satisfactory way we would welcome submission of a new version of the manuscript.</p><p>In this study, &quot;Dynamics of transcription elongation are finely tuned by dozens of regulatory factors&quot; the authors present an impressive amount of native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-Seq) data and perform in-depth analysis of the dataset. Overall, the focus of this work was to determine the contributions of 41 transcription/chromatin related non-essential gene products to RNA Polymerase II transcription at different phases of transcription. This includes in-depth characterization of RNA Polymerase II pausing in each deletion strain and an analysis of sense and antisense transcription events. The introduction, which sets up the goals of the study, was very descriptive of transcription in general and lacked some focus discussing events that occur in multiple biological systems although this study was performed using yeast as the sole model system. It is stated that it is currently unknown how Pol II pausing contributes to gene expression levels however it could also be argued that Pol II pausing is, by nature, inhibitory to transcript production. Antisense transcription in yeast has also been shown by others to be inhibitory to sense transcription in multiple contexts including different yeast deletion backgrounds.</p><p>The Churchman lab are leading experts in NET-Seq method development and data analysis and it is likely that the data produced for this study are of high quality. The major weakness in the context of this current study is that this study is NET-Seq focused with a lack of follow up experiments. This concern is partially mitigated by the breadth of the work that was performed. However, some data focuses on the reproducibility of specific events, such as Pol II pausing, and only two replicates were performed for each mutant. In fact, Figure S5A suggests that pausing reproducibility across the two replicates may be poor. Figures 4-7 focus on this pause data so lack of reproducibility of this measurement is a major concern.</p><p>The data presented covers many of the 41 mutant strains that were used in the study. It does a nice job of describing both extremes of changes for each aspect that is discussed relative to the parental yeast strain. The study often references data from other studies to suggest potential interpretation of the results but no major follow up studies were performed to provide strength to these interpretations or glean new mechanism. Many of the findings support prior studies by others making this a useful resource yet not necessarily providing many novel insights. The uncertainly regarding the pause site reproducibility limits the potential impact of that portion of the work.</p><p>Recommendations for the author:</p><p>The manuscript by Couvillion, Harlen, Lachance et al., describes the effect of deleting a set of elongation-related factors on Pol II pausing and Pol II antisense transcription using NET-seq in budding yeast. Pausing and antisense transcription were extensively compared between genes/regions and between strains. Overall, the work generated mainly expected results but did not highlight any clearly new concept or finding. One unexpected observation is that deletion of subunits of the CAF-I histone chaperone led to increased pausing near splice sites but this observation was not pursued further.</p><p>Although no major breakthrough came out of this work, the dataset generated in this study represents a valuable resource for the &quot;transcription community&quot; (notwithstanding a concern described below).</p><p>Besides the lack of a major breakthrough, enthusiasm for the work in its current form is dampened mainly by the first two issues detailed below:</p><p>1) I am concerned that the conclusions about pausing might be mitigated by noise in the pause site calls. First, I was surprised to see that in most cases, deleting elongation factor genes led to decreased pausing. Intuitively, I would have expected elongation factors to help suppress pauses, not promote them. This is notably unexpected for the spt4 mutant since Spt4 has been clearly shown to suppress pausing, yet the NET-seq data suggest the opposite.</p><p>This peculiar observation (which is not commented on by authors) raised some suspicions about the pause site calls. Scrutinizing the NET-seq literature quickly revealed that NET-seq peaks can often occur consequent to technical artifacts (RNA processing intermediates, PCR duplicates, products of mispriming during RT, etc.). The Mayer lab recently published a version of NET-seq that limits these artifacts (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab208). Using this protocol, the Mayer lab found that mammalian Pol II pauses every 3,000-30,000 nucleotides. This is far less frequent than the 31 nucleotides suggested in the current work. While this may reflect differences between species, this reinforced my suspicions about these pause site calls. The sequence bias around paused sites is also different in the current study compared to previous work in mammals and <italic>E. coli</italic>, further suggesting that the current study might include a large number of artifactual pause site calls.</p><p>Can the authors comment on the possibility that some (perhaps a lot) of their called pause sites are not bona fide, and to what extent this might have affected their conclusions? Is it possible for them to leverage some of the improvements described in the Mayer paper to test whether this would affect some of their key conclusions?</p><p>2) I am concerned about the use of the antisense/sense ratio as a measure of antisense transcription. This is a convoluted measure that is affected both by changes in sense and antisense transcription. Hence, a change in the antisense/sense ratio simply can not be assimilated to an effect on antisense transcription; it may just as well reflect effects on sense transcription or a combination of both sense and antisense.</p><p>This mitigates several of the conclusions made by the authors. For example, on p.11: &quot;This result implies that strong antisense pausing suppresses antisense transcription, perhaps by promoting termination and thereby preventing antisense transcription deep into gene bodies&quot;. This conclusion is mitigated by the use of antisense/sense ratio as a measure of antisense transcription. It appears just as possible that strong antisense pausing stimulates sense transcription.</p><p>Similarly, on p.18: &quot;Indeed, differentially transcribed genes showed pronounced changes in their antisense:sense transcription ratios, especially for a subset of sensitive genes that are differentially transcribed in many of the deletion strains&quot;. By definition &quot;differentially transcribed genes&quot; means that sense transcription is affected. This alone will affect the antisense:sense ratio.</p><p>A measure of the absolute antisense transcription levels in WT and mutant strains should be attempted. While it may be difficult to compare such measurement across strains, it would - in principle - be a more accurate measure of antisense transcription. I suspect that most conclusions will remain, but the current analysis is simply not sound.</p><p>3) Figures 1 and 2 are quite descriptive and have some presentation challenges. For instance Figure 2D, E, &amp; F appear to show very subtle changes. In the scale used for those figures it is difficult to see the changes that are occurring. It is recommended that a smaller range be used so that the changes can be more clearly visualized. Many of the changes have been previously reported although not using NET-Seq analysis to my knowledge. In these cases the NET-Seq data could be used as a higher quality resource and perhaps that aspect could be discussed (advantages, etc.).</p><p>4) Figure 3 presents some interesting data that are novel to my knowledge. These novel findings, such as the contribution of CAF-I to Pol II density changes at splice sites, should be discussed in more depth to increase the novelty of the work.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>a) The title seems inappropriate. &quot;Dynamics of transcription elongation&quot; suggest that elongation parameters (speed and processivity) were assayed, which is not the case. Instead, the paper focuses on pausing and anti-sense transcription. While these phenomena are linked to elongation, this does not justify the current title.</p><p>b) I am surprised that histone chaperones notoriously linked to elongation (e.g. Spt6, FACT, Spt2, etc.) were not included in this study.</p><p>c) The abstract mentions co-transcriptional processing (presumably RNA processing). Yet, I do not think that RNA processing was monitored in this study (except perhaps for analyzing a published dataset for CAF-I).</p><p>d) check spelling of all forms of the word (and processes related to) ubiquitin. There are multiple spellings/typos.</p><p>e) Features for the AI modeling are described as &quot;chromatin features&quot; but use features both within and outside of chromatin considerations. I would consider renaming.</p><p>f) There is a missed opportunity for more in-depth discussion of transcription factor contribution to potential pause sites and for discussion of potential RNA binding protein contributions.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transcription elongation is finely tuned by dozens of regulatory factors&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As this is a complicated paper with varying effects of different deletions etc. the reviewers thought that some issues need to be clarified in the text to make absolutely clear what robust conclusions can be drawn from this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The revised manuscript by Couvillion, Harlen, Lachance et al. is vastly improved. The authors have adequately addressed my main concerns. The only aspect that remains unclear to me concerns the fact that mutants for elongation factors such as dst1D and spt4D lead to decreased number of paused sites (Figure 4). As stated by the authors, this is unexpected since these factors are known to prevent (or help alleviate) pausing. Consistent with this expected behavior (and in apparent contradiction with the analysis shown in Figure 4), dst1D cells harbor a clear increase in Pol II density in the 5' region. This was highlighted in my initial review and the authors have addressed this by adding some speculations on page 12. This explanation, however, is vague and not compelling. One possible explanation would be that, in strains such as dst1D, pause sites are fewer but stronger. In this scenario, Pol II would pause less often but have a harder time getting out of the pause state in dst1D (and others) cells. Does the data allow testing this possibility? I feel that the manuscript would benefit from straightening that aspect.</p><p>2) For the most part my major concerns have been addressed. The reproducibility of the experiments was carefully assessed (Figure S5A &amp; B) and the use of the irreproducibility discovery rate (IDR) with clear cutoffs sets clear quantitative standards for each dataset. It is clear that some of the knockout strains have a low overall impact on pausing and this is discussed through comparison of the median TSS pausing index.</p><p>3) Much of my major concern is with the use of a discussion of machine learning being used for prediction of pausing location. The machine learning section appears to more clearly provide new models for the contribution of different DNA/chromatin features to changes in pausing observed in any individual elongation factor deletion strain. This point can be addressed through writing to clarify what the machine learning analysis actually provides rather than what it could potentially do (predict pause sites) but appeared to fall short of.</p><p>4) I appreciate the care taken to address the concerns raised about the sense/antisense ratio analysis from the initial manuscript. This clarity of this section is much improved. I have a comment regarding this specific statement:</p><p>&quot;The factors whose deletions led to the largest increase in the antisense transcription were those involved in the regulation of histone acetylation, including members of the Rpd3S-Set2 pathway (Set2) and the major histone H4 acetyltransferase complex NuA4 (Eaf1), emphasizing the role of acetylation in antisense transcription (Carrozza et al., 2005; Churchman and Weissman, 2011; Krogan et al., 2003; Murray et al., 2015; Murray and Mellor, 2016).&quot;</p><p>For this statement, the deletion of an acetyltransferase will decrease acetylation whereas the deletion of members of the Rpd3S-Set2 pathway increase acetylation. As a consequence it is recommended to state &quot;emphasizing the role of acetylation / deacetylation in antisense transcription&quot; for clarity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78944.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

To remove the pause sites that do not correspond across replicates, we used a stringent irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis (IDR of 1%). The approach increases the number of pause sites considered initially, does not require an arbitrary threshold for pause site calling, and reduces false negatives. Thus, the irreproducible pause sites in Figure S5A do not represent a failure of the methodology, rather they arise as a result of the IDR analysis. Nevertheless, we understand the reviewer’s concern about the reproducibility of our pause sites, and we have added an additional analysis that compares our results across pairs of replicates, demonstrating that the majority of reproducible pauses overlap across sets of replicates (Figure S5B). We edited the text in the Results (pg. 11) and Methods (pgs. 21-22) to explain our approach more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data presented covers many of the 41 mutant strains that were used in the study.

In this study, we performed two types of analyses to look at Pol II pausing. The first is quantifying peaks of Pol II at different positions in the gene body (transcription start sites, splice sites etc.). The other is the precise location on the DNA where Pol II prefers to pause. We found a strong trend for elongation factors to impact the peaks of Pol II at the start of genes near transcription start sites, which is consistent with their established roles. Where Pol II prefers to pause on DNA (i.e pause sites) is a different question and won’t necessarily depend on elongation factors. Pause site densities include only the locations at which Pol II typically pauses in many cells, so it is not a measure of the absolute frequency of Pol II pausing. In addition, the densities are not related to the Pol II catalysis rate. So, these transcription elongation factors may facilitate other aspects of transcription elongation or they only act locally to influence Pol II during specific points of regulation. We now include this discussion in the text (pg. 10,12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This peculiar observation (which is not commented on by authors) raised some suspicions about the pause site calls. Scrutinizing the NET-seq literature quickly revealed that NET-seq peaks can often occur consequent to technical artifacts (RNA processing intermediates, PCR duplicates, products of mispriming during RT, etc.). The Mayer lab recently published a version of NET-seq that limits these artifacts (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab208).

By contrast, it is too costly to sequence human NET-seq libraries deeply enough to determine all pause sites for many genes. Rather, the Mayer group searched for pauses in all genes regardless of coverage level, and the number of pauses identified was sensitive to the number of aligned reads used in the analysis. Thus, as they note, the number of pause sites they report is underestimated. Interestingly, they describe some genes where Pol II pause sites were identified quite frequently (every 146 nt), presumably due to high NET-seq coverage at those loci. The sequence motif differences between yeast and human pause sites could be due to species differences or the different subsets of genes analyzed in the two studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on the possibility that some (perhaps a lot) of their called pause sites are not bona fide, and to what extent this might have affected their conclusions? Is it possible for them to leverage some of the improvements described in the Mayer paper to test whether this would affect some of their key conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this critical point. Reverse transcription mispriming occurs when the RT primer associates internally within the nascent RNA instead of the oligo ligated to the 3’ end. Due to the large human genome and the long pre-mRNAs (~18,000 nt on average), these events occur more frequently in human NET-seq data. They are easily identifiable computationally because reads from mispriming events do not contain a unique molecular identifier that is added during the oligo ligation step. Furthermore, mispriming reads align proximal to a sequence that is the reverse complement of the start of the RT primer. We already remove these reads from our NET-seq analysis, although very few arise in our yeast NET-seq data. We were pleased when the Mayer lab developed the nested NET-seq protocol, because it is useful for our projects generating human NET-seq libraries. We did not expect the nested approach to impact our yeast data due to the relatively small yeast transcriptome. Nevertheless, considering the emphasis on pause sites in this study, we agree with the reviewers that we should determine whether the nested approach impacts yeast NET-seq data and pause site determination. We have now compared wild-type yeast data from libraries prepared using nested NET-seq to those prepared with the standard protocol. We found that in yeast, the genome is so small that using the nested NET-seq library approach does not change the number of pauses identified (Figure S5C) nor does it decrease the fraction of pause sites with adapter-like sequence downstream, which is expected at sites of mispriming (Figure S5D). Results of this analysis are now described on pages 11-12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am concerned about the use of the antisense/sense ratio as a measure of antisense transcription.

For example, on p.11: &quot;This result implies that strong antisense pausing suppresses antisense transcription, perhaps by promoting termination and thereby preventing antisense transcription deep into gene bodies&quot;. This conclusion is mitigated by the use of antisense/sense ratio as a measure of antisense transcription. It appears just as possible that strong antisense pausing stimulates sense transcription.</p><p>Similarly, on p.18: &quot;Indeed, differentially transcribed genes showed pronounced changes in their antisense:sense transcription ratios, especially for a subset of sensitive genes that are differentially transcribed in many of the deletion strains&quot;. By definition &quot;differentially transcribed genes&quot; means that sense transcription is affected. This alone will affect the antisense:sense ratio.</p><p>A measure of the absolute antisense transcription levels in WT and mutant strains should be attempted. While it may be difficult to compare such measurement across strains, it would - in principle - be a more accurate measure of antisense transcription. I suspect that most conclusions will remain, but the current analysis is simply not sound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now analyzed antisense transcription without using a ratio to sense transcription. We achieved this directly using the statistical gene expression analysis package DEseq2 by annotating all the antisense transcripts. Furthermore, in the reanalysis of our data with DEseq2, we found fewer sensitive genes that were impacted by the removal of regulatory factors, and we decided to remove this analysis from the manuscript. These new analyses led to reformatted Figures 2 and S2 that combines the previous Figures 2 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 1 and 2 are quite descriptive and have some presentation challenges. For instance Figure 2D, E, &amp; F appear to show very subtle changes. In the scale used for those figures it is difficult to see the changes that are occurring. It is recommended that a smaller range be used so that the changes can be more clearly visualized.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize, but we are unclear about what the reviewer is referring to. On our computer screens and printouts, the changes appear clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the changes have been previously reported although not using NET-Seq analysis to my knowledge.

Instead, the paper focuses on pausing and anti-sense transcription.

The authors have adequately addressed my main concerns. The only aspect that remains unclear to me concerns the fact that mutants for elongation factors such as dst1D and spt4D lead to decreased number of paused sites (Figure 4). As stated by the authors, this is unexpected since these factors are known to prevent (or help alleviate) pausing. Consistent with this expected behavior (and in apparent contradiction with the analysis shown in Figure 4), dst1D cells harbor a clear increase in Pol II density in the 5' region. This was highlighted in my initial review and the authors have addressed this by adding some speculations on page 12. This explanation, however, is vague and not compelling. One possible explanation would be that, in strains such as dst1D, pause sites are fewer but stronger. In this scenario, Pol II would pause less often but have a harder time getting out of the pause state in dst1D (and others) cells. Does the data allow testing this possibility? I feel that the manuscript would benefit from straightening that aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>The pause sites detected in NET-seq data are only the “stereotypical” ones, meaning that Pol II stops at those positions across many cells. Pol II is likely to pause at many other sites randomly, as has been observed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase. It is unclear what percentage of Pol II pausing is expected to occur at the stereotypical sites and how that percentage changes upon the loss of regulatory factors. Nevertheless, as suggested by the reviewer, it is interesting to determine the overall pause strength at the stereotypical pauses, which we estimated by calculating the percentage of NET-seq reads at pause sites. The results of that analysis are shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G.</p><p>This analysis shows that the Pol II density at stereotypical pause sites is lower in <italic>dst1</italic>∆ or <italic>spt4∆</italic> cells than in wild-type cells. It is important to keep in mind that there could be substantial pausing at noncanonical sites in these strains. Indeed, Pol II density near transcription pause sites increases in <italic>dst1</italic>∆ and <italic>spt4∆</italic> strains, reflective of more overall pausing in that region.</p><p>To increase clarity, we have added the following sentence on pgs. 10-11 to emphasize that our approach identifies only stereotypical pause sites and is blind to other Pol II pausing events. “Because NET-seq is performed in bulk on a population of cells, only the sites that consistently induce pausing are observed, and we refer to these as ‘stereotypical’ pause positions”. In addition, we added the following sentences to the end of the same paragraph.</p><p>“Stereotypical pause sites in NET-seq data represent loci where Pol II pauses in many cells and represent a fraction of the overall pausing by Pol II. The <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase pauses both at specific pause sites and randomly across a DNA template (Adelman et al., 2002; Neuman et al., 2003). Thus, Pol II is likely to similarly pause ubiquitously across gene bodies in noncanonical ways that would not lead to a detectable signal in NET-seq data. Nevertheless, the stereotypical pause sites identified here provide insight into the underlying features that induce Pol II pausing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the most part my major concerns have been addressed. The reproducibility of the experiments was carefully assessed (Figure S5A &amp; B) and the use of the irreproducibility discovery rate (IDR) with clear cutoffs sets clear quantitative standards for each dataset. It is clear that some of the knockout strains have a low overall impact on pausing and this is discussed through comparison of the median TSS pausing index.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that our edits addressed the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much of my major concern is with the use of a discussion of machine learning being used for prediction of pausing location. The machine learning section appears to more clearly provide new models for the contribution of different DNA/chromatin features to changes in pausing observed in any individual elongation factor deletion strain. This point can be addressed through writing to clarify what the machine learning analysis actually provides rather than what it could potentially do (predict pause sites) but appeared to fall short of.</p></disp-quote><p>All references to “predicting pauses” have been changed to “classifying pauses”. We also added the following sentence to pg. 15 to clarify the role of the machine learning analysis. “Which features contribute the most to the random forest classifier can help shape models for the molecular underpinnings of stereotypical Pol II pausing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I appreciate the care taken to address the concerns raised about the sense/antisense ratio analysis from the initial manuscript. This clarity of this section is much improved. I have a comment regarding this specific statement:</p><p>&quot;The factors whose deletions led to the largest increase in the antisense transcription were those involved in the regulation of histone acetylation, including members of the Rpd3S-Set2 pathway (Set2) and the major histone H4 acetyltransferase complex NuA4 (Eaf1), emphasizing the role of acetylation in antisense transcription (Carrozza et al., 2005; Churchman and Weissman, 2011; Krogan et al., 2003; Murray et al., 2015; Murray and Mellor, 2016).&quot;</p><p>For this statement, the deletion of an acetyltransferase will decrease acetylation whereas the deletion of members of the Rpd3S-Set2 pathway increase acetylation. As a consequence it is recommended to state &quot;emphasizing the role of acetylation / deacetylation in antisense transcription&quot; for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested edit was made on pg. 8.</p></body></sub-article></article>
