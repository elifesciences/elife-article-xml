This is difficult to establish in warm-blooded animal models, given the strict programmes controlling core body temperature and the physiological stress that results from their disruption. Thus, we took advantage of a cold-blooded teleost fish that offered natural kinetics for the induction and regulation of fever and a broad range of tolerated temperatures. A custom swim chamber, coupled to high-fidelity quantitative positional tracking, showed remarkable consistency in fish behaviours and defined the febrile window. Animals exerting fever engaged pyrogenic cytokine gene programmes in the central nervous system, increased efficiency of leukocyte recruitment into the immune challenge site, and markedly improved pathogen clearance in vivo, even when an infecting bacterium grew better at higher temperatures. Contrary to earlier speculations for global upregulation of immunity, we identified selectivity in the protective immune mechanisms activated through fever. Fever then inhibited inflammation and markedly improved wound repair. Artificial mechanical hyperthermia, often used as a model of fever, recapitulated some but not all benefits achieved through natural host-driven dynamic thermoregulation. Together, our results define fever as an integrative host response that regulates induction and resolution of acute inflammation, and demonstrate that this integrative strategy emerged prior to endothermy during evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>comparative immunology</kwd><kwd>host defense</kwd><kwd>acute inflammation</kwd><kwd>tissue repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2018-05768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barreda</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Teaching Assistantships to AMS and MEW</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soliman</surname><given-names>Amro M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torrealba</surname><given-names>Débora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Semple</surname><given-names>Shawna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioural, molecular, and functional analyses revealed that fever contributes to induction and resolution phases of acute inflammation, through enhancement of antimicrobial defences, increased efficiency in inflammation control, and improved wound repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fever is a cornerstone of acute inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenberg and Gallin, 1999</xref>). The classical response is initiated through the recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns or pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors on the surface of immune leukocytes. This sensing reaction leads to the activation of resident myeloid cells at the challenge site, and is followed by rapid production of pyrogenic prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA), interleukin-1 beta (IL1B), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel et al., 1994</xref>). Contributions at multiple levels of the fever cascade are observed; IL-6, for example, promotes initial activation events, the early rise in core body temperature, as well as the subsequent orchestration of lymphocyte trafficking to lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Others, like interleukin-8 (IL-8) are produced locally at the site of infection and manage recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes from circulation, peripheral stores, and the hematopoietic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deniset and Kubes, 2018</xref>). Increased synthesis of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) within the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus fosters added production of PGE<sub>2</sub>, which serves a dominant pyrogenic role in fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 1996</xref>). Production of endogenous pyrogenic cytokines such as IL1B and IL-6 within the central nervous system (CNS) may also complement the activity of those generated in peripheral tissues during the induction of fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Systemic physiological changes in vasodilation, vascular permeability, and leukocyte recruitment become evident a few hours after the initial insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackowiak, 1998</xref>). Thus, early innate immune recognition initiates a highly organized response that engages neuronal circuitry in the central and peripheral nervous systems and triggers the activation of thermoregulatory pathways.</p><p>The association of fever and disease dates back at least as far as Hippocrates (2500 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkins, 1985</xref>). A rise in body temperature is so tightly associated with the inflammatory response that heat (<italic>calor</italic>) is one of the four cardinal signs of inflammation. While non-severe forms of fever are well established to increase host survival upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Covert and Reynolds, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>), the mechanisms behind these contributions remain poorly understood. Improved host protection has been postulated to stem from a direct impact of increased temperature on invading pathogens, and global upregulation of antimicrobial immune mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadevall, 2016</xref>). For thermal restriction, pathogen survival and replication can be directly compromised when their maximum tolerated temperatures are reached or exceeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadevall, 2016</xref>). This is well documented for many microbes and served as an effective therapy against diseases like neurosyphilis and gonorrhea prior to the advent of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>). However, many pathogens are known to be largely unaffected or grow better at the higher temperatures that fever elicits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadevall, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shapiro and Cowen, 2012</xref>). And, even for originally permissive organisms, the effectiveness of thermal restriction may be limited to initial encounters between pathogen and host, given the extensive repertoire of thermal resistance mechanisms that are available to viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadevall, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shapiro and Cowen, 2012</xref>). Global promotion of immune defenses has also been proposed, based on reported effects of temperature increases on metabolic rates and multiple effectors and regulators of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Nicasrti, 1960</xref>). However, the global nature of this induction contradicts the emphasis that a host is known to place on energy conservation and management of collateral inflammation-associated tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steiner and Romanovsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Medzhitov, 2019</xref>). As a result, debates on the net value of fever to host health continue to permeate the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greisman and Mackowiak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernheim and Kluger, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wrotek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nielsen et al., 2013</xref>). This is compounded by limitations among available experimental models to adequately recapitulate the natural physiological processes driving and sustaining febrile responses. Early assessments into the benefits of fever, for example, suffered from temporal deviations – fever was artificially induced prior to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Nicasrti, 1960</xref>). In other cases, thermal ranges outside those normally elicited by fever were used, or peak temperatures were maintained for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Nicasrti, 1960</xref>). In vitro and in vivo mammalian models of fever-range hyperthermia (FRH) continue to offer valuable insights and have confirmed improvements in host survival and decreased microbial loads because of increased core body temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasday and Singh, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, exogenous mechanical temperature manipulation is also well established to cause physiological stress and fails to replicate the host’s intrinsic thermoregulatory machinery for heating and cooling elicited during natural fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernheim and Kluger, 1976</xref>). Pharmacological models based on antipyretic drug administration (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) have also been used broadly, but are hampered by inhibition of inflammatory pathways at multiple points and other off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernheim and Kluger, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Earn et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, fever remains among the most poorly understood of the acute inflammatory processes.</p><p>Ectotherms (fish, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates) and endotherms (mammals, birds) induce fever upon infection, and both exhibit a strong behavioural component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Terrien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garami et al., 2018</xref>). Ectotherms, however, rely on behaviour to induce fever in the absence of the metabolic toolkit available to endotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kluger, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>). Upon infection, fish move to areas with warmer waters, while reptiles lay on sun-warmed terrestrial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kluger, 1979</xref>). Social animals like honeybees go further, displaying behavioural thermoregulation at the group level, to achieve a communal increase in hive temperature in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starks et al., 2000</xref>). Despite different physiologies and thermoregulatory strategies, common biochemical pathways appear to regulate fever across cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boltaña et al., 2013</xref>). In all, the conservation of fever across phylogeny spans 550 million years of metazoan evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kluger, 1979</xref>). The net result is a survival advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Earn et al., 2014</xref>) which, based on the long-standing natural selection of the fever response, appears to heavily out-weight the reported metabolic costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kluger, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muchlinski, 1985</xref>), increased potential for predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otti et al., 2012</xref>), and decrease in reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). This level of commitment mirrors that displayed by some pathogens to inhibit it. Herpesvirus, for example, has been recently shown to express soluble decoy TNF receptors during infection that delay behavioural fever and allow for increased viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakus et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used a cold-blooded teleost vertebrate model to gain additional insights into the immunobiology of fever. We examined febrile responses under host-driven dynamic thermoregulation, to more closely mimic natural conditions for heating and cooling. This avoided common caveats encountered with exogenous drugs, temporal deviations from native thermoregulatory programmes, or forcing animals beyond thermal ranges normally elicited through fever. An in vivo Aeromonas cutaneous infection model was tailored to focus on the most common moderate self-resolving form of this natural biological process rather than severe pathological fever. Under the experimental conditions used, fever was transient and self-limiting, enabling us to interrogate its potential contributions during induction and resolution phases of acute inflammation. Together, our results demonstrate that fever is not a byproduct of acute inflammation but an important regulator of its induction and control. Fever in ectotherms favours early and selective induction of innate antimicrobial programmes against infection coupled with controlled inflammation and accelerated wound repair. As such, it serves as a fine-tuning mechanism of innate immunity to pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-resolution motion tracking identifies a predictable fever programme in an outbred population of fish</title><p>Conventional shuttle box approaches for examination of fish behaviour are well established to produce significant variability between individual animals, driven by differences in their preference for cover, swim depth and activity level, in addition to social behaviours associated with schooling, territorial grouping or avoidance based on dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). In an effort to decrease this heterogeneity and offer greater analytical depth to our behavioural outputs, we customized an annular temperature preference tank (ATPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myrick et al., 2004</xref>) which takes advantage of fluid dynamics instead of physical barriers to establish distinct temperature environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Under this setup, aquatic animals were free to choose environmental temperatures independent of other variables such as lighting, perceived cover, edge effects, water depth, or current that impact positional behaviour. Distinct temperature set points (16, 19, 21, 23, and 26°C) were chosen and used to create a barrier-free environmental housing temperature gradient that spanned a 10°C range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Water inputs and flow rates were optimized to yield a gradient that was stable through 14 days of continuous evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Directional flow rates across the swim chamber were also adjusted to create smaller consistent temperature gradients between each of the primary thermal zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our goal was to avoid abrupt housing water temperature boundaries, which could affect an animal’s choice to transition between adjacent thermal zones. Next, we coupled this updated ATPT to an automated monitoring system with per-second temporal resolution for effective tracking of fish through day and night cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This offered greater analytical robustness and temporal resolution than previously possible in behavioural fever analyses. We then challenged individual teleost fish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>; goldfish) with an <italic>Aeromonas</italic> cutaneous infection in vivo. As eurythermal ectotherms, goldfish offered an opportunity to examine absolute changes to thermopreference to an immune challenge, while minimizing the potential for thermal stress. This is because the natural range of tolerated environmental temperatures for these fish (1.3–34.5°C) was broader than those temperatures expected in a febrile response. Our choice also provided access to a previously optimized in vivo self-resolving animal model where changes during induction and resolution phases of acute inflammation could be examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Havixbeck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Havixbeck et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Annular temperature preference tank (ATPT) design, validation, and fish tracking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ATPT established a continuous ring-shaped swim chamber that offered distinct temperature environments separated by fluid dynamics instead of physical barriers.

Surprisingly, the number and proportion of ROS-producing leukocytes were greatly reduced under host-driven dynamic thermoregulatory conditions (T<sub>D;</sub> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) despite the enhanced kinetics in leukocyte recruitment outlined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Given the long-established contributions of fever to host survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kluger et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Earn et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that fever may promote an innate antimicrobial response that does not include a strong ROS production component.

Leukocytes infiltrating the furuncle of T<sub>D</sub> fish showed significant upregulation, with peak NO production observed at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was further supported by a marked, earlier upregulation of the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; <italic>nos2</italic>), which is necessary for production of immune NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neumann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogdan, 2015</xref>).

By day 10, infected wounds from fish housed under 16°C static thermal conditions showed prominent necrosis among muscle fibres, edema, and some immune cell infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, wounds from fish allowed to exert fever had no necrotic regions and inflammation had largely resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, fever promoted an earlier pro-inflammatory period, which was further paired with more efficient resolution of inflammation based on inhibition of leukocyte recruitment, control of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, induction of pro-resolution genes, and management of collateral tissue damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Fever enhances wound repair</title><p>Characterization of pathology at the infection site showed marked differences in the capacity of T<sub>D</sub> fish to heal <italic>A. veronii</italic>-associated wounds.

Among T<sub>16</sub> fish, wound re-epithelialization occurred but was delayed.

This further developed into more extensive, organized collagen deposition by 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Conversely, the absence of fever caused delayed resolution of the inflammatory response, re-epithelialization, and the appearance of extracellular matrix components. Together, our results show that in this cold-blooded vertebrate moderate self-resolving fever offers a natural strategy to harness the body’s intrinsic repair mechanisms to enhance wound healing.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fever enhances re-epithelialization and collagen deposition.</title><p>Wound tissue from <italic>Aeromonas</italic>-infected fish was collected at the indicated time points, sectioned, and stained with Masson’s Trichrome stain (<italic>n</italic> = 3 per group per time point).

Thus, for this study we examined fever under an acute inflammatory state that was transient and self-limiting. A eurythermic teleost fish model offered fine control of febrile mechanisms through host-driven dynamic thermoregulation, more closely mimicking natural conditions for heating and cooling. A custom animal enclosure delivered multi-day thermal gradient stability without the use of physical barriers that are known to affect behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rakus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myrick et al., 2004</xref>). Together, this combination of animal model, enclosure design, and automated continuous per second tracking of animal locomotory patterns over both induction and resolution phases of the febrile period greatly enhanced analytical robustness and temporal resolution compared to previous studies. Collectively, our data show that moderate self-resolving fever offers earlier and selective rather than stronger induction of innate antimicrobial programmes against infection, and that this results in markedly faster pathogen clearance. We also show that this is paired with rapid subsequent inflammation control and enhanced tissue repair at the wound site. This integrative approach is novel and represents a marked upgrade in refinement compared to popular hypotheses that postulate global induction of immunity, or rely on a shift away from those temperatures preferred by invading pathogens. Our demonstration that this integrative strategy was already well established prior to the development of endothermy further suggests a plausible scenario for the long-standing selection of fever through evolution.</p><p>Increases in core body temperature are well established to promote neutrophil accumulation, NADPH oxidase activity, and production rates of toxic superoxide anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Souabni et al., 2017</xref>). Models of FRH have linked these effects to higher serum concentrations of IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ostberg and Repasky, 2000</xref>), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-driven release of neutrophils from the hematopoietic bone marrow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capitano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis et al., 2005</xref> expansion of the circulating neutrophil pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capitano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis et al., 2005</xref>), increased endothelial barrier permeability in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2012</xref>), and upregulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), extracellular HSP70, IL-8, and other CXC chemokines at the local site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasday et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). However, these thermal increases have also been shown to promote collateral tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rice et al., 2005</xref>). This continues to be broadly viewed as an unavoidable cost of fever, where induction of immune defenses will undoubtedly drive accompanying inflammation-associated tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasday et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rice et al., 2005</xref>). Our results offer an alternative explanation where, in the absence of natural thermoregulation, FRH only partially recapitulates the regulatory capacity of fever on acute inflammation. We found that both fever and mechanical FRH displayed accelerated kinetics of leukocyte recruitment, and earlier control of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. But differences were observed in the induction of pro-resolution genes, and fever ultimately achieved greater levels of wound repair. We also documented a clear shift from an ROS-dominant microbicidal response under euthermic and FRH conditions to one dominated by NO production under fever. NO and downstream reactive nitrogen species exert microbicidal or microbiostatic activity against a broad range of bacteria, viruses, yeasts, helminths, and protozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wink et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, at first glance, this inhibition in ROS production seemed contradictory to the role of fever in pathogen resistance. Notably, decreased ROS activity does not necessarily have to result in compromised host defenses. In a murine <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection, NO enhanced bacterial clearance via an Atg7-mediated mechanism that also reduced IFN-γ activity,inhibited ROS production, and limited oxidative stress, resulting in decreased lung injury and lower infection-associated mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2015</xref>). A growing number of examples for antagonistic NO modulation of ROS responses during infection have also been described, some of which can be traced as far back as plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolbert et al., 2019</xref>). Our results are consistent with these observations and offer a natural scenario where fever drives a shift in the NO–ROS balance that maintains competencies in microbial clearance to subvert a live infection, while also contributing to inflammation control and the re-establishment of a functional mucosal barrier.</p><p>Recent years have seen renewed interest in the links between thermoregulation and host defense, which now also extend to cooler temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steiner and Romanovsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Medzhitov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganeshan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>). This has led to a perceived functional dichotomy between fever and hypothermia. Although both reflect an animal’s capacity to take advantage of thermoregulation to maintain fitness upon infection, fever drives elimination of invading microorganisms through microbicidal disease resistance while hypothermia promotes tolerance to foster energy conservation and management of collateral inflammation-associated tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steiner and Romanovsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Medzhitov, 2019</xref>). Our results blur the line in this perceived dichotomy. We identified clear fever-embedded mechanisms that contributed to the maintenance of tissue integrity and would allow for energy conservation. These contributions did not appear in response to damage, but instead were prominent features through initial induction and subsequent resolution phases of acute inflammation. Early on, fever promoted disease resistance via enhanced kinetics of leukocyte recruitment rather than by augmenting the magnitude or duration of immune activation. Engagement of cytoprotective gene programmes in the CNS occurred within hours of the initial immune challenge. Selective rather than global upregulation of immunity further decreased the potential for collateral damage often attributed to fever. Notably, microbicidal efficacy was still superior under fever, with <italic>Aeromonas</italic> clearance achieved markedly faster than under thermally restricted basal conditions (7 vs. 14 days). Our results then showed greater efficiency in inflammation control. This was paired with novel contributions that actively promoted tissue repair rather than resilience to inflammatory damage. There was no induction of a hypothermic state at any point during our observation periods; instead, high-resolution positional tracking only showed a discrete, self-resolving fever response. Thus, fever actively engages mechanisms that enhance protection, while also limiting pathology, controlling inflammation, and promoting tissue repair. Importantly, our findings do not dispute previously described competition mechanisms between immunity and other maintenance programmes that direct a transition towards tolerance under high pathogen loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Romanovsky and Székely, 1998</xref>). Instead, they simply highlight the persistent and long-standing considerations placed on energy allocation and tissue integrity by an animal host at all stages of infection.</p><p>To conclude, our results reveal novel features of fever, and demonstrate that it is an integrative host response to infection that regulates both induction and resolution phases of acute inflammation. Much work remains to establish the extent by which immune modulation through fever is conserved across cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates, despite their different physiologies. However, the downstream implications of our findings are potentially far-reaching. Among others, enhanced re-establishment of barrier integrity at tissue sites such as the skin are predicted to reduce the potential for secondary infections, and curtail the physiological stress stemming from a need for extended management of wounded tissue. There are also inferences at the population level, where marked enhancements observed in pathogen clearance are likely to translate into lower rates of transmission across a naive population, offering novel opportunities for the management of infectious disease. More studies will be required to test these possibilities, but this is critical as we look to better understand the long-standing role of fever in the modulation of immunity, and the repercussions of inhibiting moderate fever in veterinary and human medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (Goldfish;

For hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, slides were placed in Surgipath Hematoxylin Gill III (3801542; Leica Biosystems, Concord, Canada) for 2 min, washed with running cold tap water for 15 min followed by 70% ethanol for 2 min, and then in Surgipath Eosin solution (3801602; Leica Biosystems, Concord, Canada) for 30 s. For Masson’s Trichrome stain, slides were placed in hematoxylin Gill III for 1 min and washed with running cold tap water for 15 min. Slides were stained with ponceau-fuchsin (AC400211000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 2 min, rinsed in distilled water, differentiated in mordant in 1% phosphomolybdic acid (19400; Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 5 min. Slides were then stained with Aniline Blue solution (A967-25; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 3 min and incubated in 1% phosphomolybdic acid then acetic acid solution (A38C-212; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 5 and 3 min, respectively. Lastly, for both H&amp;E and Masson’s Trichrome, slides were dehydrated in series of alcohol, cleared in toluene, mounted with DPX Mountant (50-980-370; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were obtained using an AxioScope A1 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were statistically analyzed and graphed using GraphPad v9.3.1 (San Diego, CA). Fish numbers used in each experiment were determined based on the minimal sample size (<italic>n</italic>) required to detect statistical significance, while considering animal ethics and care guidelines under the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine if the means of two groups were significantly different. Data of both groups had a normally distributed population, but it was not assumed that they had the same variance. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the variance in the means of three or more categorical independent groups, considering a single independent factor or variable in the analysis. Data had a normally distributed population and each sample was drawn independently of the other samples. Additionally, the dependent variable was continuous. Two-way ANOVA was utilized for comparing the effect of two independent categorical factors on a dependent variable such as fold-change. The dependent variable was continuous and each sample was drawn independently of the other samples. Šídák’s multiple comparisons test was used in select cases when a set of means were selected to compare across two groups and each comparison was assumed to be independent of the others. Mean values and correlations for behavioural data were calculated in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). R (version 3.3, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to calculate multivariate statistics including principal component analysis (standard R package) and permutational multivariate ANOVA using distance matrices (‘vegan’ community ecology package). R code is included as part of the supplementary material.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animals were maintained according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

During the recent COVID-19 pandemic a prevalence of 82.49% versus 14.71% were reported for moderate and high-grade fevers, respectively (PLoS One. 2021; 16(4): e0249788). This, however, represents a rare opportunity for this comparison since under most common infections (e.g. seasonal influenza, common colds) moderate fevers are comparatively under-reported. Thus, we chose to avoid any specific commentary beyond those presented in lines 373-376 since these would undoubtedly misrepresent such prevalence in human populations. Numbers are even harder to capture accurately in other warm-blooded endotherms. However, we agree that added context would be beneficial. Thus, we now include the reference above as an example for the difference in prevalence of moderate and high-grade fevers under COVID-19 (line 544; reference 46).</p></body></sub-article></article>
