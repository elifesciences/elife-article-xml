In many cases, cancers can be resistant to the drug prior to exposure, that is, possess intrinsic drug resistance. However, we lack target-independent methods to anticipate resistance in cancer cell lines or characterize intrinsic drug resistance without a priori knowledge of its cause. We hypothesized that cell morphology could provide an unbiased readout of drug resistance. To test this hypothesis, we used HCT116 cells, a mismatch repair-deficient cancer cell line, to isolate clones that were resistant or sensitive to bortezomib, a well-characterized proteasome inhibitor and anticancer drug to which many cancer cells possess intrinsic resistance. We then expanded these clones and measured high-dimensional single-cell morphology profiles using Cell Painting, a high-content microscopy assay. Our imaging- and computation-based profiling pipeline identified morphological features that differed between resistant and sensitive cells. We used these features to generate a morphological signature of bortezomib resistance. We then employed this morphological signature to analyze a set of HCT116 clones (five resistant and five sensitive) that had not been included in the signature training dataset, and correctly predicted sensitivity to bortezomib in seven cases, in the absence of drug treatment. This signature predicted bortezomib resistance better than resistance to other drugs targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system, indicating specificity for mechanisms of resistance to bortezomib. Our results establish a proof-of-concept framework for the unbiased analysis of drug resistance using high-content microscopy of cancer cells, in the absence of drug treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell painting</kwd><kwd>cancer resistance</kwd><kwd>high content imaging</kwd><kwd>microscopy</kwd><kwd>linear modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Starr Cancer Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>112-0039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpenter</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpenter</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM130234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapoor</surname><given-names>Tarun M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM066699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM115327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>Adi Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF GRFP 2019272977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>Adi Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Morphological profiling of untreated HCT116 cells using Cell Painting reveals a signature of bortezomib resistance, providing a proof-of-concept for the unbiased analysis of drug resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Targeted cancer therapies often fail due to drug resistance, which makes determining the drug sensitivity of populations of cancer cells requisite for timely and effective treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garraway and Jänne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisa and Kapoor, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vasan et al., 2019</xref>). Resistance is complex and can be categorized as acquired, manifesting in the context of prolonged treatment, or intrinsic, pre-existing in the cancer cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottesman et al., 2016</xref>). Most studies of resistance focus on the drug’s known target(s) or expression levels of drug efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garraway and Jänne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottesman et al., 2016</xref>). However, we currently lack unbiased methods of identifying drug resistance in cells especially prior to treatment.</p><p>Bortezomib is an anticancer drug commonly used to treat multiple myeloma and nearly half of multiple myeloma patients show no initial response to bortezomib therapy, indicating intrinsic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Santamarta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitsiades et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hideshima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vincenz et al., 2013</xref>). Bortezomib resistance can be attributed to targeted mechanisms such as mutations in the bortezomib-binding pocket of the proteasome subunit (PSMB5) and overexpression of proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van de Ven et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>) as well as non-specific mechanisms, such as upregulation of prosurvival or anti-apoptotic pathways and enhanced cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Santamarta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hideshima et al., 2007</xref>). A priori knowledge of tumor cells’ susceptibility to candidate therapeutics could aid in identifying effective treatment options, resulting in fewer relapses and failed treatments due to resistance. However, current methods for evaluating drug resistance depend on viability assays and sequencing, which may be limited in its usefulness without knowledge of the full spectrum of resistance-conferring genomic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wheler et al., 2014</xref>) or knowing specific mutations or indels in the target that suppress drug activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapoor and Miller, 2017</xref>). Methods for determining tumor cell susceptibility prior to therapy are desirable.</p><p>A growing literature suggests that specific genomic alterations, treatment response, and prognosis can be predicted from conventional hematoxylin and eosin tissue slides using machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cifci et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee and Jang, 2022</xref>), indicating that image data holds promise for predicting drug resistance. High-content microscopy, which uses cell-based automated microscopy to capture information-rich images, has successfully categorized small molecule inhibitors by their mechanisms and targeted pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ljosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Perlman et al., 2004</xref>) and shown a relationship between morphological profiles and genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rohban et al., 2017</xref>), including specific mutations associated with lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caicedo et al., 2022</xref>). This profiling method often uses high-throughput microscopy, generating a large amount of image data from which thousands of quantitative, single-cell morphological features can be extracted to characterize signals that could not be discovered using low-throughput methods and would otherwise be impossible to study by eye. However, high-content microscopy has not been used to examine the features of resistance in the absence of drug treatment.</p><p>Here, we used Cell Painting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bray et al., 2016</xref>), a multiplex, fluorescence microscopy assay that labels eight cellular components using six stains imaged in five channels, as an unbiased method to characterize the morphological differences between bortezomib-resistant and -sensitive cancer cells. We applied a reproducible imaging- and computation-based profiling pipeline to process the images and identify a high-dimensional cell morphology signature to predict bortezomib resistance that we evaluated using machine learning best practices. This morphological signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of seven out of ten clones not included in the signature training dataset. Overall, our results establish a proof-of-concept framework for identifying unbiased signatures of drug resistance using high-content microscopy. The ability to identify drug-resistant cells based on morphological features provides a valuable method for characterizing resistance in the absence of drug treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolating and capturing Cell Painting profiles for HCT116-based bortezomib-resistant clones</title><p>We first isolated and characterized drug-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To isolate drug-resistant clones, we used an approach we have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kasap et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>) and the HCT116 cell line. These cancer cells express multidrug resistance pumps at low levels and are mismatch repair deficient, providing a genetically heterogeneous polyclonal population of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Papadopoulos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Teraishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Umar et al., 1994</xref>) allowing for isolation of drug-resistant clones in ~2–3 weeks. We hypothesized that a rapid selection of resistance could favor the isolation of clones with intrinsic resistance. To determine the appropriate drug concentrations to use in order to isolate drug-resistant clones, we performed proliferation assays on HCT116 parental cells with our drugs of interest: bortezomib, ixazomib, or CB-5083 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We also isolated bortezomib-sensitive (wild-type; WT) clones by dilution of the HCT116 parental cell line and acquired two published bortezomib-resistant clones (BZ clones A and E) both with mutations in PSMB5 identified by RNA sequencing performed in previous work (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>).

In contrast, bortezomib-sensitive clones had LD50s for bortezomib that ranged from ~0.7- to~1.2-fold that of HCT116 parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Together these methods provided a total of twelve bortezomib-resistant, five ixazomib-resistant, five CB-5083-resistant, and twelve bortezomib-sensitive clones as well as HCT116 parental cells for our experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design for using Cell Painting to examine morphological profiles of drug-resistant cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphic of the experimental workflow: we isolated drug-resistant clones by treating parental HCT116 cells with the desired drug and then expanded them for experiments.

Cell Painting captures signal in five imaging channels from six fluorescent dyes that stain cells for eight cellular components including mitochondria, actin, Golgi, plasma membrane, cytoplasmic RNA, nucleoli, endoplasmic reticulum, and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bray et al., 2016</xref>). With these images, we used CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>) to extract single-cell morphological features from individual cells. The signal from each of the five channels was analyzed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and total cell and characterized based on features (object parameters) such as signal intensity, shape of the object, texture of the staining pattern, etc. yielding a total of ~3500 features. These cellular features were combined and analyzed on a per well basis (well profiles) and then compared across cells and experimental conditions to determine whether morphological features of drug resistance could be reliably detected in the absence of drug treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A subset of morphological features contribute to the signature of bortezomib resistance</title><p>To examine whether there were any clear qualitative morphological differences between bortezomib-resistant and -sensitive cells we chose HCT116 parental cells, bortezomib-sensitive clones WT01-WT05, and bortezomib-resistant clones A, E, and BZ01-BZ05 for our initial studies.

The morphological profiles of bortezomib-resistant and bortezomib-sensitive cells did not cleanly distinguish clones based on bortezomib resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We saw a similar failure to distinguish clones based on bortezomib sensitivity after a short, 4 hr treatment with 7 nM bortezomib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that if there is a morphological difference between bortezomib-resistant and -sensitive cells, further feature refinement would be needed for its identification.</p><p>Each observed morphological measurement results from a combination of both technical and biological variables. It is therefore important to control and test for technical variables as these can confound subtle biologically relevant signatures. Using bortezomib-sensitive clones WT01-05 and bortezomib-resistant clones BZ01-05 to quantify and reduce the impact of technical variables, we fit a linear model to each morphological feature adjusting for technical variables (experimental run/batch, incubation time, cell count/density, clone ID) and biological variables (resistance status) (see Materials and methods). We then discarded morphological features with variances that correlated with experimental run (batch), incubation time (4 or 13 hours with 0.1% DMSO), cell density, or those features that varied between two or more pairs of bortezomib-sensitive clones (clone ID) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-E</xref>). Of the remaining morphological features, we only considered those that varied based on the resistance status of a clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This resulted in 45 morphological features that significantly contributed to a clone’s bortezomib resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We used these 45 features to compute a rank-based resistance score or ‘Bortezomib Signature’ for each well profile based on the direction-sensitive method called <italic>singscore</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foroutan et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Singscore</italic> ranks these 45 resistance-related features on a per sample basis and calculates a normalized score between –1 and 1, with higher values expected for bortezomib-resistant clones and lower values expected for bortezomib-sensitive clones. With the exception of some texture-based features, the Bortezomib Signature features were largely independent, displaying low pairwise correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then examined the grouping of features across compartments and channels and found radial distribution features were higher in resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Anticipating well location as a possible technical artifact, we plated our cells in a repeating serpentine pattern, ensuring that each clone would be imaged in multiple locations on a plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). We found that the pattern of Bortezomib Signatures did not correspond to well position relative to the plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>), indicating that the well position for each clone was not strongly contributing to its Bortezomib Signature. In addition, we found that the Bortezomib Signature correlated with the resistance status of clones and not technical variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). These data suggest that our analysis pipeline and signature building process minimized technical artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cell morphology predicts the bortezomib response of multiple clones across datasets</title><p>To evaluate the performance of the Bortezomib Signature, we used machine learning best practices, separating our data into training, validation, test, and holdout datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). The data initially used to create the Bortezomib Signature, which included well-based morphological profiles from clones WT01-05 and BZ01-05, was designated as the training dataset. The validation dataset was composed of well profiles from clones WT01-05 and BZ01-05 that were not used to generate the Bortezomib Signature but were collected on the same plates as the well profiles used for the training dataset. The test dataset was composed of well profiles from HCT116 parental cells and bortezomib-resistant clones A and E; these cells were not included in the training dataset, but their well profiles were collected on the same plates as those used for the training dataset. The holdout dataset was a separate plate and contained HCT116 parental cells, bortezomib-sensitive clones WT01-05, and bortezomib-resistant clones A, E, and BZ01-05. These datasets allowed us to test generalizability across clones and plates for the Bortezomib Signature.</p><p>We next examined whether the Bortezomib Signature was able to predict the bortezomib resistance of a clone based on morphological profiling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We called the clone bortezomib-resistant if the median Bortezomib Signature of all replicate well profiles was greater than zero and bortezomib-sensitive if the median Bortezomib Signature was less than zero. In the training dataset, the Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of all ten clones, with median Bortezomib Signatures for eight out of ten clones beyond the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The accuracy of the Bortezomib Signature was 88% while the average precision was 81% for the training dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) (see Materials and methods). The signature performed similarly well in the validation dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), with an accuracy of 92% and an average precision of 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In the test dataset the Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of all clones, although only HCT116 parental cells had a median Bortezomib Signature outside the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The test dataset had an accuracy of 80% and an average precision of 68% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Similarly, in the holdout dataset the Bortezomib Signature had an accuracy of 78% and an average precision of 69% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of twelve out of thirteen clones, with WT01 misclassified as bortezomib-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the holdout dataset, four of the twelve correctly characterized clones had median Bortezomib Signatures outside the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data. The Bortezomib Signature performed better than random chance in all testing conditions, as demonstrated by comparison with the mean accuracy and average precision for the randomly shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and as reflected in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which describe the classification trade-off between true positive and false positive rates in predicting bortezomib resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We then compared our linear-modeling approach to feature selection against other feature spaces and found that the Bortezomib Signature clusters same-type clones (bortezomib-resistant vs. bortezomib-sensitive) with higher enrichment compared to the full feature space, standard feature selection (see Materials and methods), or a random selection of 45 features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

If the Bortezomib Signature were a general signature of UPS-targeting drug resistance, we would expect it to perform equally well at characterizing the drug sensitivity of bortezomib-, ixazomib-, and CB-5083-resistant clones.

After processing profiles to reduce the impact of technical variables, we generated a signature of bortezomib resistance and characterized the performance of this signature using machine learning best practices. This Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of seven out of ten clones not included in the training dataset and was more specific to bortezomib-resistance given its limited ability to identify clones that were resistant to other UPS-targeting drugs, ixazomib and CB-5083. All three drugs tested target the UPS, however bortezomib and ixazomib both bind the same subunit of the proteasome, albeit with potentially non-overlapping spectrums of off-targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baggish et al., 2010</xref>). These data suggest that the Bortezomib Signature may be specific to the drug bortezomib and not a general signature of resistance to UPS-targeting drugs. The Bortezomib Signature is conceptually similar to the on-disease/off-disease score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heiser et al., 2020</xref>). Both require three phenotypic measurements: a target phenotype representing ideal, a disease phenotype, and a new phenotype to classify. However, our approach is technically different (non-parametric compared to linear projection) and our goals are different (phenotypic classification compared to perturbation alignment). Other methods also enable phenotype labeling, but they focus on single-sample annotation without regard to a target phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nyffeler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rohban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wawer et al., 2014</xref>). Our work demonstrates that there are morphological features of drug resistance in cells that can be identified using Cell Painting and provides a reproducible pipeline for generating morphological signatures of drug resistance.</p><p>The Bortezomib Signature’s performance was not perfect; it misclassified three clones not included in the training dataset. Interestingly, one of the misclassified clones (BZ06) had reduced sensitivity to mitoxantrone as well as bortezomib. Given the considerable genetic heterogeneity in this mismatch repair-deficient HCT116 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glaab and Tindall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Umar et al., 1994</xref>), it is possible that some misclassified clones have orthogonal mechanisms of resistance or unrelated mutations contributing to their morphological profiles. Targeted sequencing of the PSMB5 proteasome subunit in bortezomib-resistant clones may provide information regarding origins of these misclassifications, as multiple mutations have been identified in bortezomib-resistant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>). Determining the underlying reason for the misclassification of bortezomib-sensitive clones would require further studies.</p><p>Together, our work demonstrates the potential for morphological profiling with Cell Painting to be used as an unbiased method to characterize resistance in the absence of drug treatment. Our results indicate that different mechanisms of bortezomib resistance may generate distinct morphological profiles; with larger and broader training datasets, it may be possible to identify signatures for distinct mechanisms of bortezomib resistance as well as signatures of resistance to other drugs. Although it is unclear whether this method can be extended to patient samples, where identifying intrinsic drug resistance in cells prior to treatment has the potential to improve targeted cancer therapy, our results are an encouraging proof of concept. We expect that further refinement may develop Cell Painting as a tool for identifying drug-resistant cells, perhaps even guiding strategies to overcome resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HCT116</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-247; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">bortezomib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LC Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # 1408</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">taxol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # T7402</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mitoxantrone</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TOCRIS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # 4250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ixazomib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ApexBio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # A4007 batch 2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CB-5083</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MedChemExpress</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # HY-12861 batch 19554</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MitoTracker Deep Red</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # M22426</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phalloidin AF568</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # A12380</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Concanavalin A AF488</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # C11252</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hoechst 33342</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # 62249</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hoechst 33342</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # H3570</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wheat-germ agglutinin AF555</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # W32464</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SYTO14 Green</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat # S7576</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HCT116 cells (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link>) were purchased from ATCC (CCL-247) and were maintained in McCoy’s 5 A Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma) and cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.

After cells attached to the plate, 50 μL of media containing drug (bortezomib, ixazomib, CB-5083, taxol [Sigma], or mitoxantrone [TOCRIS]) was added to each well. The final DMSO concentration was 0.1% for all wells, including three wells with media only as background measurements. Plates were incubated for 72 hr at 5% CO2 and 37 °C before adding Alamar Blue (resazurin sodium salt, final concentration 50 μM). Cells were incubated with Alamar Blue for 3–4 hr and then imaged with a Synergy Neo plate reader using excitation: 550 nm and emission: 590 nm (Agilent). The average plate background (media only with 0.1% DMSO) was subtracted from the average fluorescence for each condition and the resulting value was normalized by dividing by the background-subtracted value for each condition’s control (cells treated with 0.1% DMSO).

At either 4 or 13 hr prior to fixation, cells were treated with either 0.1% DMSO or 7 nM bortezomib and 30 min prior to fixation cells were treated with MitoTracker Deep Red (500 nM, Invitrogen). 16% paraformaldehyde (EMS) was added to each well for a final concentration of 3.2% and cells were fixed in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. Wells were washed with HBSS (Invitrogen), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X for 15 min, and then washed twice with HBSS before incubating with staining solution (5 U/mL phalloidin AF568 [Invitrogen], 100 μg/mL concanavalin A AF488 [Invitrogen], 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 [ThermoFisher or Invitrogen], 1.5 μg/mL wheat-germ agglutinin AF555 [Invitrogen], 3 μM SYTO14 Green [Invitrogen], and 1% bovine serum albumin [BioWorld] in HBSS) in the dark for 30 minutes.

We performed per-plate illumination correction to adjust for uneven background intensity that commonly impacts microscopy images. We also developed per-plate analysis pipelines for single-cell segmentation and feature extraction. We extracted 3,528 total cell morphology features from all 25,331,572 cells we captured in this experiment. The 3528 features represent stain intensities, stain co-localization, textures, areas, and other patterns extracted from all five imaging channels and different segmentation objects (nuclei, cytoplasm, total cells).

We first used cytominer-database to ingest all single-cell, per-compartment CellProfiler output files (comma separated) to clean column names, evaluate integrity of CellProfiler output CSVs, and output single-cell SQLite files for downstream processing. Next, we used pycytominer (github hash c1aa34b641b4e07eb5cbd424166f31355abdbd4d) for all image-based profiling pipeline steps. In the first step, we median aggregated all single cells to form well-level profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Way et al., 2022</xref>). Next, we performed a step called annotation, which merges the consistent platemap metadata with the well-level profiles. Third, we performed standard z-score normalization to ensure all features are measured on the same scale with zero mean and unit variance. Lastly, we performed feature selection, which removed features with low variance, high correlation (&gt;0.9 Pearson correlation), features with missing values, features on our blocklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Way, 2020</xref>), and features with outliers greater than 15 standard deviations, which we suspected were measured in error. For developing our final analytical datasets (see section, Constructing the resistance signature) we performed normalization within each plate but performed a combined feature selection across all plates per analytical dataset using the same procedures described previously, which resulted in 782 features. We applied the same pipeline uniformly across all plates. We did not detect large differences in variance that could be attributed to well position and batch and therefore did not apply batch effect correction.

To generate our training dataset, we selected a set of six plates consisting of five bortezomib-sensitive and five bortezomib-resistant clones that we collected on three different days, which showed high within-replicate reproducibility (technical replicates; data not shown). A seventh plate was held-out from signature generation in order to analyze generalizability between plates (holdout dataset).

We excluded features that were significantly different across incubation times, batches, and cell counts. We also excluded features that were different within clone type (features varying between two or more pairs of bortezomib-sensitive clones) to reduce the contribution of features that may mark generic inter-clone differences nonspecific to resistance status. This procedure resulted in a total of 45 features that were significantly different by resistance status and not significantly impacted by any of the technical covariates we considered. Of the 45 features, 14 had higher values in resistant clones and 31 had lower values in resistant clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We were also interested in comparing the ability of different feature spaces to cluster clones of the same type (resistant vs. sensitive). This analysis would determine if the Bortezomib Signature features, which we derived using linear modeling to isolate biological from technical variables, had a greater ability to cluster. We compared the Bortezomib Signature against three other feature spaces: (1) the full feature space, (2) standard feature selection (see Image data processing methods), and (3) 45 randomly selected features. We performed two analyses using these four feature spaces including Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) and k-means clustering. For UMAP, we used default umap-learn parameters to identify two UMAP coordinates per feature space. We then visualized the clusters by their resistance status and Bortezomib Signature score. The UMAP analysis represents a qualitative analysis. Next, we applied k-means clustering with 25 initializations across a range of 2–14 clusters (k). Prior to clustering and for each feature space, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and transformed each feature space into 30 principal components. This step was necessary to compare k-means clustering metrics, which are sensitive to the feature space dimensionality. We applied a Fisher’s exact test to each cluster using a two-by-two contingency matrix that specified cluster membership for each clone classification (resistant vs. sensitive). We visualized the mean odds ratio and max cluster odds ratio for each feature space across k. A high odds ratio tells us that the feature space effectively clusters clones of the same resistance status. Lastly, we calculated Silhouette width (the average proximity between samples in one cluster to the second nearest cluster) for each feature space across k.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Applying the signature</title><p>We used the <italic>singscore</italic> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foroutan et al., 2018</xref>) to characterize individual profiles of different clones as either bortezomib-resistant or bortezomib-sensitive. <italic>Singscore</italic> is a rank-based method that was originally developed to analyze the direction and significance of previously defined molecular signatures on transcriptomic data. The method calculates a two-part signature for each direction list (14 up and 31 down) and calculates an internal rank per profile of how highly ranked and lowly ranked each of the up and down features are, respectively. The method then adds the up and down rank scores to form a total <italic>singscore</italic> per sample, which ranges between –1 and 1 and represents a rank-based normalized concordance score that can be directly compared across profiles that may have been normalized differently. Therefore, the score is robust to outliers and different normalization procedures. In addition to calculating the <italic>singscore</italic> per sample, we also calculated <italic>singscore</italic> with 1,000 random permutations, in which we randomly shuffled feature rankings to derive a range in which a sample may be scored by chance. Some profiles were consistently predicted incorrectly with high confidence but in the opposite direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For a well-level profile to be categorized as high-confidence (in either the correct or incorrect directions), it needed to score beyond the 95% confidence interval of the randomly permuted data range. For example, a high-confidence incorrect resistant profile would have a Bortezomib Signature below 95% confidence interval of the randomly permuted data. To evaluate the features driving the differences in these samples, we applied two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests per Bortezomib Signature feature. We applied these tests to two separate groups: (1) misclassified bortezomib-sensitive vs. high-confidence accurate bortezomib-sensitive and (2) misclassified bortezomib-resistant vs. high-confidence accurate bortezomib-resistant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Signature evaluation</title><p>We used several metrics to evaluate signature quality across five different evaluation scenarios (validation, test, holdout, other UPS-targeting drugs, and clones not included in the training dataset [biological replicates]). Because we are measuring a binary decision in a balanced dataset (roughly the same amount of positive as negative classes), we used accuracy (total correct / total chances) to quantify performance. We also calculated mean average precision using sci-kit learn, averaging over samples along the precision recall curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Varoquaux et al., 2011</xref>), which is a measure of separation between the two resistance classes (higher being more separation). We also calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) using sci-kit learn. AUROC compares the ability to distinguish positive samples across signatures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91362-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated during this study are provided in the dataset cpg0028-kelley-resistance, available in the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/">https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/</ext-link>).

We were very pleased with the timely communications from Review Commons, and we are grateful to have been assigned this insightful and constructive group of reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers were well-suited to evaluate our work based on their stated areas of expertise (cancer biology, image analysis, machine learning, cell-based screening, etc.). As such, we received thoughtful and constructive feedback, which we have already incorporated into our attached revision. We are confident that these reviews have improved our manuscript.</p><p>Our goal with this manuscript is to present a proof-of-concept study where high-content imaging and morphological profiling are used to characterize drug resistance in clonal cell lines. The main criticism from reviewers was that our original manuscript may have overstated our method’s ability to discriminate the signal of bortezomib resistance and that any extension beyond cultured cells (to patient samples for example) would require significant follow-up studies. The reviewers suggested that such work would be beyond the scope of our study, and recommended toning down our language to better reflect the limitations of this proof-of-concept work. We have embraced this suggestion, extensively revising our text, and we now believe our language and tone more accurately reflects our results. The reviewers also suggested follow-up computational analyses to more robustly characterize the bortezomib resistance signature. We have performed these analyses and added their description to our revised manuscript. We feel that these analyses have improved understanding of the signature, and will help a reader to gain a deeper understanding of our results and methodology.</p><p>The reviewers also suggested several minor changes; many of which we embraced fully, but others that we chose not to incorporate. We felt that a lack of clarity in our text contributed to these reviewer suggestions. In these cases, we improved clarity in the text and responded to each comment point-by-point in the “prefer not to carry out” section. Further, we address all reviewer comments in the following document point-by-point, grouped by common themes across reviewers (e.g., tone, clarity, analyses, etc.).</p><p>Lastly, a common theme among reviewer comments was their appreciation for our strong methodology and data transparency (examples pasted below). We are extremely gratified by this observation as we feel this is a particular strength of our manuscript. In addition, we were pleased to see reviewers engaged by our work, acknowledging the interest this manuscript is likely to generate among a broad range of scientific disciplines.</p><p>Examples of reviewer appreciation of our strong methodology and data transparency:</p><p>Reviewer 1: “However, this does not imply that the same approach can not achieve the goal, perhaps by using other cell painting markers for bortezomib-sensitivity, or with the same markers to assess sensitivity of different drugs. The cell painting + analysis approaches are not new and the clinical impact is questionable, but the technical aspects (data, analysis) are exceptional and the concept may hold as I described above.”</p><p>Reviewer 2: <bold>“</bold>The paper is well written, and the text is clear, as is the presentation of data and transparency of methods being utilized. The methods were applied appropriately and followed established standards in the field. The paper's premise is timely and interesting, addressing a pressing issue in cancer therapy: making informed treatment decisions fast, based on markers found in tumors early in tumor development, and using image-based screening for characterizing drug resistance before treatment could be an option. A fascinating bit of the manuscript is the description of the feature selection from the screen is done systematically, considering the technical and biological variability and technical artifacts and modeling covariates using linear models seems a very appropriate way of doing so and could serve as another proof of concept that this is indeed the most robust way of modeling and removing signal of technical covariates from the data.”</p><p>Reviewer 3: “The strengths of this study are the machine learning best practice and detailed methodology. The experiments could be reproduced and statistical analysis is more than adequate. The analysis takes into account batch effects, well position, differences in cell numbers, and other sources of technical variation that complicate high-content image analysis. It is a good exemplar of how unsupervised morphological profiling can be applied to imaging data. The major limitation is the generalizability of this particular method for patient samples. This could be addressed in the Discussion.”</p><p><italic>Description of the revisions</italic></p><p>We have incorporated all planned revisions.</p><p><italic>Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</italic></p><p>Text revisions already carried out</p><p>[Text revision] We have materially toned down our claims in the manuscript in two distinct areas: (A) model performance and (B) potential clinical application.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Model performance. We specifically balanced our discussion of the discriminative signal of the Bortezomib Signature. While the signature adequately separated never-before-seen wildtype and resistant clones with metrics well above randomly permuted baselines (accuracy near 80%, average precision about 70%, area under the ROC curve (AUROC) about 84%), there were many limitations that we should have more explicitly highlighted. For example, many individual profiles were incorrectly classified, some clones were predicted entirely incorrectly, and many profiles did not receive Bortezomib Signature scores above the randomly permuted baseline. We have more clearly discussed these limitations and used more balanced language (see key examples of text-based changes below). Additionally, we modified a figure (now Figure 3) to include boxplots of clones that explicitly show the Bortezomib Signature scores of each well profile and permit examination of the strength of the signature for each clone (previously found in Figure 2-Supplement 9). Lastly, we add a new supplementary figure (now Figure 5-Supplement 1) that describes a feature space analysis of misclassified samples. Please note that this figure rearrangement and new analysis helped to balance our claims, but were also performed in response to other tangential reviewer comments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinical application. In the abstract, introduction, and discussion, we further emphasized that this work is a proof of concept, and that more advances must be made prior to clinical application.</p></list-item></list><p>We made these changes in direct response to the following reviewer comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Major Comment 1 (relevant excerpts)</p><p>While I am convinced that the signature captures morphological phenotypes associated with drug resistance, at the cumulative scale, the discriminative signal of a single cell type seems weak… With Fig. 4, the data fully supports the argument that the bortezomib-signature encodes bortezomib-resistance, but the signal is weak. Thus statements such as &quot;We found the Bortezomib Signature could predict whether a cell line was bortezomib-resistant or bortezomib-sensitive&quot; (line #172) and the specificity statements in the abstract&quot; (line #28) are not supported by the data in my opinion. I would recommend the authors to tune down these and other related statements throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer cross-commenting - Reviewer 1</p><p>My main critic is regarding &quot;over selling&quot; a weak discriminative signal. Specifically, I am not convinced that the major claims regarding predicting sensitivity and specificity at the single cell types scales are supported by the data. Since reviewer #2 and #3 did not raise this concern I think it is worth discussion here.</p><p>Once these statements are tuned down - I think no significant additional work is needed to make the point that they can measure a discriminative signal. If they want to make these claims, perhaps they'd like to collect more data to gain statistical power (but I am not optimistic this will work at the single cell level).</p><p>Personally, I was happy with the authors' choice of cell lines not included in the training dataset. I am not convinced that additional cell lines + validations are necessary for making the point of a proof of principle.</p><p>Reviewer cross-commenting - Reviewer 2</p><p>I agree that, perhaps, my major criticism of the paper was the manuscript's 'overselling' of claims that were only weakly supported by the data. Yes, if the authors tune down their claims and clearly state that this is an interesting starting point and proof of concept study, it might be ok to publish with only minor revisions. If the claims should be more generalized, then this study needs more data supporting the conclusions and the method's predictive power.</p><p>Reviewer 2 - Major Comment 8</p><p>Lastly, I find some misfits between the question, the model used, and the conclusions drawn. The authors start by exploring the problem of bortezomib resistance in cancer treatment, which they say is a devastating issue for patients with, e.g., multiple myeloma. Yet, the authors use HCT116 as their model cell line, a microsatellite instable, colorectal cell line with several intrinsic mutations that make it a difficult model to address physiologically relevant medical problems after all. The authors then go on to suppose that their method might be suitable to diagnose resistance in patient samples, but I am not convinced this conclusion can be speculated based on data from HCT cells. I suggest the authors test their approach on at least two other cell lines (maybe from different tissues) and benchmark their results against a dataset of digital pathology where such predictions are made from stained and analyzed tissue slices. This way, after a thorough benchmark against related third-party data sets, the method would significantly gain relevance, the paper would appeal to a broader audience, and the advance gains more merit.</p><p>Reviewer 3 - Major Comment 5</p><p>It is not clear from the Discussion whether this type of analysis is more broadly applicable to cell lines derived from patients, rather than selected from a parental cell line, or if this approach would be more efficient than genotyping or next-gen sequencing. How many replicates and ground truth cell lines would be necessary for predictive confidence?</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the last two sentences of the abstract to tone down specificity claims (“provide evidence”) and clarify that we are establishing a “proof-of-concept framework”.</p><p>“This signature predicted bortezomib resistance better than resistance to other drugs targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our results establish a proof-of-concept framework for the unbiased analysis of drug resistance using high-content microscopy of cancer cells, in the absence of drug treatment.”</p><p>We revised the last paragraph of the introduction to contrast bortezomib predictions with ixazomib/CB-5083 predictions, and to remove claims about “using microscopy to guide therapy”.</p><p>“This morphological signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of seven out of ten clones not included in the signature training dataset. Overall, our results establish a proof-of-concept framework for identifying unbiased signatures of drug resistance using high-content microscopy. The ability to identify drug-resistant cells based on morphological features provides a valuable orthogonal method for characterizing resistance in the absence of drug treatment.”</p><p>To tone down claims in the figures, we added boxplots to Figure 3 (previous Figure 2) showing specific distribution of signature scores per well profile and updated Figure 4 legend (previous Figure 3).</p><p>“Figure 4. Bortezomib Signature has limited ability to characterize clones resistant to other ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitors.”</p><p>We modify the following text in the discussion to tone down claims of specificity and clinical utility:</p><p>“This Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of seven out of ten clones not included in the training dataset and was more specific to bortezomib-resistance given its limited ability to identify clones that were resistant to other UPS-targeting drugs.</p><p>Though it is unclear whether this method can be extended to patient samples, where identifying intrinsic drug resistance in cells prior to treatment has the potential to improve targeted cancer therapy, our results are an encouraging proof of concept. We expect that further refinement may develop Cell Painting as a tool for identifying drug-resistant cells, perhaps even guiding strategies to overcome intrinsic resistance.”</p><p>[Text revision] We defined LD50 in text (originally line #97), changed description of resistant clone selection to remove main text references to LD90 (originally line #87), and stated drug concentrations used for selection in Methods. We also defined LD90 in the Methods and described its role in determining the drug concentrations to use for clone selection. This change was in response to the following comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 2</p><p>What is LD90 (line #87)? LD50 (line #97)?</p><p>Reviewer 2 - Minor Comment 5</p><p>What was the LD 90 per drug on HCT cells? Rather than LD90 foldchanges, absolute concentrations should be used in the results and discussion to allow the reader to vet the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>“To determine the appropriate drug concentrations to use in order to isolate drug-resistant clones, we performed proliferation assays on HCT116 parental cells with our drugs of interest: bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor), ixazomib (proteasome inhibitor), or CB-5083 (p97 inhibitor) (Fig. 1-Supplement 1 A-D).”</p><p>“We characterized the bortezomib-resistant clones and found that the median lethal doses (LD50s) were ~2.8- to ~9-fold that of HCT116 parental cells (Fig. 1-Supplement 2 B).”</p><p>“Briefly, HCT116 cells were plated in 150 mm dishes and grown in the presence of the desired drug at a concentration that resulted in the death of the majority of cells (selection concentrations: bortezomib, 12 nM; ixazomib, 150 nM; CB-5083, 600 and 700 nM).”</p><p>“Using the data from our proliferation assays, we calculated the median lethal dose (LD50) for each of our drugs of interest by fitting data of normalized growth vs. log[drug concentration] to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism (v.9.2.0) (Fig. 1-Supplement 1 D).”</p><p>[Text revision] We thank the reviewer for allowing us an opportunity to improve clarity on the clones we used. We now describe the total number of clones generated and removed unnecessary references to specific clones for ease of reading (originally lines #96-98) (We maintain all references to specific clones in the figures, legends, supplement, and methods)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 3</p><p>It was not clear to me in the text which and how many cell lines were evaluated and the reader is forced to go to the SI.

Summary of the data (for example, based on Figure 2-Supplement 8) can be briefly mentioned in the text to make it more clear for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following to the second paragraph of the results:</p><p>“Together these methods provided a total of twelve bortezomib-resistant, five ixazomib-resistant, five CB-5083-resistant, and twelve bortezomib-sensitive clones as well as HCT116 parental cells for our experiments.”</p><p>[Text revision] We removed duplicate text (originally lines #115-125).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 5</p><p>Lines #104-111 were duplicated in lines #114-122.</p><p>Reviewer 3 - Minor Comment 4</p><p>Ten lines of text are duplicated on page 5.</p><p>Reviewer 2 - Minor Comment 4 on page 5, paragraph 4, there is a sizeable copy-and-paste error of text being identically replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>[Text revision] We provided more intuition of the Bortezomib Signature in the results section (originally lines #150-151).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 6</p><p>The &quot;Bortezomib Signature&quot; is a critical measurement but is only briefly mentioned in lines 150-151 (&quot;...based on the direction-sensitive ranking method for phenotype analysis, singscore (Foroutan et al., 2018)&quot;).

Furthermore, one of the strengths of our approach is that it can identify resistant clones in an unbiased fashion prior to molecular characterization. It is beyond scope to perform these sequencing studies in the present paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 - Minor Comment 3</p><p>The authors talk about validating the mutation - PSMB5 by RNA-seq.

Though it is unclear whether this method can be extended to patient samples, where identifying intrinsic drug resistance in cells prior to treatment has the potential to improve targeted cancer therapy, our results are an encouraging proof of concept. We expect that further refinement may develop Cell Painting as a tool for identifying drug-resistant cells, perhaps even guiding strategies to overcome intrinsic resistance.”</p><p>[Text revision] We thank the reviewers for their suggestions. We agree that the description of the experimental design was somewhat unclear and have provided greater detail and clarity, particularly regarding the generation of clones. We used the HCT116 parental cell line to generate drug-resistant clones by identifying single surviving cells after drug treatment and allowing these cells to expand prior to isolating colonies for experimentation. We did not perform experiments to confirm whether these “clones” were isogenic and can not exclude cell migration during expansion or genetic drift as convoluting factors. However, we have provided greater detail in the descriptions of our method for clone isolation in order to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 1</p><p>More information in Fig. 1's legend would be helpful to follow the experimental design. I found it hard to follow in its current form and had to go back to carefully reading the main text to fully understand.</p><p>Reviewer 2 - Minor Comment 6</p><p>The description of the resistant clonal populations is confusing. As I understand, no single-cell clones were isolated during the selection procedure. Thus, the training lines are not yet isogenic clones but oligoclonal sub-populations of the parental cell line. The authors could provide more details here and discuss the different characteristics of their sub-populations, e.g., their growth kinetics or molecular alterations.</p></disp-quote><p>We bolstered the description in the results.</p><p>“We first isolated and characterized drug-resistant cells (Fig. 1 A). To isolate drug-resistant clones, we used an approach we have described previously (Wacker et al. 2012; Kasap, Elemento, and Kapoor 2014) and the HCT116 cell line. These cancer cells express multidrug resistance pumps at low levels and are mismatch repair deficient, providing a genetically heterogeneous polyclonal population of cells (Umar et al. 1994; Papadopoulos et al. 1994; Teraishi et al. 2005) allowing for isolation of drug-resistant clones in 2-3 weeks. We hypothesize that a rapid selection of resistance could favor the isolation of clones with intrinsic resistance. To determine the appropriate drug concentrations to use in order to isolate drug-resistant clones, we performed proliferation assays on HCT116 parental cells with our drugs of interest: bortezomib, ixazomib, or CB-5083 (Fig. 1-Supplement 1 A-D). We also isolated bortezomib-sensitive (wild-type; WT) clones by dilution of the HCT116 parental cell line and acquired two published bortezomib-resistant clones (BZ clones A and E) both with mutations in PSMB5 identified by RNA sequencing performed in previous work (Fig. 1-Supplement 1 E) (Wacker et al. 2012). We characterized the bortezomib-resistant clones and found that the median lethal doses (LD50s) for bortezomib were ~2.8- to ~9-fold that of HCT116 parental cells (Fig. 1-Supplement 2 B). In contrast, bortezomib-sensitive clones had LD50s for bortezomib that ranged from ~0.7- to ~1.2-fold that of HCT116 parental cells (Fig. 1-Supplement 2 A). Together these methods provided a total of twelve bortezomib-resistant, five ixazomib-resistant, five CB-5083-resistant, and twelve bortezomib-sensitive clones as well as HCT116 parental cells for our experiments.”</p><p>We also updated the legend for Figure 1A.</p><p>“Figure 1. Experimental design for using Cell Painting to examine morphological profiles of drug-resistant cells. (A) Graphic of the experimental workflow: we isolated drug-resistant clones by treating parental HCT116 cells with a high dose of the desired drug and then expanded them for experiments. We isolated drug-sensitive clones by diluting HCT116 cells and then expanded them for experiments. We then performed proliferation assays on select clones to screen for multidrug resistance. Next, we performed Cell Painting on both drug-resistant and -sensitive clones, using multiplexed high-throughput fluorescence microscopy of fixed cells followed by feature extraction and morphological profiling to search for features that contribute to a signature of drug resistance.”</p><p>[Text revision] We clarified that the Bortezomib Signature did not correspond to well position (originally lines #155-157).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 9</p><p>Line #155-156: &quot;We found that the pattern of Bortezomib Signatures corresponded to the cell identity plate layout&quot;, the word &quot;not&quot; is missing before &quot;corresponded&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>“We found that the pattern of Bortezomib Signatures did not correspond to well position relative to the plate (Fig. 2-Supplement 7 B), indicating that the well position for each clone was not strongly contributing to its Bortezomib Signature.”</p><p>[Text revision] We explicitly described the result that some misclassified clones (WT10, WT15, and BZ06) did not have unexpected bortezomib sensitivity as determined by proliferation assays.

Proliferation assays conducted in earlier experiments showed that WT10 and WT15 were sensitive to bortezomib while BZ06 was resistant (Fig. 1-Supplement 2 A and B). By comparing these incorrect predictions with high-confidence correct predictions, we observed differences that varied by clone type, suggesting unique morphology may be driving each of these misclassifications (Fig. 5-Supplement 1 B and C). These results are consistent with the Bortezomib Signature being generalizable to clones not included in the training dataset and suggest that morphological profiling has the potential to identify bortezomib-resistant clones based on the morphological features of cells in the absence of drug treatment.”</p><p>[Text revision] We clarified that the metrics (accuracy and average precision) were based on median Bortezomib Signature scores of all replicate well-level profiles per clone. We can compare samples based on rank, and difference from 95% confidence interval of permuted data. There is no current way for our method to assign a likelihood.

We called the clone bortezomib-resistant if the median Bortezomib Signature of all replicate well profiles was greater than zero and bortezomib-sensitive if the median Bortezomib Signature less than zero. In the training dataset, the Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of all ten clones, with median Bortezomib Signatures for eight out of ten clones beyond the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data (Fig. 3 A). The accuracy of the Bortezomib Signature was 88% while the average precision was 81% for the training dataset (Fig. 3-Supplement 2 A and B) (see Methods). The signature performed similarly well in the validation dataset (Fig. 3 B), with an accuracy of 92% and an average precision of 89% (Fig. 3-Supplement 2 A and B). In the test dataset the Bortezomib Signature correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of all clones, though only HCT116 parental cells had a median Bortezomib Signature outside the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data (Fig. 3 C). The test dataset had an accuracy of 80% and an average precision of 68% (Fig. 3-Supplement 2 A and B). Similarly, in the holdout dataset the Bortezomib Signature had an accuracy of 78% and an average precision of 69% (Fig.3 -Supplement 2 A and B), and correctly predicted the bortezomib resistance of twelve out of thirteen clones, with WT01 misclassified as bortezomib-resistant (Fig. 3 D). In the holdout dataset, four of the twelve correctly characterized clones had median Bortezomib Signatures outside the 95% confidence interval for the randomly permuted data.”</p><p>We also mirrored language when discussing the ixazomib and CB-5083 results.</p><p>“However, only two of the four correctly identified ixazomib-resistant clones and one of the three CB-5083-resistant clones had median Bortezomib Signatures outside the 95% confidence interval of the randomly permuted data. The area under the ROC (AUROC) curve for ixazomib-resistant and CB-5083-resistant clones (0.63 and 0.60, respectively) was lower than those calculated for the training, validation, test, and holdout datasets. In addition, many of the Bortezomib Signatures for well profiles of ixazomib- and CB-5083-resistant clones, particularly those for CB-5083-resistant clones, landed within the 95% confidence interval of the randomly permuted data. These results suggest that the Bortezomib Signature is not a general signature of UPS-targeting drug resistance and instead has some specificity for bortezomib.”</p><p>[Text revision] We added an explicit note that our image analysis pipelines are also publicly available.

We agree with the reviewer that a discussion of these two methods would help clarify our phenotypic signature concept. The on/off score is about the degree to which a perturbation pushes disease towards a healthy state. In this case we have 3 sets of data: healthy samples (used for training), disease samples (used for training), and the sample we want to score, which should be of the form &quot;disease + perturbation&quot;. With our approach, based on singscore, we also have 3 sets of data: sensitive samples (used for training), resistance samples (used for training), and the sample we want to score. Here, our sample we want to score could be anything, not necessarily of the form &quot;resistance + perturbation&quot;. Furthermore, singscore does not have the concept of orthogonality to resistance/sensitivity. This would become relevant if we were exploring perturbations or conditions that would induce a resistant cell line to become sensitive, but we are not doing that here. There are other statistical differences (projection vs. rank based etc.) but the key difference is the applicability of the method to the specific problem at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 - Minor Comment 7</p><p>How is the Bortezomib Signature related to the &quot;on-disease&quot;/&quot;off-disease&quot; scores described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.054387v1.full?

Other methods also enable phenotype labeling, but they focus on single-sample annotation without regard to a target phenotype (Wawer et al. 2014; Rohban et al. 2017; Simm et al. 2018; Nyffeler et al. 2020).”</p><p>Figure revisions already carried out</p><p>[Figure revision] We moved all boxplots from the original Fig. 2-Supplement 9 to the main text (also splitting Fig. 2 into Fig. 2 and 3).

We feel that it is beyond scope of this manuscript to disentangle the molecular alterations that cause bortezomib resistance based on our Cell Painting insights. This wet lab experimental process is arduous and cost prohibitive, and we argue that one of the benefits of taking a morphology approach to resistance status is that we can detect resistant cells (and therefore cells that won’t die when presented with a treatment) without knowing the molecular mechanism.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewer has encouraged us to enhance the ability for a reader to view and interpret the signature to perhaps more easily facilitate future work.

A more focused analysis of their data that highlights aspects of the study either for the machine learning community, the cell biology community, or the precision oncology community would greatly benefit the manuscript's impact.

Therefore, we have performed two new computational experiments to compare our linear modeling feature selection approach against other standard approaches. We demonstrate that our linear modeling approach is effective at isolating the core differences between resistant and sensitive classes.</p><p>Specifically, we performed two analyses: (A) UMAP and (B) k-means cluster analysis. We analyzed profiles defined by four different feature selection approaches: (1) Using all traditional CellProfiler features; (2) Using the traditional CellProfiler feature selection approach (removing low variance features, high correlating features, etc.); (3) Using 45 random features (same size as Bortezomib Signature); and (4) Using only the bortezomib signature features. We performed Fisher’s exact tests to derive odds ratios of cluster membership by resistance status and calculated Silhouette widths to quantify relative proximity of clusters.</p><p>This analysis generates a new supplementary figure (see below), and demonstrates that the linear-modeling-based feature selection isolated the features driving the differences between the clone types (resistance vs. wildtype) while the standard approaches do not as effectively separate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 - Major Comment 5:</p><p>A fascinating bit of the manuscript is the description of the feature selection from the screen is done systematically, considering the technical and biological variability and technical artifacts and modeling covariates using linear models seems a very appropriate way of doing so and could serve as another proof of concept that this is indeed the most robust way of modeling and removing signal of technical covariates from the data. Yet, I wondered why the authors do not discuss other means of feature selection or dimensionality reduction; further, they need to show how the features cluster the cell lines or why impact (information content) different features deliver. For an audience interested in the technical aspects of cell painting analysis and machine learning based on the data, that would, IMHO, be the most exciting questions.</p></disp-quote><p>Additionally, we add the following to the results section:</p><p>“We then compared our linear-modeling approach to feature selection against other feature spaces and found that the Bortezomib Signature clusters same-type clones (bortezomib-resistant vs. bortezomib-sensitive) with higher enrichment compared to the full feature space, standard feature selection (see Methods), or a random selection of 45 features (Fig 3-Supplement 3).”</p><p>And methods section, describing this analysis:</p><p>“We were also interested in comparing the ability of different feature spaces to cluster clones of the same type (resistant vs. sensitive). This analysis would determine if the Bortezomib Signature features, which we derived using linear modeling to isolate biological from technical variables, had a greater ability to cluster. We compared the Bortezomib Signature against three other feature spaces: (1) the full feature space, (2) standard feature selection (see Image data processing methods), and (3) 45 randomly selected features. We performed two analyses using these four feature spaces including Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (McInnes et al. 2018) and k-means clustering. For UMAP, we used default umap-learn parameters to identify two UMAP coordinates per feature space. We then visualized the clusters by their resistance status and Bortezomib Signature score. The UMAP analysis represents a qualitative analysis. Next, we applied k-means clustering with 25 initializations across a range of 2-14 clusters (k). Prior to clustering and for each feature space, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and transformed each feature space into 30 principal components. This step was necessary to compare k-means clustering metrics, which are sensitive to the feature space dimensionality. We applied a Fisher’s exact test to each cluster using a two-by-two contingency matrix that specified cluster membership for each clone classification (resistant vs. sensitive). We visualized the mean odds ratio and max cluster odds ratio for each feature space across k. A high odds ratio tells us that the feature space effectively clusters clones of the same resistance status. Lastly, we calculated Silhouette width (the average proximity between samples in one cluster to the second nearest cluster) for each feature space across k.”</p><p>The code change to derive the UMAP coordinates, perform clustering, and generate the figure is available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/profiling-resistance-mechanisms/pull/132</p><p>[New analysis] [Response to Reviewer 3 - Major Comment 1] We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which allowed us to explore the misclassified samples in more depth. We added a new supplementary figure in which we summarized all bortezomib clones (wildtype and resistant) in their accuracy based on the bortezomib signature (panel A). We did not include training set samples in this analysis. Using samples that were consistently incorrectly classified with high confidence (three samples: WT15, BZ06, WT10) we performed two separate two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests. Specifically, we compared high incorrect wildtype to high correct wildtype and high incorrect resistant to high correct resistant.

To evaluate the features driving the differences in these samples, we applied two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests per Bortezomib Signature feature.
