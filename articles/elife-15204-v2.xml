In contrast, reduplicating chromosomes without separation frequently produces polytene chromosomes, a barrier to accurate mitosis. Chromosome reduplication occurs in many contexts, including: polytene tissue development, polytene tumors, and following treatment with mitosis-blocking chemotherapeutics. However, mechanisms responding to or resolving polyteny during mitosis are poorly understood. Here, using <italic>Drosophila,</italic> we uncover two distinct reduplicated chromosome responses. First, when reduplicated polytene chromosomes persist into metaphase, an anaphase delay prevents tissue malformation and apoptosis. Second, reduplicated polytene chromosomes can also separate prior to metaphase through a spindle-independent mechanism termed Separation-Into-Recent-Sisters (SIRS). Both reduplication responses require the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad2. While Mad2 delays anaphase separation of metaphase polytene chromosomes, Mad2’s control of overall mitotic timing ensures efficient SIRS. Our results pinpoint mechanisms enabling continued proliferation after genome reduplication, a finding with implications for cancer progression and prevention.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15204.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15204.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15204.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it duplicates all its genetic information, which is stored on chromosomes. Then, each chromosome evenly divides into two new cells so that each cell ends up with identical copies of the genetic information. Because the cellular machinery that evenly divides chromosomes is built to recognize chromosomes that were duplicated exactly once, it is important to maintain this pattern of alternating one round of duplication with one round of division. Cells that instead duplicate their chromosomes more than once can make mistakes during division that are associated with diseases such as cancer.</p><p>Chromosomes with extra duplications are present in normal tissues such as the placenta of mammals. They can also occur in human diseases and may even result from chemotherapy treatment. However, we know almost nothing about how cells respond to these problematic chromosomes when dividing.</p><p>By studying cells from the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> species of fruit fly, Stormo and Fox discovered two distinct ways in which cells respond to extra chromosome duplications. One response occurs in cells that were experimentally engineered to undergo an extra chromosome duplication. These cells delay division so that the chromosome separation machinery can somehow adapt to the challenge of separating more than two chromosome copies at once. The second response occurs in cells that naturally undergo extra chromosome duplications before division. In these cells, Stormo and Fox discovered a new type of chromosome separation, whereby the extra chromosome copies move apart from each other before cell division. In doing so the chromosomes can better interact with the chromosome separation machinery during division.</p><p>Stormo and Fox also found that a protein named Mad2 is important in both responses, and gives the cell enough time to respond to extra chromosome copies. Without Mad2, the separation of chromosomes with extra duplications is too hasty, and can lead to severe cell division errors and cause organs to form incorrectly.</p><p>Having uncovered two new responses that cells use to adapt to extra chromosomes, it will now be important to find other proteins like Mad2 that are important in these events. Understanding these processes and the proteins involved in more detail could help to prevent diseases that are associated with extra chromosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15204.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15204.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>C. pipiens</kwd><kwd>polytene</kwd><kwd>diplochromosome</kwd><kwd>endocycle</kwd><kwd>Mad2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Donald T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Donald T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitosis of reduplicated chromosomes is under careful regulation and can be perfectly executed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulating mitotic chromosome structure is critical to preventing genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfau and Amon, 2012</xref>). During mitosis, chromatids associate in sister pairs, which facilitates their bi-orientation and subsequent segregation to opposite spindle poles. A frequently occurring and long-recognized departure from this paired chromosome structure occurs when the genome reduplicates without chromatid separation (hereafter: genome reduplication). Following a single extra S-phase, cells frequently form diplochromosomes: four sister chromatids conjoined at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White, 1935</xref>). A more general term for chromosomes formed by any degree of genome reduplication without chromatid separation is 'polytene' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Painter, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhimulev et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>While incompletely understood, it is appreciated that multiple layers of physical connections tightly intertwine the multiple sister chromatids of polytene chromosomes. These connections likely include cohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cunningham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pauli et al., 2010</xref>) as well as topological entanglements that can be removed by Condensin II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, recurring regions of DNA under-replication occur between chromatids in some polytene cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beliaeva et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannibal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nordman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yarosh and Spradling, 2014</xref>) whereas DNA replication is more complete in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dej and Spradling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to connections between sister chromatids, another layer of chromosome association - pairing between homologs - also occurs in some polytene cells. This pairing results in polyploid/polytene cells that exhibit only the haploid number of distinct chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metz, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White, 1954</xref>). Given these multiple physical connections between polytene chromatids, mitosis in polytene cells is considered 'ill-advised for mechanical reasons' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>). Indeed, separation of polytene diplochromosomes at anaphase causes chromosome mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidwans et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Given the association of polytene chromosomes with mitotic errors, it is not surprising that these structures are often associated with aberrant development and disease. Polytene chromosomes have been observed in cells from spontaneous human abortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Therman et al., 1978</xref>), in muscular dystrophy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>), in a variety of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biesele and Poyner, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erenpreisa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Therman et al., 1983</xref>) and can also precede tumor formation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</xref>). Polytene chromosomes also occur after treatment with currently used anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics such as those that inhibit Topoisomerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumner, 1998</xref>). Disruption of numerous other processes crucial for mitosis, including spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goyanes and Schvartzman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takanari et al., 1985</xref>) sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wirth et al., 2006</xref>) or genome integrity control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2010</xref>) also cause genome reduplication and polyteny. Thus, polytene chromosomes, a source of mitotic instability, are a conserved and common outcome of ectopic genome reduplication.</p><p>To understand how cells adapt the cell cycle machinery to the challenge of segregating the intertwined polytene chromatids found in genome-reduplicated cells, naturally occurring models of this problem can prove useful. Programmed genome reduplication cycles of successive S-phase without M-phase (endocycles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox and Duronio, 2013</xref> see nomenclature) produce polytene chromosomes in many plant, insect, and mammalian species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhimulev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zybina et al., 1996</xref>). However, many cells with programmed genome reduplication do not subsequently divide, preventing study of how nature has circumvented the issue of segregating polytene chromosomes. In contrast, we previously demonstrated that rectal papilla (hereafter: papillar cells), ion-absorbing structures in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hindgut, are built entirely by mitosis of endocycled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, we never observed polytene chromosomes in hundreds of papillar metaphases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting papillar cells are programmed to either avoid or eliminate polyteny and its associated mitotic defects. Interestingly, previous studies suggest that polyteny can be at least partially undone without anaphase in both normal and tumorous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dej and Spradling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grell, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levan and Hauschka, 1953</xref>). Thus, in some cases, polyteny may be actively regulated or eliminated.</p><p>Taken together, the potential negative impact of genome reduplication on mitotic chromosome structure is clear. However, the responses that enable either developing or tumorous cells to continue dividing after reduplication, despite profound chromosome structure changes, remain unclear. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue models of both ectopic and naturally occurring genome reduplication, we uncover two distinct cellular responses to reduplicated chromosomes. Both reduplication responses require the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Mad2, which inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex to both delay anaphase in response to unattached or tensionless kinetochores and to also regulate overall mitotic timing from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). In reduplicated cells that retain polytene chromosomes at metaphase, we show Mad2 is involved in a SAC wait-anaphase response. This anaphase delay does not fully prevent the mitotic errors and the resulting aneuploidy associated with mitosis of polytene chromosomes, but it substantially reduces apoptosis, tissue malformation, and organismal death. In contrast to this wait-anaphase response, we also define a second response in reduplicated cells that actively eliminates polyteny before anaphase. In this response, polytene chromosomes undergo a dynamic, spindle-independent process we term <underline>S</underline>eparation <underline>I</underline>nto <underline>R</underline>ecent <underline>S</underline>ister chromatid pairs (SIRS), which eliminates any trace of polyteny before anaphase. Unlike mitosis with metaphase polytene chromosomes, mitosis with SIRS does not trigger a Mad2-dependent anaphase delay. Yet, we find Mad2 promotes efficient SIRS by allowing sufficient time between nuclear envelope breakdown and anaphase, which allows polytene chromosomes to separate into conventional mitotic sister chromatid pairs. Our results therefore define two distinct responses to reduplicated chromosomes, each of which depends on a distinct Mad2 response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To understand the mechanisms employed by cells with reduplicated chromosomes, we took advantage of accessible developmental models and in vivo genetic tools in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While ectopic genome reduplication was previously established to generate polytene diplochromosomes and subsequent mitotic errors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the effects were examined within the time-frame of the terminal embryonic mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidwans et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the long-term effects of ectopic genome reduplication on cell viability and tissue development, and key molecular regulation of reduplicated chromosomes has remained unexplored. In parallel, our development of rectal papillae as a non-ectopic, naturally occurring model of mitosis after genome reduplication enabled us to also study how cells programmed to undergo genome reduplication can regulate polytene chromosome structure during mitosis.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic genome reduplication yields polyteny and continued aneuploid cell division</title><p>We first ectopically induced genome reduplication in proliferating tissues of developing larvae by transiently re-programming mitotic cycles to endocycles. <italic>fizzy-related (fzr,</italic> mammalian <italic>Cdh1</italic>) plays a conserved role in endocycles by targeting the anaphase promoting complex to destroy the mitotic Cyclins A, B, and B3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson-Rabin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sigrist and Lehner, 1997</xref>). <italic>fzr</italic> overexpression was previously shown to transform mitotic cycles into endocycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sigrist and Lehner, 1997</xref>). To transiently induce endocycles, we used a brief heat shock (HS) pulse to express ectopic <italic>fzr (HS&gt;fzr</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using the cell cycle marker system Fly-FUCCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) we find that pulsed <italic>fzr</italic> overexpression temporarily eliminates expression of the S/G2/M mRFP-CyclinB reporter in wing imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C vs. C’, D</xref>). This same population of mRFP-CyclinB-negative cells continues to express the G2/M/G1 GFP-E2F1 reporter, but in greater proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C vs. C’, D</xref>).

At this time-point, we observe frequent tetraploidy (41% of mitotic cells, equivalent to 93% of all G2 cells prior to heat shock, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E v. F,F’,H</xref>). We obtained similar results when examining the results of <italic>fzr</italic> overexpression in diploid brain progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results confirm our ability to induce genome reduplication in normally diploid tissues. We also examined chromosome structure in our induced tetraploid cells. When <italic>HS&gt;fzr-</italic>induced tetraploid DNA first condenses post-heat shock, all chromatids of each chromosome type are closely aligned in a polytene configuration, as evidenced by having the haploid number of distinguishable chromosomes (four in females, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Frequently, we observe un-pairing of the homologous groups of centromeres within each polytene chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, asterisk, also see discussion). Later, at the first metaphase, homologous chromosomes of each polytene are now completely separated, but the four centromeres of each group of sister chromatids remain conjoined within diplochromosomes (observed for 96% of tetraploid cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>’ inset, H). Thus, <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> induces ectopic genome reduplication, resulting in tetraploid cells with metaphase polytene diplochromosomes.</p><p>We next examined the mitotic fidelity of cells with diplochromosomes by two independent means: chromosome karyotype analysis and live imaging. By examining the metaphase chromosomes of the division immediately following diplochromosome division, we could detect whether aneuploidy results from diplochromosome segregation. Following the division of cells with diplochromosomes, we observe tetraploid-aneuploid cells with one or two extra or missing chromosomes (8.6% of mitotic cells). In these cells, diplochromosomes are no longer present and instead chromatids are found in distinct sister pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that during or after anaphase of the first post-reduplication division, diplochromosomes can separate into individual chromatids. Further, these diplochromosome divisions can produce aneuploid daughter cells, many of which continue to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We also live imaged mitosis of wing imaginal disc and brain progenitor (neuroblasts and ganglion mother) cells, both with and without ectopic genome reduplication. In addition to using a histone marker to observe chromosomes, we used the Cenp-C-Tomato marker to observe kinetochores. Control diploid cells divide without errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> No HS, J, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). In contrast, most (80%) tetraploid divisions with diplochromosomes exhibit lagging chromosomes, DNA bridges, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> HS+10 hr, J, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In our live imaging, diplochromosomes were identifiable as quartets of centromeres and their associated chromosome arms in very close proximity. In some of these divisions we clearly observe four chromatids of a diplochromosome quartet segregating 3:1 (in agreement with prior work in embryos by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidwans et al., 2002</xref>, suggesting incomplete or imprecise sister chromatid disjunction is the cause of chromosome gains and losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

We thus examined the survival of these animals to adulthood. Survival is only subtly affected in animals with mild (23.0% tetraploid [S.E.M. 4.9%]) levels of induced error-prone tetraploid progenitor division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and resulting adult tissues appear normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Together, these results show that ectopic genome reduplication in multiple progenitor tissues yields tetraploid cells with polytene metaphase diplochromosomes, which are aneuploid-prone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These conclusions are in agreement with a previous study in the terminal embryonic division of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidwans et al., 2002</xref>).

Little is known about aneuploidy prevention mechanisms in cells with polytene chromosomes, despite the numerous mechanisms that can generate these aberrations. Through live imaging, we uncovered one such aneuploidy-prevention mechanism in cells with metaphase diplochromosomes. Because our heat shock protocol only affects cells in G2, a single <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> pulse creates a mixed population of unaltered diploid cells and diplochromosome-containing tetraploid cells, allowing us to simultaneously live image both cell types in the same tissue. Metaphase in cells with diplochromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow dotted outline) is significantly longer than in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> blue dashed outline, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with previous work on diplochromosomes formed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Securin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey et al., 2005</xref>). We thus hypothesized that diplochromosomes trigger the SAC, which activates a wait-anaphase signal until all kinetochores attach to microtubules and are under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). To test this model, we examined SAC-defective <italic>mad2</italic> null animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buffin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emre et al., 2011</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using live imaging of wing imaginal discs before and after heat shock, we find that loss of <italic>mad2</italic> eliminates the lengthened period of metaphase caused by diplochromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When the checkpoint is active unattached or misattached kinetochores generate a wait-anaphase signal by localizing SAC proteins such as BubR1 to those kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). To confirm that diplochromosomes have localized SAC proteins we co-imaged kinetochores and BubR1 in wing disc cells after <italic>fzr</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Royou et al., 2010</xref>). We find that in diploid cells BubR1-GFP is clearly evident on kinetochores following nuclear envelope break down and remains there until anaphase. This signal is relatively evenly spread across all the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, diploid, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).

In these animals, we find a variety of developmental defects in normally diploid tissues, including smaller eyes, ectopic wing veins, and melanotic abdominal masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Increased apoptosis is associated with these tissue malformation phenotypes, as progenitor tissue from <italic>HS&gt;fzr, mad2</italic> animals have much higher rates of apoptotic cell death as shown by both TUNEL labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), and cleaved caspase staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

In earlier work we found <italic>Drosophila</italic> rectal papillar cells (hereafter: papillar cells) naturally undergo two <italic>fzr-</italic>dependent endocycles during the 2<sup>nd</sup> larval instar to generate octoploid cells and then divide, on average, two times during pupal development. An intervening S-phase accompanies these polyploid divisions, and cells at the papillar base undergo one additional S-phase after the final polyploid mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, as with <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> induction in diploid tissues, papillar development naturally involves genome reduplication followed by mitosis. Our previous work established that papillar mitoses can be error prone, so the same problems with dissociating polytene chromosomes in <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> tissues could be responsible for a portion of these errors during papillar divisions. However, we previously did not see, in hundreds of observed cells, any instances of metaphases with persistent polyteny in papillar cells, suggesting that papillar cells somehow avoid mitosis of polytene chromosomes. Through careful re-examination of the first octoploid metaphase, we confirmed that papillar chromosomes in these octoploid cells are arranged in individual sister chromatid pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’’</xref> inset, C). This suggested two possibilities: 1) papillar cells never form polytenes, or 2) papillar cells form polytenes, but somehow separate into recent sister pairs prior to the first metaphase.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15204.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Programed genome reduplication in papillar cells is followed by <underline>S</underline>eparation <underline>I</underline>nto <underline>R</underline>ecent <underline>S</underline>isters (SIRS), which individualizes polytene chromosomes into recent sister pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model of the cell cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> papillar cells. These cells undergo two rounds of the endocycle in the 2<sup>nd</sup> instar to reach 8N/16C, then enter a G2-like state, then undergo, on average, two cell divisions with intervening S-phases during pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Karyotypes of papillar cells during the 1<sup>st</sup> polyploid division, (<bold>B–B’’</bold>).

Papillar cells re-enter mitosis from a G2-like state, as evidenced by expression of the G2/M regulator Cdc25/string just before the onset of pupal cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At time points early in the first mitosis, we indeed find that papillar chromosomes are polytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Polytene). In these polytenes, we again see examples of cells where the centromeric regions are no longer tightly associated, as we did in our studies of <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic>-induced polyteny. However, unlike in cells with induced polyteny, the centromeres in papillar polytene cells are able to not only separate into groups of homologs, but to further separate into individual sister chromatid pairs (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, also see discussion). In flies heterozygous for inversion-containing balancer chromosomes, papillar polytene structure is locally perturbed, likely due to the disruption of somatic homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At this early mitotic time point, we also observe cells where polytenes are absent. Instead, in these cells, sister chromatid pairs and homologs of each chromosome type are separated but remain clumped closely together, as if the polytene chromosome recently separated into pairs containing only the most recent sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’, D</xref>, Clumped). Neither the polytene nor the clumped configurations remain during the second division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), suggesting a specific chromosome structure is present early in the first division of papillar cells. Similarly, by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) we find examples of both closely associated (polytene) and dispersed (separated/non-polytene) signals during the period of the first papillar mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,C</xref>’). Thus, a key difference between the response to genome reduplication between papillar and <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells is the elimination of polyteny before anaphase in papillar cells.</p><p>To examine if a majority of (if not all) papillar cells transition from polytene to separate/non-polytene chromosomes during the first mitosis, we used drug treatment to isolate specific chromosome structures during the transition into the first papillar division. To enrich for early mitotic and pre-mitotic chromosomes, we induced Premature Chromosome Compaction (PCC) in papillar cells at a time point just prior to the first mitosis (Methods). PCC causes interphase chromosomes to condense and makes it possible to visualize interphase chromosome structure by standard cytological methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using this technique, we find that in pre-mitotic papillar tissue, clear polytene chromosomes are present in nearly every cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> Pre 1<sup>st</sup> Div, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). If we instead enrich for cells in metaphase of the first mitosis by treating with the spindle poison colcemid, we find zero examples where chromosomes are still polytene. In these metaphase-enriched samples, all chromosomes are separated into recent-sister pairs, and even cells with clumped chromosomes are rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> Div +colc). Thus, our pharmacological studies further suggest that essentially all genome-reduplicated papillar cells are programmed to completely eliminate polytene chromosomes as cells progress into the first metaphase.</p><p>To observe the temporal dynamics of the pre-anaphase elimination of papillar polyteny, we used live imaging, using the same markers used to image diplochromosome division. Prior to the first papillar mitosis, the kinetochores from each homolog are closely associated into an average of 4.1 large foci, close to the haploid number of distinct chromosomes (4 for females and 5 for males due to X/Y un-pairing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As time progresses in the first division, it is possible to watch these large kinetochore foci disperse into many smaller foci prior to metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, inset, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). In contrast, prior to the second division kinetochores are already separated into many more foci (an average of 15.1 observably distinct foci per cell) before entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). During the second division, the number of resolvable foci remains essentially constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). Additionally, the histone marker reveals that polytene chromosomes are visible when chromosomes first condense and can then be seen to disperse during the first but not the second division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F v. 3G</xref>, -18:00 min). This result confirms the model that genome-reduplicated papillar cells eliminate polyteny during the first mitosis, then undergo an intervening S-phase before the next division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also confirmed that each clump of 4 or 5 pre-first division centromeres only contains a single chromosome type. To do so, we took advantage of the fact that dosage compensation in flies relies on upregulation of transcription on the male X chromosome via the Dosage Compensation Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</xref>). By live imaging papillar cells expressing the DCC complex protein MSL3 tagged with GFP, which localizes only to the male X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strukov et al., 2011</xref>), we find that indeed only a single Cenp-C-Tomato focus is MSL3-GFP positive prior to polytene dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>).

As for the wait-anaphase response, this mitotic timing role involves Mad2 inhibition of the Anaphase Promoting Complex. However, Mad2’s control of overall mitotic timing is irrespective of SAC kinetochore attachment surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mad1 is reported to be dispensable for regulation of NEBD-to-anaphase timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emre et al., 2011</xref>). Given the lack of <italic>mad1</italic> phenotypes with respect to the first papillar division, we thus hypothesized that SIRS enables papillar cells to bypass the SAC-mediated anaphase delay, and that Mad2 control of overall mitotic timing is important during SIRS. If so, one would predict cells undergoing SIRS to not trigger an anaphase delay, but to still depend on mitotic timing.</p><p>To first test if papillar cells employ the SAC wait-anaphase in response to polytene chromosomes, we treated animals with colcemid, a known SAC wait-anaphase trigger. This treatment increases the mitotic index of wild type papillar cells, whereas the mitotic index of <italic>mad2</italic> null animals is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) Thus, spindle defects trigger the SAC wait-anaphase response in papillar cells. We next asked if the SAC wait-anaphase responds to polytene chromosomes during SIRS. If so, the first divisions (polytenes present) should have a longer metaphase than the second division (polytenes absent). However we find that metaphase is not any longer in the first papillar division than in the second papillar division, while in contrast metaphase is almost twice as long in wing cells with diplochromosomes than in those that are polyploid but lack diplochromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We then tested if triggering the SAC wait-anaphase response can prevent or delay SIRS completion. We find SIRS occurs on schedule even in the presence of colcemid concentrations that are sufficient to eliminate a detectable spindle and inhibit anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Video 17</xref>). We conclude that: a) SIRS is not regulated by the SAC wait-anaphase response, and b) chromosome separation during SIRS does not require a mitotic spindle.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media16" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-15204-media16.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15204.025</object-id><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>This video accompanies <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</title><p>Live imaging showing Jupiter-GFP in magenta and Cenp-C-Tomato in cyan from a first division papillar cell undergoing SIRS in control imaging media.

Using an NEBD marker, we first confirmed that Mad2 regulates NEBD-to-anaphase timing and that <italic>mad2</italic> cells spend significantly less time in mitosis than wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media18">Video 18</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media19">Video 19</xref>). We also find that Nuclear Envelope Breakdown and the onset of SIRS are synchronous in wild type cells and that SIRS generally continues until up to the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that the rapid mitosis in <italic>mad2</italic> cells might lead to a failure of complete SIRS, which could cause the resulting DNA bridges. In our live imaging, we saw evidence that a pre-SIRS group of homologs would often fail to completely disperse prior to anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>mad2,</italic> yellow arrowhead). To quantify this, we generated heat maps and line profiles of centromere signals at the metaphase plate. We performed this analysis just prior to the onset of mitosis in wild type cells, <italic>mad2</italic> cells that did not generate bridges, and <italic>mad2</italic> cells that did generate DNA bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). From these measurements, we found that SIRS fails to complete before anaphase in <italic>mad2</italic> animals, leading to a high variance of centromere intensity signal across the metaphase plate (reflecting failure of centromere dissociation/SIRS completion). This high variance disrupts the bilateral symmetry of the metaphase plate in <italic>mad2</italic> cells that form DNA bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>’). Taken together, our data show mitotic fidelity after genome reduplication is improved by one of two Mad2-dependent functions: 1) in the presence of metaphase polytene chromosomes a Mad2-dependent wait-anaphase signal is generated, 2) the efficient elimination of polytenes as cells enter metaphase by SIRS requires a Mad2 (but SAC wait-anaphase-independent) NEBD-anaphase timer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15204.027</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SIRS is dependent on Mad2-dependent mitotic timing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live imaging of a representative wild type and <italic>mad2</italic> cell expressing geminin-Azami (magenta) in and Cenp-C-Tomato (cyan) during the 1<sup>st</sup> papillar division. Just the Cenp-C-Tomato channel is also shown.

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays cells in metaphase and reduces but does not eliminate aneuploidy during the ensuing anaphase.

Here, we define two such responses- one that prevents malformation of tissues with polytene chromosomes that persist until anaphase onset, and another (SIRS) that eliminates polyteny before anaphase onset. Both polyteny responses require the conserved mitotic fidelity regulator Mad2, yet Mad2’s role in each response is distinct (anaphase delay vs. control of overall mitotic timing). These findings identify new roles for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mad2, for which few roles have been identified. Further, our findings illuminate a likely recurring role for Mad2 in response to genome reduplication.</p><p>In cells with metaphase polytenes (<italic>e.g.</italic> diplochromosomes), our data suggest polytene chromosomes present a challenge for the mitotic spindle, leading to a prolonged period of unattached/tensionless kinetochores. What particular feature of diplochromosomes triggers the SAC wait-anaphase response is unclear. It seems likely that diplochromosome structure is at least partially incompatible with attachment to the spindle. For example, it may be that the outer kinetochores block spindle attachment to the inner kinetochores within a diplochromosome, or it could be that the spindle has trouble generating tension on four kinetochores simultaneously, both of which would trigger the SAC wait-anaphase response. Eventually, the spindle appears able to attach and bi-orient all kinetochores, but the resulting anaphase is frequently error prone- with lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This result fits with the known ability of cells with erroneous merotelic kinetochore attachments to satisfy the SAC and proceed to anaphase with lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregan et al., 2011</xref>). Potentially, then, the AuroraB-mediated mechanism that can correct merotely is overwhelmed/inoperable in cells with reduplicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the inability of the SAC to prevent all instances of mitotic errors in cells with polyteny, our data suggest that development of normally diploid tissues with an operable SAC is not noticeably altered by up to 23% ± 4.9% of divisions being error prone tetraploid divisions. Given the conserved nature of SAC signaling, and the widespread occurrence of diplochromosomes in disease, it will be interesting to explore whether the SAC wait-anaphase response is a general mechanism used to enable the expansion of aneuploid cells formed by aberrant genome reduplication.</p><p>In contrast to cells with polyteny at anaphase, in cells such as papillar cells, SIRS vastly improves mitotic fidelity. This process does not require the Mad2-dependent wait-anaphase response, but the efficient completion of SIRS before anaphase requires the Mad2-dependent mitotic timer. Little is known about distinct, checkpoint-independent regulation of the Mad2 timer. In the future, papillar cells may prove useful in further study of the timer, given the dependence of SIRS completion on this Mad2 function.</p><p>We previously described the error-prone nature of papillar divisions, as well as the high tolerance of this tissue for chromosome mis-segregation. This raises the question of why papillar cells employ SIRS, if papillar aneuploidy is well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our study of <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells, which lack SIRS, we propose that SIRS is required to prevent extreme polytene chromosome mis-segregation events during papillar development, which could result in inviable nullisomic cells. Additionally, we have recently found that papillar cells actively prevent accumulation of micronuclei resulting from broken DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretscher and Fox, 2016</xref>). Thus, while mitotic genome-reduplicated cells such as papillar cells do tolerate some degree of aneuploidy, processes such as micronucleus prevention and SIRS may act to ensure a viable degree of mitotic fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A model for SIRS</title><p>Our results identify SIRS as a spindle-independent chromosome separation process that, remarkably, individualizes polytene chromosomes into recent sister pairs before anaphase. This process is distinct from another spindle-independent chromosome separation process known as C-mitosis, which involves complete sister chromatid separation before anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levan, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Östergren, 1944</xref>). While future work will determine what differentiates cells capable of SIRS from cells with polytenes that persist until anaphase, our data thus far has examined three layers of polytene chromosome organization that either are or are not eliminated during papillar and <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> mitosis, and has pinpointed one of these layers of polytene organization as distinct to cells undergoing SIRS.</p><p>The first layer of polytene organization is homolog-homolog pairing. Given that we observe the haploid number of chromosomes after both papillar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and HS&gt;<italic>fzr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) endocycles, it is clear that homologous chromosomes associate within both types of polytene chromosomes by somatic homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metz, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Painter, 1934</xref>). Both mitotic papillar and <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> polytenes exhibit un-paired homologs before dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F’</xref>), and this process appears to initiate at centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, asterisks, most obvious for the acrocentric X chromosome). Thus, homolog-homolog dissociation is not unique to SIRS. The second layer of polytene organization is interaction between sister chromatid pairs. Importantly, the arrangement of chromatid pairs at metaphase differs between cells that do or do not undergo SIRS. In SIRS-capable (e.g. papillar) cells, only the product of the single most recent round of replication (recent sisters, see nomenclature) remain attached at metaphase whereas the products of previous rounds of replication are no longer attached. In contrast, in SIRS-incapable (e.g. <italic>HS&gt;fzr)</italic> cells, all sister chromatids remain attached. Thus, the separation into chromatid pairs appears to be the critical function of SIRS. Future work can test if this separation requires the Condensin II complex activity during SIRS, which was shown previously to enable partial polytene chromosome dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartl et al., 2008</xref>). The third layer of organization within polytenes are contacts between recent sister chromatid arms. These are equally undone by metaphase in both papillar and HS&gt;<italic>fzr</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F’</xref>) so that, at metaphase, chromatids are only attached at the centromere. This process likely involves the prophase cohesin removal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sumara et al., 2002</xref>). Taken together, we conclude the key difference between SIRS-capable (e.g. papillar) and SIRS-incapable (<italic>e.g,</italic> HS&gt;<italic>fzr)</italic> cells is the ability to separate into sister chromatid pairs before metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We further hypothesize that a key prerequisite to SIRS is the careful regulation of chromosome structure during genome reduplication/endocycles. During the endocycle, papillar cells show no evidence of karyokinesis, which suggests these cells lack a mechanical method of separating chromosomes during the endocycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>). However, we speculate that during endocycles, periodic cohesin removal occurs at centromeres after each S-phase. Such cohesin removal would then allow each chromatid to both eliminate its cohesins between its sister from a previous S-phase and then establish cohesins with a new sister during the subsequent S-phase. While alterations in cohesins do not noticeably perturb interphase polytene structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cunningham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pauli et al., 2008</xref>), future work can determine if such endocycle-mediated cohesin regulation confers cells with polytene chromosomes with the ability to undergo SIRS during a later mitosis. Future work can also determine if cohesin regulation differs during endocycles of cells that are destined to later divide. We previously defined features of a distinct pre-mitotic variant of the endocycle, which include centriole retention and the completeness of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoenfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we propose that cohesin regulation may be also be distinct during this endocycle variant, and is a key factor to promoting SIRS.</p><p>An additional interesting layer of SIRS regulation to explore is how it is triggered, and whether the mitotic timer is an active or passive regulator. Our data suggest NEBD is coincident with SIRS onset, possibly by allowing chromosomes to access some cytoplasmic SIRS regulator, or to initiate SIRS by releasing chromosomes from the nuclear envelope. Regarding the role of the Mad2 timer, it will be interesting to ask if it somehow senses completedness of DNA replication, which may be a pre-requisite for SIRS initiation.</p><p>SIRS is likely frequent and conserved. Inspired by classical reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grell, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holt, 1917</xref>), we found polytene chromosomes are present before polyploid mitosis in <italic>Culex,</italic> but are later apparent as individual chromosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Based on our results, we also suggest that chromosome dispersal in polyploid <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian nurse cells represents an incomplete version of SIRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dej and Spradling, 1999</xref>), especially given that these chromosomes can further separate if mitotic cyclins are experimentally elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reed and Orr-Weaver, 1997</xref>). In polyploid trophoblasts of some mammalian species, polytene chromosomes separate into numerous bundles of paired chromosomes at the polykaryocyte stage, and thus SIRS may also occur in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zybina et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zybina et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, SIRS may eliminate polyteny in some polyploid tumors. One of the first descriptions of polyteny in tumors noted diplochromosomes 'fall apart' <underline>before</underline> anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levan and Hauschka, 1953</xref>). Whole genome duplication is common (~37%) in human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zack et al., 2013</xref>). Given the transient nature of polytene chromosomes in mitotic tissues demonstrated here, we suggest future studies of whole genome duplication in cancer models should closely examine the initial mitosis after multiple S-phases to identify potential polytene chromosome origins of tumor aneuploidy. Finally, while our studies agree with the notion that multiple S-phases and polyploidy precede aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>), they also underscore the need for aneuploidy-prevention responses including SIRS and the SAC for continued propagation of viable polyploid/aneuploid cells. Future studies can reveal additional SIRS regulation, and other critical genome instability controls in normal or tumorous cells following genome reduplication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila genetics</title><p>All flies were raised at 25° on standard media (Archon Scientific, Durham, NC).

The brightness for each cell was normalized from 1 to 0, with 1 being the highest pixel intensity value and 0 being the dimmest value for a single cell across all time-points. Anaphase was determined as the first frame with poleward movement of the kinetochores as evident by Cenp-C-Tomato. Time from NEBD to anaphase was determined as the point from half-maximal Azami signal to anaphase. To calculate kinetochore clustering we closely cropped around the cell of interest for all frames. We then used a thresholding approach to outline each centromere or group of centromeres and stored those as ROIs. We then used those ROIs to measure the average intensity of each centromere pixel and the total area of all the pixels. We reasoned that as centromeres disperse the total area they cover increases and there is a corresponding decrease in fluorescence intensity from each individual point, therefore we divided the average pixel intensity by the area and normalized that on a scale from 1 to 0. To measure symmetry of metaphase centromere alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D’</xref>), we generated a line plot of each metaphase plate at the frame immediately prior to metaphase. We then generated aggregate plots of each genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>'N' refers to the haploid number of chromosome sets, while C refers to the haploid DNA content (a diploid cell in G2 is 2N but 4C, a tetraploid cell in G1 is 4N and 4C). For chromosomes we use 'homolog' to distinguish maternally and paternally contributed chromosomes of the same chromosome type. All chromatids of the same homolog are considered 'sisters.' We use 'recent sister' to refer to two chromatids that are the product of the most recent S-phase. 'Polytene' refers to the chromosome state of any cell formed by genome reduplication that has not fully separated its chromosomes into recent sisters. In a polyploid/polytene cell with somatic homolog pairing, polytene cells exhibit the haploid number of distinguishable chromosomes, whereas in a cell without homolog pairing, this number doubles. 4 chromatids conjoined at centromeres are 'diplochromosomes'. Please note that, using metaphase spreads, the presence/absence of diplochromosomes as well as the number of individual chromatids can only be scored when chromosomes are significantly condensed as in mitosis or in the presence of Calyculin A. We use the term “endocycle” to refer to any cell cycle involving successive genome reduplication without any sign of M-phase. We note the use in the literature of terms such as 'endoreduplication', 're-replication', and 'endoreplication' to often refer to the same phenomenon.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The following kindly provided reagents used in this study: The Bloomington Stock Center, the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center, the Kyoto Drosophila Genetic Resource Center, Roger Karess (U Paris), Christian Lehner (U Zurich), Mitzi Kuroda (Harvard University), and Bill Sullivan (UC Santa Cruz).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct Responses To Reduplicated Chromosomes Require Distinct Mad2 Responses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Giovanni Bosco.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>In this study Stormo and Fox use two in vivo systems of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to ask how endoreduplicated cells cope with eventually segregating polytene chromosomes. First they drive endoreduplication in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues that are normally diploid by a heat shock inducible <italic>fzr</italic> gene. Second, they examine rectal papilla cells that normally undergo mitosis after having reduplicated their genomes. This study represents a significant new contribution to the way we think about how chromosome organizational states (e.g. polytenes) are normally modified, while it also reveals a very important new checkpoint-independent function of the Mad2 gene. The study is not particularly mechanistic and remains essentially descriptive, but it nevertheless makes an interesting contribution to the field.</p><p>An important and novel finding of this study is that the authors elegantly show distinct roles for the conserved Mad2 mitotic checkpoint signaling gene. In addition to its well-known spindle assemble checkpoint (SAC) function, the authors also show that cells containing polyploid cells that have persistent polytene chromosome structures also benefit from a Mad2 dependent mitotic timer function. This Mad2 checkpoint-independent mitotic timer function, it is proposed, promotes separation into recent sister chromatids (SIRS), and presumably disrupts other interactions, e.g. homolog pairing that tend to be strong and ubiquitous in diploid and endoreduplicating <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p><p>Overall, all reviewers agreed that this work represents a significant progress in the field that warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The following comments must be addressed, although the reviewers do not necessarily believe the authors need additional experiments.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>There is no experimental exploration of what is mechanistically happening to the polytene chromosomes that drives them to separate and individualize into recent sister pairs. Presumably cohesion is keeping the most recent sisters cohesed (or maybe catenations or under-replication, etc.?) in anticipation of metaphase. However, what is eliminating arm/centromeric cohesion and disrupting homolog interactions before the metaphase-to-anaphase transition? Obvious candidates would be processes targeting cohesins, but Top-2 or condensin II driven resolution of catenations and/or homolog pairing are other possibilities that could easily have been tested (Top-2 in particular since pharmacological inhibition could have been achieved in combination with live imaging, etc.). Can the authors speak to what is the most likely scenario and what supporting data there may be?</p><p>The authors state that chromosome missegregation in cells undergoing the first division after induced reduplication is mainly due to the persistence of &quot;diplochromosomes&quot;, i.e. homologous chromosomes completely separated but still conjoined at their centromeres. This is rather clearly apparent in the metaphase spread shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>'. However, the presence of &quot;diplochromosomes&quot; is not as clearly documented in the live imaging reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 2. In addition, how can authors exclude that the observed segregation defects are mainly due to the presence of multipolar spindles? Actually, the presence of frequent tripolar divisions has been reported by Schoenfelder et al. (2014) in 8N papillar cells.</p><p>Based on the evidence that loss of Mad2 abolishes the lengthened period of metaphase caused by diplochromosomes, authors conclude that a wait-anaphase signal is activated in the presence of diplochromosomes. However, no movie is shown to support this conclusion. In addition, they only indirectly demonstrate that the absence of a delay in the metaphase-anaphase progression corresponds to an increase of defective mitoses, through the analysis of the survival rate and of the developmental defects observed in <italic>fzr</italic> overexpressing <italic>mad2</italic> null animals. Can they quantitate the frequency of aberrant anaphases in the induced polytenic cells of <italic>mad2</italic> null animals? Also, related to this point, if Mad1 is dispensable and they claim Mad2's &quot;checkpoint-independent role&quot;, they should not call &quot;Mad2 SAC&quot; (it is simply a Mad2-depentent novel mechanism, not &quot;SAC&quot; per se).</p><p>The authors first state that papillar cells do not have quadruplochromosomes and then use a substantial part of the paragraph entitled &quot;Polyteny response 2: Separation…&quot; to demonstrate that polytene chromosomes can be visualized in these cells. This is a bit confusing. The text could be shortened to help the reader to get the point, that is the fact that in papillar cells polytene chromosomes are formed and have the ability to progressively separate into sisters prior to metaphase. Here again, the cytology on fixed material looks more beautiful and convincing than the live imaging analysis. However, the authors should explain why in the metaphase shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>&quot; four of the green (presumably third) chromosomes show a clear pericentric inversion. Are they balancers? In the same metaphase one of the green chromosomes exhibits a chromatid break. Isn't it supposed to be a wild type metaphase?</p><p>It is not clear how <italic>mad2</italic> null animals fail to complete SIRS before anaphase, as the video frames in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> refer only to a wild type cell. Representative frames from a video of a <italic>mad2</italic> null papillar cell mitosis should be reported in the figure.</p><p>Can the authors please clarify in the text and their model how they know that metaphase chromatids in SIRS cells are the most recent sister pairs? The speculation (subsection “A model for SIRS”, second paragraph) of cohesin removal between old sisters so that new cohesins could establish cohesion between the most recent sisters is a reasonable idea, however this would be greatly strengthened by somehow showing that SIRS cells entering metaphase indeed have pairs of new/recent sisters as opposed to a random arrangement of sister pairs after the second S-phase. Are there data in the literature that cohesins can be removed in endoreduplicating cells?</p><p>It would be of interest and helpful to a broader readership to further elaborate in the beginning of the manuscript what physical connections between polytene sisters/homologs might exist and which of these are analogous in mammalian cells that may display &quot;polytene-like&quot; structures. Although it is specified in the first paragraph of the Introduction that &quot;polytene&quot; refers to the persistence of chromatid associations, most readers will assume that especially in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &quot;polytene&quot; also refers to homolog-homolog pairing. Can the authors clarify this? This may be difficult to do since we don't know the actual nature of the physical interactions that form/maintain <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytenes (likely not cohesins) and how similar they are to analogous chromosome structures in non-<italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Nevertheless, this might be important to emphasize since it may be challenging for a non-<italic>Drosophila</italic>, non-polytene-centric viewpoint to understand the relevance of this new and exciting Mad2 driven SIRS mechanism. Similarly, in the third paragraph of the Introduction, the description about &quot;endocycled cells&quot; and &quot;polyteny&quot; is somewhat unclear. First of all, it is unclear how one can distinguish polytene chromosomes from regular chromosomes (containing only single sister chromatid). For example, how one can surely tell 4N vs. 8N? Are diplochromosomes from 4N (N + N + N + N) easily distinguishable from 2N+2N+2N+2N from 8N chromosomes, which might look diplochromosomes but each containing double the amount of DNA?</p><p>Is it possible that an important difference between SIRS compatible cells and SIRS non-compatible cells is some degree of DNA underreplication in polytene cells and their ability to resolve/finish this DNA replication? Is the Mad2 timer sensing unreplicated DNA – perhaps at/around the centromere? It would be interesting and informative for the authors to consider this possibility in their Discussion as it might help readers frame some of the important questions raised by this study in the context of issues relevant to what may actually be happening during the process of achieving SIRS.</p><p>In the Discussion, two possibilities are considered for why polyteny is incompatible with spindle attachment to kinetochores. However, is it possible that paired arms of sisters and/or persistent homolog pairing is also incompatible with mitotic progression? Are there data in the literature or from the authors' own work that speaks to this either way?</p><p>The use of the phrase &quot;eliminates polytene chromosomes&quot; (such as in the Discussion subsection “A model for SIRS”, first paragraph and other variants thereof) implies that chromosomes themselves are destroyed or lost. I think the authors mean that the polytene organization of the chromosomes is resolved such that sisters and homologs are individualized. If this is a correct interpretation of what the authors mean, then they may wish to use different words or phrase to clearly indicate that chromosomes are not being &quot;eliminated&quot; per se, but instead it's the polytene organization of chromosomes that is being eliminated.</p><p>The authors state &quot;consistent with previous work&quot; (or alike) in many places. This gives false impression that this work lacks novelty: if one carefully reads the paper and goes to the references, the references are often talking about the phenomenon in a different context (e.g. previous work showed something in diploid cells, and the authors showed a similar phenomenon in tetraploid cells). The authors should make it clear in what aspect it is consistent with the previous work, and what is novel in this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15204.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Suggested revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>There is no experimental exploration of what is mechanistically happening to the polytene chromosomes that drives them to separate and individualize into recent sister pairs.

This experiment provided the insight that Top-2 is not required for SIRS at centromeres. However, Top-2 inhibition does result in anaphase DNA bridges in all cell types tested, including papillar cells and diploid wing disc cells. In papillar cells these bridges could be the result of either a) failure of SIRS along chromosome arms, b) failure of the expected role of Top-2 in resolving sister chromatid catenation, or c) both a and b. As Top-2 inhibition prevents the examination of chromosome structure by metaphase spreads to differentiate possibilities a, b, and c, future work beyond a reasonable timeframe for this manuscript is required to tease apart whether or not Top-2 plays a non-centromeric role in SIRS.

Diplochromosomes are certainly the most obvious by metaphase spread analysis, which is the technique that has been used for decades to examine these structures. However, we found that we can also observe diplochromosomes during anaphase in live imaging. We expand here on their distinct appearance in live imaging. In live imaging of anaphases of first division <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells, we observe chromatid quartets, which consist of four clear centromeres and associated chromosome arms in very close proximity. These quartets are often seen lagging behind other chromosomes at anaphase, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. The appearance of quartets is exactly what one would expect if a diplochromosome were to be delayed in its segregation, as our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest to be the case.</p><p>We never observe quartets in live imaging of diploid anaphases or papillar anaphases. Further, please note that these quartet structures are <italic>not</italic> seen in the second division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). From the reviewers’ comment, it’s clear that we did not sufficiently highlight the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> (diplochromosomes present) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—supplement 1E</xref> (diplochromosomes absent). We have thus revised the text to make this point clearer. In summary, due to both protocol differences (fixed spreads vs. live imaging) and temporal differences (metaphase vs. anaphase), diplochromosomes are not morphologically identical to their appearance in metaphase spreads, but are clearly recognizable in live images of the first <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> division. We have revised the text to make this point clearer.</p><p><italic>In addition, how can authors exclude that the observed segregation defects are mainly due to the presence of multipolar spindles? Actually, the presence of frequent tripolar divisions has been reported by Schoenfelder et al. (2014) in 8N papillar cells.</italic></p><p>As requested, we now provide additional data regarding multipolar divisions. As the reviewers point out, we previously documented tripolar divisions after endocycles in papillar cells. However, we would like to point out that these divisions are in fact infrequent (~7% of all endocycled papillar cells- Schoenfelder et al., 2014), due to the inefficient duplication of centrosomes during papillar endocycles. We have since examined whether centrosomes duplicate, and to what extent, in <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells after heat shock. Much like papillar cells, we find very few (7%) <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells contain extra centrosomes at the first division, as assayed by Gamma Tubulin antibody staining. Accordingly, 0 out of 65 first division <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells undergo multipolar division. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (panels F and G) and we have added additional text that addresses this point raised by the reviewers. Thus, we conclude that diplochromosomes – not extra centrosomes/multipolar spindles – are the main cause of chromosome segregation defects in <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> animals.</p><p><italic>Based on the evidence that loss of Mad2 abolishes the lengthened period of metaphase caused by diplochromosomes, authors conclude that a wait-anaphase signal is activated in the presence of diplochromosomes.

In addition, they only indirectly demonstrate that the absence of a delay in the metaphase-anaphase progression corresponds to an increase of defective mitoses, through the analysis of the survival rate and of the developmental defects observed in fzr overexpressing mad2 null animals. Can they quantitate the frequency of aberrant anaphases in the induced polytenic cells of mad2 null animals? Also, related to this point, if Mad1 is dispensable and they claim Mad2's &quot;checkpoint-independent role&quot;, they should not call &quot;Mad2 SAC&quot; (it is simply a Mad2-depentent novel mechanism, not &quot;SAC&quot; per se).</italic></p><p>As requested, we now include multiple new movies/figure panels regarding the wait-anaphase response to diplochromosomes. 1) We now include panel C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and movies for Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4, which show that BubR1, a component of the wait-anaphase signal, persists much longer on some chromosomes in cells with diplochromosomes. 2) We now include data on the frequency of aberrant anaphases in <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> mad 2 polytene anaphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Further, we removed all references to a “Mad2 SAC” from the text.</p><p><italic>The authors first state that papillar cells do not have quadruplochromosomes and then use a substantial part of the paragraph entitled &quot;Polyteny response 2: Separation…&quot; to demonstrate that polytene chromosomes can be visualized in these cells.

We have made these requested revisions. Regarding the differences between fixed and live material, as discussed in point #2 of our response there are inherent differences in chromosome appearance between live and fixed preparations. We certainly agree that fixed chromosome spreads are the most beautiful way to examine chromosome structure. Live imaging of course has its own benefits, such as enabling us to see the fate of polytene chromosomes over time.</p><p><italic>However, the authors should explain why in the metaphase shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>&quot; four of the green (presumably third) chromosomes show a clear pericentric inversion. Are they balancers? In the same metaphase one of the green chromosomes exhibits a chromatid break. Isn't it supposed to be a wild type metaphase?</italic></p><p>Thank you to the reviewers for these questions. You are absolutely correct on both fronts. We find that inversions on balancer chromosomes locally disrupt the tight homolog-homolog pairing in papillar polytenes, which is of course expected given the long history of study of chromosome pairing in polyploid cells. We now discuss this in the text and add <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> panel B that highlights the effect of balancers on papillar chromosome structure. With regards to DNA breakage, as we discuss below and as we previously published (Fox et al. 2010) this <italic>is</italic> a naturally occurring feature of wild type papillar chromosomes. How papillar cells respond to naturally occurring DNA breaks is the subject of a separate manuscript currently in press at Developmental Cell. We now note this in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>It is not clear how mad2 null animals fail to complete SIRS before anaphase, as the video frames in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> refer only to a wild type cell.

We do in fact have compelling evidence that papillar chromatids are arranged in a conventional recent-sister pair configuration. This evidence comes from another study in our lab (currently in press at Developmental Cell) that explored the frequent appearance of broken chromosomes in papillar cells. These breaks are frequently at the same place on adjacent chromatids in a sister pair, which could best be explained by a break that occurred prior to or during S-phase, which was then propagated to both halves of the most recent sister pair. These data lead us to conclude that recent sisters remain in a conventional arrangement in papillar cells following endocycles. We provide evidence of our chromosome breakage data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1.</xref></p><p><italic>Are there data in the literature that cohesins can be removed in endoreduplicating cells?</italic></p><p>Thank you to the reviewers for this question. We are not aware of any study that specifically examined whether cohesins are dynamic during the period of endoreduplication. However, we do cite studies from the Kassis and Nasmyth laboratories showing that cohesins are dynamic in polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands (which may or may not have finished endoreduplication). In the near future, we plan to undertake our own studies and to examine whether cohesins, if dynamic in papillar cells, are similarly dynamic in other polytene cells that do not undergo future divisions. It is possible that cohesin regulation is distinct in cells that are never destined to undergo SIRS.</p><p><italic>It would be of interest and helpful to a broader readership to further elaborate in the beginning of the manuscript what physical connections between polytene sisters/homologs might exist and which of these are analogous in mammalian cells that may display &quot;polytene-like&quot; structures.

The reviewers also raise a number of important points about the often challenging and non-uniform use of nomenclature related to polyploidization cell cycles, polyploidy, and polytene chromosomes – we’ve expanded the nomenclature section of the Methods to more clearly and extensively define polytene structure and when it is possible to distinguish diplochromosomes and numbers of chromatids.</p><p><italic>Is it possible that an important difference between SIRS compatible cells and SIRS non-compatible cells is some degree of DNA underreplication in polytene cells and their ability to resolve/finish this DNA replication?

While we understand why one would wonder about pairing in this context, we find the reviewers’ model to be unlikely, based on both our own data and on previously published data. First, we find that homologous chromosomes are not paired when <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells are in mitosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>’). Second, our finding is consistent with previous work by others in diploid cells, such as from the Sedat lab (Fung et al. 1998) showing that homolog pairing is disrupted by mitosis. We have made this point clearer in the text. Thus, we consider it unlikely that homolog pairing influences polytene chromosome segregation in <italic>HS&gt;fzr</italic> cells.</p><p><italic>The use of the phrase &quot;eliminates polytene chromosomes&quot; (such as in the Discussion subsection “A model for SIRS”, first paragraph and other variants thereof) implies that chromosomes themselves are destroyed or lost.

If this is a correct interpretation of what the authors mean, then they may wish to use different words or phrase to clearly indicate that chromosomes are not being &quot;eliminated&quot; per se, but instead it's the polytene organization of chromosomes that is being eliminated.</italic></p><p>Thank you – we have revised the text to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>The authors state &quot;consistent with previous work&quot; (or alike) in many places. This gives false impression that this work lacks novelty: if one carefully reads the paper and goes to the references, the references are often talking about the phenomenon in a different context (e.g. previous work showed something in diploid cells, and the authors showed a similar phenomenon in tetraploid cells). The authors should make it clear in what aspect it is consistent with the previous work, and what is novel in this work.</italic></p><p>We have re-reviewed the literature and revised/qualified the text where necessary. Thank you for noting the novelty of our work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
