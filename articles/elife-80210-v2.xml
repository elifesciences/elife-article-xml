TEAD-YAP controls the expression of Hippo-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and tumorigenesis. Hyperactivation of TEAD-YAP activities is observed in many human cancers and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival, and immune evasion. Therefore, targeting the TEAD-YAP complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. We previously reported that the mammalian TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1–4) possess auto-palmitoylation activities and contain an evolutionarily conserved palmitate-binding pocket (PBP), which allows small-molecule modulation. Since then, several reversible and irreversible inhibitors have been reported by binding to PBP. Here, we report a new class of TEAD inhibitors with a novel binding mode. Representative analog TM2 shows potent inhibition of TEAD auto-palmitoylation both in vitro and in cells. Surprisingly, the co-crystal structure of the human TEAD2 YAP-binding domain (YBD) in complex with TM2 reveals that TM2 adopts an unexpected binding mode by occupying not only the hydrophobic PBP, but also a new side binding pocket formed by hydrophilic residues. RNA-seq analysis shows that TM2 potently and specifically suppresses TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities. Consistently, TM2 exhibits strong antiproliferation effects as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor in YAP-dependent cancer cells. These findings establish TM2 as a promising small-molecule inhibitor against TEAD-YAP activities and provide new insights for designing novel TEAD inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>medicinal chemistry</kwd><kwd>co-crytal structure</kwd><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>tead transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA219814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA238270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK127180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Junhao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK127207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Junhao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Xuelian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Antidote Health Foundation for the cure of cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystal structural analysis reveals a novel reversible pan-inhibitor of TEA domains with enhanced potency adopts a unique binding mode.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the major downstream effectors of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway that controls organ size and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Beyond their critical roles in development, accumulating evidence shows that YAP/TAZ hyperactivation is frequently linked to tumorigenesis in a broad range of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zanconato et al., 2016b</xref>). Importantly, YAP/TAZ alone cannot interact with DNA; therefore, it requires the binding of transcriptional factors TEA/TEF-domain (TEAD1–4 in mammals and Scalloped in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) to regulate the expression of Hippo-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The transcriptional targets of the TEAD-YAP/TAZ complex are involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, immune evasion, and stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>). However, direct targeting YAP/TAZ with small molecules has been shown to be difficult. Therefore, pharmacological disruption of TEAD-YAP/TAZ has been considered as a promising avenue for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holden and Cunningham, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pobbati and Hong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanconato et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>One such strategy is to directly target TEAD-YAP interface with peptidomimetic inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, a peptide termed ‘Super-TDU’ was designed to block the TEAD-YAP interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>). ‘Super-TDU’ mimics TDU domain of VGLL4, which competes with YAP/TAZ for TEAD binding, and has been shown to suppress gastric cancer growth. However, peptide-based inhibitors generally suffer from poor cell permeability and pharmacokinetic properties, limiting their therapeutic applications. Since TEAD-YAP binding interface is shallow and spanning a large surface area, it is particularly challenging to optimize small molecules for desired potency.</p><p>Previously, we and others discovered that TEAD auto-palmitoylation plays an important role in regulation of TEAD stability and TEAD-YAP binding, and loss of TEAD palmitoylation leads to inhibition of TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Holden et al., 2020</xref>). More importantly, structural and biochemical studies illustrated that the lipid chain of palmitate inserts into a highly conserved deep hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noland et al., 2016</xref>), away from TEAD-YAP interface, which is suitable for small-molecule binding and suggests that lipid binding allosterically regulates TEAD-YAP activities.</p><p>Over the past years, targeting TEAD auto-palmitoylation has emerged as an attractive strategy for fighting cancers with aberrant YAP activation. To date, several companies and academic research groups have developed small-molecule inhibitors against TEAD-YAP activities. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid (FA), has been shown to bind to the lipid-binding pocket of TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pobbati et al., 2015</xref>). Although FA lacks potency to block TEAD function, it demonstrates that the lipid-binding pocket could indeed accommodate small-molecule binding. Ever since then, FA scaffold has been extensively explored by medicinal chemists to design TEAD inhibitors, including irreversible inhibitors TED-347 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bum-Erdene et al., 2019</xref>), DC-TEADin02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2019</xref>), MYF-01-037 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kurppa et al., 2020</xref>), K975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref>), as well as reversible inhibitor VT103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). In comparison, non-FA-based TEAD inhibitors are relatively limited, and only a few examples, such as compound 2, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Holden et al., 2020</xref>). Among the reported inhibitors, K975 and VT103 showed strong antiproliferation effects in vitro and antitumor effects in vivo. However, these inhibitors only have effects in limited cell lines, such as <italic>NF2</italic>-deficient mesothelioma cells. In addition, most of the reported TEAD inhibitors are irreversible inhibitors targeting the cysteine at the palmitoylation site, which might have undesired nonspecific reactivity toward other cysteines or other targets. To gain insights into the chemical diversity of reversible TEAD inhibitors and their utilities in cancer therapeutics, it is important to identify new chemical scaffolds to target TEADs.</p><p>We previously developed a non-FA-based reversible TEAD inhibitor, MGH-CP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2020</xref>), which inhibited transcriptional output of TEAD-YAP in vitro and in vivo. However, MGH-CP1 only showed sub-micromolar potency against TEAD palmitoylation in vitro and was used at low micromolar range in cellular assays. These limitations prompt us to develop new TEAD inhibitors with higher potency. In this study, we discovered a series of novel TEAD inhibitors featuring a common 4-benzoyl-piperazine-1-carboxamide scaffold. Among them, TM2 exhibits strong inhibition of TEAD2 and TEAD4 auto-palmitoylation in vitro with the IC50 values of 156 nM and 38 nM, respectively. In addition, palmitoylation of both exogenous Myc-TEAD1 and endogenous Pan-TEADs is also significantly diminished by TM2 in HEK293A cells, which further confirms its potency and mode of action in cellular context. The co-crystal structure of TEAD2 YBD in complex with TM2 uncovered a novel binding mode of the compound, which extended into a previously unknown hydrophilic side pocket adjacent to the PBP, and caused extensive side-chain rearrangements of the interacting residues. Further functional studies showed that TM2 significantly inhibits YAP-dependent liver organoid growth ex vivo and inhibits proliferation of YAP-dependent cancer cells as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor. Overall, these studies broaden our understanding of the small-molecule-binding sites on TEADs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of TM2 as a novel TEAD auto-palmitoylation inhibitor</title><p>To identify new chemotypes that could inhibit TEAD auto-palmitoylation, we screened a library containing about 30,000 non-proprietary medicinal chemistry compounds with three rounds of click-ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lanyon-Hogg et al., 2015</xref>) through the Astellas-MGH research collaboration by using the recombinant TEAD2 and TEAD4 YBD proteins.

We found several hits that share a common 4-(3-(2-cyclohexylethoxy)benzoyl)-piperazine-1-carboxamide moiety (data not shown, with micromolar potency in TEAD palmitoylation assays in vitro). The main variation is located at the <italic>N</italic>-substituent of the urea moiety with frequent incorporation of heteroarenes. Inspired by this structural convergence, we first designed a series of derivatives with variable substituents at the urea moiety, represented by TM2 and TM22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TEAD2 auto-palmitoylation in vitro assay was used to evaluate their potency. Compared to heteroaryl group, phenyl substituent showed stronger inhibition on TEAD2 auto-palmitoylation (TM2 vs. TM22, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Inspired by these results, we explored the tolerance level by increasing hydrophilicity of TM2. As illustrated by TM45 and TM98, hydrophilic groups at the left cyclohexyl ring significantly decrease the activities, while the phenyl moiety at the right side of the urea moiety is well tolerated (TM112, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

VT103 showed stronger activities on TEAD1 palmitoylation, consistent with the previous report that VT103 is a TEAD1-specific inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, TM2 showed stronger activities in blocking endogenous pan-TEAD palmitoylation compared to other compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Unlike palmitic acid with its head group pointing toward residue C380, the urea moiety of TM2 exhibits a completely different orientation and sticks into a new side pocket, which has never been reported before to be involved in TEAD inhibitor binding and is only accessible by rearranging the side chains upon TM2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TM2 binding drives significant conformational changes in the side chains of residues C343 and L374, which makes space for TM2 insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, TM2 binding causes the side-chain movement in residues Q410 and Y333, which reduces the distance between the nitrogen atom of Q410 and the oxygen atom of Y333 from 4.9 Å to 2.7 Å to allow the formation of favorite electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>This binding model is highly consistent with our structure–activity relationship (SAR) results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> that demonstrate that the left hydrophobic tail is repulsive to incorporate hydrophilicity, while the urea moiety is tolerated. The surface electrostatics of the TM2 binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) also illustrated that the (2-cyclohexylethoxy)phenyl moiety inserts into a nearly neutral environment, while the urea is buried in a pocket bearing electronegative properties. Furthermore, the electronegative carbonyl that links benzene and piperazine is spatially adjacent to electropositive electrostatics.</p><p>We then assessed whether this unexpected binding model is unique to TM2 compared to other known TEAD inhibitors. Given that reported TEAD inhibitors are co-crystallized with different members of TEAD family of proteins, we aligned crystal structures of TEAD1–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It showed that all eight interacting residues in the new side pocket of TEAD2 were highly conserved among all the TEAD family members. Besides, the protein sequence alignment also demonstrated that the key residues within the newly identified binding site were conserved, even in TEADs from other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although there are some variants, for example, Cys343 is a Val in TEAD3 and Q410 is Leu in TEAD1, the binding affinity should not be affected. Under this premise, the co-crystal structures of TEAD YBD in complex with PLM (PDB 5HGU), TM2 (PDB 8CUH), and other known TEAD inhibitors, including MGH-CP1 (PDB 6CDY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2020</xref>), K975 (PDB 7CMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref>), and VT105 (PDB 7CNL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2021</xref>), were superposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Consistent with previously reported results, MGH-CP1, VT105, or K975 adopts almost the same binding mode as PLM and fits very well with the PBP. However, the scenario depicted by TM2 is quite different, which provides new insights into the structural adaptability for the development of TEAD inhibitors. Considering relatively higher hydrophilicity in the new side pocket, there will be much more space to balance the lipophilicity of TEAD inhibitors and improve drug-like properties, such as solubility and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Waring, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TM2 inhibits TEAD-YAP association and TEAD-YAP transcriptional activity</title><p>TEAD auto-palmitoylation plays an important role in the regulation of TEAD-YAP interaction.

Therefore, we evaluated TM2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) as Hippo pathway has been shown to regulate the progression of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Della Chiara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). However, TM2 did not exhibit strong inhibition on cell proliferation of two CRC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), HCT116 and DLD1. These results suggested that suppression of Hippo transcriptional activities in CRC alone might not be sufficient to inhibit cell growth, as observed in mesothelioma. Indeed, YAP are found to be capable of rescuing cell viability in HCT116 with loss of function of KRAS, implying that KRAS signaling might also account for lack of potency of TM2 in CRC. Hence, we performed a drug combination matrix analysis across five doses of TM2 and nine doses of MEK inhibitor trametinib in HCT116 and DLD1, respectively. Encouragingly, we observed strong inhibitory effects and substantial synergy in both of the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that combining TEAD inhibitors with other therapies might be a good strategy to broaden their therapeutic applications in near future. Together, our data highlights that TM2 might have appealing potential to antagonize carcinogenesis driven by aberrant YAP activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we discovered a new class of reversible pan-TEAD inhibitors. The most potent compound, TM2, significantly diminished TEAD2/4 auto-palmitoylation in nanomolar ranges. Co-crystal structure analysis of TM2 in complex with TEAD2 YBD discovered a novel binding mode. It showed that the much more hydrophobic part of TM2 featured a cyclohexyl ring, exquisitely fitting the palmitoylation pocket, which is the most well-known structure feature for targeting TEAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, the structure demonstrates that the urea moiety of TM2 does not overlap with PLM, but sticks into a new and unique side pocket. This binding site is not occupied by all other known TEAD inhibitors, such as MGH-CP1, VT105, and K975. This side pocket is not fully available in the palmitate-bound TEAD2 structure, but is formed with significant side-chain rearrangement upon TM2 binding. Moreover, this side pocket is endowed with higher hydrophilicity than the lipid-binding pocket, providing potentials for enhancing drug-like properties. The novel binding model expands structural diversity of the TEAD-binding pocket and will boost the discovery of more novel chemotypes, contributing to the development of therapeutics targeting TEAD-YAP.</p><p>Blocking TEAD auto-palmitoylation by TM2 disrupted TEAD-YAP association. Consistently, we observed significant suppression of downstream Hippo transcription program with treatment of TM2. RNA-seq analysis further confirmed that TM2 specifically inhibits YAP transcriptional signatures. YAP/TAZ is constitutively active in many human malignancies and shown to be essential for many cancer hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zanconato et al., 2016b</xref>). Therefore, targeting YAP/TAZ activities has been considered as an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. In human MPM, a type of tumor that is highly associated with YAP activation, TM2 showed striking antiproliferation efficacy as a single agent, which is consistent with the fact that therapeutic effects of TEAD inhibitors are mainly limited to mesothelioma models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaneda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). In colorectal cancer HCT116 and DLD1, single treatment of TM2 was insufficient to inhibit their growth, although they are also reported to be dependent on YAP activities. This might be interpreted by the activation of other oncogenic signaling pathways in these cancers, including Ras-MAPK activations. Indeed, YAP has been shown to converge with KRAS and can rescue cell viability induced by KRAS suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shao et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that inhibiting YAP activities might be also rescued by other oncogenes. Consistently, significant synergy effects were observed when combining TM2 with a MEK inhibitor. These encouraging results suggested that rationalized combination of TEAD inhibitors with other inhibitors could significantly expand the utilities. In summary, our study disclosed TM2 as a promising new starting point for developing novel antitumor therapeutics against TEAD-YAP activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Inhibition of TEAD2 and TEAD4 auto-palmitoylation in vitro</title><p>Recombinant 6xHis-TEAD protein was treated with compounds under indicated concentrations in 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.4) for 30 min.

The claim of specificity based on a comparison of RNA-Seq datasets derived from an in vivo experiment versus a cell-based monoculture assay is not relevant.

It would substantially help to clarify any differences (or identity) in the side chains within the newly identified inhibitor binding site across TEAD family members, to substantiate the claim that this is a new site.

It is also unclear how the authors defined TM2-regulated genes based only on replicates. A minimum of triplicate samples for such analysis is suggested.</p><p>– It is unclear what the analysis in Figure 3 – supplemental 2 is trying to show. If the goal is to show that similar genes are affected by both K975 and TM2 then a global analysis, rather than focusing on previously reported YAP/TAZ targets, would be more appropriate. If the goal is to state that TM2 is more potent, then analysis under the same condition needs to be performed. The comparison of in vivo animal treatment versus in vitro cell culture treatment is not informative.</p><p>– The effects of TM2 treatment on the organoids could benefit from quantitation across multiple experiments, particularly the effects on proliferation. It would also be important to quantify the organoid size and map the effects of TM2 treatment on the fate of the organoids (i.e., does TM2 treatment promote cell differentiation?).</p><p>– Quantitation and a description of how many times experiments were performed should be included throughout.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80210.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hu et al., describe the discovery and characterization of a new class of reversible TEAD inhibitors that binds to a novel side pocket adjacent to the palmitate-binding pocket.

In the revised manuscript, we compared TM2 with K975 (Kirin, irreversible inhibitor), VT103 (Vivace, reversible inhibitor), and our earlier published TEAD inhibitor MGH-CP1 side-by-side. First, in TEAD2 auto-palmitoylation assay, our results showed that TM2 is more potent than K975, VT103 and MGH-CP1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Similar results were also observed when we compared their potencies on TEAD4 auto-palmitoylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Next, we evaluated their activities to inhibit full length myc-TEAD1 palmitoylation in cells. TM2, K975 and VT103, significantly suppressed Myc-TEAD1 palmitoylation under submicromolar concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). Among them, VT103 is slightly more potent on TEAD1. This is consistent with the published report that VT103 is a TEAD1 specific inhibitor, but with less activities on TEAD2 and TEAD4 (Tang <italic>et al., 2021</italic>, <italic>Mol.

Consistently, TM2 showed the strongest inhibition on endogenous pan-TEAD palmitoylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2D). Taken together, these new data suggested that TM2 is a more potent and broader pan-inhibitor of TEAD family compared to known inhibitors. We have added these data to new Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We then compared the antiproliferation effects of TM2, K975, and VT103 in YAP-dependent mesothelioma cells. In NCI-H226 cells (NF2 mutant), TM2 showed potent and comparable activity with K975, an irreversible inhibitor. Surprisingly, VT103 showed a strikingly low nM IC50 value, which is even lower than its on-target inhibition on TEAD1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A), suggesting that its anti-proliferative activities might be due to potential off-target effects. Furthermore, we also tested these compounds in MSTO-211H cells with strong YAP dependency due to Lats1/2 deletion. Consistent with the observation in NCI-H226, the covalent inhibitor K975 showed comparable potency to TM2. However, non-covalent inhibitor VT103 did not exhibit meaningful inhibition and showed a flat curve (data not shown). Although VT103 suppressed cell growth to about 40% under low nanomolar concentrations as MTT assay indicated, we did not observe obvious cell growth inhibition under microscope when counting cell numbers (data not shown), suggesting that VT103’s effects might be due to non-specific inhibition of MTT conversion. The results are consistent with previous paper showing that VT103 did not inhibit proliferation of MSTO-211H cells (Tang et al., 2021, PMID: 33850002). Overall, TM2 and K975 displayed best inhibitory effects on cell proliferation in mesothelioma cells. Given that irreversible inhibitors harbor off-target disadvantages, and K975 has reported to have kidney toxicity (Kaneda <italic>et al., Am. J. Cancer Res.</italic> 2020, PMID: 33415007), a more potent reversible inhibitor, such as TM2, could be more promising therapeutic agent. This data has been added to new Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical analysis is generally lacking. Quantitation and a description of how many times experiments were performed should be included throughout. Especially, RNA-seq should be performed with a minimum of triplicates, and the authors need to compare an RNA-seq dataset involving the known inhibitor using an identical cell-based system (time point, cell line).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the thoughtful comments. In the revised manuscript, we included the description that indicates how many replicates were performed for every quantification experiment in the Figure legend. As suggested, we have performed RNA-seq analyses with 3 independent replicates for each sample. As Figure 3C-F shown, TM2 showed significant inhibition on transcriptional activities of Hippo pathway. Compared with two other TEAD inhibitor, K975 and VT103, TM2 showed a similar pattern on regulation of global gene expressions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). To further specify their regulation on Hippo transcriptional outputs, we compared the alterations of YAP/TAZ-TEAD target genes in NCI-H266 treated with these three inhibitors individually with the same time point and concentrations. TM2 displayed comparable potency with the irreversible inhibitor K975 on target genes regulation visualized by heatmap analysis (Figure 3G), and both compounds showed stronger suppression than VT103. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of TEAD-YAP/TAZ target genes for TM2, K975 and VT103 was also performed with the normalized enrichment score (NES) of -2.64, -2.56, -2.31, respectively (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), suggesting that TM2 likely showed the best TEAD-YAP target gene enrichment (more negative value means stronger suppression of the gene set).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The claim of specificity based on a comparison of RNA-Seq datasets derived from an in vivo experiment versus a cell-based monoculture assay is not relevant. Direct comparison to K975 can only be made using the same time point/duration of target engagement and cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree reviewer 1’s comments. We generated new triplicated RNA-seq datasets using H226 cells with comparison among TM2, K975 and VT103. New panels are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would substantially help to clarify any differences (or identity) in the side chains within the newly identified inhibitor binding site across TEAD family members, to substantiate the claim that this is a new site. It appears to be the case, but the inhibitors used for comparison were structurally characterized in the context of different (not TEAD2) family members (if I understand correctly).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer 1’s insightful suggestion. We here aligned crystal structures of TEAD1-4 and found all eight interacting residues in the new side pocket of TEAD2 were highly conserved among all the TEAD family members (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). In addition, the protein sequence alignment also demonstrated that the key residues with the newly identified binding site were highly conserved, even in TEADs from other species (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). Although there are some variants, for example, Cys343 is a Val in TEAD3 and Q410 is Leu in TEAD1, the binding affinity should not be affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The synergy data is not overly convincing. How many well replicates were used to generate the number that is shown? Can statistical significance with respect to the difference between wells under a given condition be given?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figure legend to illustrate what the panels showed in Fig4E. Figure 4E Left panels show the dose curve of the single agents. Middle panel showed the heatmap with color-coding as percentage of cell viability normalized to untreated controls under combination. Right panel shows the heatmap of Bliss score for TM2 and Trametinib combination. The Synergy score was generated by “Synergyfinder” package in R software (PMID: 35580060). Bliss score of higher than 10 indicates synergistic effects. In Fig4E, we observed strong synergy (Bliss score 20-30) across multiple doses. This is a commonly used method to determine the combinational effect using heatmaps based on Bliss score, in which the statistical models are not generally carried out (PMID: 34234012; PMID: 32368721; PMID: 27165605).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The identification of new regions within the TEAD palmitate-binding pocket that may impact TEAD functions is interesting, but it remains unclear if/how these residues influence YAP binding or TEAD activity beyond other inhibitors that sit in the hydrophobic pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe significant conformational changes in TEAD-YAP binding interface in TEAD2 YAP binding domain (YBD)-TM2 co-crystal structures. The inhibition of TEAD-YAP binding by TEAD inhibitors (including all TEAD inhibitor bound to the lipid binding site) has been observed in cell based assay with full length TEAD proteins, suggesting that additional factor or mechanisms are involved, and full-length TEADs might be required. This is consistent with other published TEAD inhibitors, including K975 and VT103, which do not significantly alter the conformation of TEAD YBD. The binding to the additional pocket by TM2 might contribute to enhanced affinity of TM2 to TEADs and its pan-TEAD inhibition. It is possible that TM2 might induce changes in full-length TEADs structures, which remain difficult to be determined by X-ray crystallography. However, we have observed that TM2 could disrupt TEAD-TEAD dimerization (data not shown), and more studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms and functional consequences. We would publish these data in future publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the statistical limitations, it is unclear why the authors chose to perform RNA-seq on two replicates to characterize the effects of TM2 treatment on gene expression. It is also unclear how the authors defined TM2-regulated genes based only on replicates. A minimum of triplicate samples for such analysis is suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

If the goal is to show that similar genes are affected by both K975 and TM2 then a global analysis, rather than focusing on previously reported YAP/TAZ targets, would be more appropriate. If the goal is to state that TM2 is more potent, then analysis under the same condition needs to be performed. The comparison of in vivo animal treatment versus in vitro cell culture treatment is not informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2’s comments. We agree that the comparison of in vivo animal treatment versus in vitro cell culture treatment is not informative. We generated new triplicated RNA-seq datasets using NCI-H226 treated with vehicle control, TM2, K975 and VT103. The new panel with comparison of target genes are shown in Figure 3G and Figure 3—figure supplement 2-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The effects of TM2 treatment on the organoids could benefit from quantitation across multiple experiments, particularly the effects on proliferation. It would also be important to quantify the organoid size and map the effects of TM2 treatment on the fate of the organoids (i.e., does TM2 treatment promote cell differentiation?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer 2’s insightful comments. As suggested, Ki67 staining was quantified across biological independent replicates (n = 3) for each group, which confirmed that TM2 disrupted organoid maintenance (New Figure 4B). To study the effects of TM2 on organoid growth, we measured the size of hepatic organoids. Our results showed that organoid size was significantly inhibited when treated with TM2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Recent evidence demonstrated that activation of Hippo signaling is required to maintain differentiation state of hepatocyte (PMID: 24906150; PMID: 27358050). Therefore, we investigated if inhibition of TEAD-YAP activity will affect the fate of organoids by detecting expression of mature hepatocyte markers, such as <italic>Alb</italic>, <italic>Fxr</italic> and <italic>cyp3a</italic>. Although TM2 only showed minor effect on <italic>cyp3a</italic>, it significantly induced expressions of <italic>Alb</italic> and <italic>Fxr</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B)<italic>,</italic> suggesting TM2 might induce hepatic differentiation.
