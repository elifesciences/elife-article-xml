with a single system? Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of <italic>E. coli</italic> using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03526.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03526.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03526.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacterial colonies are generally made up of genetically identical cells. Despite this, a closer look at the members of a bacterial colony shows that these cells can have very different behaviors. For example, some cells may grow more quickly than others, or be more resistant to antibiotics. The mechanisms driving this diversity are only beginning to be identified and understood.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria can move towards, or away from, certain chemicals in their surrounding environment to help them navigate toward favorable conditions. This behavior is known as chemotaxis. The signals from all of these chemicals are processed in <italic>E. coli</italic> by just one set of proteins, which control the different behaviors that are needed for the bacteria to follow them. Different numbers of these proteins are found in different—but genetically identical—bacteria, and the number of proteins is linked to how the bacteria perform these behaviors.</p><p>It has been suggested that diversity can be beneficial to the overall bacterial population, as it helps the population survive environmental changes. This suggests that the level of diversity in the population should adapt to the level of diversity in the environment. However, it remains unknown how this adaptation occurs.</p><p>Frankel et al. developed and combined several models and simulations to investigate whether differences in chemotaxis protein production help an <italic>E. coli</italic> colony to survive. The models show that in different environments, it can be beneficial for the population as a whole if different cells have different responses to the chemicals present. For example, if a lot of a useful chemical is present, bacteria are more likely to survive by heading straight to the source. If not much chemical is detected, the bacteria may need to move in a more exploratory manner.</p><p>Frankel et al. find that different amounts of chemotaxis proteins produce these different behaviors. To survive in a changing environment, it is therefore best for the <italic>E. coli</italic> colony to contain cells that have different amounts of these proteins. Frankel et al. propose that the variability of chemotaxis protein levels between genetically identical cells can change through mutations in the genes that control how many of the proteins are produced, and predict that such mutations allow populations to adapt to environmental changes.</p><p>The environments simulated in the model were much simpler than would be found in the real world, and Frankel et al. describe experiments that are now being performed to confirm and expand on their results. The model could be used in the future to shed light on the behavior of other cells that are genetically identical but exhibit diverse behaviors, from other bacterial species to more complex cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03526.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03526.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>fitness trade-offs</kwd><kwd>phenotypic diversity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

The core of the network is a two-component signal transduction system that carries chemical information gathered by transmembrane receptors to flagellar motors responsible for cell propulsion. A second group of proteins allows the cells to physiologically adapt to changing background signal levels, enabling them to track signal gradients over many orders of magnitude. While different receptors allow cells to sense different signals, all signals are then processed through the same set of cytoplasmic proteins responsible for signal transduction and adaptation. This horizontal integration may impose conflicting demands on the regulation of these core decision-making components because signals can vary in time, space, and identity. In this study, we examine to what extent cell-to-cell variability in abundance of these core proteins may help resolve such conflicts.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03526.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>From proteins to fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cell receives extracellular ligand signals through transmembrane receptors.

Counterclockwise rotation of the flagella promotes the formation of a helical bundle that propels the cell forward in a run. Clockwise rotation tends to disrupt the bundle, interrupting runs with brief direction-changing tumbles. The fraction of time a motor spins clockwise, or clockwise bias, controls the frequency of tumbles and thus plays a central role in chemotactic behavior. Tumble frequency increases monotonically with clockwise bias until the latter reaches about 0.9, at which point cells tumble nearly twice a second and are essentially stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>). It has been observed that clonal cells, grown and observed under the same conditions without stimulation, will differ substantially in clockwise bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The central logic of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis is to transiently decrease clockwise bias in response to an increase in attractant signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This approach allows cells to climb gradients of attractants by lengthening runs up the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The adaptation process that maintains receptor sensitivity is mediated by the covalent modification of the chemoreceptors through addition and subtraction of methyl groups by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. Like clockwise bias, the timescale of this adaptation process has been observed to vary among clonal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spudich and Koshland, 1976</xref>). The intracellular levels of these proteins are known to change both adaptation timescale and clockwise bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Chemoreceptor activity is communicated to the motors via phosphorylation of the response regulator CheY to form CheY-P by the receptor-associated kinase CheA. CheZ opposes the action of CheA by dephosphorylating CheY-P. Consequently, the balance of CheA and CheZ affects clockwise bias. The total amount of CheY in the cell determines the range of possible CheY-P levels, and due to noise in the expression of CheY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>) this dynamic range will likewise vary between clonal cells.</p><p>These three phenotypic parameters—clockwise bias, adaptation time, and CheY-P dynamic range—are the main determinants of how <italic>E. coli</italic> performs chemotaxis. These in turn depend on the quantities of chemotaxis proteins within each individual cell. Hence, the copy numbers of these proteins directly determine the ability of the individual to navigate its environment. Since all signals are processed through the same core proteins, this dependency should be independent of the type of signal being followed.</p><p>As such, cell-to-cell variability in protein abundance is likely a major contributor to the observed non-genetic behavioral diversity in clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, First and second panels). Various mechanisms can contribute to such variability, including noise in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>). Random segregation of proteins during cell division probably plays a role as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</xref>) and may impose a lower bound on minimum variability attainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lestas et al., 2010</xref>). Chemotaxis genes are chromosomally organized in operons—that is, expression of multiple genes are driven by common promoters. This genetic architecture ensures that noise in the activity of shared promoters will affect the expression of multiple genes in a correlated manner, conserving the ratios of proteins from cell to cell despite variations in total amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovdok et al., 2009</xref>). Correlation in protein noise has been experimentally shown to be important in determining chemotactic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lovdok et al., 2007</xref>). Combined with the negative integral feedback design of the protein network, this conservation of protein ratios greatly reduces the occurrence of cells with unacceptable parameter values—for instance, those that only run or only tumble—and maintains the precision of the physiological adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkai and Leibler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yi et al., 2000</xref>). For these and other reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oleksiuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres and Wingreen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sneddon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vladimirov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schulmeister etl., 2011</xref>), chemotaxis in <italic>E. coli</italic> is often said to be robust.</p><p>Within this range of acceptable behaviors, however, substantial variability exists, and the fact that this variability has not been selected against raises the question of whether it might serve an adaptive function. Population diversity is known to be an adaptive strategy for environmental uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donaldson-Matasci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haccou and Iwasa, 2005</xref>). In this case of chemotaxis, this would suggest that different cells in the population may hypothetically have behaviors specialized to navigate different environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, Second and third panels). Indeed, past simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vladimirov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dufour et al., 2014</xref>) have shown that the speed at which cells climb exponential gradients depends on clockwise bias and adaptation time, and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2011</xref>) using the capillary assay—an experiment that tests cells' ability to find the mouth of a pipette filled with attractant—have shown that inducing expression of CheR and CheB at different levels changes the chemotactic response. In order to understand the impact of these findings on population diversity, we must place them in an ecological context.</p><p>Relatively little is known about the ecology of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis, but it is probable that they, like other freely swimming bacteria, encounter a wide variety of environments, from gradients whipped up by turbulent eddies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor and Stocker, 2012</xref>) to those generated during the consumption of large nutrient caches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saragosti et al., 2011</xref>). In each case, variations in environmental parameters, such as in the amount of turbulence, the diffusivity of the nutrients, or the number of cells, will change the steepness of these gradients over orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor and Stocker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stocker at al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Seymour et al., 2009</xref>). Still other challenges include maintaining cell position near a source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark and Grant, 2005</xref>), exploration in the absence of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matthaus et al., 2009</xref>), navigating gradients of multiple compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalinin et al., 2010</xref>), navigating toward sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terry et al., 2005</xref>), and evading host immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stossel, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Each of these challenges can be described in terms of characteristic distances and times, for example the length-scale of a nutrient gradient, or the average lifetime of a nutrient source, or the characteristic time- and length-scales of a flow. Chemotactic performance, or the ability of cells to achieve a spatial advantage over time, will depend on how the phenotype of the individual matches the length- and time-scales of the environment. Considering the variety of scales in the aforementioned challenges, and the fact that all must be processed by the same proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it would seem unlikely that a single phenotype would optimally prepare a population for all environments, potentially leading to performance trade-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, panel 3) wherein mutual optimization of multiple tasks with a single phenotype is not possible.</p><p>Cellular performance will have an impact on fitness (i.e. reproduction or survival) depending on ‘how much’ nutrient or positional advantage is required to divide or avoid death. Therefore, selection that acts on chemotactic performance could transform performance trade-offs into fitness trade-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, panels 3 and 4), which are known to have direct consequences for the evolution of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donaldson and Matasci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haccou and Iwasa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shoval et al., 2012</xref>). Selection that favors top performers disproportionately to intermediate performers could hypothetically transform a weak performance trade-off into a strong fitness trade-off.</p><p>Fitness trade-offs can lead to the development of multiple biological modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reuffler et al., 2012</xref>). Some modules, like new limbs, may be permanent fixtures, while others, like metabolic pathways, may be switched on and off, either in response to the environment as it changes, or stochastically in anticipation of environmental fluctuation. This latter case, often called ‘bet-hedging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Veening et al., 2008</xref>),’ is a strategy used by bacteria to avoid extinction from antibiotic stress during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stewart and Cookson, 2012</xref>) and has evolved in the laboratory under fluctuating selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaumount et al., 2009</xref>). In these examples, environmental extremes lead to discrete partitioning of the population. Is there an intermediate case, a possible evolutionary stepping-stone, in which a single function is continuously diversified in the population without the formation of a wholly different state?</p><p>In this study, we seek to determine to what extent advantageous diversity can be created from a single biological network, as well as the possible mechanisms that may permit adaptation of such diversity in response to selective pressures. Due to the lack of quantitative information about the details of the natural environments of <italic>E. coli</italic> that would be relevant to chemotaxis, our goal is not the exact reconstruction of the distribution of challenges experienced by <italic>E. coli</italic> in the wild, but rather to use bacterial chemotaxis as a system to study the interactions between population diversity and environmental trade-offs. Although different signals are sensed by different receptors, the cell interprets all signals using the same set of proteins. Since we are interested in the relationship between cellular dynamics and the length- and time-scales of the environment, this allows us to simplify our study by focusing on different gradients of a single attractant type. Our findings should apply to different signal identities as well.</p><p>For this study, we must be able to translate an individual cell’s protein concentrations into its fitness in different environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Chemotaxis in <italic>E. coli</italic> is a system uniquely well-suited to this purpose. The wealth of molecular and cellular data that has been gathered by different research groups over the last several decades makes it one of the best-characterized systems in biology for the study of single-cell signal transduction and behavior. A key result of this past research is a molecular model of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis, which accounts for the interactions of all of the proteins in the network, that we will fit simultaneously to many experimental data sets. From this model, we will be able to calculate phenotypic parameters such as adaptation and clockwise bias as a function of protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, map from first to second panel).</p><p>We will then simulate the performance of virtual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with these phenotypic parameters to characterize any trade-offs that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> faces in performing fundamental chemotactic tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, map from second to third panel). These tasks will be parameterized by characteristic lengths (distance to source) and times (time allotted). A wide range of these environmental parameters will be explored to ensure that a full spectrum of cell–environment interactions are investigated.</p><p>We will measure the performance of cells in the environments and apply different ecological models of selection to assign fitness. In doing so, we will examine how performance trade-offs give rise to fitness trade-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, map from third to fourth panel). Finally, we will use a model of population diversity based on noisy gene expression to determine whether changing genetic regulation could allow populations to achieve a collective fitness advantage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mathematical model maps protein abundance to phenotypic parameters to behavior</title><p>The first step in creating a single-cell conversion from protein levels into fitness was to build a model of the chemotaxis network.

In this model, the abundance of each protein is lognormal-distributed and depends on a few parameters that determine the mean abundance and the extrinsic (correlated) and intrinsic (uncorrelated) noise in protein abundance (details of the model discussed further below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>). By combining these components, our model simultaneously fit the mean behavior of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>) and the noisy distribution of single-cell behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all cases, a single set of fixed biochemical parameters was used, the only driver of behavioral differences between cells being differences in protein abundance.</p><p>Given an individual with a particular set of protein levels, we then needed to be able to calculate the phenotypic parameters: adaptation time, clockwise bias, and CheY-P dynamic range. To do so we solved for the steady state of the model and its linear response to small deviations in stimuli relative to background (‘Materials and methods’). This produced formulae for the phenotypic parameters in terms of protein concentrations.</p><p>For simplicity, we did not model the interactions of multiple flagella. Rather, we assumed that switching from counterclockwise to clockwise would initiate a tumble after a lag of 0.2 s that was required to account for the finite duration of switching conformation. A similar delay was imposed on switches from tumbles to runs. In this paper we only consider clockwise bias values below ∼0.9, because above this value cells can spend many seconds in the clockwise state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>). During such long intervals, non-canonical swimming in the clockwise state can occur. In this case, the chemotactic response is inverted and cells tend to drift away from attractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 1978</xref>). This behavior is therefore maladaptive for the cell; however, it is only observed in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>). In experiments with wildtype cells, this regime is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>) because of the robust architecture of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>) (‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>Using the definitions for adaptation time, clockwise bias, and CheY-P dynamic range, we reduced the molecular model into a phenotypic model written in terms of phenotypic parameters rather than protein levels (‘Materials and methods’). Simulating the step-response of the molecular model with a given set of protein levels matched the behavior of the phenotypic model with corresponding phenotypic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because there are half as many phenotypic parameters as different proteins, the phenotypic model made it computationally possible to explore large ranges of behavior in the simulations we describe in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Different environments require different behaviors</title><p>To characterize chemotactic trade-offs faced by <italic>E. coli</italic>, we began by investigating which chemotactic phenotypes performed best in different ecological tasks. Here, we defined a phenotype as a particular set of values of the phenotypic parameters: adaptation time, clockwise bias, and CheY-P dynamic range. We used the phenotypic model to simulate the behavior of individual phenotypes in various environments and measured the performance of each phenotype based on metrics appropriate to each ecological challenge. In total, these steps provided us with a direct mapping from individual protein levels to chemotactic performance in the ecological tasks we describe below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic>, like other commensals and pathogens, must survive relatively nutrient-poor environments outside the host until it can colonize a new host. An important ecological parameter in this situation is the characteristic distance between resources, which sets the typical signal length-scale a bacterium must navigate. When a source is close, the challenge might be to climb steep gradients and to stay near the source. In contrast, when the environment is sparse, the ability to explore and navigate shallow gradients may be more important. Another important ecological parameter is the characteristic time-scale of changes in the environment, which dictates the allotted time a bacterium has to navigate its environment. As this time becomes shorter (e.g. when bacteria must take advantage of nutrient patches in moving flows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor and Stocker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celani and Vergassola, 2010</xref>]) chemotactic performance becomes more important. For these reasons, we parameterized environments in terms of distances and times. The range of values was chosen such that at one extreme, cells begin at the source, and at the other, the distance and time requirements are so stringent that reaching the source is only possible by swimming randomly (i.e. pure diffusion).</p><p>We considered two tasks. The first is a foraging challenge in which a spherical parcel of nutrient appears at a certain distance from the cell and immediately begins to diffuse away. This occurs, for instance, upon lysis of a unicellular eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn et al., 1998</xref>). The location of the parcel is unpredictable and could be close or far. Each cell in the simulation accumulated nutrient by collecting an amount proportional to the concentration at its position at every time-step. Performance was defined as the amount of nutrient acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) within a certain time limit. For simplicity we assumed that consumption by an individual is small enough not to have an impact on the gradient itself. Feedback of populations onto the shape of the gradient certainly plays a role in many ecological scenarios and could be considered in this framework in the future.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03526.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Performance of chemotactic phenotypes depends on environmental conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon diagram (not to scale) of the foraging challenge: cells navigating a 3-D time-varying gradient created by diffusion of a small spherical drop of nutrient 100 µm in diameter with diffusion coefficient of 550 µm<sup>2</sup>/s and methyl-aspartate concentration of 100 mM.

This case is analogous to the classic capillary experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mesibov and Adler, 1972</xref>) and may have relevance to infection by species such as uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lane et al., 2005</xref>). We approximated the site as a persistent spherical zone with a non-depleting concentration of attractant. Performance was defined by minimizing the time to reach the site, equivalent to maximizing the reciprocal of the arrival time, before a global time limit, which may be determined ecologically by the carrying capacity of the site or the periodic purging of the area around the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Cells unable to reach the colonization site by that time were given an infinite arrival time and consequently a zero performance value. Later, we consider the reduction of this time limit as an ecological factor.</p><p>For each ecological task, we scanned different environmental parameters (the distance at which the source appears, the time allotted, and the source concentration [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s5 fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 3,5,7</xref>, respectively]) and simulated the performance of different phenotypes. For each phenotype and environment, 6000–30,000 replicate trajectories were averaged together to quantify performance as a function of phenotype and environment. We began with no constraints or correlations between phenotypic parameters and scanned them independently; later we consider the effect of biological constraints on phenotypic distributions.</p><p>When a nearby source appeared, cells in the foraging challenge immediately experienced high nutrient levels and were challenged to maintain their position despite having been exposed to a large increase in signal. Successful cells had high clockwise bias, which curtails long runs, and short adaptation time, which mitigates large responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These cells in a way are defeating chemotaxis and motility both: to stay rooted, they tumble constantly and have a fast adaptation time that reduces the duration of response. If chemotactic populations are preparing for unexpected types of environments but have uniformly turned on expression of chemotaxis and motility genes, cells with these phenotypes could potentially function as if those processes were turned off, without having to introduce a genetic on-off switch. Conversely, when a source appeared farther away, cells had to use longer runs to reach the expanding front of the gradient and long adaptation times to integrate the weaker signals at its tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). If time is further limited, this far-source effect is exaggerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The case of colonization was similar, except that shorter adaptation times were favored overall as compared to foraging. This was because the gradient geometry is much steeper in the vicinity of the source due to its persistently high concentration, and climbing that final part of the gradient was required for colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> inset vs. A inset). Climbing steep gradients requires fast adaptation to stay abreast of quickly changing background levels.</p><p>The source concentration played a minor role in colonization; however, when foraging less concentrated sources, the favored strategy for far distances inverts from low to high clockwise bias, indicating that at that point little can be gained from motility—in fact higher motility may move the cell away from the source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). The dynamic range of CheY-P has a negligible effect on cell performance so long as it is sufficiently high as to ensure that the response of CheY-P to kinase activity is linear and does not saturate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). For this reason, when we discuss optimal performance in the subsequent analysis, we assume that the total amount of CheY molecules in the cell has been selected to be high enough to avoid these limitations (‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>In both challenges, the distance at which the source appeared substantially changed which phenotypes outperformed the others. In general, distant sources required lower clockwise bias and longer adaptation time than nearby ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> compared to B and F compared to E). This becomes even more apparent if we plot the optimal phenotype as a function of source distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results are consistent with our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dufour et al., 2014</xref>) that used an analytical model to predict the velocity of cells climbing static one-dimensional gradients and detailed the mechanistic basis of performance differences between phenotypes. There, we demonstrated a trade-off wherein steep gradients required fast adaptation time and high clockwise bias for optimal velocity, whereas shallow gradients required slow adaptation time and low clockwise bias. Our present simulations of ecological tasks show that this trade-off also exists in more complex chemotactic scenarios. The dependence of the optimal phenotype on the environment follows the same trend in the previous analytical model as it does in our current simulation results, wherein simulations of distant sources are similar to simple shallow gradients and nearer sources are analogous to steeper gradients.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Trade-off strength and population strategy depend on the nature of selection</title><p>Using two ecological tasks, we have shown that a single phenotype cannot perform optimally in all environmental conditions. To understand the consequences of these trade-offs, we must analyze whether they are weak or strong. Such analysis will reveal in which cases populations should adopt homogenous or diversified strategies, respectively, for optimal collective performance.</p><p>For a two-environment trade-off, the fitness of all possible phenotypes in both environments occupies a region in two-dimensional fitness space called the fitness set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levins, 1962</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, gray regions).

As such, we examined trade-offs between pairs of near and far environments to test to what extent cells can cope with environmental variability. In each environment, performance is evaluated on a scale relative to the richness of that environment. That is to say, nearby sources will naturally result in higher performance values than distant ones. Such differences in scale between different tasks do not change the significance of the curvature of the Pareto front; in fact, axes can even have different units and the meaning of the curvature will be the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shoval et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Trade-offs in performance arose when cells were required to mutually optimize foraging or colonization of nearby and far away sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The metabolic reactions that mediate this survival are nonlinear biochemical processes. Many such reactions follow sigmoidal relationships, like the Hill equation, rather than linear ones. We created a simple metabolic relationship in which the survival probability of an individual cell was expressed as a Hill function with two parameters: the amount of food required for survival, and how strongly survival probability depended on that amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To obtain the fitness of a phenotype, we calculated the expected value of its survival by averaging the survival probability of all replicate cells with that phenotype (‘Materials and methods’).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03526.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Selection can reshape trade-offs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simple metabolic model of survival applied to the chemotactic foraging challenge.

Increasing the nutrition requirement and dependency imposed stricter selection, which penalized all but the top performers. This transformed the underlying neutral performance trade-off into a strong fitness trade-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, the selection parameters themselves can determine the strength of fitness trade-offs. Discrete transitions between survival outcomes gave qualitatively similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A–C</xref>).</p><p>In the case of colonization, individual success was binary: either the colonization site was successfully reached, securing that cell's survival for the near future, or the cell was purged—example consumed by a neutrophil—and left no progeny. We approximate the fitness reward for each replicate as a function of the arrival time that steps down from one to zero after a time limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>As in the foraging case, we calculated the colonization fitness, or survival expectation, of a phenotype as the average of the zero and one outcomes of all the individual replicate cells of that phenotype. When the time limit was high, the previously neutral performance trade-off gave rise to a weak fitness trade-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). When the transition point was lower, the same performance trade-off became a strong fitness trade-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These effects mirror those demonstrated in the foraging case. As an alternative calculation of fitness we also considered a continuous reward function, which qualitatively produced the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>The common thread between these cases is that the nonlinear relationship between performance and fitness can increase or reduce the fitness difference between the high-performing specialists and intermediate-performing generalist, strengthening or weakening the trade-off, respectively. Thus, whether diversification is advantageous depends not only on performance trade-offs, but also on the selection process, which has the potential to reverse the strength of trade-offs. Understanding fitness trade-offs therefore requires consideration of both performance and selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Genetic control of non-genetic diversity enables populations to resolve trade-offs</title><p>We have identified conditions in which diversified populations have a fitness advantage over homogeneous ones: those in which the environment is highly variable and those in which selection truncates populations to the top performers. While we cannot know with certainty what trade-offs wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> have experienced, we do know that they exhibit substantial phenotypic heterogeneity in their swimming behavior. As mentioned earlier, our model of bacterial chemotaxis, when combined with a model of cell-to-cell variability in protein abundance, reproduces the variability in adaptation time and clockwise bias measured in a wildtype population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While there are certainly variations in other quantities, such as cell size or number of flagella, the fit of our model suggests that noise in protein levels is a plausible driver for behavioral diversity in <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis.</p><p>Since phenotypic selection can alter variability in protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mora and Walczak, 2013</xref>), we asked the question of whether selection on genetic regulatory features of the chemotaxis network could serve as an adaptive mechanism capable of shaping diversity in protein abundance, and thus phenotypes, to resolve trade-offs. Such features include the organization of the genes on the chromosome and the sequences of ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and promoter regions. Selection for individuals with mutations in these features would give rise to adaptation of the distribution without changing highly-conserved network proteins. In our model of gene expression, such alterations were realized through changes in the levels of extrinsic and intrinsic noise and the mean expression level of each protein. We first varied these parameters individually to investigate their effects on phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03526.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Genetic control of phenotypic diversity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clustering genes on multicistronic operons constrains the ratios in protein abundance.

Intrinsic noise is increased when translation of a protein is highly stochastic or when individual proteins are driven by different promoters that are decoupled. When we compared populations that had low or high intrinsic noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, light blue and dark blue, respectively) we observed that high intrinsic noise resulted in many cells having clockwise bias near 0 or 1 and therefore being non-chemotactic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, dark blue).

We illustrated this by increasing the mean level of CheR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, pink). CheR is responsible for receptor methylation, so increasing its mean level decreased the mean adaptation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). There was also an increase in mean clockwise bias due to the fact that increasing CheR relative to CheB increases the steady-state methylation level (in spite of the mitigating effect of the CheB-P feedback), leading to higher clockwise bias.</p><p>Extrinsic noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) arises both from variations in global factors in the cell, such as differences in the number of ribosomes or errors in protein partitioning during cell division, as well as from the noisiness of promoters that drive multicistronic operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller-Jensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freed et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruggeman et al., 2009</xref>). Reduction of extrinsic noise, which for example could occur through stronger feedback control on a promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lestas et al., 2010</xref>), resulted in a population with a tighter, more homogenous distribution of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>, red). Hence, through pathway-specific mutations in the promoter or its regulators, we predict that clonal populations could approach a more generalist-like distribution or a more multi-specialist-like distribution. However, noise cannot be eliminated entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lestas et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that there may be a fundamental limit to the efficacy of a generalist strategy through the reduction of protein noise.</p><p>To determine whether changing these regulatory parameters alone can generate Pareto-optimal population distributions, we numerically optimized population fitness (‘Materials and methods’), allowing only the two noise magnitudes and the mean expression levels to vary. Populations were comprised of individual cells, each having a fitness in each environment. Following previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haccou and Iwasa, 1995</xref>), the fitness of the population in a given environment was defined as the average fitness of all of its individuals in that environment. For simplicity we assumed that the population encountered environments one at a time and survived all environments. Therefore the population fitness over all environments was the geometric mean of the population fitness in each environment, weighted by the probability of encountering each environment (‘Materials and methods’). The environments considered were the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which include examples of both strong and weak trade-offs for each ecological task.</p><p>We used the wildtype level of intrinsic noise obtained in our fit to experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as a lower bound in the optimization. Multiple experimental studies show that wildtype cells reduce intrinsic noise for improved chemotactic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovdok et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lovdok et al., 2007</xref>), so we inferred that they may be operating near a fundamental lower limit. We also set a lower bound on the total noise level based on experimental measurements in <italic>E. coli</italic> of protein abundance in individual cells over a large range of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>; Materials and methods’). This bound is primarily from irreducible extrinsic noise arising from various mechanisms such as the unavoidability unequal partitioning of proteins during cell division. We set an upper bound on mean protein levels to 5 fold above the wildtype mean in order to be within a range of experimentally established observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Hazelbauer, 2004</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>When we optimized populations for weak trade-off in either foraging or colonization tasks, the resulting populations in both tasks exhibited lower levels of protein noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> for foraging and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> for colonization, blue points) and lower phenotypic variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,F</xref>), in comparison to populations optimized for the respective strong foraging or colonization trade-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B,E,F</xref>, red compared to blue points).

Even though a pure generalist strategy was unattainable, adjustments in the means and correlations between protein abundance enabled the system to shape the ‘residual’ noise to distribute cells along the Pareto front. This could be a general phenomenon in biological systems: given that molecular noise is irreducible, the best solution is to constrain diversity to the Pareto front. Our results suggest this may be achievable via mutations in the regulatory elements of a pathway.</p><p>In the strong foraging trade-off, the optimized population took advantage of the fact that correlated noise in protein levels leads to an inverse relationship between clockwise bias and adaptation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, red) due to the architecture of the network. By capitalizing on this feature, the population contained specialists for near sources, which had higher clockwise bias and shorter adaptation times, and those for far sources, which had lower clockwise bias and longer adaptation time. Cells with clockwise bias above 0.25 were avoided because steep gradients were very short-lived in this challenge.</p><p>The strong colonization trade-off also required high clockwise bias for near sources and low clockwise bias for far sources. However, since the gradient in the site’s vicinity did not flatten, a short adaptation time was always necessary to climb the final part of the gradient and clockwise bias above 0.25 could become advantageous when the source is close. In order to achieve greater diversity in clockwise bias while keeping adaptation time low, the optimized population for this trade-off had increased intrinsic noise, which diversified protein ratios and disrupted the inverse correlation between clockwise bias and adaptation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>, red).</p><p>In all cases, selection on regulatory elements of the network resulted in phenotypic diversity being remarkably constrained to the Pareto front. Furthermore, the levels of diversity in these populations are consistent with the sign of the curvature of the Pareto front they occupy. The adaptability of these distributions predicts that genetic alterations to basic regulatory mechanisms may allow clonal cells to resolve multi-objective problems at the population level using a single signaling network. This mechanism could allow populations to cope with the need to navigate diverse environments, or follow diverse signals, without partitioning into discrete subpopulations through the use of switches or modules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Potential future experiments suggested by the theory</title><p>Our results could be tested using several types of chemotactic performance experiments. The radial symmetry of our environments makes it possible to use the capillary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2011</xref>) and plug assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanfranconi et al., 2003</xref>), which present cells with a concentrated source of attractant. The soft agar swarm plate assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lovdok et al., 2007</xref>) could be used as well if modified to introduce nutrient solution to one spot of the plate instead of the whole. Microfluidic chemotaxis assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalinin et al., 2010</xref>) could be constructed using soft lithography to reproduce these environments with a higher level of precision. In each of these cases, the distance between cells and the source and the duration for which the source is presented could be varied, as well as the source concentration. Cells with high performance should be selected, analyzed for their phenotypes and protein abundance, and re-grown, either under continual presentation of the same condition or switching between two or more conditions.</p><p>Using these types of experiments, our theoretical results predict several specific outcomes. First, seeding the same clonal population in different assays that have different length- or time-scales should select for different optimal subpopulations with different phenotypic parameters and different levels of protein expression. Such measurements would make it experimentally possible to verify the chemotactic trade-offs we predict. Experimental work using the capillary assay already supports this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the case of laboratory evolution with one selection condition, we predict an eventual shift toward genotypes that suppress population noise, as well as toward mutations in chemotaxis protein RBSs that allow the mean clockwise bias and adaptation time to specialize for this task. In this case, we predict that populations will reduce phenotypic diversity but run into a lower limit of protein noise. These outcomes could be measured by performing single cell phenotype analyses and by re-sequencing the operon. Conversely, alternating selection in different assays or different length- and time-scales may lead to enhanced phenotypic noise and still other RBS mutations. In these cases, whole genome re-sequencing may show alterations to the operon structure or to the master regulators of chemotaxis.</p><p>Strains that are evolved in the lab could be compared to the wildtype ancestor in order to gain insight into the types of environments the latter evolved in. Furthermore, investigating phenotypic diversity in wild strains in comparison to domesticated and evolved laboratory strains may uncover differences that reflect the level of environmental diversity faced in their respective lifestyles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The chemotaxis system exhibits significant plasticity in the shape of phenotypic distributions, which can provide fitness advantages in chemotactic trade-offs. Such trade-offs arise from environmental variability because the performance of a chemotactic phenotype is sensitive to the length- and time-scales of the environment it must navigate. This dependency is especially strong when time for navigation is limited. Though at this stage we cannot know what distribution of chemotactic challenges wildtype <italic>E. coli</italic> have faced, we do expect trade-offs to arise from the diversity of time- and length-scales in environmental encounters.</p><p>Our simulations environments were simplified. They omitted many real-world factors for future studies, such as competition between multiple species, turbulence, and viscosity in environments such as soil or animal mucosa. As new data on these interactions emerge, the framework we introduced could be used to investigate trade-offs and resulting phenotypic distributions. Additionally, interactions with more than two environments are likely to occur and could be analyzed in the same way. Such cases will likely impose more constraints on navigation, giving rise to stronger trade-off problems. Increasing the number of phenotypic parameters would not necessarily alleviate these constraints, which would instead be primarily governed by the distance between the optimal phenotypes for these tasks in phenotypic parameter space.</p><p>In our framework, we expanded the traditional genotype–phenotype relationship to consider protein levels separately. While genotype could be broadly defined to include both coding sequences and regulators of noise, separate treatment of protein levels permitted analysis of copy number variability apart from changes in the proteins themselves. This approach could be applied to other signal transduction systems, since variability in the levels of signaling proteins may change behavior as much as changing protein biochemistry.</p><p>In this study, we tuned the distribution of protein levels using numerical parameters, but such changes would in fact occur through mutations. Mean expression levels could change via gene duplication, RBS point mutations, mRNA structures, or altered activity of upstream regulators. Phages and recombination events can reorganize genes, changing intrinsic noise relative to extrinsic noise by altering expression correlation. Regulators of promoters can incur mutations that result in negative feedback repression to reduce promoter noise. Protein localization affects partitioning noise, which is interesting since some chemotaxis proteins assemble into discrete membrane-bound clusters while others do not.</p><p>In the future, it would be interesting to study the extent to which higher expression levels will result in fitness costs, possibly introducing trade-offs. For instance, physiological adaptation via the enzymatic actions of CheR and CheB consumes cellular resources, imposing metabolic costs that depend inversely on the adaptation timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2012</xref>). Different media and growth phases alter the expression levels of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li and Hazelbauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scott et al., 2010</xref>) and will naturally change the distribution of phenotypes as well—this could be a mechanism for separating protein levels required for chemotaxis from those better suited for growth. In this study, challenges and regrowth occurred in discrete sequential steps and there was no direct inheritance of phenotype. The relative importance of these features will depend on the relationship between their time-scales and those of the environmental challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>). If the time-scale of environmental change is much slower than the time-scale of adaptation, for example, populations will adapt to their current environment rather than the statistics of environmental fluctuations.</p><p>A new feature of our conceptual framework is the distinction between performance and fitness. Organisms exhibit many behaviors that, to researchers, are not directly connected to survival and reproduction. These gaps in our understanding inhibit our ability to understand the evolutionary significance of many organismal behaviors. Here, we demonstrated methods for broaching these questions quantitatively, and in so doing uncovered the relevant finding that nonlinearities in selection can strengthen or weaken trade-offs. This will be of general interest to those studying fitness trade-offs since the nature of selection can change the optimality of pure vs mixed population strategies.</p><p>While we have used <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model system due to the wealth of experimental data, the framework developed here could be used to extend these questions to other human commensals and pathogens, with the hope of better understanding their ecology and pathogenesis. The closely related chemotaxis system in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is required for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stecher et al., 2004</xref>), as is the substantially different motility system of <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sze et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> have multiple motility systems to tackle different environments during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole and Kolter, 1998</xref>). Phenotypic diversification within a single system may bridge the gap between one system and many by allowing populations to adapt to greater environmental variation without developing a new biological module. Multicellular organisms also exhibit different motion strategies in their constituent cells, from the singular approach of human sperm to the different motility patterns of neutrophils as they navigate the body to sites of infection and capture invading organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenbach and Lengeler, 2004</xref>). Our framework could be used to investigate several open questions in such systems: How does behavioral diversity of single cells affect the fitness of the organism, and when is the diversification of a single cell type supplanted by the commitment of a new developmental cell lineage?</p><p>From the simplest two-component systems to the most elaborate signal transduction cascades, proteins responsible for sensing environmental signals are usually distinct from those involved in making behavioral decisions. Often, the output of many types of receptor proteins are fed into a much smaller number of signal transduction pathways. While cells can control their sensitivity to different signals by regulating the expression of different receptors, the integration of multiple signals through a central group of proteins will place conflicting demands on those core proteins. Thus, while horizontal integration is beautifully economical and a ubiquitous feature of biological pathways, our study illustrates that it is also likely to introduce trade-offs by design.</p><p>Biology is replete with noise. Although the concept of non-genetic individuality may have been initially coined in reference to <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spudich and Koshland, 1976</xref>), we now know that many other biological systems exhibit substantial non-genetic cell-to-cell variability, including stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang, 2009</xref>), bacterial sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maamar.et al., 2007</xref>), and cancer cell response to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spencer et al., 2009</xref>). Different systems may have different mechanistic drivers that create, constrain, and adapt this variability. In all cases, however, it is conceivable that through genetic changes to drivers of non-genetic diversity, populations of cells may achieve higher collective success in tackling biological trade-off problems. This form of diversity may constitute an evolutionary stepping stone on the path from one to multiple biological modules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Single-cell model of chemotaxis under control of a population-level model of gene expression</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Model outline</title><p>We created a single-cell model of <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis that models the switching of flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equations 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">3</xref>), the activity of chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ5">Equations 4, 5</xref>), and the biochemical actions of the signal transduction and adaptation enzymes (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equations 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">10</xref>).

Experiments carried with mutants, however, show that, when clockwise bias is above about 0.9, the motors spend enough time in the clockwise state that the flagella adopt right-handed helices which can propel the cell forward in a ‘clockwise run’. Consequently cells with extremely high clockwise bias will swim down gradients of attractants because they will perform a clockwise ‘tumble’ when going up and a counterclockwise ‘run’ when going down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 1978</xref>). The reason that this switch in behavior happens at extremely high clockwise bias and not symmetrically at clockwise bias 0.5 is not fully understood, but data shows that the residence times in the clockwise state are much shorter than those in the counterclockwise state throughout most of the range of clockwise bias. As such, the data suggests that clockwise state residence times only become long enough for ‘clockwise running’ when CheY-P is at extremely high concentrations and clockwise bias is essentially 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>). Consideration of cells with CW bias above 0.9 is not relevant for our study because neither in measurements of wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for our fit to that data) nor in our optimized populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) do we see more than 1% of cells with clockwise bias above 0.5. In experiments, cells with clockwise bias above 0.9 are only observed in mutants (e.g. CheB mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>). In wildtype, negative feedback of the kinase CheA on CheB-P implies that even when CheY or CheR are highly over expressed the level of CheY-P is maintained low enough to avoid that deleterious regime of inverted chemotaxis. As a result we can rule out this effect for the current study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Bacterial chemoreceptors</title><p>Bacteria sense changes in their external environment using transmembrane chemoreceptors.

Here, this variation arises solely from variability in protein levels, as these were the sole quantities that were varied between cells within a population. Although this variation exists within the population, the population average CW is constrained within a functional range even when the mean level of proteins is globally upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>)—experimentally this was done by inducing the expression of a master transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollamann et al., 2005</xref>), here we multiplied <bold>P</bold><sub>0</sub> by the appropriate factor. This conservation shows that our model recapitulates and resolves a fundamental unexplained dichotomy in the chemotaxis pathway: population variability around the average is possible in addition to high robustness of the population average. Hence the pathway is sensitive to molecular noise at the single cell level, but robust at the population level.

Adaptation time was scanned in 25 log-spaced steps over the interval [1, 300] s. <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>p,SS</italic></sub> was scanned in 25 log-spaced steps over the interval [1.2, 4] μM with an additional point at 0 μM. <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> was scanned in 10 log-spaced steps over the interval [820, 82000] molecules/cell. For each combination of parameters, 6000–30,000 replicates were simulated; more replicates were used for farther away sources.</p><p>To calculate foraging performance, individual cell replicates accumulated ligand along their trajectories during the simulation. At each time point, <italic>kL</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)<italic>dt</italic> was added to their total, where <italic>k</italic> is the uptake rate in µmol/µM/s, <italic>L</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the concentration of ligand at the current cell position and time, and <italic>dt</italic> is the simulation timestep in seconds. Nutrient accumulation was cut-off after a certain time; for the cases in the main figures, this was 13 min—characterization of the effect other times are described below. For each phenotype, the performance was the average ligand accumulation of all replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>To calculate colonization performance, each cell replicate was first awarded an arrival time in minutes upon its first crossing of <italic>r</italic> = <italic>R</italic>. If it failed to cross in 15 min, its arrival time was infinity. Since we define performance as a quantity to be maximized rather than minimized, the performance of each replicate was defined as the reciprocal of the arrival time in min<sup>−1</sup>; infinite arrival time resulted in zero performance. The replicates of each phenotype were then averaged together to get the performance as a function of phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B)</xref>.</p><p>Replicate cells began at a single point on the spherical shell <italic>r</italic> = <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> is the distance away that the source appears to the cells. Simulations in both tasks were performed for 15 min for several values of <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3AB</xref>). For all subsequent analysis, the heatmaps were smoothed and resampled at higher resolution in phenotype space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Performance was first smoothed over the original cell parameter mesh using a Gaussian kernel. A resampled parameter mesh was created on a 200 × 200 grid within the existing range of cell parameters. The performance values at the new grid points were interpolated from the smoothed performance heatmaps using spline interpolation. The same procedure was used for the fitness landscapes described later, but importantly all fitness calculations were performed on original unsmoothed raw data, then smoothing was applied, so we did not smooth twice.</p><p>To find the specialist in each environments, the top performing phenotype on the high-resolution parameter grid was screened out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>, diamonds). To plot the Pareto front for two environments, we scattered the performance of all values of adaptation time and <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>p,SS</italic></sub> (for a given <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>) on the high-resolution grid to obtain a cloud in chemotactic performance space. We then screened out phenotypes which were <italic>not outperformed</italic> in environment 1 and <italic>not outperformed</italic> in environment 2 to form the Pareto front.</p><p>Changing time limits was explicitly considered in the Results for the colonization case. For foraging, reducing the time limit has little effect on sources that are nearby, but for far sources, it limits the success of high clockwise bias dramatically, exaggerating the trends observed in the far cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In this regime, time is a key parameter since the cells must explore to reach the front of the source before foraging it appreciably. As such, limiting the time has a disproportionate effect on these phenotypes.</p><p>As a result of these disproportionate effects in far environments, trade-offs become stronger when time is restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). For the same four examples of two-environment near–far trade-offs, reducing the time consistently increases the curvature of the Pareto front. When 3 min are given, the transition of trade-offs from weak to strong occurs at a much more similar pair of environments. Therefore, if the environment has frequent turnover events, for example caused by turbulence that equilibrates the gradient, it strengthens trade-offs substantially.</p><p>In the cases shown in the Results section, <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> was 100 mM for foraging and 10 mM for colonization. If <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), the colonization case is relatively unaffected, except that the trend in farther sources become exaggerated because cells have to explore longer before finding a detectable signal. There are more substantial changes to the foraging case. The for farther sources especially, the preferred phenotypes switch to having high clockwise bias. In these cases, exploration reduces the chances of the cells to see ligand because they become too spread; rather, staying in one place and waiting for the diffusing nutrient front to arrive becomes the preferred strategy.</p><p>As we derived in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ20">Equation (20)</xref>, the dynamic range of CheY-P depends on <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, which sets the asymptotic value of CheY-P. In cells with low <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, phosphotransfer is hindered, reducing information transfer from the kinase to the motor and thus deteriorating performance. Cell performance is limited by low <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub>, but once it is high enough to reach the linear regime between kinase activity and CheY-P concentration, additional CheY does not add much benefit since the dynamic range of CheY-P activity will then become limited by the number of kinases.</p><p>We see in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>) that, above about <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> = 10,591 molecules/cell, the performance does not appreciably change because this condition of linearity is met. From this, we conclude that there is no trade-off on <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> apart from the cost of protein synthesis, and that cells should express enough CheY to reach the Pareto front. Beyond that, there is minimal increase in performance. Since the Pareto front represents the outer bound of performance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref> we used <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> = 29,469 mol./cell for all cells; the results do not change significantly if the next higher or lower levels of <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>tot</italic></sub> are used instead.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Calculating fitness from performance</title><p>Fitness was assigned based on performance via a selection function.

If colonization depends on arrival time within a certain time limit <italic>K</italic>, but that dependency <italic>n</italic> is not absolute (i.e. infinite), this could be described by a sigmoidal function like the Hill equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>When <italic>n</italic> is very high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>, red line), the result is very similar to that in the discrete transition model: a neutral trade-off can be converted into strong trade-off when the threshold is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). On the other hand, if the probability of colonization depends less strongly on the arrival time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>, blue line), a weak trade-off may result from the same underlying performance trade-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>For each selection function and for each environment, the approach described above creates a lookup table for fitness as a function of phenotype.

In the case of foraging these are the nutritional requirement <italic>K</italic> and the dependency <italic>n</italic>; for colonization there is only the time limit <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. These we collectively call the trade-off parameters.</p><p>The population gene expression parameters generate a list of individuals with different phenotypes as described above. We can optimize the fitness of the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) by first calculating population fitness <italic>F</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ27">Equation (27)</xref>) for a set of trade-off parameters. We then used MATLAB's pattern search optimization function on the population fitness formula, allowing only the gene expression parameters <bold>P</bold><sub>0</sub>, <italic>η</italic>, and <italic>ω</italic> to vary, but not the trade-off parameters, the biochemical parameters, or any other parameters. The constraints on these parameters are described below, and <italic>h</italic> was 0.8. From this we obtained the optimized population parameters for strong and weak trade-offs (performed separately). For each type of ecological task, the strong and weak trade-offs are between the same pair of near and far environments, with the same form of selection function, but each has a different set of selection function parameters.</p><p>Since there is always some irreducible noise in biology, we used experimental observations to provide lower bounds for the noise parameters in our model. For a limit on the intrinsic component, we took the wildtype level of intrinsic noise, which we obtained by fitting the model to wildtype data (described above). Multiple studies have described the advantage of reduced intrinsic noise in chemotaxis, so we assume wildtype cells are likely to be functioning at or near the minimum intrinsic noise. In order to apply this constraint, we ensure that the intrinsic noise scaling parameter and mean protein levels are constrained within the optimization algorithm such that the condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">P</mml:mtext><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold">P</mml:mtext><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is maintained.</p><p>There is also a lower bound on the minimum total protein noise, defined as the coefficient of variation squared, measured in single <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to be about 0.09 for proteins with a mean expression level of above 100 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>). This constraint in practice acts more on extrinsic noise than on intrinsic noise since in our case the latter is typically fairly low. To enforce this constraint computationally, we ensure that <bold>P</bold><sub>0</sub>, <italic>η</italic>, and <italic>ω</italic> of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ18">Equation (18)</xref> are chosen by the optimization such that the squared coefficient of variation of every protein is above 0.09. This typically has the effect of keeping <italic>ω</italic> above about 0.09, depending on <bold>P</bold><sub>0</sub> and <italic>η</italic>. Increases in global expression levels of up to approximately 3 fold are observed for different strains and growth media[50], and using mutations in <italic>flgM</italic>, increases up to 7 fold are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollmann et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, we set our upper limit of mean expression levels at 5 fold to work within that range.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank P Cluzel, T S Shimizu, P Turner, G Wagner, and S Zucker for valuable discussion on the manuscript.
