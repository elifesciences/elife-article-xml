<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs’ by Sugahara and colleagues, published in <italic>Science</italic> in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Sugahara et al., 2010</xref>). The key experiments being replicated include Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 9A. In Figure 2, Sugahara and colleagues presented data on the tumor penetrance of doxorubicin (DOX) when co-administered with the peptide iRGD, as well as the effect of co-treatment of DOX and iRGD on tumor weight and cell death. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they tracked body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD to provide evidence that iRGD does not increase known DOX toxicity.

This family of small peptides has been widely shown to promote targeting of a variety of therapeutics to tumor blood vessels (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danhier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feron, 2010</xref>). Sugahara and colleagues previously presented data showing that a novel cyclized form of this peptide, iRGD, coupled to a motif that binds to the Neuropilin-1 receptor, helped increase tissue penetrance beyond the vasculature of anti-cancer drugs when it was directly conjugated to those chemotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Sugahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feron, 2010</xref>). In their 2010 study, they showed that iRGD can increase penetrance simply through co-administration with therapies, including peptide-based therapeutics, small molecule drug compounds, and nanoparticle-based therapeutics. This replication attempt will focus on the finding that iRGD co-treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) in orthotopic xenograft prostate tumors increased drug penetrance and accumulation, increased TUNEL staining for apoptotic cells, and decreased tumor volume and weight.</p><p>In Figure 2B, Sugahara and colleagues showed increased tissue permeability of DOX when co-injected with iRGD by demonstrating increased accumulation of DOX in the prostate when intravenously co-injected with iRGD. They documented little change in DOX penetrance in non-prostate tissues of the mouse. This figure is evidence of the first key point for replication: that iRGD increases tissue penetrance of the co-injected drug. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3.</p><p>In Figure 2C, Sugahara and colleagues showed how treatment with varying doses of DOX, with or without iRGD, affected tumor weight. They showed that treatment with 1 mg/kg DOX with iRGD caused a decrease in tumor weight similar to treatment with 3 mg/kg DOX alone. Addition of iRGD to 3 mg/kg DOX further decreased tumor weight. In Supplemental Figure 9A, they also showed that the overall body weight of mice treated with DOX and iRGD did not change as compared to mice treated with DOX alone, indicating that DOX-related weight gain was not exacerbated by the addition of iRGD. These experiments will be replicated in Protocol 4.</p><p>In Figure 2D, Sugahara and colleagues showed that treatment with DOX in combination with iRGD increased the number of TUNEL positive (i.e<italic>.</italic>, apoptotic) tumor cells as compared to DOX alone. They also showed that iRGD did not increase the number of TUNEL positive cells in the heart, indicating that DOX-related cardiotoxicity is not exacerbated by co-treatment with iRGD. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 5.</p><p>To date, the closest direct replication of these experiments has been performed by Akashi and colleagues, who tested the effects of co-administration of iRGD with the drug gemcitabine to target xenograft models of pancreatic cancer. Relative tumor volume in two pancreatic cancer cell line-derived xenografts treated with gemcitabine in combination with iRGD was significantly reduced when compared to tumor volume from xenografts treated with gemcitabine alone. Additionally, Akashi and colleagues assessed compound penetration by co-administering iRDG and the dye Evans Blue. They showed that Evans Blue dye penetrated further into tumor tissue when co-administered with iRGD than alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akashi et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, Gu and colleagues showed that co-administration of iRGD with encapsulated paclitaxel increased nanoparticle extravasation across the blood–brain barrier, and co-administration of paclitaxel nanoparticles and iRGD led to an increase in mean survival of mice carrying intracranial gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Pang and colleagues extended the work done in Sugahara and colleagues' 2010 paper by showing that binding of iRDG through an additional cysteine residue to plasma albumin prolonged the half-life of iRGD and increased tumor penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Pang et al., 2014</xref>). In 2011, Ruoslahti and colleagues extended their findings to show that iRDG was also effective in increasing tumor penetrance of a novel therapeutic consisting of a nanoparticle-encapsulated peptide that homed to tumor vasculature and disrupted mitochondrial membranes, causing cell death; this co-treatment increased the survival of mice bearing glioblastomas as compared to mice treated with the nanoparticle alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agemy et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

The iRGD peptide (H-Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys-Gly-Pro-Asp-Cys-NH2) will be chemically synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl) chemistry sequence. The fully synthesized crude peptide will be cleaved from the resin and cleaned with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The crude peptides will be then diethyl ether precipitated, drained, and washed. The peptides will then be amide blocked on the C terminus and cyclized by a disulfide bridge between C1 and C9. The peptides will be isolated and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fractions of greater than 95% purity will be used for the investigation. The purity and molecular weight of the peptide will be confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight mass spectrometry.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers, one of whom, Erkki Ruoslahti, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers have found the experimental plan and statistical analysis to be reasonable. One particular concern is the number of animals. While they are sufficient for one experiment, ideally one would like to see the experiment to be repeated at least once. The reviewers have suggested the following corrections/improvements to be considered in a revision:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This is a reasonable plan, but a few issues should be dealt with:</p><p>1) It would be appropriate to cite Agemy et al. PNAS 108:17450-17455 (2011) PMCID: PMC3198371 in the Introduction, as it reports iRGD work partially conducted at the Salk Institute.</p><p>2) The peptide sequence in the subsection headed “Protocol 1: Synthesis of iRDG” is incorrect.</p><p>3) The iRGD peptide sequence in the subsection headed “Protocol 1: Synthesis of iRDG” is shown with unblocked N- and C-termini. The original paper is silent on whether they were blocked or not, but in the subject work, Sugahara et al. used iRGD that was amide-blocked at the C-terminus. Although the unblocked peptide is also known to be active, it would be safer to block the C-terminus.</p><p>4) The tumor line Sugahara et al. used is 22Rv1 (ATCC #CRL-2505).

We have amended the manuscript to correctly state the first amino acid as Gly instead of Cys.</p><p><italic>3) The iRGD peptide sequence in the subsection headed “Protocol 1: Synthesis of iRDG” is shown with unblocked N- and C-termini. The original paper is silent on whether they were blocked or not, but in the subject work, Sugahara et al. used iRGD that was amide-blocked at the C-terminus. Although the unblocked peptide is also known to be active, it would be safer to block the C-terminus</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this critical feedback. We have updated the manuscript to include this step in the synthesis of the peptide.</p><p>The lab preparing the iRGD peptide, having read the original paper and others describing iRGD, wanted to know if the iRGD used in Sugahara and colleagues’ 2010 paper was cyclized, specifically with a C1-C9 disulfide bridge. Would the editors be so kind as to pass this question back to the reviewers for their feedback?</p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors were informed that iRGD is a cyclic peptide with a disulfide bond between C1 and C9, and that the linear version of the peptide is inactive.]</p><p><italic>4) The tumor line Sugahara et al. used is 22Rv1 (ATCC #CRL-2505).

Part of this process is to ensure the replication experiments are designed to have a low type I and type II error rate for detecting the originally reported effect size. Additionally, any known difference from the original experiments and replication experiments are detailed and whether any of these might impact the replication. This also includes valuable insight from the authors of the originally reported results. Additionally, all data collected during the experimental procedure will be recorded and made publically available to allow the collective experimental results to be evaluated. This project aims to evaluate the predictors of reproducing a subset of the published literature. Thus, the focus is on a collection of experimental outcomes, and the factors associated with them, and not the conclusions from any given paper, which are based on multiple experiments and models. Additionally, a failure to replicate does not mean the original result was a false positive, just like an ability to replicate the original result does not mean the original interpretation is correct.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Given that the proposed work requires a small number of mice, it may be worthwhile to consider nonparametric analysis methods in addition to the proposed t test and ANOVA approaches during data analyses</italic>.</p><p>We have added language to the Confirmatory Analysis plan section detailing that we will assess the normality of the data before proceeding with the proposed parametric tests, and if the data do not conform to the assumptions for the proposed tests, we will use the appropriate non-parametric tests instead.</p><p><italic>The investigators plan to use mixed effects model ANOVA as an additional exploratory analysis in protocol 3.
