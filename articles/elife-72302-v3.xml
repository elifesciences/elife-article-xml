was reported that Yap1 and Wwtr1 in zebrafish regulates the morphogenesis of the posterior body and epidermal fin fold (Kimelman et al., 2017). We report here that DNA damage induces apoptosis of epidermal basal cells (EBCs) in zebrafish <italic>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos. Specifically, these mutant EBCs exhibit active Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and γH2AX, consistent with DNA damage serving as a stimulus of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in epidermal cells. Live imaging of zebrafish epidermal cells reveals a steady growth of basal cell size in the developing embryo, but this growth is inhibited in mutant basal cells followed by apoptosis, leading to the hypothesis that factors underscoring cell size play a role in this DNA damage-induced apoptosis phenotype. We tested two of these factors using cell stretching and substrate stiffness assays, and found that HaCaT cells cultured on stiff substrates exhibit more numerous γH2AX foci compared to ones cultured on soft substrates. Thus, our experiments suggest that substrate rigidity may modulate genomic stress in epidermal cells, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 promotes their survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippo</kwd><kwd>Yap</kwd><kwd>Taz</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>genomic stress</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2016-T3-1-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Jason KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Toh</surname><given-names>Pearlyn JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Cognart</surname><given-names>Hamizah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in the epidermal basal cells of the developing zebrafish embryo and Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for its survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hippo signaling pathway is widely known for its role in regulating tissue and organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson and Halder, 2014</xref>). More recently, the roles of its downstream effectors, Yap1 and Wwtr1 (or widely referred to as Taz), have been described in a variety of developing tissues. In the developing heart, Wwtr1 participates in cardiomyocyte decision-making to become a trabecular cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, in the cardiovascular system, YAP1 and WWTR1 are important for sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and vascular stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakajima et al., 2017</xref>). Yap1 and Wwtr1 also regulate the retinal epithelium cell fate in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miesfeld et al., 2015</xref>), kidney branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reginensi et al., 2015</xref>), and fibronectin assembly for tail morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimelman et al., 2017</xref>). In this report, we show that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for the survival and growth of epidermal cells during skin development.</p><p>In the zebrafish, the non-neural ectoderm, marked by <italic>ΔNp63</italic>, emerges from the ventral side of the gastrulating embryo, and spreads dorsally to cover the entire embryo as a sheet of cells beneath the periderm during segmentation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Solnica-Krezel, 2005</xref>). Residing in this layer are the epidermal basal cells (EBCs) which are responsible for epidermal cell renewal and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006</xref>). In mice, Yap1 and Wwtr1, acting downstream of integrin signaling, were shown to modulate EBC proliferation during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elbediwy et al., 2016</xref>). However, their role in early epidermal development is poorly characterized.</p><p>In addition to their role in cell proliferation, YAP1 and WWTR1 promote cell survival. When cells are challenged with DNA damaging agents including doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2016</xref>) and radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillermin et al., 2021</xref>), YAP1, as a co-transcription factor of Teads, is localized in the nucleus to drive expression of pro-survival genes. Indeed, transgenic expression of <italic>Yap1</italic> in murine livers upregulates the expression of <italic>Survivin</italic> (<italic>Birc5</italic>) in hepatocytes, protecting these cells from apoptosis when treated with a pro-apoptotic agent, Jo-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, genetic knockdown of <italic>Yap1</italic> or inhibition of YAP1 nuclear localization exaggerates apoptosis in cells exposed to chemo- and radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillermin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, YAP1 executes its pro-survival function in the nucleus by driving the expression of target genes.</p><p>The previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimelman et al., 2017</xref> investigated how Yap1 and Wwtr1 participate in the development of the fin fold by regulating the expression and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the course of this previous investigation, which focused specifically on why <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants had a thinner epidermis in the ventral fin fold, the authors did not observe apoptotic epidermal cells. However, apoptosis in other parts of the embryo was not thoroughly studied, as it was outside the focus of this previous work. Here, we show that concurrent loss of <italic>yap1</italic> and <italic>wwtr1</italic> results in aberrant apoptosis of EBCs on the yolk at the 6–10 ss. However, epidermal cell proliferation is not reduced in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant zebrafish embryos, in contrast to adult <italic>Yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;Wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. At these developmental stages, Yap1 and Wwtr1 are localized in the EBC nuclei to putatively carry out their co-transcriptional function through the Tead-binding domain (TBD) and support epidermal cell survival. This cell death phenotype in mutant embryos is executed through the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, as apoptosis assays reveal activation of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3. Further, we show that γH2AX, a DNA damage marker, is recruited in mutant EBCs. Thus, DNA damage prompted the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill et al., 1999</xref>). Live imaging of epidermal cells found that, leading up to this apoptosis phenotype, mutant basal cell size is inhibited after the 6 ss, unlike their sibling embryo counterparts, which continue to grow. Interestingly, human keratinocytes cultured on stiffer substrates exhibit more γH2AX foci than cells cultured on softer substrates, suggesting that the mechanical environment not only modifies cell size, but also plays a role in genomic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nava et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we use the term ‘stress’ to denote the pressure on genome integrity due to, for example, mechanical or radiative perturbations. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>YAP1</italic> or <italic>WWTR1</italic> in these cells further increases the number of γH2AX foci. Thus, we propose that in response to genomic stress, Yap1 and Wwtr1 have important roles in the survival of EBCs in the course of their development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yap1 and Wwtr1 are localized in the nuclei of EBCs to modulate their survival</title><p>The previous work on <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant zebrafish reported no overt cell death in the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimelman et al., 2017</xref>). Given the important regulatory roles of YAP1 and WWTR1, we hypothesized that cell death may be increased elsewhere during early embryonic development in such embryos. As a first exploration, we focused on the lateral yolk, on which two layers of the epidermis – the periderm and basal epidermis – reside. We performed TUNEL assays on 16–18 ss embryos as by this stage the double mutants are morphologically distinct from their siblings. We found aberrant apoptosis in the <italic>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (henceforth referred simply as ‘mutant’) epidermis on the yolk, but not in the tail as reported before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, whereas WT embryos have regular distribution of P63-positive nuclei (an EBC marker) over the yolk, mutants have a more irregular and sparser pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting apoptosis of mutant EBCs. As we could only detect apoptotic fragments in older mutant embryos, we investigated this phenotype in closer detail by repeating this assay in younger embryos and imaging them with higher magnifications. Normal sibling epidermis exhibit virtually no TUNEL signal. On the other hand, mutant epidermis exhibit P63 and TUNEL co-staining (apoptotic EBCs), as well as punctate TUNEL signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The latter corresponds to apoptotic fragments that made up the bulk of the TUNEL signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and B’</xref>). Therefore, this phenotype suggests that Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for EBC survival.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developing zebrafish <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants show aberrant epidermal basal cell death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum intensity projections of 16–18 ss WT and mutant embryos stained with TUNEL and P63.

Thus, we hypothesized that factors underlying cell size play a role in DNA damage. Exploring this hypothesis in the early embryo is very challenging due to its accessibility for modulating forces. We tested this hypothesis with two experiments: (1) in vivo stretching of head epidermal cells by ventricular inflation and (2) culturing of a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, on increasing stiffness of collagen-coated hydrogels. Though not directly related to EBCs, these experiments allow us to test the link between cell size and DNA damage, and the potential role of the Hippo pathway in regulating this process.</p><p>We stretched epidermal cells in vivo by inflating the zebrafish brain ventricle with mineral oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), based on a previously characterized approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>) As a positive control, we exposed zebrafish embryos to UV for 10 min followed by recovery of 1 hr before fixation.

We used these stiffnesses as they cover a broad range of physiologically relevant conditions, from very soft (0.5 kPa) to very stiff. One set of cells was exposed to UV as a positive control. Interestingly, the number of γH2AX foci detected in HaCaT cell nuclei is higher in cells cultured on stiffer substrates, but this correlation is not linear, with the maximum number of foci occurring in HaCaT cells cultured on 12 kPa hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, we observed a similar trend among cells exposed to UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, in cells cultured on a given substrate stiffness, we detected more γH2AX foci in the UV group than the unexposed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, keratinocytes cultured on stiff substrates appear to have greater genomic stress than cells on soft substrates.</p><p>As YAP1 and WWTR1 are shuttled into the nucleus when cells are cultured on stiffer substrates, we hypothesized that their presence in the nucleus protects HaCaT cells cultured on 25 kPa and glass from genomic stress resulting in fewer γH2AX foci.

In contrast to adult murine epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elbediwy et al., 2016</xref>), the developing zebrafish epidermis does not require Yap1 and Wwtr1 for cell proliferation. Instead, we found mutant epidermal cells to be smaller, exhibit DNA damage, and undergo apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. These observations led us to investigate the relationship between the mechanical environment of epidermal cells and genomic stress.</p><p>Mechanical perturbations of cells were shown to recruit DNA damage factors including γH2AX and ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cognart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Our present results show that both baseline and induced DNA damage can be intensified by culturing cells on stiffer substrates. Specifically, we found more γH2AX foci in human keratinocyte cells seeded on 12 kPa, 25 kPa hydrogels, and glass compared to the ones seeded on 0.5 kPa hydrogels. At the same time, YAP1/WWTR1 are known to shuttle into the nucleus of cells cultured in stiffer substrates. This phenomenon may explain why the number of γH2AX is fewer in cells cultured on 25 kPa hydrogel and glass than cells cultured on 12 kPa hydrogel, if YAP1 and WWTR1 protect the genome from DNA damage. Indeed, depleting them in HaCaT cells and zebrafish epidermal cells results in greater expression of γH2AX. We note that these conclusions are based on results from different experimental systems, and further work will be required to confirm these ideas.</p><p>Yap1 was shown to supply survival signals in cells under genotoxic stress conditions by driving the expression of <italic>Survivin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guillermin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). However, our Western blot assay did not find downregulation of Survivin in zebrafish <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutants (data not shown), presumably as Survivin is also a key player in cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nair et al., 2013</xref>), which is not impeded in mutants. Therefore, we propose that the mechanical environment of the epidermis modifies genomic stress in cells, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 play a role in their survival. However, further work will be required to test this proposal in vivo, by altering the mechanical environment within the embryo.</p><p>The mechanical environment of the developing epidermis changes with increasing production of the ECM. Indeed, greater ECM density is known to increase cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engler et al., 2006</xref>), which could underscore the increasing basal cell size during epidermal development. In the transcriptomic signatures from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimelman et al., 2017</xref>), genes that are downregulated in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> double mutant tailbuds include <italic>lama5</italic>, <italic>col7a1</italic>, <italic>lamb1a</italic>, <italic>lamb4,</italic> and <italic>lamb2</italic>, which encode key components of the skin basal lamina.

Membranes were blocked with 3–5% BSA in 1× TBST (1× TBS, 0.5% Tween-20) for an hour, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed with 1× TBST before incubation with secondary antibody for at least 1 hr. Membranes were washed again with 1× TBST. ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) was added to the membrane and imaged with the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad).</p><p>The primary antibodies used in this assay are: anti-B-actin (A5441, Sigma), 1:1000; anti-γH2AX (GTX127342, Genetex), 1:1000.</p><p>The secondary antibodies used in this assay are: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (31430, Thermo Fisher), 1:10,000; HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (31460, Thermo Fisher), 1:10,000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ventricular oil injections</title><p>The head epidermis was stretched by injecting hydrophobic mineral oil (Bio-Rad; 1632129) into the hindbrain ventricle of 24 hpf zebrafish, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, at 24 hpf the dechorionated embryos were anesthetized in 0.02–0.024% (w/v in E3) tricaine, and vertically mounted in holes punched in a 3% (w/v) agarose plate. This was followed by either stretching the epidermis by injecting 10–12 nL mineral oil in the hindbrain ventricle (stretched) or injecting only 0.1–0.2 nL oil to act as an injury control (sham). All embryos used in a set were obtained from the same clutch and were injected using the same capillary needle, to reduce variation. The test and sham embryos were grown in E3 until fixation an hour later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>HaCaT cell culture</title><p>All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The human immortalized keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, was a gift from CT Lim Lab (MBI, Singapore). The core facility at the Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore regularly performs mycoplasma contamination checks on these cells. All experiments on these cells were performed within 1 year of receiving them. HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium that was supplemented with 100 IU/mL aqueous penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and harvested with TrypLE (1×). TrypLE was deactivated with complete media. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 180× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and then re-suspended in complete media. The cell suspensions were used only when their viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, exceeded 95%. Briefly, 0.1 mL of 0.4% of trypan blue solution was added to 0.1 mL of cell suspension. Cell viability and density were calculated with a hemocytometer.</p><p>HaCaT cells were then seeded on 0.5, 12, and 25 kPa collagen-coated Softslips (Matrigen, Brea, CA), as well as glass coverslips in individual wells of a 24-well plate. 50,000 cells were seeded on each substrate. Seeded cells were incubated for 10 hr or overnight for cells to completely attach to the substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>HaCaT cell immunofluorescence assay</title><p>HaCaT cells were fixed with 4% PFA in 1× PBS for 15 min. After washing off residual PFA with 1× TBSX (1× TBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100), samples were incubated with blocking solution (4% BSA in 1× TBSX) for 1 hr. Samples were then incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. After washing off the primary antibody solution with 1× TBSX, samples were incubated in secondary antibodies and counterstains diluted in blocking solution for 2 hr, followed by washes with 1× TBSX. Hydrogel-coated coverslips (Softslips) were inverted unto a coverslip for imaging according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>γH2AX foci quantification in HaCaT cells</title><p>Nuclei of HaCaT cells were marked as regions of interest for counting the number of γH2AX foci. Background signal was subtracted using a rolling radius of 5 pixels. A focus is at least 5 pixels in area size, and the number of foci was counted for each nucleus. To test the increase of γH2AX foci in the UV-treated group, one-sided t-tests were performed between UV and control groups for each substrate stiffness. To test the change of the number of γH2AX foci by different substrate stiffness, control HaCaT cells cultured on 0.5 kPa hydrogels were used as the reference in two-sided t-tests. p-Values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing with the Tukey method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>UV exposure</title><p>Twenty-four hpf zebrafish embryos or HaCaT cells were exposed to UV in the Biosafety Cabinet. UV dose for zebrafish experiment was 63.2 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, while UV dose for HaCaT cells was 30.6 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. After UV exposure, samples were allowed to recover for an hour (zebrafish in a 29.0°C incubator; HaCaT cells in 37.0°C humidified incubator).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Paired t-test analysis was performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.estimationstats.com/#/">estimationstats.com</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All zebrafish husbandry was performed under standard conditions in accordance with institutional (Biological Resource Center, A*Star, Singapore, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, India) and national ethical and animal welfare guidelines (Singapore IACUC: 181,323 and GMAC: Res-21–034).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Barry Thompson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. While the reviewers think that manuscript is interesting and has the potential to make an important contribution to the literature, they also pointed out several issues and clarifications that were necessary. The major points are summarized in Essential Revisions below but we have also included the full reviews to help you better understand the issues raised.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The most important point seems that there is a lack of direct evidence that the cell size/cell stretching phenotype and the apoptosis phenotype are due to mechanical stress. There needs to be better evidence to support this.</p><p>Is it known whether different regions of the epidermis experience different levels of mechanical stress? If so, there could be significant differences in mechanical stress among different regions of the epidermis.</p><p>The authors need to consider cell area, which they measure, versus cell volume.</p><p>How dependent is periderm growth on proliferation of the EBCs at this stage of zebrafish development? The authors should comment this point.</p><p>There was some confusion from the reviewers because you mention in the abstract previous work on the ventral fin while that region was not examined in this study. This is an example of where the broader audience would benefit from some further details/text changes</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Yap1 and Wwtr1 are important, partially redundant proteins involved regulation of organ size and have been extensively studied. Yap1 and Wwtr1 are known to prevent apoptosis. In the adult mouse epidermis, Yap1/Wwtr1 regulate cell proliferation during wound healing. The role of Yap1/Wwtr1 in epidermis development is unknown and the topic of this study.</p><p>The manuscript by Lai et al., focuses on the role of Yap1/Wwtr1 in the development of the zebrafish epidermis. The authors present convincing data that epidermal basal cells (EBCs) exhibit reduced cellular growth and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in Yap1/Wwtr1 double mutant zebrafish embryos. The major weakness of the study is the underlying mechanisms of these phenotypes is not clearly established.</p><p>The data presented in the first five figures is convincing. Yap1/Wwtr1 are necessary for the increase in cell size of EBCs and prevent apoptosis of these cells in the post-gastrulation zebrafish embryo. The authors hypothesize that increasing mechanical stress on the Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBC cells causes the apoptosis.</p><p>In figure six, the authors try a nice in vivo experiment in which they increase mechanical stress in the head of the developing zebrafish embryo by injecting a bolus of mineral oil into the brain. However, this manipulation did not result in the expected increase in apoptosis. It is presumed that this experiment was performed in wild-type embryos as the authors do not specify the genotype. It is not clear why the authors did not try this experiment in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant embryos as they should be more sensitive to this manipulation according to the author's model.</p><p>In the latter part of figure 6, the authors plate human keratinocyte cells on substrates of different stiffnesses. Here, they observe an increase in DNA damage on cells plated on substrates with a stiffness {greater than or equal to}12.0 kPa. These keratinocytes are also prone to DNA damage via UV irradiation, but it doesn't appear that plating cells on stiffer substrates make them more sensitive to UV induced DNA damage. The relevance of these keratinocyte experiments to understanding the phenotype of Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants is not entirely clear.</p><p>The major weakness of the study is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the cell growth and apoptosis phenotypes. In the discussion, the authors hypothesize that the defect in cell growth is due to a reduction in the density of the ECM. This is based on the observations that ECM density has been shown to increase cell size in other contexts and the fact that the expression of a number of ECM proteins is reduced in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants. This hypothesis is easily testable via genetic mosaics as one would expect this phenotype to be cell non-autonomous. Wild-type EBCs in Yap1/Wwtr1 hosts should also exhibit a reduction in cellular growth. Conversely, Yap1/Wwtr1 EBCs in a wild-type host should exhibit restored cell growth.</p><p>The authors suggest that the increase in the ECM and the corresponding increase in the mechanical stiffness of the embryonic environment causes Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBCs to apoptose. In this interpretation, which seems to contradict the first hypothesis, Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants do not produce enough ECM for EBCs to reach their normal size, but Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants do produce enough ECM-dependent stiffness to induce EBC apoptosis. The suggested genetic mosaics experiments could also provide evidence for the author's explanation of the apoptosis phenotype. Might one expect an even higher rate of apoptosis of Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBCs when they are developing in a more mechanically robust wild-type host?</p><p>One issue with the text is ambiguity about what the authors mean by &quot;stress&quot;. As in physics, this could mean force per unit area. Alternatively, it could refer to a challenging physiological condition as the term is frequently used in biology. Since this study involves mechanobiology, the authors would need to clearly define what they mean by stress. This ambiguity makes it difficult to always discern the meaning of the text, and it appears that the different meanings are conflated in the text.</p><p>Relatedly, it is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;genomic stress&quot;. Is the genome under greater mechanical stress in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants? It would also be helpful to state how the authors think increased substrate stiffness increases genomic stress. Is this relationship purely mechanical or is cell signaling and gene expression involved? What is currently known about the link between the mechanical environment and genomic stress?</p><p>The study is interesting and rigorously performed. However, the authors need to better substantiate their conclusions to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Specifically, the authors need to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cell growth and apoptosis phenotypes. The beforementioned mineral oil injections into Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants could provide useful data. However, the genetic mosaic experiments could really be clarifying, and these are standard experiments in zebrafish.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Lai et al. submit a manuscript investigating the role for Wwtr1/Taz and Yap1 in morphogenesis of the posterior body and epidermal fin fold. Through Zebrafish double mutant embryos, the authors present data suggesting that Wwtr1 and Yap1 cooperate to protect epidermal basal cells from DNA damage during morphogenesis, confirming previously published studies. Not only are both Wwrt1 and Yap1 localised to EBC nuclei, but these cells undergo Tp53 independent apoptosis driven by DNA damage. Recruitment of DNA damage marker γH2AX in mutant embryos is also associated with reduced cell size. Using an in vivo ventricular inflation assay and in vitro cell stretching, the authors suggest that increased tissue stiffness may cause DNA damage that is protected against by Wwrt1 and Yap1.</p><p>The submitted manuscript aims to investigate Wwrt1 and Yap1 in epidermal morphogenesis and presents data suggesting a surprisingly strong need for both proteins to protect Epidermal Basal Cell DNA during somitogenesis. While the authors confirm no proliferation defect in mutant embryos, proliferation is assayed early in the mutant pathology and may not represent the cell dynamics present in later stages where the authors also find EBCs to be smaller. A conflict arises between these data as increased cell death and no significant increase in proliferation might lead to epithelial rupture.

While YAP/TAZ proteins are known to protect cells from apoptosis in many different animal species, the authors identify a novel and specific requirement for YAP/TAZ in preventing apoptosis caused by mechanical forces that flatten the cell nucleus and lead to DNA damage (an inducer of apoptosis). Double yap1, taz/wwtr1 knockout zebrafish embryos reveal an essential function of YAP/TAZ in maintaining cell survival in the basal layer cells of the epidermis, cells that experience significant mechanical stretch during embryonic morphogenesis. It is proposed that mechanical stress/strain in the epidermis leads to genomic stress, which then requires nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ to ensure cell survival. In addition, YAP/TAZ are shown to promote elastic expansion and flattening of epidermal cells in response to stretch. The findings are an important addition to previous work in mice, where YAP/TAZ have a mainly pro-proliferative role in basal layer skin epidermal cells during development. Thus, in different contexts, mechanical stress/strain can induce nuclear YAP/TAZ to drive either increased cell proliferation (as in mouse skin), or cell expansion/flattening and survival (as in fish embryonic skin), to govern how the tissue responds to the mechanical stimulus.</p><p>The conclusions are clearly supported by the results.</p><p>The major strengths are the quality of the zebrafish genetics and phenotypic analysis, as well as the novel insights produced, particularly that the response of zebrafish skin to mechanical stretch is different to that of mouse skin, yet still governed by YAP/TAZ. That mechanical stress leads to genome stress is also a novel finding, and the role of YAP/TAZ in ensuring cell survival in this particular context is also a novel function for these proteins.</p><p>These findings will be of major significance to both developmental biology and cancer.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;DNA-damage induced cell death in <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> mutant epidermal basal cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The major deficiency of the original submission of this manuscript was a lack of direct evidence that the cell size/cell stretching phenotype and the apoptosis phenotype in yap1/wwtr1 double mutant zebrafish are due to mechanical stress. The authors have addressed this issue not with new data, but by making their conclusions more circumspect. The problem is that the bold conclusions that made the study more broadly interesting are not adequately supported by the data. For example, the impact statement for the manuscript, &quot;Substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in the epidermal basal cells of the developing zebrafish embryo and Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for its survival&quot; is not clearly demonstrated by the data in the manuscript. Thus, the study in its current form is of less general interest and may be better suited for a different journal.</p><p>2. The author's response is that further experiments are not really feasible. However, this is not entirely true. Genetic mosaic experiments are routine in zebrafish. It is true that transplantation of yap1/wwtr1 double mutant cells into wild-type embryos is challenging because only 1/16 donor embryos will be double mutant, and one doesn't know the genotype of the embryos at the time of transplantation. There are ways to perform the experiment by allowing the donor embryos to develop along with the associated mosaic embryos created by the transplantation. The double mutants could be identified as the phenotype becomes apparent and the associated mosaic embryos could be characterized in detail. Thus, this experiment is difficult, but not impossible.</p><p>3. The converse experiment of transplanting wild-type cells into the double mutants is quite doable. Such an experiment could be done to test whether the reduction in ECM production in the yap1/wwtr1 double mutants is responsible for the reduction in size of epidermal cells. Transplants into 200 blastula stage embryos is easily doable in a single day and the phenotypes of the host yap1/wwtr1double mutant embryos will be evident as the embryos develop. Given the size of the epidermal cell population, virtually every yap1/wwtr1 double mutant would have some wild-type cells in their epidermis. Thus, more than 10 such mosaics embryos could be created in a day and there would be ample control embryos.</p><p>4. In the one new experiment presented in the revision (Figure 7), it is not clear why knockdown of yap or taz causes an increase in DNA damage foci, but knockdown of yap/taz together does not increase DNA damage. No explanation is provided for this discrepancy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72302.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The most important point seems that there is a lack of direct evidence that the cell size/cell stretching phenotype and the apoptosis phenotype are due to mechanical stress.

The latter experiments were generally supportive of our conclusions, but obviously they represent a different system. Therefore, as suggested by the Reviewers, we have toned down the confidence in a number of our conclusions.</p><p>Another related idea was to perform transplantation experiments. This is a very powerful approach that has been successfully used in zebrafish. However, in our case, we are analysing a double mutant with 1/16 success rate. Given the trickiness of the transplantation experiment and the low number of successes, this experiment was not feasible given our current time constraints. We have toned down the appropriate conclusions related to this part, reflecting the uncertainty that remains. However, we hope that the Reviewers understand the technical challenges. We emphasise that the significant majority of results presented have not been questioned.

Yap1 and Wwtr1 are known to prevent apoptosis. In the adult mouse epidermis, Yap1/Wwtr1 regulate cell proliferation during wound healing. The role of Yap1/Wwtr1 in epidermis development is unknown and the topic of this study.</p><p>The manuscript by Lai et al., focuses on the role of Yap1/Wwtr1 in the development of the zebrafish epidermis. The authors present convincing data that epidermal basal cells (EBCs) exhibit reduced cellular growth and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in Yap1/Wwtr1 double mutant zebrafish embryos. The major weakness of the study is the underlying mechanisms of these phenotypes is not clearly established.</p><p>The data presented in the first five figures is convincing. Yap1/Wwtr1 are necessary for the increase in cell size of EBCs and prevent apoptosis of these cells in the post-gastrulation zebrafish embryo. The authors hypothesize that increasing mechanical stress on the Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBC cells causes the apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the Reviewer finds the significant majority of our conclusions to be well supported by the presented findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure six, the authors try a nice in vivo experiment in which they increase mechanical stress in the head of the developing zebrafish embryo by injecting a bolus of mineral oil into the brain. However, this manipulation did not result in the expected increase in apoptosis. It is presumed that this experiment was performed in wild-type embryos as the authors do not specify the genotype. It is not clear why the authors did not try this experiment in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant embryos as they should be more sensitive to this manipulation according to the author's model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggested experiment. Unfortunately, the technique has been developed and tested for embryos after 20 hpf, which is beyond the viability of the double mutants. In addition, when the experimental results carried out on WT embryos proved negative, we did not pursue it further as Singapore and India were under strict border controls due to the Δ SARS-COV2 variant – the fish were in Singapore, while the technique was performed in India. We have toned down our conclusions on this experiment to reflect the remaining uncertainty in our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the latter part of figure 6, the authors plate human keratinocyte cells on substrates of different stiffnesses. Here, they observe an increase in DNA damage on cells plated on substrates with a stiffness {greater than or equal to}12.0 kPa. These keratinocytes are also prone to DNA damage via UV irradiation, but it doesn't appear that plating cells on stiffer substrates make them more sensitive to UV induced DNA damage. The relevance of these keratinocyte experiments to understanding the phenotype of Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants is not entirely clear.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, a challenge we faced was performing robust and reproducible mechanical manipulations in vivo. The use of keratinocytes was to have a cleaner system to explore the role of stiffness in the genomic stability – but obviously at the cost of removing from the in vivo system.</p><p>We have included an additional part to the discussion (lines 215-224) that outlines the link between the experiments. We also include an appropriate caveat highlighting the limitation of our approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major weakness of the study is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the cell growth and apoptosis phenotypes. In the discussion, the authors hypothesize that the defect in cell growth is due to a reduction in the density of the ECM. This is based on the observations that ECM density has been shown to increase cell size in other contexts and the fact that the expression of a number of ECM proteins is reduced in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants. This hypothesis is easily testable via genetic mosaics as one would expect this phenotype to be cell non-autonomous. Wild-type EBCs in Yap1/Wwtr1 hosts should also exhibit a reduction in cellular growth. Conversely, Yap1/Wwtr1 EBCs in a wild-type host should exhibit restored cell growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting this point, but unfortunately this experiment is extremely challenging. We discuss this point above at the beginning of the letter. We now include a caveat regarding this in the Discussion, to make clear where future work can progress (lines 231-232).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the increase in the ECM and the corresponding increase in the mechanical stiffness of the embryonic environment causes Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBCs to apoptose. In this interpretation, which seems to contradict the first hypothesis, Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants do not produce enough ECM for EBCs to reach their normal size, but Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants do produce enough ECM-dependent stiffness to induce EBC apoptosis. The suggested genetic mosaics experiments could also provide evidence for the author's explanation of the apoptosis phenotype. Might one expect an even higher rate of apoptosis of Yap1/Wwtr1 mutant EBCs when they are developing in a more mechanically robust wild-type host?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that there is tension in the results from our experiments. It appears that Yap1/Wwtr1 has two important functions here: (1) Drive expression of ECM genes; and (2) promote survival under genomic stress. These processes are intertwined with the hypothesis that under increased mechanical stiffness cells experience genomic stress. The suggested experiment of performing a mosaic experiment should disentangle and address this hypothesis.</p><p>As outlined above, unfortunately such a mosaic experiment is very challenging to perform, both due to the early developmental stage and the very low probability of gaining cells of correct genotype. Even if the embryo transplantation experiment worked, it’s likely that the results would be confusing as the readouts may be unclear. For example, our key readout is apoptosis of mutant cells which, if the hypothesis is true, becomes absent during sample collection and imaging. This readout means that either transplantation for that embryo was suboptimal, or that we are only observing after the fact that the apoptosed cells have been cleared away.</p><p>This is why we decided to robustly test this hypothesis using human-derived keratinocytes, namely the HaCaT cell line. Obviously, we lose the advantage of the in vivo system. However, we have far greater control on the perturbations, making readout clearer. We found that indeed, both depletion of Yap1/Wwtr1 and increasing mechanical stiffness could induce recruitment of γH2AX. We have introduced suitable caveats within the manuscript to make these points clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One issue with the text is ambiguity about what the authors mean by &quot;stress&quot;. As in physics, this could mean force per unit area. Alternatively, it could refer to a challenging physiological condition as the term is frequently used in biology. Since this study involves mechanobiology, the authors would need to clearly define what they mean by stress. This ambiguity makes it difficult to always discern the meaning of the text, and it appears that the different meanings are conflated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting this issue – we agree that this term is often used ambiguously. We have tried to clarify our terminology in the manuscript. We have endeavoured to make sure that when referring to the sense with regards to challenging physiological conditions, we always use “genomic stress”. Further, to avoid confusion, we do not use the word “stress” explicitly in the manuscript to refer to the physics meaning of force/area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, it is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;genomic stress&quot;. Is the genome under greater mechanical stress in Yap1/Wwtr1 mutants? It would also be helpful to state how the authors think increased substrate stiffness increases genomic stress. Is this relationship purely mechanical or is cell signaling and gene expression involved? What is currently known about the link between the mechanical environment and genomic stress?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of the link between mechanical environment and genomic stress is a topic of significant interest. Recent work from the Wickström lab (Nava <italic>et al.</italic> Cell 2020) has revealed that nuclear softening can protect the genome from mechanical perturbations in epithelial tissues. This stands in contrast to experiments on cancer lines, that reveal DNA damage under mechanical stress (Denais <italic>et al.</italic> Science 2016, Raab <italic>et al.</italic> Science 2016). We include these references when introducing the concept of genomic stress (line 76), which helps to clarify the comparison of genomic with mechanical stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study is interesting and rigorously performed.

However, the genetic mosaic experiments could really be clarifying, and these are standard experiments in zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, the mosaic experiments are especially challenging in this case and the expected readouts (<italic>i.e.</italic> apoptosis of mutant cells) may not necessarily address the hypothesis at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):Lai et al. submit a manuscript investigating the role for Wwtr1/Taz and Yap1 in morphogenesis of the posterior body and epidermal fin fold.

While YAP/TAZ proteins are known to protect cells from apoptosis in many different animal species, the authors identify a novel and specific requirement for YAP/TAZ in preventing apoptosis caused by mechanical forces that flatten the cell nucleus and lead to DNA damage (an inducer of apoptosis). Double yap1, taz/wwtr1 knockout zebrafish embryos reveal an essential function of YAP/TAZ in maintaining cell survival in the basal layer cells of the epidermis, cells that experience significant mechanical stretch during embryonic morphogenesis. It is proposed that mechanical stress/strain in the epidermis leads to genomic stress, which then requires nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ to ensure cell survival. In addition, YAP/TAZ are shown to promote elastic expansion and flattening of epidermal cells in response to stretch. The findings are an important addition to previous work in mice, where YAP/TAZ have a mainly pro-proliferative role in basal layer skin epidermal cells during development. Thus, in different contexts, mechanical stress/strain can induce nuclear YAP/TAZ to drive either increased cell proliferation (as in mouse skin), or cell expansion/flattening and survival (as in fish embryonic skin), to govern how the tissue responds to the mechanical stimulus.</p><p>The conclusions are clearly supported by the results.</p><p>The major strengths are the quality of the zebrafish genetics and phenotypic analysis, as well as the novel insights produced, particularly that the response of zebrafish skin to mechanical stretch is different to that of mouse skin, yet still governed by YAP/TAZ. That mechanical stress leads to genome stress is also a novel finding, and the role of YAP/TAZ in ensuring cell survival in this particular context is also a novel function for these proteins.</p><p>These findings will be of major significance to both developmental biology and cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their overall positive review of our manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The major deficiency of the original submission of this manuscript was a lack of direct evidence that the cell size/cell stretching phenotype and the apoptosis phenotype in yap1/wwtr1 double mutant zebrafish are due to mechanical stress. The authors have addressed this issue not with new data, but by making their conclusions more circumspect. The problem is that the bold conclusions that made the study more broadly interesting are not adequately supported by the data. For example, the impact statement for the manuscript, &quot;Substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in the epidermal basal cells of the developing zebrafish embryo and Yap1 and Wwtr1 are required for its survival&quot; is not clearly demonstrated by the data in the manuscript. Thus, the study in its current form is of less general interest and may be better suited for a different journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this feedback. We have revised the concluding statements to capture the results of the experiments presented.</p><p>“Thus, our experiments suggest that substrate rigidity modulates genomic stress in epidermal cells, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 promotes their survival.”</p><p>As support for the relationship between substrate rigidity and genomic stress is limited to culturing HaCaT cells on different substrate rigidity, we have corrected the first part of the conclusion by not alluding this relationship to the developing epidermis, which should rightly be tested with mosaic experiments as suggested below.</p><p>The second part of the conclusion reflects the observed phenotype of the double <italic>yap1;wwtr1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Along with the above changes, a concern is raised about the generality of our results. Our findings that Yap1/Wwtr1 play an important role in cell survival in cells under mechanical stress is a very important one. It has clear potential impact, from developmental biology to cancer research.</p><p>Therefore, even though our conclusions are toned down, they will still be of broad interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The author's response is that further experiments are not really feasible. However, this is not entirely true. Genetic mosaic experiments are routine in zebrafish. It is true that transplantation of yap1/wwtr1 double mutant cells into wild-type embryos is challenging because only 1/16 donor embryos will be double mutant, and one doesn't know the genotype of the embryos at the time of transplantation. There are ways to perform the experiment by allowing the donor embryos to develop along with the associated mosaic embryos created by the transplantation. The double mutants could be identified as the phenotype becomes apparent and the associated mosaic embryos could be characterized in detail. Thus, this experiment is difficult, but not impossible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment is difficult, but not impossible. However, we face two hurdles at the moment.</p><p>First, despite a number of trials, the relevant fish in our system are not spawning well. We likely need to out-cross the fish to return them to laying well, which will take &gt; 3 months.</p><p>A further issue here is that while this experiment is doable in a technical sense, it requires significant hands-on work from dedicated and trained lab personnel. Due to Covid, much of the work on this project has been significantly delayed and key lab personnel have subsequently moved onto new positions. Therefore, getting the expertise together is a major challenge at present.</p><p>Given the above issues, it is not possible to do the requested experiments within a reasonable timescale. We have therefore toned down our conclusion on this part (see [1]). Despite this, we stress that the manuscript still has numerous strong experiments that provide support for our key conclusions regarding Yap/Wwtr1 and cell survival under mechanical stress. Hence, we hope that the reviewers can accept the manuscript in this current version given the constraints we face.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The converse experiment of transplanting wild-type cells into the double mutants is quite doable. Such an experiment could be done to test whether the reduction in ECM production in the yap1/wwtr1 double mutants is responsible for the reduction in size of epidermal cells. Transplants into 200 blastula stage embryos is easily doable in a single day and the phenotypes of the host yap1/wwtr1double mutant embryos will be evident as the embryos develop. Given the size of the epidermal cell population, virtually every yap1/wwtr1 double mutant would have some wild-type cells in their epidermis. Thus, more than 10 such mosaics embryos could be created in a day and there would be ample control embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is facing similar challenges to point [2] above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the one new experiment presented in the revision (Figure 7), it is not clear why knockdown of yap or taz causes an increase in DNA damage foci, but knockdown of yap/taz together does not increase DNA damage. No explanation is provided for this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission. We have added this explanation in lines 197-204, reproduced here:</p><p>“We found that double knockdown of <italic>YAP1</italic> and <italic>WWTR1</italic> did not deplete their protein expression, unlike the single <italic>YAP1</italic> or <italic>WWTR1</italic> knockdowns (Figure 7A). Accordingly, the depletion of YAP1 or WWTR1 resulted in greater expression of γH2AX by Western Blot (Figure 7A), and more γH2AX foci (Figure 7B). However, we could not test the redundancy of YAP1 and WWTR1 as the double knockdown was incomplete, which may explain the unchanged γH2AX levels in the double knockdown compared to control. This observation suggests a role for YAP1/WWTR1 in protecting the genome from DNA damage.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
