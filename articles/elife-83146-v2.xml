examined utilizing a high-resolution multiphoton-based imaging platform in conjunction with advanced optical techniques that allow interrogation of the oxygen microenvironment and cellular energy metabolism in living animals. Our study demonstrates the dynamic changes of vessel types, that is, arterial, venous, and capillary vessel networks at the superior and dura periosteum of cranial bone defect, suggesting a differential coupling of the vessel type with osteoblast expansion and bone tissue deposition/remodeling during repair. Employing transgenic reporter mouse models that label distinct types of vessels at the site of repair, we further show that oxygen distributions in capillary vessels at the healing site are heterogeneous as well as time- and location-dependent. The endothelial cells coupling to osteoblasts prefer glycolysis and are less sensitive to microenvironmental oxygen changes than osteoblasts. In comparison, osteoblasts utilize relatively more OxPhos and potentially consume more oxygen at the site of repair. Taken together, our study highlights the dynamics and functional significance of blood vessel types at the site of defect repair, opening up opportunities for further delineating the oxygen and metabolic microenvironment at the interface of bone tissue regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone repair</kwd><kwd>intravital imaging</kwd><kwd>blood vessel

requires coordinated and concerted activities from both osteogenic and angiogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hankenson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ai-Aql et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Olsen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schott et al., 2021</xref>). While the interdependent role of osteogenesis and angiogenesis is well documented, the cellular and molecular events that take place at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface of bone defect repair remain superficially understood. A functional blood vessel network consists of arteries, veins, and a capillary interface that connect arterial and venous vessels for proper vascular perfusion. Following injury, blood vessels are severed, and angiogenesis commences in response to a low state of oxygen, that is, hypoxia. Localized hypoxia stimulates endothelial cells (ECs) to undergo a series of changes including sprouting of the tip cells, proliferation of the stalk cells, and expansion of the continuous lumen, ultimately forming a functional capillary network to restore nutrients and oxygen supply to the site of the defect. This process occurs concurrently with migration, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblasts and their progenitor cells at the site of repair. How functional blood vessel networks are re-built and remodeled in response to injury to support the proliferation and differentiation of bone forming cells at an early stage of healing and a late stage of bone tissue remodeling remain poorly understood.</p><p>Skeletal vasculature has been shown to be uniquely patterned to adapt to the need and functionality of bone tissues at different anatomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watson and Adams, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sivaraj and Adams, 2016</xref>). Recent studies have further shown that bone forming progenitors and osteoblasts are associated with a specialized subset of ECs that expresses high levels of endothelial markers CD31 and endomucin. Type H (CD31<sup>high</sup>Emcn<sup>high</sup>) and type E (CD31<sup>high</sup>Emcn<sup>low</sup>) vessels, as opposed to type L (CD31<sup>low</sup>Emcn<sup>high</sup>) vessels, are shown coupling to OSX<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts at the long bone metaphysis and Gli1<sup>+</sup> bone progenitor cells at the cranial bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kusumbe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramasamy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rindone et al., 2021</xref>). Both type E and type H vessels are derived from <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels that directly connect to arterioles, exhibiting high flow rate and are further regulated by molecular pathways that control EC specification during development, that is, hypoxia inducible factor, BMP, and Notch pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sivaraj and Adams, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). In view of this recent development, understanding bone-dependent vessel formation and patterning and delineating specific bone progenitor cell interaction with the vascular microenvironment are critically important for developing successful strategies aimed at modulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis at the bone healing interface for enhanced repair and regeneration.</p><p>Mapping functional vessel networks in bone has been a persistent challenge due to heavy mineralization of the bone tissue, compounded by the technical difficulty in imaging functional vasculature deep inside tissues. We have previously demonstrated an imaging platform for high-resolution analyses of cranial bone tissue vascularization via multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schilling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang, 2018</xref>). Compared with confocal microscopy which utilizes a pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus fluorescence, MPLSM fluorescence excitation is intrinsically confined to a very small focal volume, permitting detection of a great deal of scattered fluorescence light. Since multiphoton excitation utilizes a longer wavelength laser to excite fluorescent molecules, penetration of the laser beam into the tissues is also considerably deeper, with further benefits of reduced photobleaching and photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoover and Squier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niesner and Hauser, 2011</xref>). In addition to imaging fluorescence excitation, MPLSM can also be used for imaging collagen matrix and bone tissue through second harmonic generation (SHG), making it a powerful imaging platform for visualization and analysis of vascularization in bone tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pendleton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vielreicher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaudhary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ranjit et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A series of two-photon or multiphoton-based non-invasive optical techniques have been developed that permit interrogation of physiological, functional, and molecular properties of blood vessels at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Combining phosphorescence quenching with two-photon laser scanning microscopy, an optical technique known as two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2P-PLIM) has been established. Equipped with two photon excitable oxygen probes, namely platinum porphyrin coumarin-343 (PtP-C343), this technique enables high spatial resolution measurements of partial oxygen tension (pO<sub>2</sub>) in living tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finikova et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>). Another non-invasive technique developed to obtain information on cell metabolism and to differentiate different metabolic states of cells and tissues is the fluorescence lifetime-dependent measurements of free and bound NAD(P)H via two-photon microscopy (2P-FLIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chance, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayevsky and Chance, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winkler and Hirrlinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringari et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stringari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wright et al., 2012</xref>). This method exploits the intrinsic autofluorescence lifetimes of free and bound NAD(P)H, which reflect the metabolic state of single cells within the native microenvironment of the living tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stringari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stringari et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stringari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stringari et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yaseen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolenc and Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datta et al., 2020</xref>). By analyzing the lifetime contributions of enzyme-bound and non-bound fluorescent species, one can infer cellular energy metabolism of a specific cell population in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chacko and Eliceiri, 2019</xref>), ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Skala et al., 2007</xref>), as well as in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schilling et al., 2022</xref>). These techniques have provided unprecedented opportunities for elucidating the molecular and cellular events, as well as the microenvironmental factors at the biological interfaces of bone tissue repair and regeneration.</p><p>The overall goal of our current study was to utilize a series of advanced optical imaging techniques in conjunction with transgenic animals that label subtypes of ECs to define dynamic changes of vessel specification and function at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface during cranial bone defect repair. Our study was motivated by the clinical need to develop effective therapeutics, as well as the importance of addressing a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the functional vascular bed in bone regeneration. Through high-resolution imaging of the osteogenic and angiogenic interface at the defect site via multiphoton-based microscopy, we highlight the functional significance of the blood vessel types in bone repair, offering new insights into bone tissue vascularization and bone healing microenvironment at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface of bone defect repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD31 and EMCN define different types of vessels that displayed distinct dynamics in response to injury at the regenerative interface</title><p>Using high-resolution MPLSM, which allows for simultaneous imaging of bone via SHG, donor osteoblasts via Col1a1-GFP, and blood vessels via immunostaining of CD31 and EMCN in the repair tissues, we examined the spatiotemporal specification of the vessel network during the healing of a 1-mm cranial full-thickness defect created in Col1a1-GFP mice over a period of 21 days. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), CD31 and EMCN marked two distinct types of vessels at the site of cranial defect: CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> (merging red and green channel to show as yellowish green or yellow) and CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> (red only with absence of EMCN staining). A relatively stronger staining of CD31 and EMCN in double positive vessels was observed at the site of active bone repair as compared to the regions of un-injured bone. To gain a better understanding of the vascularization process during repair, all samples harvested at the indicated time points were examined via MPLSM from both superior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and dura side of the cranial bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As shown, vessel organization and response at the superior and dura side of cranial bone were distinct. From the superior side, where the top 100–150 μm of the repair tissue was examined over a time course of 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panels A, B, C, D, and E), we found few vessels between days 1 and 5 on the surface of bone following injury. A large number of CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels sprouted out of the defect at day 5. The vessels were further spread out and formed a connected network over the superior surface of bone, suggesting that the majority of the vessel networks at the superior side of cranial bone were originated from dura side periosteum. Compared to CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel E1–7), CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel D1–7) followed a similar trend with significantly more vessels shown at days 14 and 21 around newly formed bone at the leading edge of the bone defect. Col1a1-GFP<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts (pseudocolored as cyan) appeared at the leading edge of the bone defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel C1–7) and some along the channels of the existing bone at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F1, G1</xref>), in accordance with the appearance of some large diameter CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels in bone tissue. Many of these CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels were observed to be lined by Col1a1-GFP<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts and intertwined with CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels at days 10, 14, and 21 in newly formed bone undergoing active remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panels F and G, arrows).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) imaging at the superior periosteum of the cranial bone defect in Col1a1-GFP transgenic mice.</title><p>Cranial defects were imaged via MPLSM from superior side of cranial bone before and after injury at days 1, 3, 5, 10, 14, and 21.

Vessels sprouted from the dura side periosteum were abundant in the defect region at day 5. The superior periosteum had no sign of bone formation until day 10. GFP<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts (cyan) were found primarily at the leading edge of the defect and within bone channels at days 10, 14, and 21 (C1–7). CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> (red, D1–7), CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> (green, E1–7) were separately reconstructed to show temporal changes of the two types of vessels.

Taken together, our current study highlights the functional differences of blood vessel types at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface of bone defect repair, offering imaging tools and new insights for a deeper understanding of bone tissue vascularization and the bone healing microenvironment at the site of regeneration.</p><p>CD31 and EMCN have been shown to differentially mark arterial, venous, and capillary vessels in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samulowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">dela Paz and D’Amore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zuercher et al., 2012</xref>). Utilizing an intravital MPLSM imaging approach, we have previously shown that CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels exhibit higher mean pO<sub>2</sub> than CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface during nanofiber-mediated cranial defect repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhai et al., 2021</xref>). To further understand the dynamics of these two types of vessels during skeletal healing, we performed longitudinal analyses of the two types of vessels during spontaneous cranial defect repair, together with analyses of osteoblasts via Col1a1-GFP and bone matrix deposition via SHG. Our data demonstrate distinct dynamics of the two types of vessels marked by CD31 and EMCN in response to injury: CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels expand rapidly, coinciding with the expansion of the clusters of Col1a1-GFP<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts, while CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels show a delayed response to injury, with enhanced branching and extension of the vessels observed at a late stage of healing, when formation of vascular channels within bone tissue is evident. The differential dynamics of the angiogenic response reflects the intrinsic differences between venous and arterial ECs in response to bone injury, which could be attributed to the fundamental differences in the biology of the two types of vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">dela Paz and D’Amore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitsebaomo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simons and Eichmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbert and Stainier, 2011</xref>). The differential dynamics of angiogenesis from the two types of vessels could also be attributed to the repertoire of angiogenic factors produced by osteoblasts to induce a blood vessel network that is specialized for bone regeneration and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schipani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stegen and Carmeliet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stegen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstenfeld et al., 2003</xref>). More detailed studies are needed to define vasculature as well as the factors that organize the specialized vessel network in bone tissue.</p><p>It is worth noting that the rapid expansion of the CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels is transient and quickly subsides when osteoblasts become more mature and when significant bone matrix deposition and remodeling follow. The regression of the vessels is necessary for organization of a specialized bone vasculature, specifically the formation of type H vessels in new bone tissue. This finding is consistent with our previous observation which shows similar down-regulation of CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels following the deposition of bone tissue in a nanofiber-mediated bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhai et al., 2021</xref>). This finding is also consistent with more recent studies which link specialized osteoclastic activities with organization and formation of type H vessel formation in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Romeo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the formation of a specialized vascular network in bone involves concerted activities from osteoblasts, osteoclasts as well as subsets of ECs.</p><p>By analyzing the time-dependent changes of bone and vessel formation at the superior and dura periosteum of cranial defect repair, we further show that revascularization at the superior side of cranial bone is largely dependent upon the rapid expansion of the vasculature from the dura periosteum. Similarly, progenitor cells located at the dura periosteum and in the marrow space are the major sources of bone forming cells during healing, as these cells are the first to respond to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The differences in the response to injury at the two different sites of periosteum could be attributed to the extent of damage inflicted on vessels and progenitor cells during initial surgery, in which the dura periosteal cells/vessels are better preserved. However, the difference could also be due to the different density and distribution of vessel types present on the superior and dura periosteum. As a matter of fact, we see very different vessel network in non-injured bone on dura and superior periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1</xref>) with more organized arterial and venous network formed at the dura side periosteum.

By tracing <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels during repair, our current study shows that nearly all CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> capillary vessels are labeled by <italic>Apln<sup>CreER</sup></italic> including vessels tightly associated with osteoblasts following injury at day 14, excluding CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels derived from arterial vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> 1-8). This result is consistent with the previous study which shows that <italic>Apln<sup>CreER</sup></italic>-derived vessels give rise to CD31<sup>high</sup>EMCN<sup>high</sup> type H and E vessels that are tightly coupled to osteoblasts during bone development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langen et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Apln<sup>CreER</sup></italic> is a useful tool to study vessel coupling with osteoblasts. Our study further confirms that <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> EC robustly labels venules and venous capillaries but not arterial ECs at the site of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Apln, endothelial bone marrow tyrosine kinase <italic>Bmx</italic> is a gene known to be expressed in ECs of arterial vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rajantie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ekman et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mouse model has been shown to largely label arterial vessels during retinal angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehling et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, our current study shows that <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels are primarily arterial CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels directly extended from arterioles at the healing site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels show higher mean pO<sub>2</sub> than <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels at a similar location, particularly when the vessel network at the defect site becomes more mature and stable at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels which are abundant and subject to dynamic changes at the site of the defect, <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels exhibit a slow response to injury during the course of healing, consistent with what is observed in CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> vessels.</p><p>Genetic labeling of the <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels and osteoblastic cells in a triple transgenic reporter mouse allows us to utilize advanced imaging techniques to study the oxygen microenvironment at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface during defect repair. Despite heterogeneous pO<sub>2</sub> distribution within blood vessels, our analyses show that <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels closer to osteoblast clusters have significantly lower pO<sub>2</sub> at days 10 and 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>), coinciding with osteoblast expansion, indicating enhanced demand for oxygen supply and potentially enhanced consumption of oxygen at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface during early stages of healing. In contrast to <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels which are often found to be close to osteoblasts, <italic>Bmx<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels at days 10 and 17 do not show changes of pO<sub>2</sub> as a function of distance (Figures 5C1–2), suggesting that perhaps the dip of pO<sub>2</sub> is vessel type dependent and could be attributed to the close coupling of <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels with osteoblast clusters at the leading edge of the defect.</p><p>Genetic labeling of the <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> vessels and osteoblastic cells in a transgenic reporter mouse further allows us to examine cellular metabolism at the osteogenic and angiogenic interface utilizing a previously established phasor approach for measurement of NAD(P)H τ<sub>M</sub> via 2P-FLIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schilling et al., 2022</xref>). Our data show that <italic>Apln<sup>CreER+</sup></italic> ECs prefer glycolysis and are less sensitive to microenvironmental pO<sub>2</sub> changes at the site of defect repair, consistent with reports that show that glycolysis is the primary energy producing mechanisms in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eelen et al., 2018</xref>), and glycolysis is highly favored during sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Bock et al., 2013</xref>). By choosing glycolysis for ATP production, ECs allow oxygen diffusion to neighboring cells to support healing. Compared to ECs, osteoblasts have higher NAD(P)H τ<sub>M</sub>, therefore utilizing relatively more OxPhos. Osteoblasts further show a significant shift of NAD(P)H τ<sub>M</sub> to glycolysis coinciding with the drop of pO<sub>2</sub> at the same location. This is consistent with the data that show low oxygen status is favored by osteoblastic aerobic glycolytic metabolism at the site of bone repair and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Further analyses of energy metabolism of osteoblasts at different stages as well as other cell types at the defect site could help advance our understanding of the impact of oxygen microenvironment and the hypoxic niche on cellular metabolism at the site of bone healing and homeostasis.</p><p>The high complexity of the regenerative microenvironment drives the heterogeneous and non-uniform oxygen distribution and therefore the spatiotemporal differences in the structure and function of blood vessel network during repair and regeneration. In our current study, we find that even within the same type of vessels, there exists a high degree of heterogeneity in pO<sub>2</sub> distribution. The heterogeneous pO<sub>2</sub> could not be attributed to the heterogeneous vessel diameter distribution at the site of repair since our data showed poor correlation of pO<sub>2</sub> value with the vessel diameter at the site of repair (data not shown). The pO<sub>2</sub> heterogeneity has critical functional consequences for different cell types in bone and could be important for constitution of various stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sivan et al., 2019</xref>). It is also worth noting that while the range of pO<sub>2</sub> in CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>+</sup> vessels falls within the reported blood pO<sub>2</sub> in venous vessels, the mean pO<sub>2</sub> in CD31<sup>+</sup>EMCN<sup>−</sup> capillary vessels is lower than reported in arterial blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marenzana and Arnett, 2013</xref>), likely due to the active exchange and consumption of oxygen at the repair site.</p><p>Blood vessel types and function associated with bone repair and bone tissue engineering remain poorly understood. The limited knowledge hinders further efforts aimed at engineering effective and functional vessel networks for enhanced bone defect repair and regeneration. A deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal control of bone-dependent angiogenesis and bone healing microenvironment is critically important for long-term success of material-based approaches for tissue repair and reconstruction. With the establishment of high-resolution and state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques, our current study has laid the foundation for future studies aimed at better understanding of the osteogenic coupling with EC subtypes at regeneration interface, offering useful tools to study stem/progenitor cell behavior as well as bone healing microenvironment at the site of repair for enhanced skeletal repair and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The Col1a1-GFP transgenic mice, which specifically label mature osteoblasts with GFP, are published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

It is a very well-written manuscript and was built on the authors' previous works to visualize, for the first time, the natural bone healing progression in mouse calvarial defects. Notably, it also includes the analysis of the oxygen and energy metabolism within the defects during bone healing, which provides critical information for future optimization of therapeutic approaches for bone regeneration.

Authors measured the pO2 labels after injury or during the healing process and found lower levels on days 10, 17 and 31, but the lowest was observed on day 17 because of the hypoxic environment. As per previous experiments (Figure 2), metabolic activities are higher on day 10 post-injury, and vessel proliferation is associated with osteoblast expansion at the same time. These two experiments contradict each other regarding the lowest level of pO2 on day 17. Why the higher metabolic activities did not affect the pO2 level at day 10, and why is there a similar level of pO2 at day 10 and 24 at &lt;150 µm.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, pO<sub>2</sub> levels in the defect were very heterogeneous as shown in our data and in our discussion. Secondly, from day 10 to day 24, more cells were recruited into the defect with vessel density in the defect markedly increased over time. At day 10, due to the presence of relatively fewer cells at the defect site, the consumption of oxygen by osteoblasts may not exert a direct impact on the mean oxygen level at the defect site. On day 17, with more osteoblasts being formed plus other oxygen consuming cell types being recruited to the site of injury, we observed a significant drop of the overall oxygen level at the defect site. By day 24, more vessels were being formed and getting matured, resulting in an increased availability of oxygen. Hence, at this time, the differences in pO<sub>2</sub> were lost. This difference was again noted on day 31 when oxygen equilibrium was reached at the site of repair. Overall, we do not think that these experiments are contradicting to each other. On the contrary, they reflect the complexity of the in vivo microenvironment in the context of healing.</p><p>Lastly, we want to mention that our current method to measure pO<sub>2</sub> is limited to a small focal spot (point scan), precluding us from recording pO<sub>2</sub> in a large area efficiently. We are in a process of updating our microscope so that we can create a density map of pO<sub>2</sub> in a larger and better-defined region of interest. We are also collaborating with experts to use more sensitive two-photon excitable probes for analyses of oxygen in vessels in the deeper layers of the healing tissue. We will provide updates to the community as our work progresses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
