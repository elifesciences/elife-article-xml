However, it remains unknown whether and how neurexins are involved in shaping functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate prominent inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. To address these issues, we examined the role of neurexins in a model glycinergic synapse between the principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the principal neuron in the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem. Combining RNAscope with stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in the MNTB of neurexin1/2/3 conditional triple knockout mice, we showed that MNTB neurons highly express all isoforms of neurexins although their expression levels vary remarkably. Selective ablation of all neurexins in MNTB neurons not only reduced the amplitude but also altered the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission at LSO neurons. The synaptic dysfunctions primarily resulted from an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release and a loosened coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. Together, our current findings demonstrate that neurexins are essential in controlling the strength and temporal precision of the glycinergic synapse, which therefore corroborates the role of neurexins as key presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurexins</kwd><kwd>glycinergic</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>MNTB</kwd><kwd>LSO</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Fujun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32371050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurexins are essential for shaping the functional properties of glycinergic synapse in the auditory brainstem, further attesting their universal role as critical presynaptic organizers in all major fast chemical synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved synaptic adhesion molecules and their genetic mutations are highly associated with autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">SÃ¼dhof, 2008</xref>). In the vertebrates, neurexins are encoded by three genes Nrxn1, Nrxn2, and Nrxn3, each of which contains distinct promoters for expressing longer Î±- and shorter Î²-neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ullrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ushkaryov et al., 1992</xref>).

Triple knockout (KO) of Î±-neurexins causes a significant decrease in the density of GABAergic but not glutamatergic synapses while producing a strong reduction in both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Missler et al., 2003</xref>). Triple KO of Î²-neurexins reveals a significant phenotype only in glutamatergic synapses, but not in GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of all neurexins, including Nrxn1/2/3 Î±- and Î²-neurexins, leads to profound but strikingly distinct phenotypes in different synapses, which further points to the diverse actions of neurexins in specific neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, transcriptomic analysis has revealed that the expression profiles of various neurexins differ remarkably in excitatory neurons versus inhibitory neurons even among distinct subtypes of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FÃ¶ldy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukacsovich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uchigashima et al., 2019</xref>).

These synapses are robust, precise, and extremely reliable even during high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KrÃ¤chan et al., 2017</xref>). Strong evidence has shown that the MNTBâLSO glycinergic synapses are subject to extensive refinement during development, including transmitter type switch, the elaboration of dendrites and axonal arbors followed by synaptic pruning, to achieve exquisite control of fast inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Kandler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotak et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nabekura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanes and Friauf, 2000</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of shaping their functional characteristic remain incompletely understood.</p><p>We utilized the triple Nrxn1/2/3 conditional KO mice (Nrxn123 cTKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) to ablate all neurexins in MNTB principal neurons with stereotactic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre recombinase. Combining this with the RNAscope technique, we verified that MNTB neurons highly express various isoforms of neurexins. Selective injection of AAV-Cre, but not AAV-EGFP(enhanced green fluorescent protein), successfully blocked expression of all neurexins in MNTB neurons. Functionally, pan-neurexin deletion significantly impaired both the amplitude and the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, deletion of all neurexins led to a significantly higher number of glycinergic synapses innervating the LSO and higher frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Application of low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocked the glycinergic neurotransmission of both control and neurexin-deficient synapses, but with a significant difference in its effectiveness. Moreover, treatment with EGTA(ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid), a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator with slow binding kinetics, caused a much stronger inhibition of neurotransmission in neurexin-deficient synapses, suggesting a significant disruption of the tight coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles in the MNTBâLSO glycinergic synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neurexins are highly expressed in MNTB neurons</title><p>To study the role and mechanism of neurexins in the glycinergic synapse between MNTB neurons and LSO neurons, which are critical in computing sound localization in mammalian auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grothe et al., 2010</xref>), we first characterized the expression of Nrxn1â3 in the principal neurons of the MNTB by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the RNAscope technique. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, MNTB neurons in wild-type (WT) mice expressed Nrxn1, Nrxn2, and Nrxn3, although the expression level of each gene appeared to vary remarkably. As an initial exploration, we took advantage of Nrxn123 cTKO mice that enable deletion of all neurexins following the expression of Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), to bypass the functional redundancy of different neurexins. Neuronal specific deletion of all neurexins was achieved by stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre-EGFP into the MNTB at P0 (TKO). As a control, AAV-EGFP was injected (Ctrl). Successful virus injection and expression of Cre recombinase in MNTB neurons were confirmed by strong EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). FISH data further demonstrated that the recombinase dramatically blocked the expression of all neurexins, as compared to the normal expression of neurexins when EGFP was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Altogether, these data show that the glycinergic neurons in the MNTB highly express various neurexin genes, which can be specifically deleted by stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in Nrxn123 cTKO mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neurexins are highly expressed in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunohistochemistry and RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showing expression of various isoforms of neurexins in the MNTB, which make glycinergic synapses with lateral superior olive (LSO) neurons.

To test the hypothesis, we sought to examine how neurexins may regulate the function of the MNTBâLSO glycinergic synapse in the auditory brainstem. Because LSO neurons receive excitatory glutamatergic inputs and inhibitory GABAergic/glycinergic inputs, we used a pharmacological approach to isolate the glycinergic inputs. By blocking glutamatergic inputs with CNQX and AP5, we were able to selectively record inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from LSO neurons, which can be completely inhibited by strychnine, a potent glycine receptor inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To specifically examine the role of neurexins in regulating the glycinergic synapse, we used an optogenetic approach in which two AAVs, AAV-Cre-EGFP and AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry, were co-injected in Nrxn123 cTKO mice. As a control, AAV-ChR2-EYFP was used for injection. Virus injection was performed at P0 and acute slices derived from these mice were analyzed at P13â14. We verified the successful expression of ChR2 by examining the fluorescence and further by recording optogenetically evoked action potentials (APs) from the soma of MNTB neurons. Reliable AP firing can be induced by single or repetitive high-frequency light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). In control mice, optogenetic stimulation of MNTB neurons robustly triggered large IPSCs recorded from LSO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>), which can be fully blocked by strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1d</xref>) and are thus purely glycinergic. In TKO mice with co-injection of Cre and ChR2, however, optogenetic stimulation-induced significantly smaller IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). On average, we observed ~60% reduction in the peak amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), similar to previous findings at other different synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetics of IPSCs were dramatically reduced as indicated by significantly slower rise time and decay time in TKO mice as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that neurexins are essential for the intact function of the glycinergic synapse.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Deletion of neurexins reduces the strength and kinetics of glycinergic synapse.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) traces of lateral superior olive (LSO) neurons evoked by optogenetic stimulation of ChR2 expressed in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) neurons.

Consistent with our optogenetic approach, afferent-evoked large IPSCs were predominantly glycinergic as they can also be fully blocked by strychnine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A modest but significant decrease in synaptic strength was observed in Nrxn123 TKO mice as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>), confirming the important role of neurexins in the glycinergic synapses. The modest effect of the pan-neurexin deletion on synaptic strength in the MNTBâLSO synapses is likely due to the incomplete AAV transfection in MNTN neurons. Therefore, it is likely that a small fraction of MNTB neurons may still express relatively normal expression of neurexins. It is worth pointing out that extensive efforts were made to optimize our virus injection protocols by adjusting the injection parameters including the needle angle, virus titers, and volume. On average, it was estimated that approximately ~80% neurons in the MNTB expressed GFP and thus were infected by AAV-Cre. It is also possible that other sources of glycinergic inputs other than the MNTB afferents are likely to present but are obscured in WT animals by the predominant glycinergic inputs from MNTB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jalabi et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The mechanism of neurexins for regulating the MNTBâLSO glycinergic synapse</title><p>Since neurexins play multifaceted roles in regulating pre- and/or postsynaptic functions, we explored the potential mechanisms by initially examining the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of IPSCs, which has been routinely used for identifying a presynaptic origin of regulation.

Surprisingly, however, we found that deletion of all neurexins caused a small but significant increase in the frequency of sIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>), which is opposite to previous reports of either no change or decrease in the miniature frequency at glutamatergic or GABAergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>).

Consistent with the increased frequency of sIPSCs, we found a significant increase in the density of both GlyT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f</xref>) and VGAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g, h</xref>) staining, suggesting more abundant glycinergic terminals at the LSO of TKO mice.

Our findings in general strongly corroborate the idea that neurexins are central presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses including glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic.</p><p>Specifically, we have shown that various neurexin genes express concurrently in these glycinergic neurons but the expression level of each appears to vary significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This finding is consistent with many studies in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, which converge to show that multiple genes, isoforms, and splicing sites of neurexins normally co-express in individual neurons and the expression profiles are highly cell-type specific and brain region specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schreiner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uchigashima et al., 2019</xref>). Distinct neurexins may interact separately and/or redundantly with diverse signaling molecules to form specific molecular codes for shaping neuronal connectivity and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lloyd et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>). The observed differential expression of individual neurexins suggests the possibility that specific isoforms may exert dominant regulatory roles in neurotransmission in different synapses. For instance, compelling evidence indicates that Nrxn3, arguably the best studied neurexin isoform, is selectively required for intact synaptic function in the olfactory bulb GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trotter et al., 2023</xref>). Understanding the distinct roles of each neurexin isoform in regulating glycinergic synaptic transmission is crucial for future studies. Particularly noteworthy is the potential involvement of Nrxn3, the most abundant isoform, in this synapse.</p><p>We further show that neurexins are critical in controlling the strength and precise timing of the glycinergic synaptic inhibition at LSO neurons by clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels tightly with synaptic vesicles in presynaptic release sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These data strongly corroborate two perspectives on the function of neurexins as central presynaptic organizers. First, deletion of all neurexins not only weakens the glycinergic synaptic connectivity but also impairs the temporal precision of synaptic inhibition, exactly as it does at the glutamatergic calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Since both the glutamatergic calyx of Held synapse and the glycinergic MNTBâLSO synapse in the auditory brainstem are extremely strong and fast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beiderbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grothe, 2003</xref>), the orchestrating role of neurexins in controlling the timing and magnitude of their synaptic transmission is therefore desirable for the auditory information processing. Second, neurexins execute their role at the glycinergic synapse mainly by tightly organizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels within the release sites, again exactly as it does at the calyx of Held synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). Nanodomain coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles has been found in many fast central synapses and is functionally crucial for increasing the efficacy and speed of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). This similar role of neurexins in clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels tightly at presynaptic active zones of not only the glutamatergic synapse but also the glycinergic synapse prompts a shared mechanism and further research on the potential molecular candidates.</p><p>On the other hand, our data surprisingly reveal that deletion of neurexins may promote the formation/maintenance of the glycinergic synapse, as evidenced by the increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events measured at LSO neurons as well as the increase in the glycinergic synaptic density in Nrxn123 TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Early studies of TKOs of Î±- or Î²-neurexins lead to general conclusion that neurexins are not essential for the formation/maintenance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Missler et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, deletion of all Î±- and Î²-neurexins has no impact on the formation/maintenance of glutamatergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2020</xref>) and GABAergic synapse made by somatostatin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), but produces partial loss (~30%) of GABAergic synapse made by parvalbumin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). There are several possibilities that may explain our present findings on the glycinergic synapse. First, the most parsimonious explanation would be that neurexins play contradictory dual roles at the glycinergic synapse: orchestrate the synchronized synaptic transmission by promoting tight coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone; restrict the formation of weaker synapse or spontaneous transmission. Another well-established example of synaptic protein with dual functions in synaptic transmission is synaptotagmin 1, which acts as a calcium sensor to trigger synchronous release while clamps and restricts spontaneous fusion of vesicles on the other hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">SÃ¼dhof, 2013</xref>). It is worthy of note that synaptotagmin can specifically interact with neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hata et al., 1993</xref>). Second, deletion of neurexins impairs the strength of the MNTBâLSO synapse, which may indirectly interfere with synaptic elimination process and therefore lead to an increase in synaptic density. Third, the more abundant glycinergic synapses may arise from the developmental compensation of synapse formation by other sources of glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jalabi et al., 2013</xref>). Strong reduction in the strength of the MNTBâLSO synapse caused by selective deletion of neurexins may shift the winner of synaptic competition toward other parallel but much weaker glycinergic inputs in normal animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse breeding and virus injection</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Bioland Laboratory, Guangzhou National Laboratory, Guangzhou, China (IACUC2020062; GZLAB-AUCP202403A07).

With the extracellular [Cl<sup>â</sup>] of 133 mM and a temperature of 22Â°C, the equilibrium potential of the Cl<sup>â</sup> was approximately â78.8 mV. In voltage-clamp configuration, IPSCs were recorded by holding cells at 10 mV in ACSF containing CNQX (20 Î¼M), D-AP5 (50 Î¼M), to block AMPA, NMDA receptors, respectively. For some experiments, 2 Î¼M strychnine, a potent glycine receptor antagonist, was added to ACSF to verify that IPSCs recorded at LSO neurons are glycinergic. Membrane potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Electrical fiber stimulation was performed using a concentric bipolar electrode (CBAEB75, FHC Inc, USA) positioned medially to the LSO and MNTB. Short pulses (0.1 ms) were delivered via an isolated stimulator (Model 2100; A-M Systems, USA). For optogenetics, a light simulation of 5 ms was delivered by LED (pE-300 white, CoolLED, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Whole-cell current-clamp recordings</title><p>Whole-cell current-clamped recordings were performed similarly as voltage-clamped recordings, except that the internal solution did not contain Qx-314. APs at MNTB neurons were recorded by holding the membrane potential at approximately â70 mV. For optogenetics, a light simulation of 5 ms was delivered by LED (pE-300 white, CoolLED, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNAscope FISH and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized and perfused at speed of 1 ml/min with 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. Brains were removed and stored in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C. After going through a 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose gradient for cryo-protection, the tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Cat: 14020108926, Leica) and rapidly frozen on dry ice. Transverse sections at 16 Î¼m were cut at â20Â°C using a cryostat (CM3050-S, Leica) and mounted directly on Superfrost Plus slides (Cat: PRO-04, Matsunami Platinum Pro). FISH and immunohistochemistry were performed using the RNAscope multiplex platform (Multiplex Reagent Kit, Cat: 323100; Co-detection ancillary Kit, Cat: 323180, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the manufacturerâs instructions. RNA probes for Nrxn1, Nrxn2, and Nrxn3 (Cat: 461511-C3, 533531-C2, and 505431, respectively, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and primary antibody against VGluT1 (guinea pig, polyclonal, 1:500, Millipore) were used. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor conjugates (1:400; Thermo Fisher). Samples were mounted with a Vectashield hard-set antifade mounting medium (Cat: H-1500, Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope with a Ã63 oil-immersion objective (1.4 numerical aperture) or OLYMPUS IXplore SpinSR confocal microscope with a Ã60 oil-immersion objective (1.5 numerical aperture). Image analysis was performed using Zeiss 2.6, cellSens Dimension 3.2, and ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pharmacological manipulations</title><p>To estimate the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmitter release, we perfused the slice with ACSF containing low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.2 mM) and continuously recorded eIPSC.

To estimate the spatial relationship between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles, we perfused the slice with ACSF containing 20 ÂµM EGTA-AM for 25â30 min while continuously recording eIPSC. The blocking effect of EGTA on eIPSCs was evaluated by comparing eIPSCs before and after EGTA treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed in the IgorPro (Version 8) and GraphPad Prism 9 software.

It is worth mentioning that LSO neurons are an integration station of the auditory brainstem circuit displaying high reliability and temporal precision. These features are necessary for computing interaural cues to derive sound source location from comparing the intensities of sounds arriving at the two ears. In this context, the authors' findings build up according to the hypothesis first by displaying that neurexins were expressed in the MNTB at varying levels. They followed this up with deletion of all neurexins in the MNTB through the employment of a triple knock-out (TKO). Using electrophysiological recordings in acute brainstem slices of these TKO mice, they gathered solid evidence for the role of neurexins in synaptic transmission at this glycinergic synapse primarily by ensuring tight coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites. Additionally, the authors uncovered a connection between the deletion of neurexins and a higher number of glycinergic synapses of TKO mice, for which they provided evidence in the form of immunostainings and related it to electrophysiological data on spontaneous release.

For their study on LSO IPSCs the authors transduced MNTB neurons by co-injection of virus carrying Cre and ChR2 and subsequently optogenetically evoke release of glycine. As a result, they observed a significant reduction in amplitude and significantly slower rise and decay times of the IPSCs of the TKO in comparison with control mice in which MNTB neurons were only transduced with ChR2. Furthermore, they observed an increased paired pulse ratio (PPR) of LSO IPSCs in the TKO mice, indicating lower release probability. Elaborating on the hypothesis that neurexins are essential for the coupling of synaptic vesicles to Ca2+ channels, the authors show lowered Ca2+ sensitivity in the TKO mice.

However, we would like to point out that a novelty of our present study indeed stems from the exploration of how different types of synapses converge to employ the same mechanism of synaptic function, particularly in the context of neurexin-mediated regulation. Our previous study focused on glutamatergic synapses, the current study delves into the realm of glycinergic synapses, which represent a distinct population with unique properties and functions. Despite the differences between these synapse types, our findings reveal a commonality in the underlying mechanisms of synaptic regulation mediated by neurexins. This convergence of mechanisms across different synapse types highlights the fundamental role of neurexins in synaptic function and plasticity. By elucidating how neurexins regulate synaptic transmission at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, we provide valuable insights into the general principles governing synaptic function. In addition, this comparative perspective may shed light on the complex interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, which is crucial for maintaining the balance of neuronal activity and network dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>During the developmental period spanning P3-P12, the MNTB-LSO synapses undergo a transition from GABAergic to glycinergic transmission. It is well-established that Neurexin plays a role in modulating GABAergic transmission. In the authors' experimental system, AAV was injected at P0, likely impacting GABAergic transmission, including potentially influencing synapse number, before subsequently affecting glycinergic transmission. A thoughtful discussion of how the experimental interventions might have influenced this developmental process and glycinergic transmission would enhance the clarity and interpretation of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the interesting topic of the transmitter switch during neurodevelopment. Strong evidence using gerbils and rats as animal models demonstrates that the MNTB-LSO synapses undergo a shift from GABAergic to glycinergic during the early development. However, in a more recent study by Friauf and colleagues (Fisher et al., 2019), patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse brainstem slices at P4-P11 combined with pharmacological blockade of GABAA receptors and/or glycine receptors clearly demonstrated no GABAergic synaptic component on LSO principal neurons, suggesting the transmitter subtype switch may be species different.

Indeed, the weakening of glycinergic transmission due to pan-neurexin ablation in MNTB neurons could potentially alter the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, thereby impacting the overall excitability of LSO neurons. We have conducted preliminary experiments to investigate this aspect and found that the E/I balance at LSO neurons was notably increased in TKO mice.

We revised the text in line 60 to âIn the mature mammalian auditory brainstemâ and in line 113, we removed GABAergic to emphasize the nature of glycinergic synapse, particularly in the mouse brainstem where no GABAergic components are found (Fisher et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 72/73 it should be adeno-associated virus; line 73: &quot;combining this with the RNAScope technique&quot; sounds better.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 91 using the RNAScope technique; lines 97, 119 as a control; line 108 the functional organization.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 113 should be a pharmacological approach; line 122 optogenetically evoked.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 132, 160: the control.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 147 thus were infected; line 148 likely to be present but were obscured .</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 154 which has been routinely used.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 155 It is not supposed to be Figure 2h but 2i; following that Figure 2i should be 2j; in my opinion, Figure 2i does not display a strong depression for the TKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 171 a better flow is achieved by saying: together these data show.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ EC50 rather than IC50 of [Ca2+].</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ 180 it is better to say &quot;we approached the matter by...&quot;; line 183 while recording;</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 203 were much stronger than the effect at control synapses; line 206 tightly clustering.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 212 sounds like they provide evidence for retina and spinal cord as well, should be made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 289 previously.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 295 should be 30 min.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 336, 337 confocal microscope.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Please provide the number of data points also in figure captions or in the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>Added in the captions as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Line 533, a better phrasing would be: the blocking effect of 0.2 mM Ca on IPSC amplitude.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Explain either in the methods or result section how was the EC50 of Ca2+ calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>Added in the methods as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
