Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is a major contributor to the rising rates of overdose deaths. Reversing fentanyl overdoses has proved challenging due to its high potency and the rapid onset of OIRD. We assessed the contributions of central and peripheral mu opioid receptors (MORs) in mediating fentanyl-induced physiological responses. The peripherally restricted MOR antagonist naloxone methiodide (NLXM) both prevented and reversed OIRD to a degree comparable to that of naloxone (NLX), indicating substantial involvement of peripheral MORs to OIRD. Interestingly, NLXM-mediated OIRD reversal did not produce aversive behaviors observed after NLX. We show that neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), the first central synapse of peripheral afferents, exhibit a biphasic activity profile following fentanyl exposure. NLXM pretreatment attenuates this activity, suggesting that these responses are mediated by peripheral MORs. Together, these findings establish a critical role for peripheral MORs, including ascending inputs to the nTS, as sites of dysfunction during OIRD. Furthermore, selective peripheral MOR antagonism could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing OIRD by sparing CNS-driven acute opioid-associated withdrawal and aversion observed after NLX.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fentanyl</kwd><kwd>naloxone methiodide</kwd><kwd>nTS</kwd><kwd>photometry</kwd><kwd>respiratory depression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA042499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morón</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA045463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morón</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA054900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morón</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA059067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morón</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GF0012452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruyle</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DA007261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruyle</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide reverses fentanyl-induced respiratory depression without causing aversive behaviors that are observed after naloxone.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Millions of Americans live with Opioid Use Disorders (OUD) and face a high risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), the leading cause of opioid related deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>). The number of fatalities attributed to OIRD has been exacerbated by the rise of distribution and use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comer and Cahill, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mattson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>). Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic opioid that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and binds tightly to mu opioid receptors (MORs), which are abundant in the respiratory centers of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansour et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to other opioids such as heroin and morphine, fentanyl exhibits both a faster onset of OIRD and higher potency for MOR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchette et al., 2023</xref>), minimizing successful prevention of lethal outcomes using naloxone (NLX), a competitive and preferential MOR antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairbairn et al., 2017</xref>). Despite its high efficacy in reversing OIRD, NLX also precipitates unpleasant withdrawal symptoms and aversion, as reported in patients and preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fairbairn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yugar et al., 2023</xref>), making its implementation for managing OUD challenging. Therefore, a better understanding of the pharmacology, specific brain regions and pathways, and physiological responses induced by high doses of fentanyl are necessary to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies, ultimately saving lives of patients suffering from OUD.</p><p>Several regions have been implicated as key sites of triggering OIRD, including the Pre-Botzinger Complex in the ventral medulla and the parabrachial nucleus and Kölliker–Fuse nucleus in the pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman and Levitt, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haji et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palkovic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>). Opioids act directly within these networks to alter inspiratory and expiratory phase duration, leading to overall reductions in respiratory rate and apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pattinson, 2008</xref>). In addition, the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS), located in the dorsal brainstem, is the first central site that receives sensory afferent information via cranial nerves related to cardiorespiratory, gustatory, and gastrointestinal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andresen and Kunze, 1994</xref>). Acute hypoxia robustly activates nTS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teppema et al., 1997</xref>) to initiate appropriate autonomic and cardiorespiratory responses that facilitate a return to homeostatic physiological states. MORs are expressed throughout the entire caudal–rostral extent of the nTS, where they are located postsynaptically on nTS neurons and on vagal afferent fibers that terminate within the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furdui et al., 2024</xref>). Opioids induce both systemic and brain hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Disney et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solis et al., 2018</xref>) and produce an increase in Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salas et al., 2013</xref>). However, engaging MOR signaling in the nTS impairs hypoxic ventilatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that OIRD may result from nTS dysfunction failing to engage appropriate cardiorespiratory responses, thereby leading to prolonged OIRD. However, the specific contributions of nTS MOR, including ascending MOR-expressing inputs from the periphery to this region, in driving aberrant cardiorespiratory depression are still not fully understood.</p><p>In addition to their high expression throughout brainstem respiratory nuclei, MORs are also expressed in the periphery, including sensory ganglia, lung afferents, cardiac tissue, and cranial nerves that terminate within the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabot et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 1996</xref>). Naloxone methiodide (NLXM) is a quaternary derivative of NLX that does not cross the blood–brain barrier at low doses, making it a useful tool to assess the peripheral versus central contribution of MORs in opioid-induced physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perekopskiy et al., 2020</xref>). Despite its lower binding affinity for MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2003</xref>), NLXM has been shown to reverse opioid-induced hypoventilation and brain hypoxia in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perekopskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that peripheral opioid receptors may play a greater role in OIRD than previously thought. However, no studies to date have provided a comprehensive assessment of opioid-induced cardiorespiratory depression and systemic hypoxia combined with a real-time assessment of MOR-mediated activity of nTS neurons.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the relative contributions of central and peripheral MORs mediating fentanyl-induced depression of cardiorespiratory parameters and investigated potential mechanisms of opioid-induced dysfunction within the nTS. We report that fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression and prolonged systemic hypoxia can be prevented or reversed by NLXM to degree comparable to NLX. As compared to NLX, NLXM-mediated reversal of OIRD did not produce aversive-like behaviors. Fentanyl-induced robust Fos-IR expression in the nTS in a dose-dependent manner, and this activation can be attributed to a combination of direct effects of opioids acting at MOR located within the nTS and the subsequent hypoxia that develops after fentanyl exposure. Given that the majority of nTS MOR is located on vagal afferent fibers, we utilized various techniques to evaluate opioid-induced activity within the nTS and manipulate nTS MOR signaling during OIRD. Using wireless in vivo fiber photometry, we show that fentanyl evokes a biphasic activity profile in nTS neurons, characterized by a transient increase followed by a prolonged decrease in neuronal excitability. NLXM pretreatment strongly attenuated this biphasic response, indicating that fentanyl-induced nTS activity is influenced by MOR-expressing peripheral afferents. Together, these findings provide novel insights into peripheral mechanisms mediating OIRD and support peripheral MOR antagonism as a promising therapeutic strategy for managing OIRD for patients suffering from OUD while sparing the CNS-driven acute aversive behaviors that are observed with the use of NLX.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intravenous fentanyl induces respiratory depression and activates nTS neurons in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>We first examined the effect of intravenous fentanyl to induce cardiorespiratory depression and activate neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS). Catheterized rats received intravenous saline (1 ml/kg) or fentanyl at a range of doses (2, 20, or 50 µg/kg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and cardiorespiratory parameters were measured up to 60 min. The first 20 min of these responses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, baseline cardiorespiratory parameters were similar between male and female rats that received 20 µg/kg fentanyl. There was a small but significant difference in basal heart rate in female rats that received 50 µg/kg fentanyl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Neither saline nor 2 µg/kg fentanyl evoked a significant change in cardiorespiratory parameters. In comparison, both 20 and 50 µg/kg fentanyl produced rapid decreases in oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate, with the largest decrease occurring after 50 µg/kg fentanyl. The nadir (defined as the lowest point measured after fentanyl) and recovery (calculated as 90% of baseline values prior to fentanyl) for each physiological parameter were assessed in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–J</xref>). There was no significant difference in the nadir or recovery values between saline- and 2 µg/kg fentanyl-treated rats. In comparison, rats given 50 µg/kg fentanyl exhibited a significantly lower nadir in oxygen saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and respiratory rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) compared to 20 µg/kg. In addition, the recovery time was significantly longer in rats that received 50 µg/kg fentanyl compared to 20 µg/kg fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, J</xref>). The nadir of bradycardia was similar between 20 and 50 µg/kg rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), although the duration of the response was significantly longer in rats that received the highest dose of fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Overall, we observed no sex differences in the nadir or recovery time in rats that received 20 µg/kg fentanyl. Female rats that received 50 µg/kg fentanyl exhibited a significantly longer recovery of respiratory rate, although oxygen saturation and heart rate recover times were similar to males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C, D</xref>). We next examined nTS activation (Fos-IR) following intravenous fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). A significant increase in Fos-IR was observed after 2 µg/kg fentanyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), a dose that did not induce cardiorespiratory depression.

Initial biodistribution experiments were performed to confirm the peripheral restriction of NLXM.

The intense symptoms induced during NLX-precipitated withdrawal present additional challenges in managing OUD in patients. Given that peripheral MOR antagonism sufficiently reverses fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression to a degree that is comparable to NLX, we used a conditioned place aversion (CPA) approach to assess whether selective peripheral antagonism of MOR signaling produces aversive behaviors. Rats underwent a three-session CPA challenge that consisted of pre-conditioning test, conditioning test, and post-conditioning test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Horizontal locomotion in both compartments of the CPA boxes was assessed during both pre- and post-conditioning tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). During the pre-conditioning test, rats exhibited no natural preference or aversion for either compartment. On the conditioning day (Day 2), a divider was placed in the middle of the CPA box. Rats received intravenous fentanyl (50 µg/kg) in their home cage. Four minutes later, rats were placed into the paired compartment of the CPA box and immediately given intravenous saline (1 ml/kg), NLX (1 mg/kg), or NLXM (1 or 5 mg/kg). During the post-conditioning test, the divider was removed, and rats were allowed to explore both compartments of the CPA box. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows the time spent on the conditioned side of the CPA box for all groups.

Importantly, a single conditioning session with fentanyl administered in the home cage followed by saline in the compartment instead of an MOR antagonist did not produce a preference or aversion to the saline-paired compartment. To rule out any potential effects of endogenous opioids influencing the behavioral responses to opioid receptor antagonism, we performed an additional test in which rats were given saline in their home cage, followed by NLX or NLXM in one of the CPA compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>).

While Fos-IR quantification provides insight into the anatomical activation of brainstem subregions in response to fentanyl administration and OIRD reversal, this approach does not provide any temporal resolution of the activity of these cells. Therefore, we used wireless in vivo fiber photometry to assess dynamic changes in nTS calcium transient activity after intravenous fentanyl administration in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Catheterized rats underwent bilateral injections of an AAV expressing a calcium sensor (pGP-AAV9-syn-jGCaMP8m-WPRE) into the nTS.

GCaMP viral expression was observed throughout the caudal-rostral extent of the nTS in all rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Fentanyl (20 µg/kg) infusion induced a biphasic activity profile in nTS neurons, characterized by an initial robust increase (Early Response) followed by a decrease below baseline (Late Response, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We next examined the extent to which MOR antagonists restore the fentanyl-induced reductions in activity. After MOR antagonist administration, fentanyl-induced suppression of nTS activity returned to baseline during the early recovery in rats that received NLX, but not NLXM. However, both NLX and NLXM enhanced nTS activity above baseline during the late recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>).

Numerous studies have evaluated opioid-induced dysfunction within key regulatory sites in the central nervous system that contribute to the severity of OIRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman and Levitt, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>). Peripheral MORs have also been examined for their roles in impacting OIRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>). However, the specific contributions of central and peripheral MORs to the onset and duration of fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression, along with the role of the nTS in these effects, are not completely understood. In this study, we show that blocking peripheral MORs with NLXM sufficiently prevents and reverses fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression and systemic hypoxia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that peripheral opioid receptors mediate fentanyl-induced activity of nTS neurons. These data suggest that the nTS may be an area impacted by fentanyl via peripheral MOR activation. Lastly, we demonstrate that in addition to reversing fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression, NLXM does not induce aversive behaviors, as compared to NLX. Together, these findings provide evidence that peripheral MOR antagonism may be a potential novel strategy to reverse OIRD without inducing withdrawal, anxiety, and aversion, all of which can contribute to further relapse in drug-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comer and Cahill, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While numerous studies have focused on evaluating the effects of opioids acting at MORs present within brainstem and pontine networks, less attention has been given to identifying peripheral MOR mechanisms contributing to OIRD. NLX is the most common reversal agent used to treat OIRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to reversing opioid-induced analgesia, NLX precipitates withdrawal symptoms and aversion in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neale and Strang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahan et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that NLX-mediated reversal of OIRD caused a CPA, as shown by a significant decrease in time spent in the NLX-associated compartment. This is likely the result of the induction of withdrawal symptoms that occur following antagonism of MOR in central reward pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katovich et al., 1986</xref>). In contrast, this aversive response was not observed in rats that received NLXM. These data suggest that alleviating fentanyl-induced respiratory distress without antagonizing central MOR may mitigate the aversive state produced by NLX.</p><p>Conditioned place preference and aversion paradigms have been utilized to evaluate rewarding and aversive properties of opioids and antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finlay et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaulden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knauss et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, we observed relatively minimal sex differences in basal and fentanyl-induced changes in cardiorespiratory depression, which is consistent with a previous report showing that sex differences due to fentanyl are relatively minimal compared to other opioids such as heroin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchette et al., 2023</xref>). Previous reports have shown sexually dimorphic differences in fentanyl-induced conditioned place preference, with higher doses of fentanyl affecting females only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knauss et al., 2023</xref>). In present study, we administered fentanyl to male and female rats in the home cage followed by saline in the CPA box and observed neither a preference nor aversion in either sex. This suggests that the results obtained during OIRD-mediated reversal via NLX or NLXM are driven by effects within the CPA box and are not influenced by the rewarding properties of fentanyl itself. While previous reports have shown that NLX can be detected centrally after a subcutaneous injection of NLXM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perekopskiy et al., 2020</xref>), we observed no detectable amount of NLX or NLXM in brain tissue of rats that received intravenous NLXM at either dose or time point. Our data demonstrate robust fentanyl-induced neuronal activation in the nTS that appears to be mediated via peripheral MORs. Given the proximity of the nTS to the circumventricular organ area postrema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price et al., 2008</xref>), this raises the possibility that fentanyl can access the central nervous system via the area postrema to influence neuronal activation. However, our data showing the lack of a CPA following NLXM-mediated reversal of OIRD support our biodistribution data showing no NLXM detection in brain samples that the observed effects primarily involve fentanyl actions at MOR located in peripheral sites. Similar to NLX, peripheral MOR antagonism with NLXM has been shown to partially reverse opioid-induced analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewanowitsch and Irvine, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spahn et al., 2017</xref>) which may pose limitations for pain management. While we report no changes in cardiorespiratory parameters from baseline following intravenous administration of NLX or NLXM in drug-naive animals, previous work has shown that high doses of NLX elicit behavioral and physiological changes in humans, including cognitive impairment, nausea, tachycardia, and hypertension, even at low and moderate doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yugar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 1982</xref>). Future investigations are needed to evaluate mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of NLXM as an intervention for managing OIRD in patients with OUDs.</p><p>The nTS is a region with a high degree of MOR expression, and appears to be primarily located on afferent fibers arising from the vagus nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nomura et al., 1996</xref>). While MOR has been shown to be present in nTS somas and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aicher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>), these MOR-expressing cells do not express Fos following exposure to opioids or hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>), which suggests a mechanism of presynaptic action of MOR signaling in the nTS. Likewise, the nodose ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of nTS-projecting vagal sensory afferents, has high expression of MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 1996</xref>), and intra-nodose injection of fentanyl induces hypoventilation, although to a much lesser degree compared to systemic fentanyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we used fiber photometry to characterize nTS neuronal responses to show that fentanyl induces an initial excitatory response in nTS cells.

This prolonged suppression of nTS neuronal activity may contribute to the overall duration of OIRD. Furthermore, our photometry data demonstrate that while the NLXM-mediated reversal of fentanyl-induced inhibition of nTS neurons was slower compared to NLX, activity was eventually restored. A similar finding was observed in OIRD experiments, as NLXM induced a rate of recovery in all parameters that was comparable to NLX. Taken together, this suggests that peripheral MOR antagonism may sufficiently override simultaneous central effects of fentanyl acting at MOR present in cardiorespiratory nuclei, including the nTS.</p><p>It is important to note that while all our experiments assessing fentanyl-induced cardiorespiratory depression were conducted in conscious rats breathing room air, photometry experiments were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Due to the location of the nTS, chronic fiber implantation and subsequent in vivo photometry recordings in conscious, unrestrained animals are not possible. In the nTS, Isoflurane has been reported to suppress visceral afferent glutamatergic transmission and enhance GABAergic transmission via postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters et al., 2008</xref>), as well as induce cFos expression in the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2024</xref>). Precautions were taken to use the lowest dose of isoflurane needed to maintain sufficient anesthesia. However, we cannot rule out the possible influence of isoflurane anesthesia to influence the observed biphasic responses evoked by fentanyl. In addition, sex differences in physiological and pharmacological responses to anesthesia have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mawhinney et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the high attrition rate for these experiments, which require multiple survival surgeries and proper fiber placement into the nTS, we were unable to fully evaluate potential sex differences and cannot rule out the possibility of a sex effect of fentanyl-induced neural activity or in responses to anesthesia. Nevertheless, our data support a mechanism by which fentanyl induces OIRD via disruption of visceral afferent signaling to the nTS, thereby leading to prolonged OIRD due to suppression of physiological reflex responses that would be normally engaged in response to systemic hypoxia.</p><p>The nTS plays an essential role in the regulation of basal- and reflex-evoked cardiorespiratory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andresen and Kunze, 1994</xref>). Activation of MOR in the nTS has been shown to blunt hypoxic ventilatory responses following MOR agonism in the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>). Our data are consistent with previous work demonstrating opioid-induced activation of nTS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>). The degree of fentanyl-induced Fos-IR in the nTS resembles what is observed after acute exposure to hypoxic air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 1981</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed increased Fos in the nTS at a dose of fentanyl that was below the threshold to induce respiratory depression. It is unclear whether the Fos-IR observed after low or high doses of fentanyl is, in part, the result of increased glutamatergic transmission stemming from enhanced chemoreceptor afferent signaling to the nTS or via MOR signaling within the nTS itself.</p><p>Glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter released from sensory afferent fibers into the nTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andresen and Kunze, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Talman et al., 1980</xref>). While intra-nTS application of opioid agonists have been shown to reduce glutamate release and calcium channels via presynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rhim and Miller, 1994</xref>), opioids also have been shown to induce a similar biphasic action of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent spikes in the nodose ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Higashi et al., 1982</xref>) that resembles what we observed in GCaMP-expressing nTS cells after intravenous fentanyl. NLXM strongly attenuated the fentanyl-induced excitatory wave observed in GCaMP-expressing nTS neurons, suggesting that MOR-expressing peripheral afferents mediate this transient activation of nTS neurons, even if the primary effect of fentanyl is to inhibit the nTS and suppress cardiorespiratory reflex function.</p><p>One possibility is that the increase in nTS activity may be mediated by opioid-induced disinhibition within the nTS. The nTS contains a large population of second-order GABAergic interneurons that receive direct inputs from visceral afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>), and hypoxia activates these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 2012</xref>). nTS MOR agonists suppress the activity of these cells, primarily via presynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boxwell et al., 2013</xref>), although postsynaptic mechanisms have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glatzer and Smith, 2005</xref>). Similarly, visceral afferents also activate catecholaminergic nTS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appleyard et al., 2007</xref>), which are critical for the generation of hypoxia-evoked cardiorespiratory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">King et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bathina et al., 2013</xref>). Opioids inhibit visceral afferent transmission to this cell group, primarily via a presynaptic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we observed robust Fos expression in these cells at all doses of fentanyl examined. These findings raise the possibility that nTS dysfunction, via MOR-expressing peripheral inputs that terminate within this region, represents the first central site of fentanyl-induced dysfunction, ultimately leading to downstream effects in other brain regions that contribute to diminished autonomic and cardiorespiratory responses that contribute to the duration of OIRD. Future studies are needed to fully evaluate the exact opioid-MOR effects in the nTS, including specific MOR afferent inputs and the nTS phenotypes, to determine their relative contributions to OIRD.</p><p>In summary, these studies highlight a significant involvement of peripheral MORs contributing to the rapid cardiorespiratory depression induced by intravenous fentanyl. We have provided extensive characterization into how fentanyl elicits cardiorespiratory depression and examined the relationship between peripheral MORs and nTS activity in mediating the duration of OIRD. Moreover, our findings suggest that selectively blocking peripheral opioid receptors could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing OIRD. Notably, peripheral opioid receptor antagonists are already prescribed for patients undergoing chemotherapy to alleviate side effects such as opioid-induced constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Floettmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pergolizzi et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, our data demonstrate that peripheral MOR antagonism appears to reverse OIRD without triggering unwanted effects of withdrawal that occur following NLX administration, suggesting that peripheral MOR antagonists like NLXM could potentially be utilized in treatment strategies for managing patients with OUD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Sprague Dawley, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type Sprague Dawley</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained In House</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RGD_70508">RGD_70508</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male and female rats</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-c-Fos antibody (Rabbit polyclonal) primary antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# ab190289;

Rats were initially group-housed with two to three animals per cage on a 12/12-hr dark/light cycle (lights on at 7:00) and acclimated to the animal facility holding rooms for at least 7 days before any manipulation. Following catheterization surgery, rats were single-housed and remained on an identical 12/12-hr dark/light cycle. The temperature for the holding rooms of all animals ranged from 21 to 24°C while the humidity was between 30 and 70%. Rats received food and water ad libitum for the duration of all experiments. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. For all experiments, male and female Sprague Dawley rats (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:RGD_70508">RGD_70508</ext-link>; 250–350 g) were used. In all datasets, male rats are represented by filled symbols and female rats are represented by open symbols.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Jugular catheterization procedure</title><p>Animals were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane (3% induction, 2% maintenance). A small incision was made in the dorsal surface of the neck. Another small incision was made on the ventral surface of the neck, and underlying tissue was carefully dissected to expose the jugular vein. An indwelling catheter was inserted into the jugular vein and sutured in place using non-absorbable silk suture. The catheter was then tunneled subcutaneously and exited the body through the first small hole in neck on the dorsal side. The ventral incision was closed using non-absorbable silk suture. The exposed catheter was connected to a backpack device (Instech) containing a port for drug administration. Animals were given Carprofen (2 mg/kg sc), Baytril (8 mg/kg sc), and bupivacaine (5 mg/kg, site of incision). In addition, rats were given Carprofen tablets (Bio Serv, MD150-2) for 2 days after surgery to assist in wound healing and analgesia. Rats were singly housed following surgery and were allowed to recover for 1 week prior to random assignment to an experimental group. Catheter patency was maintained with daily flushing of 0.3 ml sterile saline containing gentamicin (1.33 mg/ml, i.v.). Rats with a loss of catheter patency were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Respiratory depression experiments</title><p>Following recovery from IV catheterization surgery, conscious, freely moving rats in their home cages were fitted with a non-invasive pulse oximeter collar (Starr LifeSciences). Cardiorespiratory parameters (oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate) were collected (MouseOx v2.0, Starr LifeSciences) at baseline conditions in animals breathing room air, and after intravenous administration of fentanyl citrate (2, 20, or 50 µg/kg). A subset of animals received weight-adjusted intravenous administration of the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone hydrochloride (NLX; 1 mg/kg; Sigma, Cat#: N7758, CAS: 51481-60-8) or the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide (NLXM; 1 or 5 mg/kg; Sigma, Cat#: N129, CAS: 93302-47-7) before or after fentanyl administration. Cardiorespiratory parameters were then measured for up to 60 min. For all OIRD experiments, the time course graphs consist of 30 s of data averaged into a single data point. The nadir was defined as the lowest point measured after fentanyl administration (for all graphs, red arrow indicates time of fentanyl administration, time = 0 min). In addition, the recovery rate was defined as the time to reach 90% baseline of pre-fentanyl values for each cardiorespiratory parameter. Two hours after fentanyl administration, rats were transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.01 M PBS). Brains were removed and stored overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde for post-fixation, followed by at least 72-hr incubation in sucrose (30% in 0.01 M PBS) solution. Isopentane was used to flash-freeze brains. Brainstem sections containing the nTS were sliced in the coronal plane (40 µm) using a cryostat (Leica CM 1950).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Biodistribution</title><p>A subset of previously catheterized drug-naive rats was deeply anesthetized and then received intravenous administration of NLX (1 mg/kg) or NLXM (1 or 5 mg/kg). While still under anesthesia, rats were quickly decapitated 2 or 10 min after intravenous administration of MOR antagonists. MOR antagonists were dosed in all rats at an experimentally relevant concentration with triplicate blood and brain samples collected at two time points. The early time point at 2 min evaluated conditions when the plasma concentration of the OR antagonist is high and reflects the identical time point of intravenous administration for OIRD pretreatment experiments. The second collection time point (10 min) was intended to evaluate steady-state conditions and represent physiological experiments when reversal of OIRD was achieved by both antagonists. Brains were quickly removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Trunk blood was collected into capillary collection tubes containing lithium heparin (Greiner Bio-One; Fisher Scientific). The blood was spun on a centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C, and plasma was carefully extracted from the supernatant. Brains and plasma samples underwent PK analyses for detection of NLX or NLXM at both time points. Standard rat PK studies dosed the candidate MOR antagonists and sample blood over multiple time points. A general description of tissue distribution can be obtained during PK modeling by calculating the volume of distribution. Samples underwent a direct measurement of peripheral restriction by measuring compound concentration in plasma and brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conditioned place aversion</title><p>The aversive effects following reversal of OIRD were measured using CPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tzschentke, 2007</xref>) using the video tracking system ANY-maze (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_014289">SCR_014289</ext-link>). During a pre-conditioning session (Day 1), rats were allowed to explore both sides of a two compartment CPA box for 15 min. On the Conditioning Day (Day 2), a divider was placed in the middle of the box to restrict movement to one side on the box. Rats were then randomly assigned to one side of the CPA box, and this side was paired with either saline (1 ml/kg), NLX (1 mg/kg), or NLXM (1 or 5 mg/kg). Rats were given intravenous fentanyl (50 µg/kg) or saline in their home cages. Four minutes later, they were placed in the paired side of the box and immediately given saline or an MOR antagonist. Rats were confined to this compartment for 15 min. For all CPA experiments, measures were taken to balance the side of CPA box by drug and by sex. On the post-conditioning test (Day 3), the divider was removed. Rats were then placed in the CPA box and allowed to explore both sides of the CPA box for 15 min. The total time spent in the paired chamber and CPA scores were calculated for all groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Wireless in vivo fiber photometry</title><p>To selectively measure nTS neuronal calcium transient activity, we injected an AAV containing a calcium sensor expressed under the synapsin promoter (pGP-AAV9-syn-jGCaMP8m-WPRE; Addgene viral prep # 162375-AAV9) into the nTS (500 nl per side; 0.3–0.5 mm anterior, ±0.4 mm lateral, and 0.4 mm ventral to brain surface, relative to calamus scriptorius). Rats were allowed at least 3 weeks to recover from nanoinjection surgery to allow for robust viral expression in the nTS before IV catheters were implanted as described above. On the day of the experiment, rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (3–4% induction, 2% maintenance), placed in the stereotaxic apparatus, and the nTS was exposed as described above. To overcome limitations associated with chronic fiber implants in the nTS, a wireless photometry headstage (TeleFipho, Amuza Inc) was secured to a 5 mm flat-tipped silica optic fiber cannula (400 μm c.d./470 μm o.d., NA 0.37, 2.5 mm receptacle; Doric) and mounted the stereotaxic arm with an apparatus 3D printed in house to permit simultaneous nTS exposure and photometry recordings. The optic fiber was lowered to the site of the dorsal brainstem and firmly pressed on the surface above the nTS until a signal was detected (~0.3–0.5 mm ventral from the surface). An LED generated blue light was bandpass-filtered (445–490 nm) to excite jGCaMP8m and emission fluorescence was detected by an internal photodiode detector for green light (bandpass filtered at 500–550 nm). An internal DC amplifier transmitted the data (16-bit arbitrary unit; AU) to a wireless receiver (TeleFipho, Amuza Inc) and the data was extracted in real-time using TeleFipho software (Amuza Inc) at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The offset was set to 90° and the LED power was adjusted to achieve an optimal signal output (30–40 k a.u.) not to exceed 36 mW power, and remained constant throughout the recording. Baseline activity of GCaMP fluorescence nTS-infected cells was measured after at least 5 min to mitigate effects of baseline drift in signal due to slow photobleaching artifacts. Then, baseline activity was measured for at least 30 s prior to administration of either fentanyl (20 µg/kg, i.v.) or NLXM (5 mg/kg, i.v.). After response activity was recorded, rats received a second intravenous injection of either an opioid receptor antagonist (NLX,1 mg/kg or NLXM, 5 mg/kg) or fentanyl (20 µg/kg), respectively. Each intravenous administration was manually time locked to calcium transient recordings by a second experimenter and response activity following each injection was recorded for 60 s before administration of the second injection or conclusion of the experiment. Rats were transcardially perfused with PFA at the end of the experiment as described above and viral expression was validated for all animals.</p><p>For analysis of calcium transient activity, custom MATLAB scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15042135">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15042135</ext-link>) were used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Higginbotham et al., 2025</xref>).

All surgical and experimental procedures were approved by Washington University Committee in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Rats were initially group-housed with two to three animals per cage on a 12/12-hr dark/light cycle (lights on at 7:00) and acclimated to the animal facility holding rooms for at least 7 days before any manipulation. Following catheterization surgery, rats were single-housed and remained on an identical 12/12-hr dark/light cycle. The temperature for the holding rooms of all animals ranged from 21 to 24°C while the humidity was between 30 and 70%. Rats received food and water ad libitum for the duration of all experiments. All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables of baseline, nadir and recovery of cardiorespiratory parameters in male and female rats that received intravenous administration of 20 or 50 µg/kg fentanyl.</title><p>(A) Baseline cardiorespiratory values in rats prior to receiving 20 µg/kg fentanyl.

Its high lipophilicity facilitates rapid absorption and central nervous system penetration, which contributes to the rapid onset of these cardiorespiratory depression. The narrow therapeutic window of fentanyl further emphasizes the critical need for timely intervention when an overdose has occurred, and effective antagonists to reverse respiratory depression and save lives. We have revised the abstract to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Are the doses of fentanyl used in the study (2, 20, or 50 µg/kg IV) relevant to those achieved by fentanyl-exposed human drug users?</p></disp-quote><p>In these studies, we intravenously administered three doses of fentanyl. The human equivalent doses (HED) of 20ug/kg and 50 ug/kg fentanyl are ~3 ug/kg and ~8 ug/kg, respectively. These doses have previously been shown to induce respiratory depression in humans (Dahan et al.,2005).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1, it appeared that only a small fraction of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons expressed cFos in response to fentanyl, and the degree of cFos expression was largely similar across all fentanyl doses tested. Thus, it is unclear whether TH+ neurons play a role in fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, and the value of these data is unclear (see point #6 below also).</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the mean data, the lowest dose of fentanyl, which was below the threshold for inducing OIRD, activated approximately 50% of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) nTS neurons. In contrast, the highest dose of fentanyl resulted in a statistically significant increase, with ~75% of TH+ cells co-expressing Fos-IR.</p><p>We included the assessment of catecholaminergic nTS cells for several reasons. The regions of the nTS evaluated in this study contains high expression of MOR and are the termination points of sensory afferent fibers transmitting cardiorespiratory information to the nTS (Aicher et al., 2000; Furdui et al., 2024). Catecholaminergic cells receive direct excitatory inputs from visceral afferents (Appleyard et al., 2007) and exhibit intensity-dependent increases in Fos-IR in rats exposed to hypoxic air (Kline et al., 2010; King et al., 2012). These neurons are essential for generating appropriate cardiorespiratory responses to hypoxic challenges (Bathina et al., 2013; King et al., 2015). As the reviewer notes, rats exposed to fentanyl exhibit a high degree of Fos-IR in the nTS, including catecholaminergic neurons. Despite the robust fentanyl-induced activation (increased Fos-IR) nTS neurons, yet there appears to be a failure to initiate appropriate chemoreflex-mediated cardiorespiratory responses. Our photometry data further indicate that fentanyl-induced changes in neuronal activity are mediated, in part, by peripheral MOR. Collectively, these findings suggest that fentanyl impacts nTS activity through alterations in peripheral afferent signaling to the nTS, which may contribute to the severity and duration of OIRD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would help with the flow of the paper if the pharmacokinetic data shown in Figure 6 were presented earlier (as part of Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the biodistribution data earlier in the manuscript, now presenting it as Figure 2. The numbering of all subsequent figures has been adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 5, there appears to be a large number of GCaMP-expressing neurons located outside the nTS. To what degree can the changes in calcium signaling, attributed to alterations in neural activity in the nTS, be explained by altered activity of neurons located outside the nTS?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that our viral spread extends beyond the boundaries of the nTS, raising the possibility that the responses observed in Figure 5 may be influenced by neural activity of cells outside the nTS. While some viral spread beyond the target region is unavoidable, calcium transients were measured at the tip of the fiber, which was positioned directly within the nTS.</p><p>To address this concern further, we performed Fos immunohistochemistry in a subset of animals that received bilateral GCaMP virus injections into the nTS. Following fentanyl administration (50 µg/kg IV), brains were collected two hours later. As shown in the accompanying image, we observed Fos-IR co-expression with GCaMP exclusively within the nTS boundaries. No Fos-IR was detected outside the nTS, including in GCaMP cells. Taken together, these findings support our conclusion that the data depicted in our photometry figure (now Figure 6) accurately represent fentanyl-induced activity changes in nTS neurons.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Arrowheads: Fos-negative GCaMP cell; Arrows: Co-labeled Fos/GCaMP cell; Asterisk: Fos+ GCaMP-negative cell.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104469-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Currently, the cFos and photometry data are descriptive in nature. Are opioid-induced changes in nTS neural activity relevant to respiratory depression? If so, one might expect DREADD-mediated stimulation of the nTS neural activity (or stimulating nTS activity by some other means) would reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory depression similar to naloxone and methyl-naloxone.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point regarding the relevance of the nTS in the context of OIRD. The nTS is a major site of integration of sensory afferent information and involved in the initiation of reflex responses that facilitate a return to homeostasis. As described above, we characterized the collective response of nTS neurons to intravenous fentanyl using both Fos immunohistochemistry and fiber photometry. Our data indicate that fentanyl-induced changes in nTS activity are strongly mediated by peripheral MOR. While the suggestion to use global chemogenetic activation of nTS neurons to reverse fentanyl-induced respiratory depression is intriguing, results from these experiments may be difficult to interpret due to the extensive heterogeneity of the nTS. However, we are currently conducting similar experiments using a more selective approach that will allow us to isolate and evaluate specific nTS phenotypes to better understand their contributions to OIRD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Are peripherally restricted mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists available?

However, while the data is not powered for the distinction of sex differences, there appears to be a bi-modal distribution of the individual data points that likely correspond to sex across most experiments. For example, in Figure 2E there are both color and clear dots, which this reviewer assumes indicates sex (however, this wasn't easily apparent if it was commented on at all in the paper). If you look at the saline oxygen saturation (nadir) levels (2e), there is wide variability with the red-filled circles, but not the clear ones. This may indicate a bimodal distribution (and may be related to the baseline HR sex differences highlighted). This is also the case in Figure 2L but is perhaps more obvious in the CPA score data (Figure 4d), where it seems the nlx negative CPA effects were likely driven primarily by one sex. While this reviewer does not expect a full powering of experiments for sex differences (and also is very appreciative of the inclusion of both sexes), full raw data with sex indicated included in the supplemental data would greatly aid the field in general and allow for those with a specific interest in this area to build upon this data. Additionally, further discussion regarding the potential role of sex differences in the translational value of these findings is also warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>For all bar graphs, open symbols represent females and filled symbols represent males. This information can be found in the first paragraph of the Materials and Methods section. We have also added this information to each figure for increased visibility. We appreciate the acknowledgement of our inclusion of both sexes. For all experiments, we attempted to balance by sex. Unfortunately, we occasionally had to exclude animals for technical reasons (with clogged catheters being the most common reason for exclusion). This sometimes led to an imbalance in sex in some groups, as the reviewer has noted. In the graph of oxygen saturation nadir values in Fig 2E now Fig 3E in the revised manuscript, all animals received intravenous fentanyl at a dose of 20 ug/kg. The reviewer is correct that there is greater variability in the males (filled symbols) compared to the females (open symbols) in this graph. However, this variability in the distribution was not observed in Fig 1E or Fig 4E, in which male and female rats received an identical dose of 20 ug/kg. Taking this into account, our overall interpretation of the data is that there is relatively minor sex difference in the responses observed after intravenous fentanyl, and the variability in Fig 3E is primarily due to a lower n compared to Fig 1E.</p><p>All raw data will be uploaded to a data repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Page 7, line 209: Figure 5D should be Figure 6D.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Page 8, line 267: Cure should be Curve.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Discussion: Page10, line322 states that &quot;no detectable NLX ... was found in brain tissue&quot;.

As demonstrated in the biodistribution figure (now Figure 2 in the manuscript), our data demonstrate that an intravenous injection of NLXM did not result in NLX formation in the brain. We have reworked the sentence for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) jGCaMP injections: Figure 5B/c shows the distribution of the gcamp across animals. The optic fiber is placed directly over the NTs. However, how are we certain there isn't a nearby nuclei/structure outside the NTS that is contributing to the photometry data presented in D-G?</p></disp-quote><p>See our above comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Fiber Photometry and Sex: These studies unfortunately may have had only 1 of a sex included in the fiber photometry data. While the inclusion is overall good, the single value for a sex suggests that there are differences, given the clustering of the data. While the anesthesia may be driving this potential sex effect, it is not clear based on the data presented.

While we made every attempt to balance for sex across all experiments, we unfortunately had to exclude some animals for technical reasons (clogged catheter, missed injection site, etc). This produced an imbalance in our photometry studies and did not allow us to thoroughly evaluate sex differences in fentanyl-induced changes in neural activity or in the responses to anesthesia. We have expanded on this limitation in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 5 - the bars are not the color indicated by the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this in the figure.
