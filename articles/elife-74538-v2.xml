to cargos via adaptor proteins. While ~40 kinesins transport cargo toward the plus end of microtubules, a single dynein moves cargo in the opposite direction. How dynein transports a wide variety of cargos remains an open question. The FTS–Hook–FHIP (‘FHF’) cargo adaptor complex links dynein to cargo in humans and fungi. As human cells have three Hooks and four FHIP proteins, we hypothesized that the combinatorial assembly of different Hook and FHIP proteins could underlie dynein cargo diversity. Using proteomic approaches, we determine the protein ‘interactome’ of each FHIP protein. Live-cell imaging and biochemical approaches show that different FHF complexes associate with distinct motile cargos. These complexes also move with dynein and its cofactor dynactin in single-molecule in vitro reconstitution assays. Complexes composed of FTS, FHIP1B, and Hook1/Hook3 colocalize with Rab5-tagged early endosomes via a direct interaction between FHIP1B and GTP-bound Rab5. In contrast, complexes composed of FTS, FHIP2A, and Hook2 colocalize with Rab1A-tagged ER-to-Golgi cargos and FHIP2A is involved in the motility of Rab1A tubules. Our findings suggest that combinatorial assembly of different FTS–Hook–FHIP complexes is one mechanism dynein uses to achieve cargo specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>Rab5</kwd><kwd>Rab1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM141825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99GM140269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>Jenna R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-18-190-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kendrick</surname><given-names>Agnieszka A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combinatorial assembly of different adaptor complexes is a mechanism that dynein uses to interact with multiple cargos.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper positioning of intracellular material in space and time is crucial for many cellular processes including cell division, cell signaling, and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burute and Kapitein, 2019</xref>). Long distance transport occurs primarily on polarized microtubule tracks by the motors, dynein and kinesin. While kinesin motors transport cargo predominantly toward the ‘plus’ end of microtubules, cytoplasmic dynein-1 (‘dynein’ here) transports cargo toward the ‘minus’ end of microtubules. In mammalian cells, kinesin and dynein are responsible for transporting many diverse cargos including membrane-bound organelles, mRNAs, and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). The expansion of the kinesin family of motors within the animal kingdom itself reflects this necessity—the presence of many distinct motors promotes the specialized delivery of many different cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollmar and Mühlhausen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Welburn, 2013</xref>). Similarly, dynein adaptors have expanded in animal cells. In many organisms, processive dynein motility requires the dynactin complex and a coiled-coil activating adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). There are ~20 known or candidate activating adaptors in human cells, several of which have been implicated in linking dynein to different cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, how activating adaptors link dynein to its cargo is only known in a few cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>).

Both the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> HookA and FtsA proteins require FhipA to associate with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the FHIP protein mediates cargo recognition and binding. FTS is a member of the family of inactive E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variants with varying biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), whose role in the FHF complex remains unclear. Human cells have one FTS, three Hooks (Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3), and four FHIPs (FHIP1A, FHIP1B, FHIP2A, and FHIP2B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We hypothesize that gene expansion and functional divergence of the Hook and FHIP families of proteins may result in the formation of different FHF complexes, allowing dynein to bind multiple cargos in human cells.</p><p>The exact composition of the FHF complex and whether multiple distinct FHF complexes form remains unclear. FHIP1A (also known as FHIP-L and FAM160A1) and FHIP1B (also known as FHIP, p107<sup>FHIP</sup>, and FAM160A2) are the most well-characterized FHIP proteins. The initially described ‘FHF’ complex was identified by immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry (MS) of FTS in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), and was found to contain FHIP1B, FTS, Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3. Further studies confirmed a similar FHF complex composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>) and found that FHIP1A binds FTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattera et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that it may also be an FHF complex component. However, very little is known about FHIP2A (also known as FAM160B1) and FHIP2B (also FAM160B2), and whether they also associate with FTS and/or Hook proteins. FHIP2A and FHIP2B were identified in Hook1 and Hook3 proteomic datasets previously generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting they may also be FHF complex components.</p><p>Several studies have provided insight into the cellular roles of the FHF complex. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, the sole FHF complex links dynein to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). In human cells, the only characterized FHF complex (FTS, Hook1/2/3, and FHIP1B) has several proposed functions. This FHF complex has been shown to associate with homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex components and may be involved in late endosome/lysosome clustering and epidermal growth factor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). In rat hippocampal neurons, an FHF complex of similar composition has been demonstrated to bind Rab5A and is involved in the retrograde axonal transport of transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a similar FHF complex has also been demonstrated to link dynein to the AP-4 adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattera et al., 2020</xref>). However, very little is known about the roles of FHIP2A and FHIP2B, whether they are associated with distinct FHF complexes, and whether they are also involved in linking dynein to specific intracellular cargos.</p><p>Here, we use the FHF complex as a model cargo adaptor system to understand how dynein achieves cargo specificity. We identify and characterize the different human FHF complexes using proximity-dependent biotinylation, MS, and immunoprecipitations, and show in single-molecule motility assays using purified components that moving dynein/dynactin complexes associate with different FHF complexes. We also show that in cells FHF complexes containing Hook1 and/or Hook3 and FHIP1B associate with Rab5B endosomes, while complexes containing Hook2 and FHIP2A associate with Rab1A-tagged ER-to-Golgi cargos. Furthermore, FHIP1B and FHIP2A are important for the formation and movement of their corresponding cargos. Taken together, our data provide a mechanistic understanding of how a single dynein complex transports numerous cellular components.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FHIP BioID protein interactomes</title><p>To elucidate the cellular roles of the FHIP proteins, we first identified the protein ‘interactome’ of each FHIP in 293T cells. To do this, we used a proximity biotinylation (BioID) approach in which the carboxy-terminus of each of the four FHIP proteins was tagged with a promiscuous biotin ligase BioID2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roux et al., 2012</xref>).

For each BioID experiment, we grew the FHIP-BioID2-expressing cell line in doxycycline and biotin-containing media for 16 hours. We then collected cells and performed a streptavidin immunoprecipitation of the biotinylated proteins and identified protein interactomes via MS. Significant protein ‘hits’ were determined using a label-free proteomics approach by comparison to the cytoplasmic BioID2 control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).

For example, endosome-associated proteins were enriched in the FHIP1A and FHIP1B datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – blue circles), consistent with their previously identified endosomal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2014</xref>).

Though we identified Rab5B as a significant hit in the FHIP1B dataset, we found no HOPS complex components in any of our FHIP datasets.</p><p>In contrast, the interactomes of FHIP2A and FHIP2B were highly enriched for Golgi-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – green circles). Additionally, multiple proteins involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport (TBC1D23, FAM91A1, GOLGA4, GOLGA5, and WDR11) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi transport (SCFD1, SEC22B, SEC24B, BET1, BET1L, STX5, GOSR1, and GOSR2) were found in either the FHIP2A or both the FHIP2A and FHIP2B datasets, but not in the FHIP1A or FHIP1B datasets. Although there was some overlap between the FHIP2A and FHIP2B datasets, we also observed a high level of enrichment for mitochondria-associated proteins specifically in the FHIP2B interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – orange circles).</p><p>We also found some cytoskeletal components enriched in the different FHIP BioID datasets. The FHIP1B dataset had multiple actomyosin-associated proteins, while the FHIP1A, FHIP2A, and FHIP2B datasets had many kinesin hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We did not further explore these potential kinesin interactions, but this will be an important area for future work as many cellular cargos move bidirectionally. Finally, comparative analysis of each FHIP BioID interactome with each Hook BioID interactome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>) showed modest overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Because BioID is a proximity-dependent approach this lack of substantial overlap was not surprising and supports the idea that FHIP proteins are the most cargo-proximal components of the FHF complex. Taken together, our BioID data show that different FHIP proteins associate with diverse cellular interactomes, suggesting that these proteins may link to different cellular cargos.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Different FHIP proteins interact with different Hooks</title><p>The FHIP BioID datasets demonstrate that the FHIP proteins associate with different Hook proteins.

While Hook2 activates organelle motility in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dwivedi et al., 2019</xref>), Hook2 has not been shown to activate dynein motility in vitro.

We then used lentiviral expression vectors to reintroduce a fluorescently tagged version of FHIP1B or FHIP2A (FHIP1B- or FHIP2A-TagRFP-T-V5) in the corresponding knockout cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

However, the morphologies of these cargos were distinct.

GDP-bound Rabs are present in the cytosol in an inactive form, while GTP-bound Rabs associate with membranous structures and ‘effector’ proteins that in some cases link Rabs to motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pylypenko et al., 2018</xref>). In mammalian cells, there are three different Rab5 isoforms (Rab5A, Rab5B, and Rab5C). FHIP1B has previously been proposed to be an effector protein for Rab5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we tested if purified FHIP1B directly interacts with purified Rab5B, as Rab5B was detected in our BioID FHIP1B dataset. To do this we mixed purified Rab5B tagged at the amino-terminus with 6xHis and carboxy-terminus with SNAP-tag with purified FHIP1B in the presence of GDP or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPNP and performed pull-down experiments with Ni-NTA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We found that GMPPNP-bound Rab5B bound FHIP1B to a higher extent as compared to GDP-bound Rab5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that FHIP1B binds to membrane-bound Rab5B.</p><p>We also tested if FHIP1B associates with other Rab GTPases. We expressed 13 GFP-tagged Rab proteins (Rab1A, 2, 3A, 4A, 5B, 6A, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 18) in 293T cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS. FHIP1B coimmunoprecipitated with Rab5B, as expected, but we did not detect an interaction with any of the 12 other Rab GTPases tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, these data show that FHIP1B is a Rab5-specific effector.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>FHIP2A associates with Rab1A-bound ER-to-Golgi tubular intermediates</title><p>Both the FHIP2A and FHIP2B BioID datasets had many protein hits corresponding to Golgi-related processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Several proteins involved in endosome-to-TGN trafficking were found in both the FHIP2A and FHIP2B BioID datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether FHIP2A was involved in endosome-to-TGN transport by expressing known GFP-tagged endosome-to-TGN transport proteins in our FHIP2A KO cells expressing FHIP2A-TagRFP-T. We found that the GFP-tagged golgin GOLGA4 colocalized with a population of FHIP2A at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Endosome-to-TGN transport protein TBC1D23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) colocalized with FHIP2A at the Golgi apparatus as well, but neither GOLGA4 nor TBC1D23 colocalized with motile FHIP2A tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that FHIP2A was not involved in endosome-to-Golgi transport.</p><p>Many proteins known to be involved in ER-to-Golgi transport were found exclusively in the FHIP2A, but not the FHIP2B BioID dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether FHIP2A was associated with ER-to-Golgi transport. To do this, we expressed a GFP-tagged glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) in FHIP2A KO cells expressing FHIP2A-TagRFP-T to determine if VSV-G colocalized with FHIP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Presley et al., 1997</xref>). VSV-G is a temperature-sensitive cargo that becomes trapped in the ER when cells are grown at 40°C. Upon a temperature shift to 32°C, VSV-G is transported from the ER to the Golgi and from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. We incubated cells at 40°C and after 12 hr, shifted the cells to 32°C and began imaging. We observed two primary subsets of GFP-VSV-G cargo. The first subset of cargo consisted of tubules that moved in both the anterograde and retrograde direction, and likely represent ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Tekaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Presley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sannerud et al., 2006</xref>). These tubules were colocalized with FHIP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> #1, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). The second subset of VSV-G cargo were very bright, long tubules that moved directly from the Golgi to the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). These tubules represent transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and were not colocalized with FHIP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> #2, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that FHIP2A is specifically associated with the ER-to-Golgi stage of VSV-G transport. We further tested whether FHIP2A was associated with ER-to-Golgi transport by expressing GFP-tagged ER-to-Golgi proteins identified in our BioID dataset in FHIP2A KO cells expressing FHIP2A-TagRFP-T. We found that FHIP2A colocalized with GMAP210, SCFD1, and BET1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), further confirming that FHIP2A is involved in ER-to-Golgi transport.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>FHIP2A and Hook2 colocalize with Rab1A-associated ER-to-Golgi tubular intermediates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fold-enrichment over cytoplasmic BioID2 control (grayscale intensity) and p value (circle size) for selected known ER-to-Golgi proteins identified in the indicated FHIP BioID2 datasets.

Here, working with pure recombinant proteins, we showed that the interaction between Rab5 and FHIP1B is direct. We also found that Hook2 links to Rab1A via FHIP2A. However, the Rab1A-FHIP2A interaction is likely indirect, as Rab1A was not present in our FHIP2A BioID dataset and we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate FHIP2A with Rab1A. Therefore, there are likely other intermediate protein(s) between FHIP2A and Rab1A that will be of interest for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Combinatorial assembly leads to the formation of distinct FHF complexes</title><p>Although the initial discovery of the FHF complex suggested formation of a single complex composed of Hook proteins, FTS, and FHIP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), our work shows that different FHF complexes exist in cells and in vitro. Specifically, we find that Hook1 and Hook3 are found in complexes containing FHIP1B, while Hook2 predominantly interacts with complexes containing FHIP2A. Our findings are further supported by studies showing that distinct Hook proteins exhibit different cellular localizations and functions, possibly due to their interactions with different FHIP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dwivedi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olenick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2008</xref>).

In our experimental conditions, the formation of these complexes did not significantly affect dynein’s motile properties. Our reconstitution of complexes containing Hook2 are the first to demonstrate that Hook2 is a bona fide dynein activating adaptor. Interestingly, Hook2 seems to be more dependent on Lis1 to form activated dynein/dynactin complexes compared to complexes formed with Hook3. An important future direction will be to determine the stoichiometries of these complexes and if the addition of cargo to moving dynein/dynactin/FHF complexes affects dynein’s motile properties.</p><p>FHIP proteins are likely the most cargo-proximal adaptors in the FHF complex.

Specifically, we find that FHIP1B colocalizes with Rab5B-marked early endosomes by directly interacting with GTP-bound Rab5B. Furthermore, FHIP1B overexpression results in an accumulation of early endosomes at the centrosome. FHIP1B has been previously shown to associate with GTP-locked Rab5A via coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).

Though we see FHIP1B association with nearly every Rab5B-marked early endosome, it is possible that FHF complexes containing FHIP1B/Hook1 may interact with a different subpopulation of endosomes from FHF complexes containing FHIP1B/Hook3. In agreement with this hypothesis, Hook1, but not Hook3 was previously shown to colocalize with a subpopulation of Rab5-marked endosomes and regulate TrkB-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-signaling endosomes in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olenick et al., 2019</xref>).

To prepare the Alt-R crRNA and Alt-R tracrRNA duplex, reconstituted oligos (100 μM) were mixed at equimolar concentrations in sterile PCR water and annealed at 95°C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. To generate knockouts 70–80% confluent U2OS cells were reverse cotransfected with 200 ng of pX459 vector and gene-specific crRNA–tracrRNA duplexes (10 nM) diluted in OptiMEM (Gibco) and combined with RNAimax reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, cells were dislodged with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA and resuspended in DMEM medium. Cells were mixed with transfection complexes and plated into a 6-well plate to a final concertation of 0.64 million cells/well. Forty-eight-hour post-transfection, the cells were pulsed with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 24 hr to allow selection of pX459-transfected cells. Following puromycin selection and recovery in DMEM without puromycin, single-cell clones were plated in 96-well format by limiting dilution and cultured to allow single colonies to grow out. Clones were expanded to 12-well plates, and samples of resulting clones were screened via immunoblotting with gene-specific antibodies for FHIP1B (Abcam, FAM160A2 rabbit monoclonal, Cat #: EPR13604) and FHIP2A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FAM160B1 rabbit polyclonal, Cat #: PA560442).

Slice label information was removed, cells were saved as separate files, and file names were blinded using the Blind Analysis Tools macro. For each cell, the number of motile tubules present during the 1-min movie was then quantified manually using the multipoint tool. In order for a tubule to be counted, it had to move from its initial location and be more than 1 μm long at some point during its motility. Tubules that did not move from their original location and puncta shorter than 1 μm were not counted. Quantification of the percentage of cells with five or more motile tubules was performed similarly, except that cells were selected and blinded and quantifications tallied from both 488 (GFP or EGFP-Rab1A) and 561 (FHIP2A-TagRFPT) channels. Tubule length was quantified by measuring the length of each motile tubule identified in the above analysis at its longest point using FIJI.

The <italic>xy</italic> position of the stage was controlled by ProScan linear motor stage controller (Prior). The microscope was equipped with an MLC400B laser launch (Agilent) equipped with 405 nm (30 mW), 488 nm (90 mW), 561 nm (90 mW), and 640 nm (170 mW) laser lines. The excitation and emission paths were filtered using appropriate single bandpass filter cubes (Chroma). The emitted signals were detected with an electron multiplying CCD camera (Andor Technology, iXon Ultra 888). Illumination and image acquisition were controlled by NIS Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon).</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Single-molecule motility assays</title><p>Single-molecule motility assays were performed in flow chambers assembled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Case et al., 1997</xref>) using the TIRF microscopy setup described above. Biotinylated and PEGylated coverslips (microsurfaces) were used to reduce nonspecific binding. Microtubules were polymerized from tubulin prepared from bovine brain as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waterman-Storer, 2001</xref>). Microtubules contained ~10% biotin-tubulin for attachment to streptavidin-coated cover slip and ~10% Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) tubulin for visualization. Imaging buffer was DLB supplemented with 20 µM taxol, 1 mg/ml casein, 1 mM Mg-ATP, 71.5 mM βME (beta mercaptoethanol) and an oxygen scavenger system, 0.4% glucose, 45 μg/ml glucose catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.15 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were recorded every 0.4 s for 3 min. Movies showing significant drift were not analyzed.</p><p>All movies were collected in two-color setup with the following protein concentrations: 125 pM TMR-dynein, 250 pM unlabeled dynactin, 9 nM Hook3 or Hook2, 450 nM FTS, 450 nM FHIP1B (FHIP1B-HaloTag-Alexa660), or 450 nM FHIP2A (FHIP2A-HaloTag-Alexa660). All experiments performed with Hook2, unless otherwise stated, also included 15 nM Lis1. For conditions missing one of the indicated protein components, corresponding matching buffers were used. The FHF complexes composed of FTS, Hook2 or Hook3, and FHIP1B or FHIP2A samples were incubated on ice for 10 min prior to dynein and dynactin addition. Each protein mixture was then incubated on ice for an additional 5 min following Lis1 addition and an additional 5 min incubation on ice prior to TIRF imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>TIRF data analysis</title><p>The velocity of moving particles was calculated form kymographs generated in ImageJ as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). Velocities were only calculated from molecules that moved processively for greater than five frames. Nonmotile or diffusive events were not considered in velocity calculations. Processive events were defined as events that move unidirectionally and do not exhibit directional changes greater than 600 nm. Diffusive events were defined as events that exhibit at least one bidirectional movement greater than 600 nm in each direction. Single-molecule movements that change apparent behavior (e.g., shift from nonmotile to processive) were considered as multivelocity events and counted as multiple events. For run length analysis, the length of each track in a multivelocity event was combined to calculate the total run length. Landing rates were calculated by counting the number of processive events that start after the first frame and end before the last frame of each movie and dividing this number by the microtubule length and total movie time. Pausing frequencies were calculated by counting the total number of pauses in multivelocity events and dividing this number by the total run length. Colocalization events were manually scored in kymographs. Two-color partially colocalized processive events were counted as colocalized events.</p><p>Data visualization and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (9.2; GraphPad Software), Excel (version 16.52; Microsoft), and ImageJ (2.0). Brightness and contrast were adjusted in Image J for all videos and kymographs. The exact value of <italic>n</italic>, evaluation of statistical significance, and the specific statistical analysis are described in the corresponding figures and figure legends. All experiments were analyzed from at least three independent replicates and cumulative data are shown in each figure, unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro binding assay</title><p>Direct binding between Rab5B and FHIP1B was assessed by incubating 15 μM 6xHis-SNAP-Rab5B with 25-molar excess of GMP-PNP (Abcam) or GPD (Abcam) in nucleotide buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA) overnight at 4°C. The next day, reactions were supplemented with 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and nucleotide-bound 6xHis-SNAP-Rab5B was diluted to 5 μM in Ni-binding buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.1% casein). 6xHis-SNAP-Rab5B was then captured onto 20 μl Dynabeads His-Tag Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and washed three times in Ni-binding buffer in 2 ml Protein Lo Bind Tubes (Eppendorf). Bead conjugated 6xHis-SNAP-Rab5B was incubated for 15 min in room temperature with gentle agitation. The beads were then washed three times with Ni-binding buffer and 250 nM FHIP1B-HaloTag diluted in modified Ni-binding buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% casein) was added to the beads. FHIP1B-HaloTag-conjugated bead complexes were gently shaken for 30 min at room temperature following three washes with 1 ml Ni-binding buffer. FHIP1B-HaloTag was eluted of the beads by applying 30 μl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 0.01% NP-40) and 10-min incubation at room temperature.

In this manuscript, Christensen et al., provide a novel mechanism by which dynein's cargo specificity can be achieved. Using the cargo adaptor complex Fts-Hook-FHIP as a model system, the authors employ a BioID approach to determine the interactome of all FHIPs. They identify that FHIP1B and FHIP2A preferentially bind Hook1/Hook3 and Hook2, respectively. Addition of either Fts-Hook3-FHIP1B or Fts-Hook2-FHIP2A activates dynein in motility assays in vitro. Importantly, these distinct FHF complexes also associate with non-overlapping, dynein-driven motile cargo: FHIP1B binds endosomal proteins whereas FHIP2A acts in ER-to-Golgi Rab1-tubule transport.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This manuscript reads well, and the claims are justified by mostly well-controlled experiments. Analysis of top BioID hits is followed up by an extensive array of validation techniques, including immunoprecipitation, live cell imaging and direct binding in vitro. Together, this makes a convincing case for FHIP1B and FHIP2A's preferential binding for different Hooks and cargo proteins. In addition, they show that Hook2 can activate dynein, adding to a growing list of dynein activating adaptors. The datasets generated here will also be a very useful resource for scientists looking to investigate the molecular basis for other adaptor-cargo links revealed by this study.</p><p>A weakness of the study</p><p>The authors conclude that Fts and FHIP do not/minimally alter properties of dynein movement. However, this is based on the comparison of full-length Hook and FHF – and we note that the velocities in these experiments are slower than previously reported. We also question whether full-length Hook in the absence of Fts-FHIP behaves as a single molecule.</p><p>In lines 293-294 the authors state: &quot;The colocalization of these FHF complexes with moving dynein/dynactin had no effect or only minimal effects on dynein's motile properties including velocity, landing rates, and pausing frequencies.&quot; To ensure the validity of this conclusion, the authors may want to test whether all components in their TIRF assay are single molecules. Our own preparations of full-length Hook2 and Hook3 have consistently eluted in the void volume of gel filtration columns, showing a propensity to aggregate. We suggest the authors revise their single molecule experiments by following one or more of these suggestions:</p><p>1) Performing a sizing step as the last stage of their Hook purifications (SEC/or centrifugal gradients).</p><p>2) Tagging Hook with a SNAP or Halo tag to allow labelling and intensity/co-localisation measurements of this adaptor in TIRF.</p><p>3) Co-expressing Fts, Hook and FHIP. This helped us circumvent the heterogeneity we were observing with isolated full-length Hook, giving monodisperse and stoichiometric FHF complex. This has the added advantage of minimising the addition of Fts-FHIP sub-complexes to the TIRF assay.</p><p>The average velocities also appear lower than previously published work with truncated and full-length adaptors (Kendrick et al., 2019; Urnavicius et al., 2018). Can the authors explain the reasons why? Are these differences significant? In addition to the revisions suggested above, the authors should consider including a positive control (e.g. DDtruncatedHook3) to allow a direct comparison within this study.</p><p>Lines 296-298 state that: &quot;Although run lengths increased slightly for FTS, Hook2, FHIP2A complexes (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2E), run lengths for FTS, Hook3, FHIP1B complexes remained unchanged (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3F).&quot; However, in my view these conditions cannot be compared as the Hook3 experiments have omitted Lis1. Based on previous results and our attempts, Lis1 increases complex formation and is also likely to have an impact on the numbers of motors recruited. Adding Lis1 across all samples will allow a more robust comparison of velocity, run lengths and landing rate between Hook2 and Hook3 containing dynein complexes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Christensen, Kendrick et al. investigate dynein-mediated intracellular transport of various cargos via different combinations of Hook and FHIP proteins. By applying proximity biotinylation (BioID) of FHIP in combination with mass spectrometry, they find that FHIP proteins selectively interact with marker proteins of different membrane-bound intracellular compartments. In particular, the authors highlight the following interactions: (1) FHIP1A and FHIP1B interact with endosomal marker proteins, (2) FHIP2A interacts with Golgi markers, and (3) FHIP2B interacts with both Golgi and mitochondrial marker proteins.</p><p>They further validate selectivity for interactions between FHIP and Hook proteins by co- immunoprecipitation from mammalian cell lines and focus on the partner complexes of: (1) Hook3 and FHIP1B and (2) Hook 2 and FHIP2A. The validate these interactions through co-immunoprecipitation assays and live-cell imaging. These experiments indicate that: (1) FHIP1B interacts with GTP-bound Rab5 to mediate the transport of early endosomes and (2) FHIP2A colocalizes with Rab1A-bound ER-to-Golgi tubular intermediates. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitations do not show an interaction between FHIP2A and Rab1A. In addition, consistent with the idea that FHIPs confer cargo specificity, in in vitro reconstitution of motility experiments, FHIPs colocalize with motile dynein complexes, but do not alter motor properties like speed and landing rate.</p><p>This paper provides an important finding that combinations of adapters function to selectively load different vesicular cargos onto dynein motors. The BioID datasets provide a valuable resource for further studies that will broaden the repertoire of membrane-bound intracellular compartments and dynein adapters, opening the door to many future investigations. The data support the conclusions of the paper and are technically rigorous.</p><p>Major/conceptual points:</p><p>1) In the Figure 3 kymographs, the addition of FTS and FHIPs looks like it increases the number of bidirectional (jiggly) runs. Please quantify number per length of microtubule and run length. If not, that is fine. If so, it might indicate a more nuanced cargo loading effect.</p><p>2) In Figure 4C-F, please show endogenous FHIP staining or rationale why it is not shown. The authors state in the same paragraph that they have validated antibodies (by Western blot, in Figure 4B). I assume they do not work well for staining. If so, that is fine, but please add one sentence that using tagged proteins is not as reliable as staining for endogenous localization due to possible overexpression (and therefore sometimes mislocalization).</p><p>3) In the schematic in Figure 8, I anticipate that some readers will be confused by the placement of the centrosome in between the ER and Golgi, because generally we think of ER to Golgi transport as progressing from proximal to distal (relative to the nucleus). Since the centrosome is perinuclear, it often looks like it's on the nucleus in a max projection / 2D image, but I understand this might be confusing in a cartoon (which could be misinterpreted as being inside the nucleus).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Recent years have seen rapid progress in our understanding of how autoinhibited cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) is turned into a highly processive motor. A central role is played by cargo adaptor proteins, which bring dynein together with its activator dynactin. What is much less understood is how these so-called activating adaptors link the dynein-dynactin transport machine to its diverse cargo. Christensen, Kendrick, and colleagues provide insight into this problem by characterizing FHIP proteins, which are known to form &quot;FHF&quot; complexes with adaptors of the Hook family and a protein called FTS. To understand the cellular roles of the 4 human FHIP paralogs, the authors first determine the FHIP interactomes using proximity biotinylation in HEK293 cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that FHIP1A/B preferentially associate with endosomal proteins, while FHIP2A/B preferentially associate with proteins implicated in Golgi-related processes. Moreover, the interactome analysis suggests specific pairings exist between FHIP proteins and Hook adaptors, which is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments: FHIP1A/B form FHF complexes with Hook1 and 3, while FHIP2A interacts predominantly with Hook2. in vitro reconstitution of dynein-dynactin-FHF complexes and single-molecule motility assays with fluorescently labelled dynein and FHIP establish that FHIP2A-Hook2 and FHIP1B-Hook3 co-localize with processively moving dynein on microtubules, and that the presence of FHIP/FTS does not appreciably alter dynein's motile properties. To examine the role of FHIP1B and FHIP2A in cargo transport, the endogenous proteins are knocked out in U2OS cells and replaced by transgene-encoded fluorescent versions, which are imaged by spinning disk confocal microscopy. This shows that (overexpressed) FHIP1B and FHIP2A are present on motile compartments with a punctate and tubular morphology, respectively. FHIP1B (but not FHIP2A) co-localizes with Rab5A/B, co-immunoprecipitates with GTP-bound (&quot;active&quot;) Rab5B, and does not associate with any of the 12 other Rab family members that are tested. This reveals FHIP1B as a Rab5-specific effector. On the other hand, co-localization experiments with VSV-G and proteins from the BioID dataset suggest that FHIP2A is involved in ER-to-Golgi transport. A visual screen of small GTPases associated with the ER or Golgi shows that Rab1A co-localizes with FHIP2A and Hook2. The authors do not find biochemical evidence that FHIP2A and Rab1A associate with one another, but two experiments suggest a functional link: overexpression of GDP-bound Rab1A decreases the number of mobile tubules marked by Rab1A or FHIP2A, and overexpression of transgene-encoded FHIP2A in the FHIP2A knock-out cell line rescues the decrease in motile Rab1A-marked tubules. The authors conclude that an FHF complex containing FHIP2A and Hook2 recruits dynein to ER-to-Golgi tubular transport intermediates.</p><p>This is a study of high technical quality that offers significant novel insight into the composition and function of FHF complexes. Through complementary approaches, the authors convincingly demonstrate that FHF complexes of distinct composition recruit dynein to specific cargo via membrane-bound Rab GTPases. These results therefore help explain how the single dynein motor can be selectively recruited to so many different types of cargo, which is an important unresolved question. The study focuses mostly on FHIP1B and FHIP2A, which leaves functional characterization of the other two FHIP proteins for the future. Also, while centrosomal clustering of Rab5-marked organelles in cells overexpressing FHIP1B suggests that FHIP1B promotes dynein-mediated early endosome transport, whether FHIP1B loss affects early endosome distribution has not been examined. Thus, while co-localization and biochemical data demonstrate that FHIP1B is a Rab5 effector, the functional implications of this interaction remain to be fully explored.</p><p>Given the already large number of technically sound experiments that support the authors' conclusions, I only have a single suggestion for an additional experiment.</p><p>Suggested (optional) experiment:</p><p>Examine the distribution/motility of Rab5-marked cargo in FHIP1B knock-out cells. This would complement the corresponding analysis of Rab1A-marked cargo in FHIP2A knock-out cells and would strengthen the functional link between FHIP1B and early endosome transport.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74538.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] In lines 293-294 the authors state: &quot;The colocalization of these FHF complexes with moving dynein/dynactin had no effect or only minimal effects on dynein's motile properties including velocity, landing rates, and pausing frequencies.&quot; To ensure the validity of this conclusion, the authors may want to test whether all components in their TIRF assay are single molecules.

Performing these experiments for the current manuscript would be a substantial undertaking, as it will require us to re-express and purify Hook2 and Hook3 proteins and/or clone, co-express and co-purify FTS, FHIP and Hook proteins, as well as repeat all of the motility assays described in Figure 3. These experiments would significantly extend our revision timeline beyond the suggested two months and would not change the main conclusions of our work, which shows that different FHF complexes form in cells and in vitro and that dynein, dynactin, FTS and the different Hook and FHIP proteins are sufficient to form motile complexes.
