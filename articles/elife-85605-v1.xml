As <italic>Leishmania</italic> lack a functional non-homologous DNA end joining pathway however, obtaining null mutants typically requires additional donor DNA, selection of drug resistance-associated edits or time-consuming isolation of clones. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens across different conditions and across multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species are therefore unfeasible at present. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editor (CBE) toolbox that overcomes these limitations. We employed CBEs in <italic>Leishmania</italic> to introduce STOP codons by converting cytosine into thymine and created <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net/">http://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link> for CBE primer design in kinetoplastids. Through reporter assays and by targeting single- and multi-copy genes in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic>, <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and <italic>L. infantum</italic>, we demonstrate how this tool can efficiently generate functional null mutants by expressing just one single-guide RNA, reaching up to 100% editing rate in non-clonal populations. We then generated a <italic>Leishmania</italic>-optimised CBE and successfully targeted an essential gene in a plasmid library delivered loss-of-function screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. Since our method does not require DNA double-strand breaks, homologous recombination, donor DNA, or isolation of clones, we believe that this enables for the first time functional genetic screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic> via delivery of plasmid libraries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>cytosine base editor</kwd><kwd>loss-of-function screening</kwd><kwd>LeishBASEedit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 727-2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beneke</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP2332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-473-416.13/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NUM Organostrat</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LeishBASEedit enables gene editing in <italic>Leishmania</italic> without requiring DNA double-strand breaks, homologous recombination, or donor DNA, thereby facilitating loss-of-function screens via delivery of plasmid libraries and regardless of limitations due to gene copy number variations and/or lack of RNAi components.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with poor treatment options, causing an estimated 1 million new cases and 20,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">World-Health-Organization, 2023</xref>). It is caused by <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, which proliferate in sand flies as motile promastigotes and in vertebrates as immotile amastigotes. When injected into a mammalian host, promastigotes predominantly enter macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Zandbergen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaves et al., 2020</xref>) and differentiate inside the phagolysosome into amastigotes. In the host, parasites can remain local (cutaneous leishmaniasis), disseminate throughout the skin (diffuse cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), or enter the bloodstream to establish visceral infections (visceral leishmaniasis). These outcomes mark the difference between a mild illness and a deadly disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCall et al., 2013</xref>), and a systematic large-scale genetic dissection of <italic>Leishmania</italic> genes involved in the mechanisms that drive these different clinical manifestations remains to be performed.</p><p>Despite this, large-scale genetic screens represent a major challenge for the <italic>Leishmania</italic> research community. While genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens have enabled a detailed functional dissection of nearly all genes in the closely related parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2002</xref>), this success has not been mirrored in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Recent developments for the use of RNAi in <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> are promising and may facilitate genome-wide loss-of-function screens in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lye et al., 2022</xref>). However, only <italic>Leishmania</italic> species of the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus have retained the components required for RNAi activity, precluding its use as a tool in most other <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. These include the causative agents of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, such as <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic>, <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and <italic>L. infantum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ullu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>An alternative approach to RNAi is the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. By simplifying previous labour-intensive gene replacement strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz and Beverley, 1990</xref>), CRISPR/Cas9 has greatly improved loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sollelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2015</xref>). Over the past 8 years, multiple CRISPR toolkits for kinetoplastids, including <italic>Leishmania</italic>, have emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yagoubat et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pal and Dam, 2022</xref>), enabling specialised gene editing approaches, such as marker free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soares Medeiros et al., 2017</xref>) or inducible gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damasceno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rico et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yagoubat et al., 2020b</xref>). In particular, the introduction of the PCR-based LeishGEdit toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>) has boosted the number of successful loss-of-function studies in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yagoubat et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). LeishGEdit enabled bar-seq screens in-which hundreds of barcoded mutants are simultaneously phenotyped by pooling them together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>). This approach allows for precise deletion of single-copy or tandem arrayed multi-copy genes and since it produces complete knockouts, the number of false positives and negatives in any subsequent screening format is limited. Furthermore, the approach is scalable and it is therefore not surprising that this has led to a genome-wide loss-of-function screening proposal. Using the LeishGEdit method, the LeishGEM project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishgem.org/">http://www.leishgem.org/</ext-link>) attempts to knockout nearly all genes in the <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> genome and plans to uncover key virulence factors by screening barcoded mutants across 170 pooled populations.</p><p>While these knockout pools will surely be a major resource for the research community in the future, their applications are limited. Cell pools are logistically difficult to share and it is unclear how well frozen pools recover and if they can be expanded after freezing without losing their uniformity. Also the composition of these pools cannot be changed and since each barcoded mutant needs to be created individually by replacing target genes with drug selectable marker cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>), bar-seq screens are most likely to be ‘one-offs’ on a genome-wide scale. Furthermore, aneuploidy in some <italic>Leishmania</italic> species can be a major challenge for gene replacement strategies as multiple rounds of transfection or isolation of clones may be required to target genes on multi-copy chromosomes. It is therefore unlikely that genome-wide bar-seq screens, such as the LeishGEM screen, could be repeated for <italic>Leishmania</italic> species that display extreme cases of aneuploidy, such as <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Using gene replacement approaches it is also not feasible to study multi-copy genes that are scattered over multiple chromosomes. These are major disadvantages of bar-seq screening. Hence, even though the LeishGEdit bar-seq approach and through LeishGEM available bar-seq pools, as well as novel RNAi tools provide a platform for possible genome-wide screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic> in the future, their applications remain extremely limited.</p><p>The lack of widely applicable high-throughput genome-wide screening platforms in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is in stark contrast to screening technologies that are available in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>) and other parasites. For example, Cas9-expressing <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites can be transfected with single-guide RNA (sgRNA) plasmid libraries to enable genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). One of the reasons why similar pooled CRISPR transfection screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species have not been performed is that <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, unlike mammalian cells or <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites, lack the key components of the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway, including DNA-PKcs, Ligase IV, and XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passos-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Following a Cas9-introduced double-strand break (DSB), DNA in mammalian cells and <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites is mainly repaired by NHEJ (&gt;70% in humans,&gt;90% in <italic>T. gondii</italic> of all DSBs), allowing indels and frame-shifts to be efficiently introduced in the target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fenoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallagher and Haber, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smolarz et al., 2014</xref>). This greatly simplifies the knockout process, as just one ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, consisting of a Cas9 protein and an sgRNA, is required without the need for donor DNA templates. In contrast, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites rely on homologous recombination (HR), single-strand annealing, and microhomology-mediated end joining DNA repair pathways to repair Cas9-introduced DSBs. Without the addition of repair template DNA, this leads to large and unpredictable DNA deletions, increased cell death during DNA repair failures and prolonged repair times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In consequence, CRISPR targeting in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is highly inefficient and the mutation rate is believed to be less than 1% without addition of donor DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). To overcome these limitations, there have been attempts to boost the CRISPR editing efficiency in <italic>Leishmania</italic> without requiring donor DNA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref> have recently attempted to reconstitute the NHEJ pathway of <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. While the authors claim that this improved DSB repair fidelity and efficiency in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, editing rates still remain low without the addition of donor DNA (less than 3% editing in selected non-clonal populations that express Cas9 and one sgRNA). These low editing rates mean in consequence that desired mutants can be only obtained through extra steps, which involve either the addition of donor DNA, labour-intensive isolation of clones or other means of selection, such as the selection of drug resistance-associated edits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). This makes pooled transfection loss-of-function screens currently unfeasible in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites.</p><p>Our aim was to overcome these limitations by bypassing the DSB repair machinery and instead directly editing suitable codons into STOP codons by using a CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editor (CBE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This strategy has previously been used for large-scale and genome-wide loss-of-function screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuscu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Després et al., 2020</xref>). CBEs are comprised of a cytidine deaminase domain fused to an impaired form of Cas9. The Cas9 module provides precise targeting of the CBE to a site of interest, where the cytidine deaminase can directly convert cytosine to thymine without requiring DSBs, HR, or donor DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, the deaminase domain catalyses a deamination reaction, converting cytidine (C) to uridine (U). Uridine is then repaired to thymidine (T) during DNA replication. To prevent base excision repair, which would convert uridine back to cytidine, Cas9 nickases (nCas9), such as D10A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cong et al., 2013</xref>), are additionally tethered to two monomers of a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) and further modifications of nuclear localisation signals (NLS), codon usage and the deaminase component have yielded highly efficient editors, such as the BE4max and AncBE4max (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komor et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, CBE editing rates can be further improved through insertion of a non-sequence-specific single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding domain (DBD) from the Rad51 protein between the Cas9 nickase and the deaminase domain (namely hyBE4max) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cytosine base editing (CBE) in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and other kinetoplastids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of hyBE4max CBE, consisting of D10A nCas9 with an HNH endonuclease domain (grey), a deaminase domain (APOBEC-1 [Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1], pink), two uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) monomers (purple), and a RAD51 ssDBD (orange). The editing window is located on the PAM sequence containing strand (yellow) at positions 4–12 (purple). Codons for arginine, tryptophan, or glutamine, can be edited into STOP codons, as shown in the text boxes. While one arginine and two glutamine codons are edited on the coding strand (light blue) into one STOP codon each, the one tryptophan codon on the template strand (dark blue) can be edited into three STOP codons. Suitable single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that would convert these four codons into STOP codons were designed for 64 kinetoplastid species.

We show that our tool can be used to convert arginine, tryptophan, or glutamine codons into STOP codons with up to 100% editing efficiency in transfected cells that have been selected for CBE and sgRNA expression constructs.

We then optimised the hyBE4max editor further by replacing the Rad51 ssDBD with a <italic>L. major</italic>-derived version, giving rise to hyBE4max-LmajDBD. Finally, we successfully use the hyBE4max and hyBE4max-LmajDBD CBE versions to perform a small-scale plasmid library delivered screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and demonstrate that the viability phenotype of an essential gene can be identified in a pooled format with our CBE method. To our knowledge, this is the first time a plasmid library transfection loss-of-function screen has been reported in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, enabling large-scale screens under various conditions in multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Feasibility of cytosine base editing in kinetoplastids</title><p>To establish cytosine base editing in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we decided to test the hyBE4max (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) CBE version noted in the introduction.

This increases the number of possible C to T conversion targets and therefore the potential for genome-wide loss-of-function screening in <italic>Leishmania</italic> through the insertion of STOP codons. To test how many genes could be targeted on a genome-wide level, we first designed sgRNAs that would allow the introduction of STOP codons by C to T conversion within the 4–12 editing window. There is a total of four codons that can be converted into all three STOP codons (amber, ochre, and opal) by this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuscu et al., 2017</xref>). While one arginine and two glutamine codons are edited on the coding strand into one STOP codon each, there is one tryptophan codon on the template strand that can be edited into three STOP codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then filtered suitable sgRNAs that would introduce a STOP codon within the first 50% of the CDS, assuming that this would be sufficient to yield functional null mutants for most genes. We could on average design at least 2 sgRNAs per gene for 87.2% of all protein-coding genes in the genomes of 64 kinetoplastids (available through TritrypDB release 59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aslett et al., 2010</xref>]), including 32 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). For genes with more than two sgRNAs available, we generated a scoring matrix that ranked guides by their exact edit window (e.g. C to T conversion is more efficient at positions 4–8 than 8–12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>]) and based on how many STOP codons each guide would introduce. The primer design for all 64 genomes was then uploaded to our new primer design resource <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net/">http://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Establishing cytosine base editing in <italic>Leishmania</italic></title><p>Since this showed that CBE-mediated genome-wide loss-of-function screens in kinetoplastids would be feasible, we started to develop a strategy to express the hyBE4max CBE in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. First, we cloned the editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) into pLdCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), enabling episomal expression of the sgRNA and hyBE4max CBE via a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then, we established a reporter assay to test the editor. A <italic>L. major</italic> clone was isolated, expressing a tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) reporter from the 18S rRNA locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). In the following, two CBE sgRNAs were designed to induce a C to T conversion that results in a neutral substitution (‘control’ sgRNA; codon change but no amino acid change), while four other targeting guides were designed to yield a STOP codon through C to T conversion (‘target’ sgRNA). Three of these six guides were designed to target the coding strand, while the other three would target the template strand. Guide sequences were cloned into pLdCH-hyBE4max (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and then transfectants analysed 11, 21, and 33 days post transfection, while being under constant drug selection to maintain the episome. Strikingly, we observed strong knockdown effects of the tdTomato reporter across all four guides, designed to introduce a STOP codon (‘Target 1’ and ‘Target 2’ on template and coding strand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For guide 1, targeting the template strand, 98.0% of transfected cells had no fluorescent signal as early as 11 days post transfection (‘Target 1’ on template strand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, guides designed to only introduce neutral substitutions with no amino acid change (‘Control’ on template and coding strand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), did not alter the fluorescent signal of the reporter even 33 days post transfection. We also measured the doubling time of transfected cells. While the tdTomato reporter cell line showed an increase in doubling time compared to the wildtype cell line (from 5.6 to 7.5 h), additional transfection of the pLdCH-hyBE4max plasmid did not lead to a further increase in doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating no effect of the editor or guide expression on growth in <italic>L. major</italic> parasites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cytosine base editing in <italic>L.</italic> <italic>major</italic> using an episomal hyBE4max expression constructs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of pLdCH-hyBE4max plasmid, containing (from left to right) a <italic>L. donovani</italic>-derived ribosomal RNA (rRNA) promoter, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassette, hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme containing transsplice sequence (TSS), SV40 NLS, APOBEC-1 domain (ssDNA-specific cytidine deaminase), RAD51 ssDBD surrounded by two glycine–serine linkers (GSL), nCas9 (D10A) protein, two uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) monomers tethered via GSL, nucleoplasmin NLS, <italic>L. donovani</italic>-derived A2 intergenic sequence, and hygromycin resistance marker.

Sanger sequencing reads were analysed by using ICE (inference of CRISPR edits; Sythego), allowing to quantify the discordance (editing rate) between the normalised edited and non-edited read for the entire sequenced region (from 2.7% to 25% of the tdTomato CDS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For all six guides, editing was only observed within the guide target sequence and not elsewhere in sequenced regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). While selected C to T conversions within the editing window (positions 4–12) were up to 100% effective (100% editing rate) for three of the six guide target sequences, not all possible C to T conversion targets were effectively edited. For example, three C to T conversions were 100% effective for ‘Target 1’ on the template strand at positions 6–8, yielding a STOP codon at the intended position. However, the fourth conversion target of that guide at position 12 was not edited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), confirming previously observed differences in editing efficiencies across the editing window (efficiency higher at positions 4–8 than 8–12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>]). Strikingly, both control guides, which did not show any changes in the reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) as they were designed to only change the DNA sequence but not the amino acid sequence, showed also high editing rates (100% for Ctrl(+), 79.2% and 45.9% for Ctr(−)), confirming that the hyBE4max CBE was highly specific even though expressed for 33 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sanger sequencing following cytosine base editing in <italic>L.</italic> <italic>major</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of reference sequences (Reference) with Sanger sequencing trace plots before transfection of pLdCH-hyBE4max-tdTomato targeting plasmids (D0) and 33 days after transfection (D33).

This also allowed to express sgRNAs under the control of the T7 RNAP promoter either via transcription from short DNA templates or from epsiomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the latter strategy increased editing during our tdTomato reporter assay, with all six guides reaching nearly 100% editing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) and controls showing no effect on the reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), doubling times significantly increased once episomal-expressed sgRNAs were transfected into the cell line expressing constitutively hyBE4max and T7 RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We also tested another CBE version (namely AncBE4max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>]) that, unlike hyBE4max (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), does not have the Rad51 ssDBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While we observed also high editing rates of 100% for nearly all sgRNAs when targeting tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), we saw strong editing outside of the guide targeting window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>), depleting the tdTomato reporter signal even in control cells, where only neutral substitutions were intended with no amino acid change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Meanwhile, editing outside the guide target sequence was not observed when using the hyBE4max CBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>We concluded from these initial results that episomal expression of the sgRNA and hyBE4max CBE is a suitable approach for mutant generation. While stable expression systems did not affect growth before expressing the sgRNA and may be attractive too after further optimisation, an episomal expression system seemed to be much more flexible, allowing to transfect wildtype parasites without further modifications. To test the flexibility of our system, we therefore next performed our reporter assay in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and <italic>L. infantum</italic>, and repeated it in <italic>L. major</italic>. First, we confirmed the identity of each <italic>Leishmania</italic> species by sequencing the LPG2 locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhoundi et al., 2017</xref>) and generated tdTomato-expressing clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then transfected all four species with pLdCH-hyBE4max plasmids, targeting the tdTomato reporter as in experiments above, and measured the reporter signal 16 days post transfection. First, we assessed whether we could reproduce results in <italic>L. major</italic>. For all four repeated guide transfections (‘Control (−)’, ‘Target 1 (+)’, ‘Target 1 (−)’, and ‘Target 2 (−)’) similar results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) with again almost 100% elimination of the tdTomato reporter signal in cells transfected with guide 1 targeting the template strand (‘Target 1 (−)’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While we also achieved full depletion of the tdTomato reporter for selected guides in the other three species, the reporter was strongest depleted in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, followed by <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. infantum</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It is possible that this result was caused by a potentially different number of integrated tdTomato expression constructs, as we did not assess the exact tdTomato reporter copy number in each species. However, given that the pLdCH-hyBE4max expression cassette is driven by an <italic>L. donovani</italic> rRNA promoter, which is diverse compared to other <italic>Leishmania</italic> rRNA promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martínez-Calvillo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), a species-dependent result is anticipated. A pattern was also observed when assessing the doubling time of all four transfected species. Expression of the CBE and sgRNA did not affect <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> growth but it increased significantly doubling times in <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic>, suggesting that high CBE and sgRNA expression levels may be toxic for these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Conversely, this was not reflected when assessing the expression levels of hyBE4max in all four species. While protein degradation made an exact quantification of hyBE4max difficult, western blots indicated that the highest expression of hyBE4mas was seen in <italic>L. major</italic>, followed by <italic>L. infantum</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and <italic>L. donovani</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CBE targeting of single- and multi-copy genes in <italic>Leishmania</italic></title><p>Despite the slight toxicity observed in <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic>, we concluded that our system was efficiently and specifically converting C to T within the target window, thereby introducing STOP codons in all four <italic>Leishmania</italic> species. This prompted us to generate proof of principle mutants in wildtype cells next. To test our CBE system we decided to target the single-copy genes PF16 (encoding a central pair protein of the axoneme and essential for flagellar motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martel et al., 2017</xref>]), IFT88 (encoding a subunit of the IFT-B complex and essential for flagellar assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>]), and the miltefosine transporter (MFT, encoding a P-type ATPase that is linked to miltefosine resistance in <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seifert et al., 2007</xref>]), as well as the multi-copy gene PFR2 (encoding a key component of the paraflagellar rod and required for normal flagellar motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maga et al., 1999</xref>]). All four genes were targeted with four guides each, which were cloned into pLdCH-hyBE4max plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While we designed PF16 and IFT88 guides to be universal for multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, guides for MFT and PFR2 were species specific for <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, respectively. In addition, guides targeting PFR2 were designed to be universal for all three PFR2 copies (A, B, and C). We then individually transfected plasmids targeting PF16 into <italic>L. donovani</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. infantum</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic>, while plasmids targeting IFT88 were only transfected into <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic>.

As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>), the proportion of cells showing a motility phenotype in the IFT88 targeted <italic>L. infantum</italic> population decreased further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For <italic>L. major</italic> parasites, we finally could detect cells with a motility phenotype within the PF16 guide transfected population (PF16-3). However, the transfected IFT88 guide (IFT88-1) still did not induce any measurable effect in <italic>L. major</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Observed motility phenotypes correlated well with editing rates. For example, guide PF16-3, yielding the strongest decrease in motility across all species, showed high editing rates in all four species with up to 100% C to T conversion. Guide PF16-2, which only showed a motility phenotype in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>, also only showed editing in those two species and guide PF16-1, which only showed a decrease in mutant speed in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, also just showed editing in <italic>L. donovani</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Surprisingly, we saw high editing rates for three of the four IFT88 targeting guides in <italic>L. infantum</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> but only guide IFT88-1 resulted in a measurable motility and flagellar assembly phenotype in <italic>L. infantum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysing the Sanger sequencing trace plots further, we noticed that only guide IFT88-1 induced a mutation that resulted in a STOP codon, while non-STOP codon mutations became dominant for the other two guides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), presumably due to the known IFT88 growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>). For guides targeting PFR2 in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, only guide PFR2-1 was efficient, which was also the only guide resulting in decreased motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). To confirm that indeed, the knockdown of PFR2 was successful, we analysed the expression of the targeted protein by western blot, confirming a strong knockdown only for guide PFR2-1 (~97% knockdown compared to wildtype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is important to highlight that this strong knockdown was achieved in non-clonal populations that had been selected to express the hyBE4max and only one sgRNA. There was no requirement for additional donor DNA or isolation of clones. This is despite the fact that PFR2 is a three-copy gene in a tandem array.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Determining hyBE4max editing rates following targeting of single- and multi-copy genes.</title><p><italic>L. donovani</italic>, <italic>L. infantum</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic> wildtype parasites were transfected with pLdCH-hyBE4max-sgRNA expression plasmids, targeting (<bold>A</bold>) PF16, (<bold>B</bold>) IFT88, and (<bold>C</bold>) PFR2 with four guides each (see main text description).

To determine the suitability of our method for drug screening applications, such as positive drug resistance screens, we also wanted to test whether miltefosine-resistant parasites could be enriched in the mutant population by treating them with a low dose of miltefosine prior to assessing their actual resistance to the drug itself. To test this, wildtype parasites and parasites expressing MFT targeting guides were treated for 48 hr with 20 µM miltefosine (pre-treated parasites) from 16 days post transfection onwards. Then cells were washed and cultured for another 72 hr. In the following, pre-treated and non-pre-treated parasites were incubated with different doses of miltefosine for 48 hr and subsequently cell viability was measured by using an MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Pre-treated with miltefosine or not, wildtype cells were only resistant to small doses of miltefosine (5 and 20 µM). In comparison, parasites transfected with pLdCH-hyBE4max plasmids that allowed to express MFT targeting guides became significantly resistant to high doses of miltefosine (50 and 80 µM) (guide MFT-1 and MFT-3 significantly different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As expected, when pre-treated with miltefosine the proportion of viable parasites at high miltefosine concentrations then rose further and three out of four guides were able to confer resistance (guide MFT-1, MFT-2, and MFT-3 significantly different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, viability rates correlated well with high editing rates for all these three guides. For example, guide MFT-3, which conferred the highest level of resistance to miltefosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>), resulted also in the highest editing rate of all MFT targeting guides (up to 81.9% for non-pre-treated cells and 86.5% for pre-treated cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Further analysis of trace plots also highlighted that the introduced mutations resulted in the intended premature STOP codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Comparing the Rad51 ssDBD from <italic>Leishmania</italic> with the human version, the <italic>Leishmania</italic> version contains an N-terminal extension that is bound to the conserved Rad51 ssDBD part through a glutamine-rich repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Glutamine-rich repeats, known to be enriched in transcription factors, can increase DNA–protein binding by forming hydrogen bonds via their amide site chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perutz et al., 1994</xref>). Since <italic>L. major</italic> had the longest glutamine-rich repeat among our tested <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, we decided to replace the Rad51 ssDBD in pLdCH-hyBE4max with an <italic>L. major</italic>-derived Rad51 ssDBD, giving rise to pLdCH-hyBE4max-LmajDBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then chose <italic>L. mexicana</italic> to test our <italic>Leishmania-</italic>optimised CBE as in experiments above editing rates in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> were higher than in <italic>L. major</italic> while not affecting parasite growth. First, we repeated our tdTomato reporter assay and saw an increase in the knockdown effect for the <italic>Leishmania</italic>-optimised CBE version for two of the four targeting guides at 16 days post transfection (1.6-fold increase for guide Target 2 on the coding strand and 5.3-fold increase for guide Target 2 on the template strand). For all other guides, including control guides that were designed not to yield a STOP codon, no major difference between both CBE versions could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Encouraged by the slightly improved editing rate, we then decided to test whether our method could also be used to target essential genes. Our earlier results indicated that the individual targeting of IFT88, a gene required for normal proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>), results in outcompeting of the introduced STOP codon mutation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This outcompeting process should in-turn result in reduced growth of the overall mutant population. Therefore, our assumption was that the viability phenotype of an essential gene could especially be detected in a pooled screening format. To test this, we pooled all annealed guide oligos from experiments above, targeting IFT88, PF16, MFT, PFR2, and tdTomato, and generated an oligo pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition, we added four guides to this oligo pool that target the Cdc2-related kinase 3 (CRK3), an essential kinase that has been used as a proof of principle mutant for essential genes in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yagoubat et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>). The prediction was that CRK3 guides would be strongly depleted from the pool over time. In addition, we wanted to use this experiment as an opportunity to compare again our <italic>Leishmania</italic>-optimised CBE (pLdCH-hyBE4max-LmajDBD) with the non-optimised version (pLdCH-hyBE4max). We therefore cloned the oligo pool, consisting of these 26 guides, into both plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We then transfected this library in triplicates into <italic>L. mexicana</italic> wildtype parasites, so that the four guides targeting MFT, originally designed for <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and the six guides targeting tdTomato, having no target in wildtype cells, would serve as non-targeting controls.

Selected clones from these serial dilutions were then also Sanger sequenced to determine whether parasites would harbour one or multiple sgRNAs.

However, three out of eight sequenced clones maintained two different plasmids and by that expressed two sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This meant that for most transfectants only the effect of one guide per transfectant is measured. However, there must have been also transfectants in the pool with simultaneously induced mutations on multiple genes.

Strikingly, we found two of the four CRK3 targeting guides (CRK3-3 and CRK3-4) to be significantly depleted at days 12 and 21 in the <italic>Leishmania</italic>-optimised CBE library (pLdCH-hyBE4max-LmajDBD), while only one CRK3 guide (CRK3-3) was significant depleted from the non-optimised CBE library (pLdCH-hyBE4max). All other guides, including non-targeting guides, did not significantly change in their representation within the pool over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This demonstrates that our method can not only be used to target essential genes but also to pursue loss-of-function screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic> via delivery of plasmid libraries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Advantages and disadvantages of cytosine base editing in <italic>Leishmania</italic></title><p>Here, we report our new LeishBASEedit CBE toolbox, allowing to knockdown single- and multi-copy genes in <italic>Leishmania</italic> populations by expressing hyBE4max and just one sgRNA. Our method to convert selected codons into STOP codons by using a base editor bypasses the requirement of DSBs, HR, donor DNA, or isolation of clones in order to obtain functional null mutants. Since our technique resembles a gene silencing approach, it is applicable for targeting essential genes in pooled transfections. Most importantly, this enables genetic screening in wildtype parasites (no engineered cell lines required) through a pooled plasmid library transfection format. While most of these points also apply for RNAi approaches, their application remains restricted to <italic>Leishmania</italic> species of the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ullu et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the RNAi efficacy in <italic>Leishmania Viannia</italic> species varies widely and has been shown to be gene-, species-, and even strain-specific, as well as to depend on the length of the dsRNA hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brettmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>On the contrary, the base editing efficacy was here also shown to be time dependent and to vary widely amongst genes, species, and chosen sgRNA sequences. This is not surprising, especially as variations in efficacy across sgRNAs that target the same gene and locus are a common problem in any CRISPR approach, including CRISPR bar-seq screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labuhn et al., 2018</xref>). It is also worth highlighting that by base editing produced knockdowns are technically truncations and open reading frames (ORFs) are not fully replaced. It is unknown whether mutant mRNAs harbouring these truncated ORFs have any additional effects on the parasites or whether they are quickly degraded. Degradation of mutant mRNAs in which a termination codon is present within the ORF would require a classical nonsense-mediated decay pathway. But it is unclear whether this pathway is functional in <italic>Leishmania</italic> and other kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clayton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delhi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus remaining N-terminal protein parts could be functional or even deleterious themselves, leading to false positive and negative results. However, this may also provide extra information about functional domains of the targeted protein and highlights that our tool can not only be used to create functional null mutants by inserting premature STOP codons but also to pursue targeted mutagenesis screens.</p><p>To facilitate large-scale base editing CRISPR screens, ssDNA oligo pools can be obtained commercially and used to generate sgRNA libraries. The generation of CRISPR libraries is straight forward and scalable, with some libraries containing as many as ~215,000 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>). Guides are designed to be gene specific and have therefore a much greater specificity than RNAi plasmid libraries that are typically comprised of randomly sheared genomic DNA, such as those previously used for <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2002</xref>). Cloning strategies to generate sgRNA plasmid libraries typically involve first the amplification of ssDNA oligo libraries and then golden gate assembly (using Type IIS restrictions enzymes) of amplicons into a target vector. Since the vector we here use for base editing is compatible with this cloning strategy, we believe that our base editing method could be scaled up to facilitate genome-wide screens in future studies. The ability of just sharing targeted or potentially even genome-wide plasmid libraries and applying these to different research questions in various <italic>Leishmania</italic> species in many different laboratories around the globe represents a major improvement to previous methods and overcomes challenges associated with bar-seq screens, such as the LeishGEM project (as outlined in our introduction).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible improvements to base editing in <italic>Leishmania</italic></title><p>What remains to be improved however, is the long culture time needed for some guides in order to reach high C to T conversion rates because prolonged guide targeting may cause unwanted side effects, such as off-target mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grünewald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). We did not assess possible off-target mutations on a genome-wide scale in this study and this remains to be thoroughly evaluated in the future. However, apart from one guide (PF16-1 in <italic>L. donovani</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which resulted in editing within 6nt range of the guide sequence, we did not detect any editing outside of the 20nt guide sequence even 33 days post transfection when analysing the entire Sanger sequencing range of all our targeted genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–C,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Editing time could be reduced by fine-tuning sgRNA and CBE expression, especially through the use of species-specific promoters, synthetic promoters, modified T7 RNAP promoters and stable integration of expression constructs. This could also help to minimise possible toxic effects on growth, as observed in <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Integrating sgRNA constructs would also ensure that sgRNAs are not lost during <italic>in vivo</italic> screening and that just one sgRNA per transfectant is expressed, thereby reducing the risk of horizontal plasmid transfer between parasites throughout a screen. Multiple sgRNAs per transfectant could theoretically cause multi-gene knockout effects. However, this risk seems to be low as we did not detect more than two sgRNAs per transfectant and as those two guides seemed to be randomly mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, integrating sgRNA constructs would reduce possible variations in the episomal copy number, which <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites are known to vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ubeda et al., 2014</xref>). Although episomal transfection allows also to adjust protein expression by increasing the concentration of selection drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>), our attempts to increase editing rates by raising drug concentrations were not successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To reduce editing time, it may be also preferable to target the template strand (−) over the coding strand (+). Since mutations on the coding strand have no immediate effect on the transcript, they first need to be incorporated on the template strand (−) during DNA replication. Hence, targeting the coding strand leads to a slower increase in editing over time and this was also repeatedly reflected in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore have adjusted our scoring criteria for ranking guides on our primer design platform <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net/">http://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link>. In addition, to minimise the possibilities for non-STOP codon mutations to become dominant our guide ranking could be further modified in the future to prioritise guides that have as few as possible cytosine bases. Although we have not measured this yet, the expectation would be that guides with fewer cytosine bases within the editing window would result in higher rates of successful STOP codon transformations. This is especially desirable when targeting essential genes, as the chances of non-deleterious mutations becoming dominant would be reduced.</p><p>Lastly, modifying the CBE version through codon optimisation, addition of species-specific NLS or exchange of deaminase and UGI domains, could further increase the editing rate in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. We show that our <italic>Leishmania</italic>-optimised hyBE4max CBE version increases the editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, it remains to be explored whether also fidelity and editing window size is affected by this modification, as for example hyBE4max adaptations in rise are known to have expanded the editing windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). While especially our improved CBE version allowed to efficiently induce a knockdown of CRK3, guides targeting IFT88 were not significantly depleted in our small-scale library screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Although IFT88 is not an essential gene, we would have also expected a decrease in guide abundance over time as IFT88 has been shown to be required for normal promastigote proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that we prioritised universal sgRNAs over the highest scoring guides to target IFT88 in multiple species in this study. Testing these four IFT88 guides individually, we only found one to be effective in <italic>L. infantum</italic>, while in <italic>L. major</italic> no measurable effect, even 42 days post transfection, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Meanwhile, we did not individually test these four IFT88 targeting guides in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. It is therefore possible that by picking higher scoring guides, a depletion of IFT88 guides from the pool could have been achieved. It is also worth highlighting again that through base editing produced knockdowns are technically truncations with remaining N-terminal protein parts that could be functional. In addition, the exact timing of isolating DNA from pools might influence when a decrease of parasites with a deleterious mutation is detectable. As pointed out above, this may differ between guides, species, and genes. Thus, to detect the whole range of mutant phenotypes, such as IFT88, a tighter collection window of isolating DNA from pools may be needed. Nevertheless, we demonstrate through targeting of CRK3 that cells with an introduced premature STOP codon in an essential gene can be significantly depleted from a library with our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To date, a functional dissection of the vast majority of <italic>Leishmania</italic> genes remains to be performed and a lack of suitable tools limits the ability of the field to pursue large-scale loss-of-function screens. There is an urgent need to develop a high-throughput technology that allows: (1) to identify genes that are essential in any given environment, (2) to study multi-copy genes, and (3) to generate loss-of-function libraries through transfection of pooled plasmids rather than by pooling individually generated mutants. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 CBE toolbox for <italic>Leishmania</italic> that fulfils these criteria. LeishBASEedit allows to efficiently transform codons into STOP codons, thereby enabling the functional disruption of single- and multi-copy genes without requiring DSBs, HR, donor DNA, or isolation of clones. We demonstrate that this tool can be used for drug resistance screening, to target essential genes and to pursue loss-of-function screens in a pooled plasmid library transfection format. We therefore believe that this method will enable large-scale loss-of-function screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic> in many laboratories around the globe, simply by just sharing plasmid libraries. This will potentially even allow for genome-wide screens under different conditions in various clinical isolates and across multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without limitations due to extreme cases of gene copy numbers and/or aneuploidy or lack of RNAi components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

First CRISPR-CBEI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) was used to find all suitable sgRNAs that would transform arginine, tryptophan, or glutamine codons into STOP codons by cytosine to thymine conversion. Then, sgRNAs were filtered to select guides that would introduce a STOP codon within the first 50% of the CDS and were scored via a scoring matrix as follows: (1) one scoring point per additionally introduced STOP codon, (2) one scoring point if C to T edit is within 4–8 editing window, (3) one scoring point if C to T edit is within 4–10 editing window (guides with 4–8 editing window will have now 2 points in total), (4) one scoring point if C to T edit is within first 20% of CDS, and (5) one scoring point if C to T edit is within first 40% of CDS (guides within first 20% of CDS will have now 2 points in total) (the scoring matrix can be found as a table on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net/">http://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link>).

symptoms range from disfiguring skin lesions to lethal visceral infections. Knowledge of gene function has been limited by aneuploidy, as well as the absence of RNAi (in most but not all species) and of non-homologous DNA end joining (which limits the utility of Crispr-Cas systems). In this paper, the authors describe the successful testing and application of a new method for functional screens in Leishmania, in which targeted cytosine base editing is used to introduce premature stop codons within open reading frames. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach, in comparison with others, are described in a balanced and careful way. This is a very important new tool for researchers in Leishmania, and might also serve as a model for other poorly tractable species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85605.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Clayton</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05x8b4491</institution-id><institution>DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Clayton</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05x8b4491</institution-id><institution>DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.08.519658">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.08.519658v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Christine Clayton as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main request is to be more balanced, up-front, about the pros and cons of this approach relative to LeishGEM and – even though these are currently &quot;only&quot; at the preprint stage – RNAi screens.</p><p>2) Minor changes as requested in the detailed comments – more details in the Methods, for example.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following is a list of pros and cons for this method that I could think of. The other experts (who are Leishmaniacs) may have more useful input; all methods have a variety of possibilities for false-negative results.</p><p>Pros/possibilities:</p><p>a) Screening a particular gene set before LeishGEM results are available?</p><p>b) Screening genes that are present in L. donovani or L. infantum, but absent in L. mexicana/braziliensis – or which might have different functions. (At present it works too poorly in L. major to be useful, so the authors' claim to have established the method &quot;in four Leishmania species&quot; is an over-statement.)</p><p>c) Editing multi-copy genes (although if the mutation is lethal all copies might still not be edited).</p><p>Cons for this method:</p><p>1) Introducing a premature stop codon may not disrupt protein function (or may cause some other unexpected effect). Since there is probably no classical nonsense-mediated decay (if Leishmania is like <italic>T. brucei</italic>), one cannot expect the mRNA to be degraded – which might otherwise enhance the effects of the stop codon. In the case of proteins that interact with others, the production of truncated proteins might actually be more deleterious that deleting a gene entirely, giving possible false-positive results.</p><p>2) Culturing for at least 2 weeks – and often longer – was required to get high percentages of mutants. How does this compare with the other methods?</p><p>3) Using pools (which is what this tool is supposed to be good for), any cells that harbour deleterious mutations would be competed out so no mutants would be obtained, and there would be strong selection for cells in which the guide RNA had been lost from the episome, or the episome otherwise rendered harmless, giving false negative results. This is compounded by the problem that not all guides work.</p><p>4) It is still necessary to synthesise each guide separately, even if they can be cloned and transfected in bulk – describe how this would be done, and compare with the Gateway method for the RNAi. (Although some guides might be lost /underrepresented after cloning, the resulting variability would be no worse than the variability in representation in RNAi libraries and would be controlled for during screens.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Improvements to the methods, in places, need to express cell numbers in the correct format, and the same with H20.</p><p>Line 436 – would read better as 'the highest expression of hyBE4mas was seen in'</p><p>Figure 4 – error bars were difficult to see and the legend didn't state what they represented. Plus what do the percentages mean on graphs? Need a bit more detail in this figure legend.</p><p>Line 482 – a little explanation for why this result is expected would be useful.</p><p>Have the authors analysed the effectiveness of the guide based on whether the only mutation within the guide would result in the generation of a STOP versus those that offer multiple mutation options?</p><p>In figure S11A could the authors highlight the exact sequence of the Lmajor ssDBD they used to generate the modified plasmid?</p><p>The authors could include a discussion of the RNAi-based approaches for L. braziliensis in comparison to other methodologies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85605.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following is a list of pros and cons for this method that I could think of.

Instead it was developed to generate more easily mutant libraries for all sort of screening applications and use these in all <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without facing limitations due to the lack of RNAi activity or due to the presence of extreme cases of aneuploidy. The real advantage of our here developed method is that plasmid libraries can be easily shared around the globe with many different labs without requiring a modified cell line beforehand. We have clarified this point in our revised discussion (line 429 – 468).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Screening genes that are present in L. donovani or L. infantum, but absent in L. mexicana/braziliensis – or which might have different functions. (At present it works too poorly in L. major to be useful, so the authors' claim to have established the method &quot;in four Leishmania species&quot; is an over-statement.)</p></disp-quote><p>Screening genes that are present in one species and not in the other would be one possibility. However, since gene copy numbers greatly vary between <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and many single copy genes vary in their ORF sequence, it is also attractive to pursue comparative genome-wide screens in all <italic>Leishmania</italic> species. Performing the LeishGEM project in multiple <italic>Leishmania</italic> species would be unfeasible at present but feasible with our base editing method (see revised introduction [line 36 – 73] and discussion [line 429 – 468]).</p><p>We also don’t think that claiming we have established base editing in <italic>L. major</italic> is an over-statement. Due to the <italic>L. donovani</italic>-derived rRNA promoter in our expression construct there is of course room for improvement, which we highlight in our discussion (line 497 – 535). However, our experiments in <italic>L. major</italic>, including the reporter assays and the targeting of PF16, clearly show that it works (see Figure 2, 3 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Editing multi-copy genes (although if the mutation is lethal all copies might still not be edited).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and made this argument already in our original manuscript (line 469 – 472). For clarity, we reiterate this point now in our revised version (line 430 – 433 and 570 – 572).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cons for this method:</p><p>1) Introducing a premature stop codon may not disrupt protein function (or may cause some other unexpected effect). Since there is probably no classical nonsense-mediated decay (if Leishmania is like <italic>T. brucei</italic>), one cannot expect the mRNA to be degraded – which might otherwise enhance the effects of the stop codon. In the case of proteins that interact with others, the production of truncated proteins might actually be more deleterious that deleting a gene entirely, giving possible false-positive results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this comment to our revised manuscript (line 445 – 454).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Culturing for at least 2 weeks – and often longer – was required to get high percentages of mutants. How does this compare with the other methods?</p></disp-quote><p>Culturing for at least 2 weeks was not required to get high percentages of mutants but to recover cells from transfections. For our here developed base editing approach, cells are transfected with a plasmid that expresses the base editor, the sgRNA and a drug resistance gene. In order to edit a GOI, cells need to be selected for this plasmid. Selection of drug resistant cells takes between 7 – 10 days (depending on the species). In the following the cells need to be sub-cultured before DNA can be extracted to assess the base editing rate (to dilute out cell debris from the selection). Hence 14 days was just the earliest time point we could look at simultaneously across all species. It is very likely that the actual editing happens much earlier and immediately after transfection if the guide is efficient enough. Therefore, some guides result in 100% editing rate at the earliest time point. However, it is true that some guides then needed longer in culture in order to be efficient. This is due to differences in guide efficiencies, which can be observed for various CRISPR approaches, as commented in our discussion (line 441 – 444). In addition, for base editing the efficiency and editing time will depend on the strand that is being targeted (line 526 – 531).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Using pools (which is what this tool is supposed to be good for), any cells that harbour deleterious mutations would be competed out so no mutants would be obtained, and there would be strong selection for cells in which the guide RNA had been lost from the episome, or the episome otherwise rendered harmless, giving false negative results. This is compounded by the problem that not all guides work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the strength of this tool lies within its compatibility for loss-of-function screens via plasmid pool delivery. Following a plasmid pool transfection, cells that harbour deleterious mutations will be outcompeted from the pool as shown in our proof of principle CRK3 screen (Figure 7). Some guides will not be effective, just like some guides for the LeishGEdit method will not be functional or like some RNAi hairpins have no effect. This is the reason why multiple guides in parallel are being tested and why large-scale CRIPSR libraries usually target genes with 3-10 guides. So we do not think “that not all guides work” is a problem specific for base editing.</p><p>In addition, we have added that our method is not only useful for using plasmid pools but may be also used for other applications, such as targeted mutagenesis experiments (line 452 – 454).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is still necessary to synthesise each guide separately, even if they can be cloned and transfected in bulk – describe how this would be done, and compare with the Gateway method for the RNAi. (Although some guides might be lost /underrepresented after cloning, the resulting variability would be no worse than the variability in representation in RNAi libraries and would be controlled for during screens.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment in our revised discussion (line 455 – 468).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Improvements to the methods, in places, need to express cell numbers in the correct format, and the same with H20.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for these suggestions.

We have stated that the complete deletion of IFT88 in <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> has been shown to have reduced doubling time (Beneke et al., PLoS Pathogens 2019) and are therefore most likely outcompeted from the pool (line 293 – 298 and 537 – 541).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors analysed the effectiveness of the guide based on whether the only mutation within the guide would result in the generation of a STOP versus those that offer multiple mutation options?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we added that this should be measured and tested in future studies. The expectation would be that guides with fewer cytosine bases within the editing window would result in higher rates of successful STOP codon transformations. If true, our guide ranking could be further modified to prioritize guides that have as few as possible cytosine bases, minimizing the possibilities for non-STOP codon mutations to become dominant (526 – 531).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure S11A could the authors highlight the exact sequence of the Lmajor ssDBD they used to generate the modified plasmid?</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted the amino acid sequence taken for generating the <italic>Leishmania</italic> optimized base editor.
