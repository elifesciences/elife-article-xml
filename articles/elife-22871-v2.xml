Accumulation of misfolded proteins triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress that leads to unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is relayed to the cell through the activation of PERK, IRE1/XBP1, and ATF6. Here, we demonstrate that levels of PERK and IRE1 are increased in satellite cells upon muscle injury. Inhibition of PERK, but not the IRE1 arm of the UPR in satellite cells inhibits myofiber regeneration in adult mice. PERK is essential for the survival and differentiation of activated satellite cells into the myogenic lineage. Deletion of PERK causes hyper-activation of p38 MAPK during myogenesis. Blocking p38 MAPK activity improves the survival and differentiation of PERK-deficient satellite cells in vitro and muscle formation in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that the PERK arm of the UPR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of satellite cell homeostasis during regenerative myogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22871.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22871.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle regeneration</kwd><kwd>ER Stress</kwd><kwd>PERK</kwd><kwd>IRE1/XBP1</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR059810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Ashok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG029623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Ashok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR068313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Ashok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that PERK is important for the survival of activated satellite stem cells during regeneration of injured skeletal muscle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle exhibits a remarkable capacity for regeneration following damage that is attributed to a population of muscle precursor cells, termed satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). In undamaged skeletal muscle, these mononucleated cells reside between the basement membrane and the sarcolemma in a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Following injury to myofibers, satellite cells rapidly become activated, proliferate, and then fuse either to form new muscle fibers or to repair damaged parts of existing muscle fibers. Moreover, a fraction of the activated satellite cell population escapes differentiation and restores the pool of quiescent satellite cells in newly formed skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Quiescent satellite cells express high levels of paired box 7 (Pax7) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Following specification to the myogenic lineage, the levels of Pax7 are repressed and the levels of Myf5, MyoD, and myogenin are concomitantly increased, giving rise to proliferative myoblasts, which eventually fuse with injured myofibers to accomplish regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuang and Rudnicki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that satellite cell homeostasis and function in adult skeletal muscle is regulated through the activation of multiple pathways including Notch, Wnt, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies also suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways play an important role in satellite cell homeostasis and function. Activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling enhances the self-renewal of satellite cells through downstream activation of the c-JUN transcription factor, which augments the expression of Pax7 in satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Khalil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, activation of p38 MAPK inhibits self-renewal and promotes differentiation of satellite cells into myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lluís et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). While p38 MAPK promotes later stages of myogenic differentiation, its untimely activation reduces the pool of satellite cells and their regenerative potential in many conditions including aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Satellite cell survival and function can be influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brack and Muñoz-Cánoves, 2016</xref>). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle of mammalian cells involved in many functions, such as protein folding and secretion and calcium homeostasis. Prolonged accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins causes stress in the ER, which initiates an evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling mechanism known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is comprised of three signaling branches, which are initiated by three ER receptors: RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu and Kaufman, 2006</xref>). Under basal conditions, these proteins are maintained in a relatively dormant state through binding to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a chaperone protein in the ER lumen. When unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, GRP78 binds preferentially to the misfolded proteins and is therefore released from PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, leading to their activation (14, 15). Activation of the UPR causes translational reprogramming, in which protein synthesis is globally repressed and accompanied by the preferential synthesis of a specific subset of mRNAs whose protein products are required for responding to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). While the primary role of UPR is to restore ER function, chronic unmitigated ER stress can also lead to apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flamment et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu and Kaufman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>ER stress-induced UPR appears to play an important role in myogenesis, evidenced by findings that the ATF6 arm of the UPR is activated during skeletal muscle development and mediates apoptosis of a subpopulation of myoblasts that may be susceptible to cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>). Pan-inhibition of ER stress using pharmacological compounds blocks apoptosis and myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>), whereas inducers of ER stress selectively eliminate vulnerable myoblasts that allows surviving cells to differentiate more efficiently into myotubes in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakanishi et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study has shown that the PERK/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) arm of the UPR may be required for maintaining satellite cells in a quiescent state in adult skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role and mechanisms of action of various arms of the UPR in satellite cell-mediated regenerative myogenesis remain completely unknown.</p><p>In the present study, using genetic mouse models, we have investigated the role of individual UPR pathways in satellite cell-mediated skeletal muscle regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the mRNA levels of <italic>Eif2ak3</italic> (encoding PERK) and <italic>Ern1</italic> (encoding IRE1), but not <italic>Atf6</italic> (encoding ATF6), are increased in satellite cells upon skeletal muscle injury in adult mice. We demonstrate that PERK, but not X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1, the major target of IRE1 endonuclease activity which activates UPR), is required for satellite cell function during skeletal muscle repair. Our results also suggest that PERK is required for the survival of satellite cells during muscle regeneration and their differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, we found that the inactivation of PERK leads to hyper-activation of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK using molecular and pharmacological approaches improves survival and differentiation in PERK-deficient myogenic cells both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ablation of PERK in satellite cells inhibits skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice</title><p>We first investigated how the expression of various markers of ER stress are affected in satellite cells upon skeletal muscle injury.

To understand how the expression of various markers of ER stress are regulated in satellite cells upon muscle injury, we injected both tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GA) muscles of WT mice with 1.2% BaCl<sub>2</sub> solution, a widely used myotoxin for experimental muscle injury in mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>). Control muscles were injected with saline only. After 5d, the TA and GA muscles were isolated and the single cell suspension made was subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for the isolation of quiescent and activated satellite cells from uninjured and injured muscle, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hindi et al., 2012</xref>).

Using a FACS-based intracellular protein detection assay, we sought to investigate whether pPERK is also present in activated satellite cells of injured skeletal muscle of mice. Single cell suspensions prepared from 5d-injured TA muscle of WT mice were analyzed by FACS for the expression of α7-integrin and the phosphorylated form of PERK (pPERK).

The P7:PERK KO mice were fed a tamoxifen containing chow for the entire duration of the experiment. One week after the first injection of vehicle or tamoxifen, TA muscle of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice was injected with 100 µl of 1.2% BaCl<sub>2</sub> solution to induce necrotic muscle injury. Muscle regeneration was evaluated at day 5 and 14 post-BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

However, the wet weight of injured TA muscle was significantly reduced in P7:PERK KO mice compared to injured TA muscle of Ctrl mice at day 5 after BaCl<sub>2</sub>-mediated injury suggesting deficit in muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We next prepared transverse cryosections of the TA muscle and performed Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining.

Moreover, the percentage of myofibers containing two or more centrally located nuclei was significantly reduced in injured TA muscle of P7:PERK KO mice compared with Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). A deficit in muscle regeneration in P7:PERK KO mice was also clearly evident at 14d after muscle injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). By preparing single cell suspension from 5d-injured TA muscles followed by FACS analysis using antibody against CD45 (a marker for leukocytes), we also investigated whether the deletion of PERK in satellite cells affects the inflammatory immune response.

In wild-type mice, immediately after isolation, each myofiber is associated with a fixed number of satellite cells which express Pax7, but not MyoD (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup>), that represent the quiescent satellite cell population. Upon culturing, satellite cells undergo multiple rounds of cell division through upregulating MyoD (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>) and form cellular aggregates on myofibers. These cells then either self-renew (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup>) or commit to terminal differentiation (Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>) into the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hindi et al., 2012</xref>). We prepared myofiber explants from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice and myofiber-associated satellite cells were analyzed immediately or after 72 hr of culturing by immunostaining with anti-Pax7 and anti-MyoD antibodies. There was no significant difference in the number of myofiber-associated Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells immediately after isolation between Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice. Moreover, none of the myofiber-associated cells stained positive for MyoD in either genotype at 0 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After 72 hr of culturing, myofiber-associated satellite cells formed clusters, a typical characteristic of activated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). No significant difference was observed in the average number of clusters per myofiber or average number of cells per cluster between Ctrl and P7:PERK KO cultures (data not shown). There was no significant difference in Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells on myofibers between Ctrl and P7:PERK KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, the percentage of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells was significantly reduced in P7:PERK KO cultures compared with Ctrl cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). There was also a trend towards increased proportion of Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells in P7:PERK KO cultures compared with Ctrl cultures but it was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Using GSK2606414, a highly specific inhibitor of PERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axten et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2013</xref>), we also investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PERK on the fate of myofiber-associated satellite cells in cultures. For this experiment, suspension cultures of myofibers were established from the EDL muscle of WT mice followed by treatment with vehicle alone or GSK2606414 for 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistent with the above results, GSK2606414 did not affect the average number of cellular clusters per myofiber or average number of cells per cluster on isolated single myofibers (data not shown). Inhibition of PERK using GSK2606414 had no effect on the proportion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). By contrast, treatment with GSK2606414 significantly reduced the proportion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) without having any significant effect on the proportion of Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).</p><p>We also sought to investigate the effect of genetic ablation of PERK on self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of satellite cells in myofiber-free cultures. However, we could not purify enough number of satellite cells from hind limb muscle of P7:PERK KO mice for experimentation. While there was no apparent difference between initial number of satellite cells isolated from hind limb muscles of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO, most of P7:PERK KO satellite cells died within 3–4 days of culturing. Moreover, the surviving cells from P7:PERK KO mice failed to proliferate efficiently in culture. In one experiment, we plated surviving satellite cells from Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice and monitored their proliferation by counting the number of cells per colony. There was a drastic reduction in the colony size in P7:PERK KO cultures compared to Ctrl cultures after 12d of their initial plating on the culture dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is notable that P7:PERK KO cells proliferate on isolated myofibers in cultures, but fail to survive or proliferate when cultured in myofiber-free conditions.</p><p>To investigate the effect of inhibition of PERK on satellite cells in myofiber-free cultures, we used a pharmacological approach. Primary myogenic cells prepared from WT mice were treated with vehicle alone or GSK2606414 for 24 hr followed by immunostaining for Pax7 and MyoD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Most satellite cells in cultures were Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>, whereas a small proportion of them were Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> or Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>. GSK2606414 had no significant effect on the proportion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> or Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>. However, GSK2606414 significantly reduced the percentage of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that GSK2606414 inhibited the phosphorylation without having any effect on the total levels of PERK protein in myogenic cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Since we found a significant reduction in the proportion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> satellite cells on cultured myofibers of P7:PERK KO mice compared to Ctrl mice, we next investigated whether deletion of PERK had a similar effect on satellite cells in injured muscle microenvironment. Muscle sections generated from 5d-injured TA muscle of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice were immunostained for Pax7 and MyoD protein whereas nuclei were identified by staining with DAPI. Consistent with published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Didier et al., 2012</xref>), a vast majority of the nuclei including those within myofibers stained positive for MyoD which made it difficult to enumerate Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, there were distinct populations of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells within TA muscle sections. Our analysis showed that there was a significant reduction in the number of both Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells in TA muscle of P7:PERK KO mice compared to Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). It is notable that deletion of PERK did not affect the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> satellite cells in ex vivo myofiber cultures whereas a significant reduction in this cell population was noticeable in regenerating myofibers of P7:PERK KO mice. This could be attributed to the fact that myofibers in ex vivo cultures are maintained in growth conditions in which satellite cells do not undergo terminal differentiation and fusion. In contrast, in regenerating muscle, satellite cells are initially exposed to a pro-proliferation microenvironment followed by one that favors differentiation to conclude the regeneration program. These findings suggest that PERK is essential for maintaining the pool of satellite cells capable of undergoing self-renewal, proliferation, and fusion with injured myofibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ablation of PERK induces apoptosis in myogenic cells during regenerative myogenesis</title><p>Since the abundance of satellite cells was reduced in injured skeletal muscle of P7:PERK KO mice compared with Ctrl mice, we next investigated whether PERK regulates the survival of muscle progenitor cells during skeletal muscle regeneration.

Incubation of cells in DM led to reduced levels of phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK) and phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) as well as total protein levels of their downstream target CHOP within 3 hr. However, the levels of p-PERK and p-eIF2α again started increasing by 6 hr, peaked at 12 hr, and remained elevated up to 24 hr after addition of DM. It is well established that differentiation-incompetent cells undergo apoptosis during in vitro myogenesis. Intriguingly, we found that phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α (i.e. at 12 hr of addition of DM) was associated with concomitant increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the markers of apoptosis which have been shown to be expressed and required in surviving differentiating myogenic cells upon incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernando et al., 2002</xref>). While the pPERK levels were reduced after 24 hr, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP remained elevated even at 48 hr of addition of DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although the physiological significance of these findings remains unknown, it is possible that the PERK arm of the UPR regulates the initiation of the differentiation program in myogenic cells after incubation in DM.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22871.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PERK is required for survival of myogenic cells during in vitro myogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary myogenic cells isolated from WT mice were incubated in DM for the indicated time intervals and protein extracts analyzed for the levels of various proteins related to the PERK arm of the UPR.

Since satellite cells from P7:PERK KO mice did not grow in culture, we isolated satellite cells from Ctrl mice. After establishing the cultures, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or 0.5 μM tamoxifen (TAM) for 48 hr to generate PERK WT and PERK KO cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>). The cells were washed and incubated in GM for an additional 48 hr. In our initial experiments, we confirmed that 0.5 μM TAM has absolutely no effect on cellular viability or differentiation of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes in WT cultures. Moreover, there was also no significant difference in cellular viability between PERK WT and PERK KO cells in GM (data not shown). Next, PERK WT and PERK KO cells were incubated in DM for 48 hr and the myotube formation was monitored by immunostaining for myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein. DAPI was used to identify nuclei. Interestingly, myotube formation was considerably reduced in PERK KO cultures compared to PERK WT upon incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of MyHC, but not MyoD and myogenin, were significantly reduced in PERK KO compared with PERK WT cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our analysis also showed that there was &gt;90% reduction in PERK protein levels in PERK KO cultures compared with PERK WT cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that there was increased cell death in PERK KO compared to PERK WT cultures after incubation in DM, which was also confirmed by performing Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Consistent with increased cell mortality, levels of cleaved caspase-3 were also found to be increased in PERK KO cultures compared to PERK WT cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a stable enzyme which is released in culture supernatants upon cell death. Results showed that the levels of LDH were significantly higher in culture supernatants of PERK KO cells compared to PERK WT at 48 hr after incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), further suggesting that deletion of PERK reduces the survival of progenitor cells during myogenic differentiation.</p><p>To further evaluate the role of PERK in myogenesis, we next investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PERK on the survival and differentiation of myogenic cells. Primary myogenic cultures prepared from hind limb muscle of WT mice were incubated in DM for 48 hr with vehicle alone or GSK2606414. Similar to PERK KO cultures, we observed reduced myotube formation in GSK2606414-treated cultures compared to cultures treated with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). Moreover, the levels of MyHC were considerably reduced, whereas the levels of cleaved caspase-3 were increased upon treatment of myogenic cells with GSK2606414 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

We investigated whether inhibition of PERK using GSK2606414 affects the rate of protein synthesis in myogenic cells. Results showed that the inhibition of PERK considerably increased the rate of protein synthesis in myogenic cells in GM or 12 hr of incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since myogenesis is regulated through the coordinated activation of multiple signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>), we next investigated whether the inhibition of PERK perturbs the activation of various signaling proteins in myogenic cells after incubation in DM. There was no difference in the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, Akt, or p65 (a marker of activation of canonical NF-κB pathway) protein between control and GSK2606414 treated myogenic cultures after 12 hr of incubation in DM. There was also no change in the relative levels of p100 and p52 proteins suggesting that the non-canonical NF-κB pathway was not affected upon inhibition of PERK in myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that levels of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) MAPK were significantly increased in GSK2606414-treated cultures compared to those treated with vehicle alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Moreover, we found increased levels of p-p38 MAPK in PERK KO cultures compared with PERK WT cultures upon incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Using another approach, we investigated the effects of knockdown of PERK on the activation of p38 MAPK. We generated adenoviral vectors expressing scrambled (control) shRNA or PERK shRNA. As expected, we found knockdown of PERK reduced the levels of MyHC upon incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Importantly, we found that the levels of p-p38 MAPK were considerably increased upon knockdown of PERK in myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). It is notable that the increased activation of p38MAPK was observed when cells were incubated in DM. There was no difference in the levels of p-p38 between control and GSK2606414-treated cultures in GM (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of PERK leads to hyper-activation of p38 MAPK during myogenic differentiation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22871.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PERK induces protein synthesis and activates p38 MAPK in cultured myogenic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary myogenic cells prepared from hind limb muscles of WT mice were incubated with growth medium (GM) or DM with or without 1 µM GSK2606414 for 12 hr.

We investigated whether the increased activation of p38 MAPK is responsible for increased cell death and reduced myotube formation upon inhibition of PERK. MKK3 and MKK6 are the upstream kinases which directly phosphorylate p38 MAPK in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brancho et al., 2003</xref>). To inhibit p38 MAPK, we transfected PERK WT and PERK KO myogenic cells with dominant negative (DN) mutants of MKK3 or MKK6. After 36 hr of transfection, the cells were incubated in DM for 48 hr and the myotube formation was measured. Interestingly, overexpression of DN-MKK3 or DN-MKK6 significantly improved myotube formation in PERK KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of DN-MKK3 or DN-MKK6 improved cell survival in PERK KO cultures during myogenic differentiation evidenced by the significant reduction in the levels of LDH in culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We also investigated the effect of pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK on cell survival and myotube formation in PERK KO cultures. Results showed that treatment of cells with SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, dramatically improved the survival of cells in PERK KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). While we observed increased survival of MyHC<sup>+</sup> myotubes upon treatment with SB202190, the diameter of multinucleated myotubes was smaller in PERK KO cultures. Indeed, SB202190 also reduced size of myotubes in PERK WT cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This is because p38 MAPK is also essential for terminal differentiation of myoblasts and SB202190 acutely inhibits the activity of various isoforms of p38 MAPK in mammalian cells. Collectively, these results suggest that PERK inhibition perturbs the activation of p38 MAPK which causes cell death and reduces the formation of multinucleated myotubes upon incubation in DM.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22871.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of p38 MAPK improves myogenic cell survival and myotube formation in PERK-deficient cultures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PERK WT and PERK KO primary myogenic cells were transfected (by electroporation) with vector alone or a dominant negative (DN) mutant of MKK3 or MKK6.

The UPR is comprised of the PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 pathways, which increase the protein folding capacity of the ER through augmenting the levels of chaperone proteins and attenuating global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu and Kaufman, 2006</xref>). PERK is also involved in the termination of the UPR after the stress has been relieved through activation of GADD34, which dephosphorylates p-eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the UPR has an important role in survival, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells. For example, activation of PERK predisposes human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to apoptosis, whereas closely related progenitors of HSCs exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Galen et al., 2014</xref>). In Drosophila, PERK is required for intestinal stem cell proliferation under both homeostatic and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Stem cells are also one of the important cell types most susceptible to causing tumorigenesis in mammals. Forced activation of UPR induces the differentiation of colon cancer stem cells and makes them susceptible to conventional chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wielenga et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal muscle is a highly regenerative tissue, attributed to the presence of satellite stem cells. The regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle is often impaired in many chronic disease states, genetic muscle disorders, and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in the regulation of satellite cell function has not been fully elucidated. The induction of PERK and IRE1 in satellite cells upon skeletal muscle injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and our results with P7:PERK KO mice provides the first genetic evidence that the PERK arm of the UPR is critical for satellite cell survival and function during skeletal muscle regeneration. Satellite cell-specific deletion of PERK considerably reduced the early markers of skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, deletion of PERK reduced the number of satellite cells in response to muscle injury suggesting that the PERK arm of the UPR is essential for the survival or expansion of satellite cells during muscle regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). IRE1 is an endonuclease which mediates its most effects through alternative splicing of the XBP1 transcription factor during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, we found that genetic deletion of XBP1 in satellite cells had no effect on skeletal muscle regeneration, expression of various MRFs, or Pax7 levels suggesting that IRE/XBP1 arm of the UPR is dispensable for satellite cell-mediated regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). We did not find any change in the levels of ATF6 in satellite cells of injured muscle compared to uninjured muscle of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, a previous study has shown that the ATF6 arm of the UPR is essential for selective apoptosis of differentiation-incompetent myogenic progenitor cells during skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these findings highlight that different arms of the UPR may have distinct roles in regulation of muscle progenitor cell function during embryonic development and regeneration of adult myofibers upon injury.</p><p>It was recently reported that PERK and its downstream target eIF2α are constitutively phosphorylated in freshly isolated satellite cells and their phosphorylation is reduced upon culturing for three days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been reported that the phosphorylation of eIF2α at Serine 51 residue is essential for the self-renewal of satellite cells and overexpression of a phosphorylation resistant mutant of eIF2α (i.e. eIF2αS51A) leads to the activation and progression of satellite cells into the myogenic lineage. Satellite cells expressing the eIF2αS51A mutant are capable of undergoing differentiation and fusion with injured myofibers. While the overexpression of the eIF2αS51A mutant dramatically reduced the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in naïve muscle, only a very small reduction was noticeable by the deletion of PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of PERK in satellite cell regenerative function was not investigated. It is noteworthy that in addition to PERK, there are several other known kinases, such as double stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor eIF2α kinase (HRI), and general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), which can phosphorylate eIF2α in response to stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilberg et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, PERK also has eIF2α independent functions including the activation of an antioxidant response, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy, all of which promote cell survival in stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avivar-Valderas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavener et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mollereau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the ablation of PERK in satellite cells inhibits regeneration of skeletal muscle in adult mice.

Although we found that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PERK significantly reduces satellite cells on cultured myofibers and in myofiber-free cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–K</xref>), there wasn’t a significant difference in the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells in skeletal muscle in naïve conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) or on freshly isolated EDL myofibers of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells on freshly isolated EDL myofibers of P7:PERK KO further suggests that the deletion of PERK does not affect the quiescence of satellite cells in vivo in naïve muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, when we attempted to isolate and purify satellite cells from P7:PERK KO mice, most of them failed to survive and the remainder of the cells failed to expand. These findings suggest that PERK-mediated signaling is essential for the survival of satellite cells during their activation phase, especially when they are removed from their niche. During muscle injury, the niche of satellite cells is disrupted, which leads to their activation and proliferation. Indeed, we found that the number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly increased in the regenerating myofibers of P7:PERK KO mice compared with corresponding Ctrl mice. Moreover, a significant increase in TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells was noticeable in isolated myofibers from P7:PERK KO mice after 72 hr of culturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). After around 72 hr of culturing, myofiber-associated satellite cells either self-renew or differentiate into the myogenic lineage, further suggesting that PERK is required for the survival of activated satellite cells which are capable of undergoing self-renewal or progression through the myogenic lineage. Similar to this study, PERK has also been found to play an important role in maintaining viability of acinar cells in exocrine pancreas. The exocrine pancreas develops and grows normally until p18 in PERK-KO mice, but then the acinar cells start to die and are completely lost within a few months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iida et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Published reports suggest that PERK is involved in proliferation, differentiation, and survival of several cell types. PERK-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in β-cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in low β-cell mass in pancreas at neonatal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, PERK is required for skeletal development and postnatal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the inhibition of PERK reduces the differentiation of cultured myogenic cells into myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that a significantly higher proportion of PERK-deficient cells undergoes apoptosis during myogenic differentiation. These results are consistent with many published reports demonstrating that PERK plays an important role in cell survival in multiple conditions of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avivar-Valderas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mollereau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). While PERK is highly phosphorylated in satellite cells in GM, addition of DM drastically reduces p-PERK levels. Interestingly, a small increase in p-PERK and p-eIF2α phosphorylation and expression of the downstream target CHOP is noticeable at 6 hr after addition of DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This transient increase in PERK-mediated signaling appears to be essential for the initiation of the differentiation program in satellite cells. The increase in PERK activity coincides with the elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, the executors of apoptosis and myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernando et al., 2002</xref>). It is likely that PERK-mediated signaling is a mechanism to fine-tune the survival and differentiation of myogenic cells. A previous study has shown that the incubation of myogenic cells in low serum conditions (i.e. DM) imparts significant stress on the cells and ATF6 contributes to the removal of differentiation-incompetent cells through apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, our experiments suggest that the activation of PERK is a mechanism to promote the survival of myogenic cells capable of undergoing differentiation, supported by our findings that the inhibition of PERK increases the levels of cleaved capsase-3 and apoptosis in myogenic cells upon incubation in DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, pharmacological activation of ER stress removes differentiation-incompetent myoblasts and improves the formation of myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakanishi et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, PERK-mediated up-regulation of CHOP may also regulate myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alter and Bengal, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The p38 MAPK is activated at later stages of myogenesis to initiate a muscle gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lluís et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). However, activation of p38 MAPK in satellite cells causes precocious differentiation and diminishes their ability to undergo proliferation to repair the injured skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segalés et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that the inhibition of PERK leads to the activation of p38 MAPK in myogenic cultures during differentiation without having any significant effect on the activation of other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Available literature suggests that p38 MAPK is one of the very important signaling pathways that gets activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses and leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the activation of p38 MAPK is an important mechanism of increased myogenic cell death and reduced myotube formation upon inhibition of PERK both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of p38 MAPK improved the survival of cultured PERK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and skeletal muscle regeneration in P7:PERK KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While the activation of p38 MAPK diminishes survival of PERK KO myogenic cells, it remains unknown whether p38 MAPK is directly regulated through PERK-mediated signaling or if it is a result of increased cellular stress due to an increased load of newly synthesized proteins upon inhibition of PERK. PERK promotes the antioxidant capacity of cells by directly phosphorylating the NF-E2-Related Factor 2 transcription factor, which induces the expression of various anti-oxidant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maas and Diehl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motohashi and Yamamoto, 2004</xref>). In addition, PERK has been found to regulate calcium dynamics in primary cortical neurons and pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, a previous study has demonstrated PERK-dependent activation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK upon disruption of calcium homeostasis in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that inhibition of PERK disrupts oxidative balance and calcium homeostasis which lead to myogenic cell death through the activation of p38 MAPK.</p><p>In summary, our study provides initial evidence that the PERK arm of the UPR is essential for the survival of muscle progenitor cells during myogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provide the basis for the evaluation of PERK activity in human muscle diseases and in preclinical models of muscle degenerative disorders to determine whether increased PERK activity may prove to be beneficial.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Satellite cell specific inducible <italic>Eif2ak3</italic>-knockout (i.e. P7:PERK KO) or <italic>Xbp1</italic>-knockout mice (i.e. P7:XBP1 KO) mice were generated by crossing <italic>Pax7-CreER</italic> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012476">IMSR_JAX:012476</ext-link>) with <italic>Eif2ak3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:023066">IMSR_JAX:023066</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>) or <italic>Xbp1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (RRID:MGI:3774017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hetz et al., 2008</xref>) mice, respectively.

FACS analysis was performed on a C6 Accuri cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with three lasers. The output data was processed and plots were prepared using FCS Express 4 RUO software (De Novo Software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Assay</title><p>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR were performed using a method as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hindi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogura et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, total RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle tissues of mice or cultured myogenic cells using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences) and a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. First-strand cDNA for PCR analyses was made with a commercially available kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences). The quantification of mRNA expression was performed using the SYBR Green dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences) method on a sequence-detection system (model 7300; Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences). Primers were designed with Vector NTI software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences) and are available from the authors on request. Data normalization was accomplished with the endogenous control (β-actin), and the normalized values were subjected to a 2<sup>−ΔΔ<italic>Ct</italic></sup> formula to calculate the fold change between control and experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy J Wagers (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the role of PERK and XBP1, components of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response, in satellite cell fate and function in muscle regeneration. The authors use a <italic>Pax7-CreER</italic> dependent ablation system to inducibly delete these genes in satellite cells and report that deletion of PERK causes deficits in muscle repair, associated with normal numbers of satellite cells at steady state but increased presence of apoptotic cells after muscle injury in vivo and during ex vivo culture. Interestingly, satellite cells isolated from PERK-deleted mice can grow in culture when associated with myofibers, but fail to survive in purified cultures. In addition, PERK suppression seems to impair myogenic differentiation potentially due to over-activation of p38 MAPK. The manuscript is well written and provides new information about the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle repair and muscle stem cells. However, there are a number of aspects of the paper that require further clarification. About half of these will require new experimentation, and half should be addressable through revision/clarification of the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must clarify in the Methods and Results sections how old mice were when TAM was injected. At present, it is only stated that the mice were injured at 8-10 weeks of age, but it is unclear how many days before the injury TAM was administered (this matters because satellite cells do incorporate into muscle fibers during muscle growth and even at low levels at steady state, so depending on the timing of Cre deletion, there could be partial loss of function in muscle fibers as well).</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the authors should clarify what conclusion(s) can be drawn from reduced wet muscle weight in scPERK<sup>-/-</sup> muscles. Would dry weights be more revealing? Stemming from the reduced wet weight, the authors should evaluate possible blunting of inflammation in this model using CD45 or F4/80 immunostaining.</p><p>3) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F–G</xref> appear illogical as Myf5 is expressed before MyoD, which is then followed by Myogenin, however, in the figure only Myf5 and Myogenin show differences. It would seem more logical that MyoD would also be reduced as this is in the middle of this signalling pathway that leads to differentiation. Please comment on this apparent discrepancy in the text.</p><p>4) The authors should clarify whether PERK plays a role in differentiation mainly by mediating apoptosis of differentiation incompetent cells or through regulating myogenic genes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows a decrease in Myogenin levels in vivo using PERK knockouts, however PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cells show no change in the levels of Myogenin and MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and J</xref> with GSK2606414)). Related to this, what is the reason for reduced fiber CSA in PERK null mutants? It would be beneficial to report data as the average minimal Feret's diameter rather than CSA of muscle fibers during regeneration, since it is difficult to cut muscle at a perfect perpendicular in this tissue state.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref> would benefit from double staining from whole tissue sections rather than one fiber. At the moment, it would seem that there is more satellite cell self-renewal in PERK<sup>+/+</sup> mice, and yet they exhibit the same number of differentiating cells. This is odd as there are more fibers being regenerated following damage in the PERK<sup>+/+</sup> mice, which would likely require more differentiating cells.</p><p>6) The authors' conclusion from their enumeration of different subsets of Pax7/Myod expressing cells in culture (&quot;Taken together, these results suggest that the inactivation of PERK diminishes the self-renewal capacity of satellite cells.&quot;) overstates the data. Their data are consistent with the notion that loss of PERK activity reduces the proportion of cells thought to be capable of self-renewal (the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> subset), but their experiment does not assay self-renewal itself (which would require tracking of either individual cell divisions or minimally of input cell number versus output cell number). Similarly, they do not actually measure proliferation (just the fraction of cells double positive for these markers). Please re-phrase. Finally, the changes themselves are a bit subtle, given the profound effects on regeneration seen in vivo – can the authors comment on this?</p><p>7) The percentages for the apoptosis studies seem a bit conflicting with the authors' conclusion. They conclude that the self-renewing cells are the ones undergoing apoptosis (subsection “Deletion of PERK induces apoptosis in myogenic cells during regenerative myogenesis.”), but these cells represent only 9% of the cells in these cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); whereas there are 15% TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells. Please reconcile this discrepancy, and define the identity of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells in the regenerating muscle.</p><p>8) The data and interpretation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> need further clarification. The authors show kinetics of p-PERK in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). p-PERK is apparent in undifferentiated cells and declines during differentiation. However, the transient increase in p-PERK at 6 and 12 hr post differentiation that the authors postulate coincides with increased caspase 3 activity at 12hr is not convincing. The increase in p-PERK at 6-12hr is modest, although activation of caspase 3 is robust until 48hr. Moreover, in other panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), caspase 3 levels in control cells are minimal at 48hr in DM. The authors conclude “the transient increase in PERK signalling appears to be important for initiation of differentiation […] inhibition of PERK 24 hr after addition of DM had no effect”. The inhibition of pPERK 24 hr after addition of DM should not have an effect as there are negligible levels of pPERK at that point. Thus, the correlation of a presumed transient increase in pPERK and caspase 3 activity is unclear. Please clarify the text to address this point.</p><p>9) Is p38 signalling elevated in vivo, and does inhibition of p38 signalling impact the regeneration defect in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> mutants?</p><p>10) All of the studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are performed with PERK<sup>-</sup> cells; however, comparison is needed to PERK<sup>+</sup> in order to support the conclusion that PERK inhibition causes aberrant activation of p38 signaling (subsection “Inhibition of p38 MAPK reduces mortality and improves myotube formation in PERK-/- cultures”). In this case, one could expect the effects to be specific to PERK<sup>-</sup>inhibited cells, and this should be tested directly by analyzing WT vs. PERK<sup>-</sup> cells in parallel.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22871.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors must clarify in the Methods and Results sections how old mice were when TAM was injected.

We had also considered reviewers’ point about the possible incorporation of PERK<sup>-/-</sup> satellite cells into the muscle fiber prior to muscle injury and regeneration; therefore, we isolated myofibers from scPERK<sup>+/+</sup> and scPERK<sup>-/-</sup> mice and immediately fixed them for Pax7 and MyoD expression analysis in satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not find any difference in the number of myofiber associated Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells between the two groups at 0h post isolation. We also did not detect any MyoD<sup>+</sup> satellite cells at this time point, which excludes the possibility of precocious differentiation of PERK<sup>-/-</sup> satellite cells. We have also now included a schematic to show the time of TAM injection, muscle injury, and analysis of regeneration phenotype. Please refer to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. We would also like to mention that in some initial experiments, we used 4-month old mice and obtained the same muscle regeneration defects in scPERK<sup>-/-</sup> (now referred to as P7:PERK KO) mice.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the authors should clarify what conclusion(s) can be drawn from reduced wet muscle weight in scPERK-/- muscles. Would dry weights be more revealing? Stemming from the reduced wet weight, the authors should evaluate possible blunting of inflammation in this model using CD45 or F4/80 immunostaining.</italic> </p><p>This figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) depicts the weight of TA muscle upon isolation from tendon to tendon. The wet weight is suggestive of potential differences in muscle regeneration. After injection of myotoxin, muscle fibers undergo necrosis which leads to reduced muscle weight. The muscle weight starts increasing when the regeneration starts occurring. If muscle regeneration is inhibited, the muscle weight is generally reduced. Although this is not a conclusive phenomenon, many studies including from our group have previously used wet muscle weight as one of the criteria to study muscle regeneration (e.g. Ogura et al., Nat Commun. 2015 Dec 9;6:10123; Hong et al. J Clin Invest. 2012 Nov;122(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>):3873-87). In our model, PERK is only deleted in satellite cells which contribute minimally (if any) towards inflammation. However, on reviewer’s suggestion, we investigated whether PERK deletion in satellite cells may have altered the inflammatory immune response in regenerating muscle. We have now quantified the percentage of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in TA muscle at 5d post-BaCl2-medited injury. However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in injured TA muscle of Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F–G</xref> appear illogical as Myf5 is expressed before MyoD, which is then followed by Myogenin, however, in the figure only Myf5 and Myogenin show differences. It would seem more logical that MyoD would also be reduced as this is in the middle of this signalling pathway that leads to differentiation. Please comment on this apparent discrepancy in the text.</italic> </p><p>There was certainly some problems in this qRT-PCR analysis. We also noticed that there was no significant increase in MyoD mRNA levels at day 5 after injury even in control mice which is a well-established phenomenon. We revisited our qRT-PCR data and found that there were some outliers and there were primer dimers in a few samples in the MyoD expression analysis. We have now repeated this experiment with a new set of mice. Consistent with published reports, we find an increase in transcript levels of MyoD in 5d-injured TA muscle of scPERK<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Additionally, there is a significant decrease in mRNA levels of MyoD in 5d-injured TA muscle of P7:PERK KO compared to Ctrl mice. Moreover, the reviewers will find that our mRNA data for MRFs are consistent with their protein levels presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should clarify whether PERK plays a role in differentiation mainly by mediating apoptosis of differentiation incompetent cells or through regulating myogenic genes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows a decrease in Myogenin levels in vivo using PERK knockouts, however PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cells show no change in the levels of Myogenin and MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and J</xref> with GSK2606414)). Related to this, what is the reason for reduced fiber CSA in PERK null mutants? It would be beneficial to report data as the average minimal Feret's diameter rather than CSA of muscle fibers during regeneration, since it is difficult to cut muscle at a perfect perpendicular in this tissue state.</italic> </p><p>We believe that PERK is required for the survival of myogenic cells capable of differentiating because we see significant more cell death in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cultures after induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). PERK appears to have no direct effect on the expression of myogenic genes evidenced by our observation that the inhibition of PERK does not reduce levels of MyoD and myogenin in cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,J</xref>). We see a reduction in MRFs (i.e. myogenin and MyoD) in regenerating myofibers of P7:PERK KO mice because the myofiber formation is reduced due to increased mortality of muscle progenitor cells available to participate in regenerative myogenesis. The injured muscle environment is a heterogeneous mix of myogenic and non-myogenic (e.g. inflammatory cells, fibroblast, fat cells, etc.) cells. A reduction in MRF’s in scPERK<sup>-/-</sup> muscle can signify two possibilities as suggested by reviewers: (a) Deletion of PERK in satellite cells is directly regulating the expression of myogenic genes and therefore inhibiting differentiation; and/or (b) ablation of PERK in satellite cells is leading to myogenic cell death and therefore reducing the number of cells available to differentiate and complete the myogenic program, which will result in an overall reduction in the number and therefore percentage of myogenic cells within the injured muscle environment. For this reason, we performed the same analysis in vitro where the experimental dishes contained an equal number of pure myogenic cells and therefore any detected differences in specific RNA or protein levels will reflect a change in expression and will not be based on the proportion of a specific cell type amongst other cells as is the case in injured muscle microenvironment in vivo. If lack of PERK in satellite cells was directly regulating the expression of MRFs then we should have seen a reduction in their levels in vitro as well, however this is not the case. We observed that the levels of MRF’s were not significantly affected while the mortality of myogenic cells was significantly increased when P7:PERK KOwere incubated in differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings lead us to conclude that myogenic cell death is the main mechanism by which muscle regeneration is compromised in P7:PERK KOmice. Stemming from those notes, we believe that the fiber CSA in 5d regenerating P7:PERK KOmuscle is reduced because there is a suboptimum number of surviving myogenic cells that will carry out the regeneration program and therefore the number of fusing myoblast per myofiber is reduced which will lead to a reduction in the fiber CSA. We also agree with the reviewers that average minimal Feret's diameter is a better measure than average CSA for such studies. We have now also included minimal Feret’s diameter wherever applicable in this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref> would benefit from double staining from whole tissue sections rather than one fiber. At the moment, it would seem that there is more satellite cell self-renewal in PERK<sup>+/+</sup> mice, and yet they exhibit the same number of differentiating cells. This is odd as there are more fibers being regenerated following damage in the PERK<sup>+/+</sup> mice, which would likely require more differentiating cells.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed the double immunostaining for Pax7 and MyoD proteins on muscle sections from Ctrl and P7:PERK KO mice. Consistent with our analysis on isolated myofibers, we also found that the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells is reduced in P7:PERK KO mice TA muscle after 5 days of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), which suggests a reduction in cells capable of self-renewing as stated previously. However unlike our ex vivo cultured myofiber data, we found that the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells were also significantly reduced in 5d injured P7:PERK KO TA muscle which is consistent with the notion that there are less myogenic cells available to participate in the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As far as the seeming discrepancy in the ex vivo vs. in vivo results, this might be attributed to the variation in the corresponding myogenic environment between the two settings. It’s notable that in the injured muscle environment, factors that are intrinsic and extrinsic to the myofiber and satellite cells direct the signaling cascades to progress from pro-proliferation to pro-differentiation as regeneration ensues, which terminates with the fusion of myoblasts with each other or with the existing injured myofibers. However, in the ex vivo myofiber cultures, the myofibers and associated satellite cells are constantly cultured under proliferation conditions in growth medium, and although satellite cells do partially recapitulate the myogenic program as far as MRFs’ expression, they never completely differentiate and fuse with each other or associated myofiber within the 72h time point of culturing. Our findings indicate that PERK<sup>-/-</sup> myogenic cells undergo notable cell death under differentiation conditions (as evidenced by our in vitro results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) which might explain why myofiber-associated satellite cells cultured ex vivoare displaying a milder phenotype when compared to differentiating myogenic cultures and during in vivo muscle regeneration.</p><p><italic>6) The authors' conclusion from their enumeration of different subsets of Pax7/Myod expressing cells in culture (&quot;Taken together, these results suggest that the inactivation of PERK diminishes the self-renewal capacity of satellite cells.&quot;) overstates the data.

Similarly, they do not actually measure proliferation (just the fraction of cells double positive for these markers). Please re-phrase. Finally, the changes themselves are a bit subtle, given the profound effects on regeneration seen</italic> in vivo <italic>– can the authors comment on this?</italic> </p><p>We have now removed the sentence “Taken together, these results suggest that the inactivation of PERK diminishes the self-renewal capacity of satellite cells”. Per reviewers’ suggestion we have now concluded our paragraph stating that “These findings suggest that PERK is essential for maintaining the pool of satellite cells capable of undergoing self-renewal, proliferation, and fusion with injured myofibers” We agree that the changes observed in ex vivo experiment are not dramatic but they are significant. Similar to what was mentioned above to address the previous comment, we think that the milder phenotype ex vivo is due to the fact that the myofibers are constantly cultured under proliferation conditions. Our new analysis on injured muscle sections showed that the lack of PERK drastically reduces the number of remaining and possibly surviving Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is responsible for reduced muscle formation both in vivo and in vitro. We could have removed ex vivo myofiber results but we believe that it is important to highlight that PERK has a more important role in the survival of myogenic cells in differentiation conditions.</p><p><italic>7) The percentages for the apoptosis studies seem a bit conflicting with the authors' conclusion. They conclude that the self-renewing cells are the ones undergoing apoptosis (subsection “Deletion of PERK induces apoptosis in myogenic cells during regenerative myogenesis.”), but these cells represent only 9% of the cells in these cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); whereas there are 15% TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells. Please reconcile this discrepancy, and define the identity of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells in the regenerating muscle.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the self-renewing cells associated with P7:PERK KO myofiber cultures are not enough to account for all the TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells in the same cultures. We attempted to define the identity of those TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells (both in vitro and in vivo) through repeatedly trying multiple protocols to obtain double staining for TUNEL and Pax7 or TUNEL and MyoD. However, we were unsuccessful in achieving such double staining. It seems since all three labels are localized in the nucleus, we could not obtain reliable staining for TUNEL combined with Pax7 and/or MyoD. However our new results demonstrate that regeneration-defective TA muscle of P7:PERK KO mice display a reduced number of both Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> atday 5 following injury, which clearly demonstrates a loss of satellite cells capable of self-renewing, proliferating, and possibly differentiating under such conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results combined with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–D</xref> lead us to conclude that proliferating, differentiating, and self-renewing PERK<sup>-/-</sup> satellite cells participating in myogenic regeneration undergo apoptotic cell death once muscle differentiation signaling has ensued. We have now removed the sentences that the “self-renewing cells are the ones undergoing apoptosis”.</p><p><italic>8) The data and interpretation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> need further clarification. The authors show kinetics of p-PERK in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). p-PERK is apparent in undifferentiated cells and declines during differentiation. However, the transient increase in p-PERK at 6 and 12 hr post differentiation that the authors postulate coincides with increased caspase 3 activity at 12hr is not convincing. The increase in p-PERK at 6-12hr is modest, although activation of caspase 3 is robust until 48hr. Moreover, in other panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), caspase 3 levels in control cells are minimal at 48hr in DM. The authors conclude “the transient increase in PERK signalling appears to be important for initiation of differentiation […] inhibition of PERK 24 hr after addition of DM had no effect”. The inhibition of pPERK 24 hr after addition of DM should not have an effect as there are negligible levels of pPERK at that point. Thus, the correlation of a presumed transient increase in pPERK and caspase 3 activity is unclear. Please clarify the text to address this point.</italic> </p><p>The quality of the p-PERK immunoblot was certainly not good in our previous submission. Many times the intensity of the signal in western blotting depends on quality of antibody and may be on conditions of the cells (i.e. passage number etc.). We have now performed another independent experiment and measured the levels of pPERK and caspase-3 and other markers of ER stress and apoptosis. The reviewers will find that there is a clear increase in the pPERK levels from 6-24h after addition of DM. This coincides with the activation of caspase-3 which was previously found to be required for terminal differentiation of myogenic cells after addition of DM (Fernando et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Aug 20;99(17):11025-30). In this report, authors demonstrate that myogenic differentiation and apoptotic cell death share similar signaling events that include but not limited to caspase-3 and PARP activation. In this section of the manuscript, our intention was to make a correlation between PERK phosphorylation and caspase-3 and PARP activation as mediators and markers of myogenic differentiation. Our findings indicate that phosphorylation of PERK is required to initiate the normal myogenic program which is marked by caspase-3 and PARP activation. We have now added a paragraph about this in the “Results” section of our revised manuscript.</p><p>The differences observed in the expression of caspase-3 activation at 48h in different blots of different figures are merely due to variation in blot exposure time and do not reflect a difference in expression at this time point. We also agree with the reviewers regarding the findings in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 of our original manuscript. Based on the kinetics of PERK phosphorylation during differentiation, it would indeed be logical that inhibition of PERK after 24h of addition of DM should not have an effect on myogenic differentiation. We performed this experiment as proof of concept for this point. However, we have now removed this data set in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>9) Is p38 signalling elevated</italic> in vivo<italic>, and does inhibition of p38 signalling impact the regeneration defect in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> mutants?</italic> </p><p>This is a really good point. We have now compared the levels of p38 MAPK in vivo. Consistent with our in vitro findings, we observe a significant increase in p-p38 levels in satellite cells and the whole injured TA muscle of P7:PERK KO mice compared with Ctrlmice. Using a pharmacological inhibitor of p38MAPK we have also now studied the effect of inhibition of p38 on muscle regeneration in vivo. Importantly, we found that the inhibition of p38 improves TA muscle regeneration P7:PERK KOmice. Results are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p><italic>10) All of the studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are performed with PERK<sup>-</sup> cells; however, comparison is needed to PERK<sup>+</sup> in order to support the conclusion that PERK inhibition causes aberrant activation of p38 signaling (subsection “Inhibition of p38 MAPK reduces mortality and improves myotube formation in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cultures”). In this case, one could expect the effects to be specific to PERK<sup>-</sup> inhibited cells, and this should be tested directly by analyzing WT vs. PERK<sup>-</sup> cells in parallel.</italic> </p><p>We have used appropriate controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, both PERK<sup>+/+</sup> and PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cells were used. We believe reviewers were referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We used PERK<sup>+/+</sup> and PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cells for the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A and B</xref>. However, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8C and D</xref>, we did not show the results for PERK<sup>+/+</sup> cells. This is because inhibition of p38 in control (PERK<sup>+/+</sup>) conditions resulted in inhibition of differentiation which is not surprising, as a physiological level of p38 upregulation is a critical requirement for adequate myogenic differentiation and a disruption in this normal biological event will interfere with the progression of the myogenic program. However, we do see a rescue in PERK<sup>-/-</sup> cell differentiation following p38 inhibition because those cells express a supra-physiological level of p38 which results in cell death due to activation of apoptotic pathways. Per reviewers’ suggestion we have now included the data from the PERK<sup>+/+</sup> cells under the same conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
