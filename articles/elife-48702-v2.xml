In monkeys attempting to detect a single omission of isochronous visual stimulus, we found that neurons in the caudate nucleus showed increased activity for each stimulus in sequence, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus showed decreased activity. Firing modulation in the majority of caudate neurons and all cerebellar neurons was proportional to the stimulus interval, but a quarter of caudate neurons displayed a clear duration tuning. Furthermore, the time course of population activity in the cerebellum well predicted stimulus timing, whereas that in the caudate reflected stochastic variation of response latency. Electrical stimulation to the respective recording sites confirmed a causal role in the detection of stimulus omission. These results suggest that striatal neurons might represent periodic response preparation while cerebellar nuclear neurons may play a role in temporal prediction of periodic events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>temporal prediction</kwd><kwd>rhythm</kwd><kwd>caudate nucleus</kwd><kwd>dentate nucleus</kwd><kwd>single neuron</kwd><kwd>nonhuman primate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H03539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kameda</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H04928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H05523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18J20197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons in the striatum exhibited periodic firing in monkeys attempting to detect omission of repetitive visual stimulus, while the phase of neuronal activity differed from that observed in the cerebellum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When listening to music, we often feel rhythms and sometimes dance to them. It has been suggested that temporal information processing for periodic events differs from that for a single interval, such as pressing a stopwatch at a specific time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grahn and Brett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel and Iversen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ross et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teki et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Teki et al., 2011b</xref>).

However, as the number of physiological studies in experimental animals are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadena-Valencia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lakatos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renoult et al., 2006</xref>), how individual neurons in these regions represent periodic timing remains largely unknown. Furthermore, most of the previous studies used timing tasks that required rhythmic movements, making it difficult to dissociate sensory from motor components in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider and Ghose, 2012</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of clarifying the neuronal mechanism of rhythm processing, we have developed the oddball detection paradigm that requires temporal prediction of periodic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>). In this task, subjects are asked to detect the unexpected omission or the change in color of isochronous repetitive visual stimuli in the range of several hundreds of milliseconds. Importantly, to detect the stimulus omission, the subjects need to predict the timing of each stimulus in the sequence but are not allowed to make any movements until the omission. When tested in humans, the subjects indeed relied on temporal prediction to detect the stimulus omission for sequences slower than 4 Hz, whereas they detected a slight stumbling of stimulus stream for faster sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohmae and Tanaka, 2016</xref>). We also demonstrated in monkeys that neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus during the task exhibited entrainment of activity, and that neuronal modulation for each stimulus was proportional to the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>). Because local inactivation and electrical stimulation applied to the recording sites delayed and promoted the detection of the stimulus omission, respectively, the periodic neuronal signals in the cerebellar nucleus likely contributed to the prediction of stimulus timing during the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohmae and Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the cerebellum is not the only subcortical structure involved in rhythm perception. As above, evidence shows that the basal ganglia are also essential for temporal information processing for both periodic and single event timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buhusi and Meck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coull et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merchant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>). In particular, dopamine signaling in the striatum appears to play a crucial role in regulating the signal flow in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways during timing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Corte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emmons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim and Narayanan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we examined neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus during the oddball detection task in monkeys, and then compared the results with those obtained previously from the cerebellar dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>). We show that neurons in the caudate nucleus also exhibit periodic activity for isochronous repetitive visual stimuli, whereas the time courses of neuronal activity were clearly different from those in the cerebellum. Further quantitative analyses suggest that the caudate nucleus might be responsible for periodic motor preparation, while the cerebellar dentate nucleus may be involved in temporal prediction of periodic sensory event which is necessary to detect the stimulus omission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Periodic neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus</title><p>A total of 129 task-related neurons were recorded from the head of the caudate nucleus (1–5 mm anterior to the anterior commissure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in three monkeys.

During central fixation, a saccade target was presented either left or right of the fixation point (FP).

Monkeys were trained to make a saccade in response to the omission or deviation of the repetitive visual stimuli.

The firing modulation was much lower when the animal prepared for detecting the changes in stimulus color (deviant condition, blue trace and rasters). Like this example, the majority of caudate neurons responding to the repetitive stimuli (74%, 83/109) exhibited a gradual rise in firing modulation for each stimulus during the trial, while only one neuron responded roughly equally to each stimulus in the sequence.

However, during recording from the deep cerebellar nucleus in the previous study, animals were not informed in advance of oddball conditions so that they were required to predict stimulus timing in all of the trials. To test the effect of prior instruction of oddball condition, we recorded from additional 18 neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus in monkey H in separate sessions. We found that the time course of neuronal activity was similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, and the times of peak and trough of neuronal activity were not significantly altered by the instruction, although the magnitude of firing modulation differed between these populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next examined how precisely neuronal activity in these subcortical structures signaled the timing of each next stimulus. We assumed that the downstream structure might decode the elapsed time when the firing rate reached a certain threshold that was proportional to the size of firing modulation. First, we measured the maximal firing modulation as the difference between the peak and trough of population activity during the period from the last stimulus to the time of stimulus omission (i.e. the expected time of stimulus appearance) for each ISI. Then, we defined the predicted timing as the time when the firing modulation reached a certain level of the maximal value. We searched for the optimal %threshold (1% steps) across all the ISIs of 300, 400 and 600 ms that minimized the sum of the squared difference between the predicted and actual timing of the next stimulus (temporal prediction error, Δt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> plots the prediction errors in different interval conditions, showing that the stimulus timing was better predicted by neuronal activity in the cerebellum than the caudate nucleus (mean Δt = 63 versus 28 ms; bootstrap 95% CI [46, 81] and [14 44], respectively). These results suggest that the cerebellum may carry more accurate temporal information than the striatum when predicting timing of periodic events.</p><p>The previous study using the oddball detection task demonstrated that neuronal activity in the cerebellar nucleus at the time of stimulus omission correlated with saccade latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>). The other study in our laboratory using the self-timing task showed that the stochastic variation of saccade latency differently affected neuronal activity in the caudate and the cerebellar dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we next asked whether the timing of neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial latency during the oddball task differed between these subcortical structures. To examine this, data for each neuron were divided into six groups according to saccade latency and were aligned with either stimulus omission or saccades (Materials and methods). Then, we measured the timing of stochastic neuronal variation across different groups by performing ANOVA for every millisecond. Specifically, when we aligned the data with stimulus omission, the traces of population activity for the six latency groups were initially comparable but gradually varied as time passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, left panels). We searched for the start of the diverging point back in time, and the time when p-value consistently (&gt;100 ms) surpassed 0.05 was taken as the start of neuronal variation. Similarly, when we aligned the data with saccade initiation, the neuronal activity initially varied between the groups but become indistinguishable around the time of saccades (right panels). We searched for the end of neuronal variation in order of time and detected the time when p-value consistently became &gt; 0.05. In the caudate nucleus, the population activities for different latency groups varied until just before saccade onsets (–161 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, vertical dashed line), while neuronal activity around the time of saccades (±50 ms) were comparable between the groups (one-way ANOVA, p=0.90). In contrast, the stochastic neuronal variation in the cerebellar nucleus disappeared well before saccade initiation (–428 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We evaluated the difference in timing of neuronal variation using the bootstrap procedure and found that when the data were aligned with saccade initiation the trial-by-trial variation disappeared earlier in the cerebellum than the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). When the same sets of data were aligned with the stimulus omission, the stochastic variation tended to emerge earlier in the cerebellum than the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Most neurons showed phasic activity that increased gradually as the repetition progressed and peaked around 160 ms following the visual stimulus. The firing modulation for the repetitive stimulus did not develop as great as missing condition when monkeys attempted to detect the change in stimulus color (deviant condition), although the animals were equally required to make a saccade to the visible target. We also found that electrical stimulation delivered to the recording sites promoted the detection of stimulus omission but not the detection of stimulus change. These results suggest that neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus might be relevant to periodic motor preparation with strong enhancement by temporal prediction and may be causally linked with the detection of stimulus omission.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Entrained neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus</title><p>Most (88%) caudate neurons with periodic activity exhibited a strong burst of activity around the time of saccades, suggesting that they could somehow play a role in eye movement generation. In support of this, the magnitude of periodic activity in one fifth of individual neurons as well as in the population of neurons altered depending on saccade direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It has been widely accepted that an increase of neuronal firing in the caudate nucleus results in a reduction of activity in the substantia nigra, leading to disinhibition of neurons in the superior colliculus which facilitates saccade generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hikosaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shires et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, electrical stimulation delivered to the caudate nucleus has been shown to evoke contraversive saccades with short latency (typically &lt; 150 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kitama et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, however, electrical microstimulation applied to the recording sites failed to elicit immediate saccades but instead reduced the latency of targeting saccades in both directions. Given that the stimulation parameters in our study was comparable or even stronger than those in the previous studies, the differential stimulation effects might be due to the difference in stimulation sites within the caudate nucleus (i.e. more anterior sites in this study) or the difference in behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Munoz, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the effects of electrical stimulation in many sites were evident only when the animals prepared for saccades in response to the stimulus omission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). These results suggest that neurons with periodic activity may not directly participate in the triggering of saccades, although they could be related to saccade preparation. Previous studies demonstrated that neuronal firing in the primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Renoult et al., 2006</xref>) as well as the power of gamma-band oscillation in the supplementary motor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadena-Valencia et al., 2018</xref>) exhibited periodic modulation in anticipation of the trigger signal for reaching movements. Considering these results together, the temporal prediction of repetitive events might be represented by periodic motor preparation in the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry.</p><p>We also found that the periodic activity was much less when monkeys prepared for saccades in response to the changes in stimulus color. Because the repetitive visual stimuli and required movements were identical between the oddball conditions, the different firing modulation was likely attributed to the need for temporal prediction in the missing but not in the deviant conditions. Alternatively, the difference in neuronal activity might come from the fact that there was an explicit cue for the timing of the targeting saccade in the deviant condition, while the animals needed to internally determine movement timing for stimulus absence in the missing condition. In relation to this, previous studies have shown that neuronal firing and stimulation effects in several brain areas are different between self-initiated and triggered movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maimon and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner and Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Donkelaar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimnik et al., 2019</xref>), while significant preparatory activity can be observed when the timing of the trigger signal is certainly predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romo and Schultz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka, 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is also well documented that neurons in the caudate nucleus modulate firing in association with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lau and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultz, 2016</xref>). However, in this study, monkeys obtained an equal amount of reward for every successful trial. These results indicate that the differential modulation of periodic activity between the conditions unlikely reflected reward information. Nevertheless, the activity of these neurons as well as behavioral parameters could be altered by systematic changes in the reward schedule. For example, the gradual rise of neuronal activity during stimulus repetition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which likely reflected temporal expectation of the stimulus omission in each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>), might be scaled by the amount of reward. This possibility is to be tested in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison of periodic activity between caudate and cerebellum</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that different time intervals might be processed by different groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heron et al., 2012</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, neurons in several areas in the cerebral cortex have been shown to exhibit tuned representation of specific intervals during rhythmic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>). We also found in this study that a minority of neurons in the caudate nucleus showed a tuned representation for specific time intervals (200–400 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>), while the majority of neurons exhibited monotonical increase of firing modulation as a function of ISI. In contrast, tuned representation for short ISIs was not found in the cerebellar dentate nucleus in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the duration tuning might only be common in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways but not in the cortico-cerebellar pathways, although alternative possibilities still remain. For example, we could find tuned representation in the cerebellum if we tested for a wider range of intervals than in the previous study (100–600 ms), or if we exhaustively searched for relevant neurons in the other cerebellar nuclei.</p><p>Another line of evidence suggests a scalable neuronal representation of interval timing. When monitoring a single interval, the time courses of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex and the striatum are temporally scaled according to the duration of the measured interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Alteration in the speed of neuronal processing in the population of neurons could be achieved by changing the initial state or the overall level of excitatory input to the recurrent network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray and Escola, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Tanaka, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the caudate neurons found in the present study significantly altered the <italic>magnitude</italic> of firing modulation for different ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the temporal information processing for periodic events might differ from the scaling representation for single-event timing. Similar to neuronal firing in the caudate and the cerebellar nucleus, temporally specific gain modulation has also been reported in the beta power in the sensorimotor cortices and the neural coherence through the cerebello-cortical pathways during passive listening to isochronous auditory rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujioka et al., 2012</xref>). The temporally specific gain modulation for periodic timing may be an essential framework to understand neural mechanisms of rhythm perception.</p><p>Another interesting feature was the different time courses of neuronal activity between the caudate and the cerebellum. Neurons in the caudate nucleus elevated activity for each repetitive stimulus, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus reduced activity that gradually resumed and peaked around the time of the next stimulus. When we attempted to decode the timing of each next stimulus from the time course of population activity, the temporal prediction was better for the cerebellum than the caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This was because the duration of transient decrements of activity in the cerebellar nucleus was highly dependent on the ISI, while that of transient increases of activity in the caudate nucleus was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>).</p><p>We also found that neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial variation of saccade latency emerged at different timings in these subcortical structures. When the data were aligned with saccades, the trial-by-trial variation disappeared early in the cerebellum but persisted late in the caudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). When the same sets of data were aligned with stimulus omission, the stochastic variation in the cerebellum started well before but that in the caudate followed the stimulus omission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Given that the reaction time in our behavioral paradigm depends both on the latencies of omission detection and saccade generation, the different timing of stochastic variation may indicate distinct roles of these subcortical structures; the cerebellum might be responsible for the detection of stimulus omission, while the caudate nucleus might contribute to periodic saccade preparation. Because our behavioral paradigm requires both sensory and motor processing, it is difficult to dissociate these components in neuronal activity. However, close comparisons of directionality and time course of neuronal activity suggest that temporal prediction in the caudate nucleus might be represented in motor rather than sensory domain. Similarly, a recent study has shown that the temporal prediction of alternating imaginary targets recruits gamma-bursts in the supplementary motor area, which appears to reflect periodic motor preparation for reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadena-Valencia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we explored signals in the caudate nucleus because our behavioral paradigm required eye movements and because the striatum has been shown to play a role in timing. However, the signals in two other nuclei in the basal ganglia may be also worth exploring during the task. For comparison with the deep cerebellar nucleus, neuronal signals in the output node of the basal ganglia, such as the substantia nigra, need to be clarified in future study. Exploring neuronal signals in the putamen is also important because previous studies suggest its role in timing, especially when somatic movements are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rao et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that neurons in the caudate nucleus exhibited periodic increases of activity in response to isochronous repetitive visual stimulus. The magnitude of activity depended both on the number of repetitions and the ISI, similar to the activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). However, unlike neurons in the cerebellum, the duration of firing modulation for each stimulus was almost constant in the caudate nucleus, making it difficult to decode the timing of each next stimulus from the population activity of striatal neurons. In addition, the neuronal correlates of stochastic variations of saccade timing started earlier in the cerebellum than the striatum, suggesting that they might be involved in the temporal prediction of stimulus occurrence and periodic motor preparation, respectively. In future studies, dissociation of sensory from motor components of periodic activity is needed to elucidate different contributions of these subcortical structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Three Japanese monkeys (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>; one female and two males, monkeys G, H and L; 6.0–7.6 kg) were used. All experimental protocols were evaluated and approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Care and Use Committee. The basic surgical procedures of animal preparation were identical to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka, 2007</xref>). Briefly, the animals were implanted with a pair of head holders and an eye coil under general isoflurane anesthesia in separate surgeries. Analgesics were administered during and a few days following each surgery. After full recovery from the surgery, the animals were trained in the oddball detection task (see below) for several months. Then, a recording cylinder was implanted over a trephined hole for electrode penetration targeting the striatum under the same surgical condition. The location of the cylinder was determined based on stereotaxic coordinates and the magnetic resonance (MR) images taken before the surgery. For monkeys G and L, the cylinder was tilted in the coronal plane to allow for electrode penetration roughly perpendicular to the internal capsule (40° off-vertical, centered at AC+3). For monkey H, the cylinder was installed vertically over both hemispheres (AC+3). Antibiotics were administered during the course of the experiments as necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Visual stimuli and behavioral tasks</title><p>Animals were placed in a darkened booth during the experiments. Visual stimuli were presented on either a 24-inch cathode ray tube monitor (GDM-FW900, Sony; 64 × 44° of visual angle; 60 Hz) or a 27-inch liquid crystal display monitor (XL2720-B, BenQ; 73 × 46°; 144 Hz). Stimulus presentation and data acquisition were controlled by the TEMPO system (Reflective Computing). Five different visual stimuli were presented during the experiments. Red and green filled squares (0.5°) served as the fixation point. A gray-filled square (1.0°) was used as a saccade target. A large (4.0°) white unfilled square surrounding the fixation point was presented repeatedly in each trial, and the color of the square suddenly altered (red filled) in the deviant oddball trials (see below).</p><p>We used two versions of the oddball detection task, in which animals were required to detect the unexpected omission (missing condition) or the change in color and filling (deviant condition) of the repetitive visual stimuli. Each trial started with central fixation, and the color of the fixation point indicated the trial type (red and green for the missing and deviant conditions, respectively). As the animals maintained fixation for 2000 ms, a saccade target appeared either 16° left or right of the fixation point. After a random 100–400 ms, a brief (35 ms) visual stimulus was repeatedly presented around the fixation point at a fixed inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 100, 200, 300, 400 or 600 ms (only 400 ms for the deviant condition). The stimulus sequence lasted for a random 2000–4800 ms (3000–4800 ms for trials with a 600 ms ISI) before the occurrence of stimulus omission or color deviation (we refer to these events as ‘oddball’). The central fixation point remained visible until the end of each trial. Animals were trained to detect the oddball and make a saccade to the target within 600 ms. It should be noted that the animals needed to predict the timing of every upcoming stimulus to detect the stimulus omission but not for the detection of stimulus deviation, at least for ISIs longer than several hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohmae and Tanaka, 2016</xref>). Because the trial type was explicitly denoted by the color of the fixation point, the animals were likely to attend either to the stimulus omission or deviation during the stimulus repetition. Correct response was reinforced by a liquid reward delivered at the end of each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Physiological procedures</title><p>A single tungsten microelectrode (Alfa Omega Engineering) was lowered into the anterior part of the caudate nucleus through the 23-gauge stainless steel tube that was guided by the grid system (Crist Instrument Co.) attached to the cylinder. The electrode was advanced using a micromanipulator (MO-972A; Narishige) in 10 μm steps. Neuronal signals were amplified (Model 1800; A-M Systems), filtered (Model 3625; NF Co.), and monitored online using oscilloscopes and an audio device. We could easily locate neurons in the caudate nucleus based on the depth of electrodes, relatively wide action potentials, and their low baseline firing rate. Once we encountered task-related neurons, we attempted to isolate the waveform of single neurons online, using software with real-time template-matching algorithms (ASD; Alpha Omega Engineering). In this study, we did not include data from putative tonically active cholinergic interneurons which are known to exhibit characteristic firing pattern and wider action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aosaki et al., 1995</xref>). Neurons included for the analysis had relatively low baseline firing rate and were considered as medium-spiny projection neuron and some GABAergic interneurons. The spike timing data were saved in files along with the data of eye position and visual stimuli during experiments. We collected the data for the trials when monkeys remained fixation &gt; 1500 ms from the first stimulus. Eye position data were directly obtained from the eye coil device (MEL-25; Enzaishi Kogyo) and were sampled at 1 kHz with 16-bit resolution. The data were later analyzed off-line using MATLAB (Mathworks). During recording sessions (<italic>n</italic> = 84), animals sometimes made an early erroneous targeting saccade (11.3 ± 9.3% and 2.7 ± 3.6% for the missing and deviant conditions, respectively) and rarely failed to detect the oddball (2.2 ± 3.5% and 0.9 ± 2.4%). We considered only correct trials for the quantitative analysis.</p><p>After the termination of the recording experiments, we examined the effects of electrical microstimulation applied to the recording sites in two monkeys (G and L). Stimulation pulses (50 μA, 200 μs biphasic) were generated by using a stimulator connected with an isolator unit (SEN-3401 and SS-203J; Nihon Kohden). Electrical stimulation was delivered as a train of 100 Hz pulses during 200 ms just before the oddball. Current intensity was monitored by measuring the voltage across the 1 kΩ resistor placed in series with the electrode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>When we examined the effects of saccade direction and task condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the magnitude of neuronal activity was assessed by direct spike count during the ISI just before the oddball. The maximal neuronal activity was defined as the mean firing rate for 100 ms during the period. For the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, quantification of neuronal activity was made based on the modulation of spike density, which was obtained by convolving the millisecond-to-millisecond probability of spike occurrence with Gaussians (σ = 30 ms). We also used a smaller σ (15 ms) to verify the absence of high-frequency neuronal oscillation for short ISIs (see the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The magnitude of firing modulation for different ISIs was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of spike density during a specific period in the trial.</p><p>We compared the time courses of neuronal activity between neurons in the caudate nucleus and the cerebellar dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). When we estimated how accurately neuronal activities could predict the next stimulus timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>), we searched for the %threshold that minimized the prediction error of stimulus timing in trials with longer ISIs (300–600 ms). When we measured the timing of neuronal correlates of trial-by-trial latency variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we divided the data for each neuron into six groups according to saccade latency and performed one-way ANOVA for every millisecond to detect the diverging point of spike density profiles. Saccade latency was defined as the time from oddball (either omission or color change) to saccade initiation, which was detected when angular eye velocity exceeded 60°/s immediately after the oddball occurrence. The time when the traces of population activities for the six latency groups consistently differed for &gt; 100 ms was taken as the start and end of the stochastic variation. For both analyses on the population activity, statistical significance was evaluated using the bootstrap procedures (1000 resampling of individual neurons).</p><p>For comparison between conditions, Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test and paired <italic>t</italic>-test were used, respectively, for individual neuronal activity and the population activity. Effects of electrical microstimulation were also evaluated using two-way ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Further details of statistical tests are reported in the relevant text.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank T Mori, A Hironaka, and H Miyaguchi for their assistance with animal care and surgery; M Suzuki and M Saito for administrative help; M Takei and M Kusuzaki at the Research Institute for Electronic Science for manufacturing some equipment; and all lab members for comments and discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study, analyzing the neural activity in the basal ganglia and cerebellum of monkeys during a rhythmic timing prediction task. The focus of the present study is recording from the caudate nucleus, with comparison to previously published data from this lab from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. In both regions, there is neural activity that predicts the occurrence of the next stimulus, but the neural activity in the cerebellum can better predict the timing of an omitted stimulus than activity in the caudate, whereas activity in the caudate better predicts the behavioral response (saccade) latency. In addition, the authors show that stimulation of the caudate reduces the response latency on the task that requires the monkey to detect stimulus omission, but not a control task that also has rhythmic visual stimuli, but requires the monkey to detect a color change. The results are clear, data rigorously analyzed, and thoughtfully discussed. The many strengths of this study include the comparison of basal ganglia with cerebellum, and the comparison of the stimulus omission and color change tasks, and the convergent evidence from recording and stimulation. It is pretty amazing that differences in neural activity and effects of stimulating the caudate on the two tasks can be detected, especially since the monkeys are trained on both, and hence are likely to be doing some temporal prediction even in the color change task.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Striatum or caudate.</p><p>Are all neurons recorded in caudate (Introduction, last paragraph)? If so, why are they called striatum everywhere else in the manuscript? Are there some neurons outside of the caudate but within the striatum? Unless there are specific reasons, we would suggest using &quot;caudate&quot; consistently.</p><p>2) Identify the caudate neurons.</p><p>- Are these neurons recorded from the caudate head, body, or tail?</p><p>- Have these neurons, or the neurons of the recorded area, been known by some other function in the previous studies? Or, is this brand-new population of neurons that have never tested before?</p><p>- Previous studies induced saccades by an electrical stimulation but not in this study (subsection “Entrained neuronal activity in the striatum”, first paragraph). Why is that? Different area? Different stimulation condition?</p><p>- How were the neurons determined as caudate dopamine neurons?

Which one is true? Maybe the sentences in the first paragraph of the Discussion need to be revised?</p><p>4) Comparing with the dentate nucleus data.</p><p>- If we understand correctly, the oddball paradigms in this study and the previous dentate study (Ohmae et al., 2013) are slightly different: the target colors during fixation for missing and deviant are different in this study but same in the dentate study.

Could this difference cause the difference in the neural activity?</p><p>- Dentate nucleus contains output neurons of the cerebellum, whereas the striatum is considered to be an entrance of the basal ganglia. The rationale to compare the dentate nucleus and striatum is not clear. We understand that dentate activity can be considered as a representative of the cerebellum because it is an output of the cerebellum, but striatum cannot.

We now use &quot;caudate&quot; rather than &quot;striatum&quot; throughout the manuscript, except when we compare the data with previous studies in rodents. We would like to retain the term in the title for contrasting with the cerebellum and for a wide range of readers. We have added a paragraph to Discussion describing why we collected data from the caudate nucleus and that exploration of signals in the putamen in the future study is needed (subsection “Comparison of periodic activity between caudate and cerebellum”, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Identify the caudate neurons.</p><p>- Are these neurons recorded from the caudate head, body, or tail?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the beginning of the Results (subsection “Periodic neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus”, first paragraph), neurons were recorded from the head of the caudate nucleus (1-5 mm anterior to the anterior commissure). We have also added this information to the Materials and methods &quot;anterior part of the caudate nucleus&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Have these neurons, or the neurons of the recorded area, been known by some other function in the previous studies? Or, is this brand-new population of neurons that have never tested before?</p></disp-quote><p>We searched for caudate neurons modulating activity during the oddball detection task, while neurons in this area have been examined using a variety of oculomotor/cognitive tasks in the previous studies. For a few task-related neurons, we also examined activity during a conventional, visual saccade task, but failed to find significant firing modulation. This is mentioned in the revised text (subsection “Periodic neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus”, second paragraph). So, neurons with periodic firing modulation during the oddball task might be a brand-new population, while some of them might also respond to other oculomotor or cognitive tasks tested previously in the head of the caudate nucleus. We have added some note to the text regarding this issue (subsection “Entrained neuronal activity in the caudate nucleus”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Previous studies induced saccades by an electrical stimulation but not in this study (subsection “Entrained neuronal activity in the striatum”, first paragraph). Why is that? Different area? Different stimulation condition?</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous studies, electrical stimulation applied to the caudate successfully evoked saccades with short latency. Given that the stimulation parameters in our study was comparable to those in the previous studies, the stimulation areas might differ between the studies. However, because the effects of electrical stimulation in the caudate have been shown to be highly context-dependent (e.g., Watanabe and Munoz, 2010), the absence of stimulation-evoked saccades might reflect the difference in task condition rather than the stimulation sites. We have added a sentence regarding the issue: &quot;The differential stimulation effects might be due to the difference in stimulation sites within the caudate nucleus (i.e., more anterior sites in this study) or the difference in behavioral context&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How were the neurons determined as caudate dopamine neurons? Criteria needs to be documented.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include putative cholinergic, tonically active neurons with characteristic tonic firing pattern and wide action potentials (Aosaki et al., 1995). Neurons included for the analysis had relatively low baseline firing rate and were considered as medium-spiny projection neurons and some GABAergic interneurons. We now mention this point in the revised Materials and methods (subsection “Physiological procedures”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Inconsistency of conclusion.</p><p>The conclusion has been mentioned in three locations: (i) at the end of the Introduction; (ii) early part of the Discussion (first paragraph); and (iii) late part of the Discussion (subsection “Comparison of periodic activity between the striatum and cerebellum”, fourth paragraph). It stated that the striatum is for motor preparation at (i) and (iii) but then for temporal prediction at (ii). It stated that the cerebellum is involved in the prediction (Introduction). Which one is true? Maybe the sentences in the first paragraph of the Discussion need to be revised?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we have revised the text in the first paragraph of Discussion (corresponding to the part (ii) indicated by the reviewer). We assume that the periodic activity in the caudate nucleus is relevant to periodic motor preparation and is greatly enhanced by temporal prediction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Comparing with the dentate nucleus data.</p><p>- If we understand correctly, the oddball paradigms in this study and the previous dentate study (Ohmae et al., 2013) are slightly different: the target colors during fixation for missing and deviant are different in this study but same in the dentate study. So, the monkey was ready for missing in this study but not in the dentate study. Could this difference cause the difference in the neural activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are right. For the previous recording from the cerebellum, animals were not informed of oddball condition (i.e., missing or deviant) during the stimulus repetition so that they needed to predict stimulus timing in all trials. This is contrast to the present study in which monkeys needed to predict stimulus timing only in the missing trials with a red fixation point (Figure 1A). To examine the effects of prior instruction on neuronal activity, we recorded from 18 additional neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus in the new version of the task (i.e., different color of fixation point for different conditions). As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the magnitude of firing modulation during expectation of stimulus deviation was less than that during expectation of stimulus omission (red continuous versus thin black traces). Nevertheless, the time course of neuronal activity in the missing oddball condition was similar to that presented in Figure 5B (red continuous versus dashed traces), and the times of peak and trough of neuronal activity were almost identical, although the sizes of firing modulation were somewhat different between the two populations of neurons. We have added a paragraph reporting this fact to the Results (subsection “Comparison of time course of neuronal activity with the deep cerebellar nuclei”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Dentate nucleus contains output neurons of the cerebellum, whereas the striatum is considered to be an entrance of the basal ganglia. The rationale to compare the dentate nucleus and striatum is not clear. We understand that dentate activity can be considered as a representative of the cerebellum because it is an output of the cerebellum, but striatum cannot. For example, comparing the dentate and substantia nigra is straightforward because both are outputs of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, respectively (subsection “Entrained neuronal activity in the striatum”, first paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers in that exploring neuronal signals in the output nodes of the basal ganglia (the substance nigra and the globus pallidus) is certainly important. However, because many previous studies suggest a role of the striatum in timing, we started from the striatum to compare the signals in the basal ganglia with those in the cerebellum. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to mention this (subsection “Comparison of periodic activity between caudate and cerebellum”, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Specific concerns:</p><p>Subsection “Visual stimuli and behavioral tasks”, last paragraph. In the deviant condition, does the fixation target change only its color? Does the size also change? The size looks changed in Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>Only color and filling of the repetitive stimulus changed. We have added a sentence to Figure 1 legend &quot;The deviant stimulus differed in color and filling but had the same size as the regular repetitive stimuli.&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Visual stimuli and behavioral tasks”, last paragraph. What is the visual stimuli around the fixation point? Black square with 6 radial lines as in Figure 1A?</p></disp-quote><p>The lines represented flashing of repetitive stimuli and were invisible. In response to this comment, we have removed the radial lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Data analysis”, first paragraph. Gaussian 30ms seems long. Why did you choose it? Any reference to support it? If you need to use 15ms for short ISI, why don't you use 15ms for all data. For dentate data, did you use 30ms?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the previous studies in the cerebellar dentate nucleus used a 30-ms Gaussian kernel (Ohmae et al., 2013; Uematsu et al., 2017), we chose the same kernel for comparison. Although the use of a wider kernel smoothened the traces of spike density and reduced the magnitude of firing modulation, there was no qualitative difference from the data with a narrower kernel. To directly compare these data, we have added Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and modified relevant text (subsection “Basic response properties in different conditions”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Data analysis”, second paragraph. How did you detect the saccade latency?</p></disp-quote><p>Saccade onset was detected when angular eye velocity exceeded 60 deg/s immediately after the oddball occurrence. Saccade latency was defined as the time from oddball to saccade onset. We now report this in the revised Materials and methods (subsection “Data analysis”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A.

Please clarify how modulation of firing was calculated (as a percentage of baseline, or raw delta).</p></disp-quote><p>The maximal firing modulation was defined as &quot;<italic>raw data</italic>&quot; which was the difference between the peak and trough of population activity following the last stimulus in the sequence. The predicted stimulus timing was when firing modulation reached a certain threshold that was a percentage of the maximal firing modulation. We have added a few sentences to clarify the details (subsection “Comparison of time course of neuronal activity with the deep cerebellar nuclei”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6. Additional explanation of the analysis and results illustrated in this figure should be added as it is currently a little difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We have inserted some sentences to the text (subsection “Comparison of time course of neuronal activity with the deep cerebellar nuclei”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
