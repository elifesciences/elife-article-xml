However, how different molecular lesions in the Shh pathway drive transformation is frequently unclear, and <italic>SUFU</italic> mutations in the cerebellum seem distinct. In this study, we show that fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) signaling is integral for many infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> cases and that <italic>FGF5</italic> expression is uniquely upregulated in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors. Similarly, mice lacking SUFU (Sufu-cKO) ectopically express <italic>Fgf5</italic> specifically along the secondary fissure where GNPs harbor preneoplastic lesions and show that FGFR signaling is also ectopically activated in this region. Treatment with an FGFR antagonist rescues the severe GNP hyperplasia and restores cerebellar architecture. Thus, direct inhibition of FGF signaling may be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sonic Hedgehog</kwd><kwd>Sufu</kwd><kwd>medulloblastoma</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01CA201068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yabut</surname><given-names>Odessa R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH077694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH077694-S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomez</surname><given-names>Hector G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NCI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01CA201068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yabut</surname><given-names>Odessa R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001453</institution-id><institution>American Brain Tumor Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A131363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yabut</surname><given-names>Odessa R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice with <italic>Suppressor of Fused</italic> mutations have aberrant cerebellar granule cell proliferation accompanied by ectopic expression of an FGF ligand, also expressed in infantile medulloblastoma patients.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, with half of the cases diagnosed before the age of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ostrom et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Suppressor of Fused</italic> (<italic>SUFU</italic>) comprise approximately 30% of tumors in infants with Sonic Hedgehog-driven MB (MB<sup>SHH</sup>). Infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>, including those associated with SUFU mutations (MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup>), has a worse prognosis and higher rates of local recurrence than other MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kool et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schwalbe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guerrini-Rousseau et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, available SHH-targeted treatments for MB<sup>SHH</sup> act specifically on proteins upstream of SUFU and are therefore ineffective for MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kool et al., 2014</xref>). The poor prognosis, early occurrence, and lack of targeted therapy for MB<sup>SHH-SUFU</sup> patients make a detailed understanding of the drivers of oncogenesis in this group of great importance.</p><p>SUFU acts as an intracellular modulator of SHH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matise and Wang, 2011</xref>). Briefly, the Shh signaling pathway is initiated after the binding of extracellular Shh ligands to the transmembrane receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1). This relieves PTCH1 inhibition of the transmembrane protein, Smoothened (SMO), and enables the initiation of a cascade of intracellular events promoting the activator function of the transcription factors, GLI1, GLI2, or GLI3. Sufu modulates Shh signaling by ensuring the stability of Gli transcription factors or by promoting the formation of the repressor forms of GLI2 (GLI2R) or GLI3 (GLI3R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, depending on the developmental context, loss of <italic>Sufu</italic> can lead to activation or repression of Shh signaling. In the developing cerebellum, SUFU dysfunction is associated with the abnormal development of granule neuron precursors (GNP), which account for MB<sup>SHH</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vladoiu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>). GNPs populate the external granule layer (EGL) along the cerebellar perimeter, where local SHH signals trigger GNP proliferation and differentiation at neonatal stages. However, other mitogenic pathways can also influence GNP behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leto et al., 2016</xref>), yet little is known about how SUFU interacts with these pathways. Understanding how <italic>Sufu</italic> loss of function (LOF) affects the activity of concurrent local signaling pathways in granule neuron development may be key to developing potent targets for anti-tumor therapy.</p><p>In this study, we examined the regulation of FGF signaling in MB<sup>SHH</sup> and identified upregulation of <italic>FGF5</italic> expression in tumors of infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients. Similarly, we show ectopic expression of <italic>Fgf5</italic> in the neonatal cerebellum of mice lacking SUFU, which correlates with the activation of FGF signaling in surrounding EGL-localized cells where GNPs accumulate. Strikingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of FGF signaling results in near-complete rescue of these defects, including restoration of cerebellar histo-organization. Thus, our findings identify <italic>FGF5</italic> as a potential biomarker for a subset of patients with infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> who may be responsive to FGFR-targeting therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF5 is specifically upregulated in SHH-driven infantile MB</title><p>We previously reported that <italic>Sufu</italic> LOF in neocortical progenitors results in FGF signaling activation to influence the specification and differentiation of neocortical excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yabut et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we sought to determine if key FGF signaling pathway genes are differentially expressed in MB patient tumors. We performed a comparative analysis of the expression dataset from 763 MB patient samples comprised of tumors resected from molecularly distinct MB subgroups: Wingless (Wnt subgroup; MB<sup>WNT</sup>), MB<sup>SHH</sup>, Group 3 (MB<sup>Group3</sup>), and Group 4 (MB<sup>Group4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, our analyses show that <italic>FGF5</italic> expression is higher in tumors, specifically from MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients, compared to other MB subgroups, with approximately 25% of MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors exhibiting a twofold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We also find that <italic>FGF5</italic> is uniquely upregulated in MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors from patients within the 0â3-year-old age group, but not patients within the same age group in other MB subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further examination across all MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors stratified which subgroups express the highest levels of <italic>FGF5</italic> expression. Infantile tumors, largely belonging to the SHHÎ² and SHHÎ³ subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>), exhibit higher <italic>FGF5</italic> levels compared to tumors from children (SHHÎ±) or adults (SHHÎ´) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By all measures, the proportion of SHHÎ² and SHHÎ³ tumors with relatively high levels of <italic>FGF5</italic> is significantly increased (~30%) compared to other MB<sup>SHH</sup> subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that FGF signaling is specifically disrupted in infantile-onset MB<sup>SHH</sup>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>FGF5</italic> expression is upregulated in MB<sup>SHH</sup> tumors from infant patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Levels of <italic>FGF5</italic> expression in human medulloblastoma (MB) tumors of all ages from GEO expression dataset #GSE85217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>).

Since mutations in <italic>SUFU</italic> drive infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>, we generated the mutant mice (<italic>hGFAP-Cre;Sufu<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, hereto referred to as Sufu-cKO), in which <italic>Sufu</italic> is conditionally deleted in GNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhuo et al., 2001</xref>) to examine FGF activity. Sufu-cKO mice exhibit profound defects in cerebellar development. At P0, a time point at which GNP proliferation and differentiation is ongoing, there is a visible increase in measured cerebellar size and expansion of Pax6-positive (Pax6+) GNPs in the EGL of Sufu-cKO cerebellum compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). Notably, the expansion of Pax6+ GNPs specifically localizes along the secondary fissure (EGL region B, arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) compared to other EGL areas (EGL regions A and C) in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We then proceeded to examine whether these defects correlated with abnormal FGF5 expression. We collected P0 littermates for these analyses and found that the foliation defects are particularly severe in the cerebelli of mice from this P0 Sufu-cKO litter compared to littermate controls (as determined by DAPI labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In situ hybridization (ISH) using <italic>Fgf5</italic>-specific riboprobes show high expression of <italic>Fgf5</italic> (Fgf5<sup>high</sup>) immediately adjacent to the presumptive secondary fissure in the P0 control cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, there is an expansion of Fgf5<sup>high</sup> expression regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), coinciding with areas near the secondary fissure where GNP expansion is most severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). Further, while <italic>Fgf5</italic>-expressing (FGF5+) cells are largely excluded from the EGL of the control cerebellum, a substantial number of <italic>Fgf5</italic>+ cells are ectopically localized in the EGL region B of the Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). <italic>Fgf5</italic> mRNA molecules are visibly higher in <italic>Fgf5</italic>-expressing cells in the Sufu-cKO EGL, while <italic>Fgf5</italic> expression is largely absent in the deeper EGL regions (outlined cells within boxed regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These findings implicate FGF5 as a potential instigator of region-specific defects in GNP differentiation present in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased <italic>Fgf5</italic> expression coincides with region-specific expansion of granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pax6 (red) and DAPI (blue) immunofluorescence staining of the P0 Sufu-cKO and control cerebelli.

Nevertheless, as previously reported, tumors do not readily form in the Sufu-cKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), indicating either timely repair of DSBs or the induction of apoptosis in GNPs with significant genomic instability.

Among the downstream targets of DSB repair pathways is Trp53, which, when activated, mediates cell death to suppress tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2000</xref>). In the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum, Trp53 protein is present, albeit significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Supporting this, we find ectopic expression of <italic>Fgf5</italic> and deregulation of FGF signaling as marked by the excessive intracellular activation of MAPK signaling in the P0 Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Similarly, in previous studies, ectopic expression of FGF ligands, <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Fgf15</italic>, are associated with degradation of GLI3R because of <italic>Sufu</italic> deletion, resulting in regional patterning and precursor specification and differentiation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yabut et al., 2020</xref>).

These key molecular differences may activate unique signaling networks in Sufu-cKO GNPs. Additionally, 18 FGF ligands differ significantly in molecular features and binding specificities to distinct combinations of FGFR splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ornitz and Itoh, 2015</xref>). For example, unlike FGF2, which acts in an autocrine manner, FGF5 can exert both autocrine and paracrine functions, bind different combinations of FGFRs, and is dynamically expressed in distinct regions of the developing cerebellum. Thus, in-depth studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms triggered by abnormally high levels of FGF5 in the developing cerebellum, particularly since <italic>Fgf5</italic> overexpression is known to drive cancer development and progression, including brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allerstorfer et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, examination of whether inhibition of FGF signaling by AZD4547 (or other FGFR inhibitors) in MB tumor-bearing Sufu;Trp53-dKO mice is crucial to establish that FGF signaling is a druggable target for SUFU-associated infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup>.</p><p>The high occurrence of <italic>SUFU</italic> mutations in infantile MB indicates the selective vulnerability of the developing cerebellum to the neoplastic effects of SUFU dysfunction. Notably, the timing of <italic>SUFU</italic> LOF is critical; conditional deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> in neural stem cells before granule neuron specification (using the hGFAP-Cre line) results in GNP hyperplasia, whereas conditional deletion of <italic>Sufu</italic> after granule neuron specification (using the Atoh1-Cre line) does not lead to these defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiwani et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, <italic>SUFU</italic>-associated infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> is a likely consequence of defects stemming from the early stages of granule neuron lineage specification at embryonic stages. However, since hGFAP-Cre may also be expressed in cerebellar glial cells, we cannot yet eliminate the possibility that the defects are directly or indirectly a consequence of abnormal glial cell development and function. In-depth studies are required to interrogate the effects of SUFU LOF in cerebellar glial cell development and how this might indirectly affect GNP differentiation.</p><p>Unfortunately, tumors initiated at embryonic stages are typically undetectable until several months after birth, when tumorigenesis has significantly progressed. Thus, therapeutics for infantile MB must successfully curtail tumorigenic mechanisms at postnatal stages and minimally affect normal GNPs elsewhere in the cerebellum. Toward this goal, inhibiting localized FGF5 and FGF signaling activity may provide new paths toward the design of targeted treatments. Since we confirmed the occurrence of high <italic>FGF5</italic> levels in a subset of infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients, measuring FGF5 may be a useful diagnostic biomarker for this patient population. This may predict the lack of efficacy of SHH-targeting compounds in curtailing tumor growth but could instead significantly impede cerebellar development. Importantly, detection of elevated FGF5 levels may identify patients who will be responsive to FGF-targeting treatments. Ultimately, we hope these studies facilitate the design of much-needed precision medicines to address the distinct oncogenic mechanisms specifically and effectively in infantile MB<sup>SHH</sup> patients while enabling normal progression of cerebellar development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice carrying the floxed <italic>Sufu</italic> allele (Sufu<sup>fl</sup>) were kindly provided by Dr. Chi-Chung Hui (University of Toronto) and were genotyped as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>GFAP-cre,</italic> a transgene driven by the human GFAP promoter (Stock #004600; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">SchÃ¼ller et al., 2008</xref>), and Gli1-LacZ (Stock #008211) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

Signals were detected using the TSA Plus Fluorescein Kit (Cat# NEL741E001KT, PerkinElmer) and Opal Dye reagent (Opal 570, Cat# FP1488001KT or Opal 520, Cat# FP1487001KT, from Akoya Biosciences) after 30 min of incubation at 40Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blot analyses were conducted according to standard protocols. Soluble extracts were loaded onto Criterion, 4â15% Tris-HCI 4 SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), separated at 120 V, and transferred to PVDF membrane at 30 V for 2 hr or overnight at 4Â°C. Membranes were blocked with 3% milk/1Ã TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) or 5% BSA/1Ã TBS-T for 1 hr at RT and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4Â°C, and secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution; IR-Dye antibodies, LI-COR) for 1 hr at RT. Membranes were washed in 1Ã TBS-T and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Primary antibodies were used as follows: rabbit anti-Gli1 (1:1000; Abcam); goat anti-Gli2 (1:1000; R&amp;D Systems), rabbit anti-Gli3 (1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Pax6 (1:1000 dilution; Cat# 901301, BioLegend); rabbit anti-NeuN (1:1000 dilution; Cat# PA5-784-99, Invitrogen); rabbit anti-GABA A Receptor Î±6 (1:1000 dilution; Cat# PA5-77403, GABRA6; Invitrogen), and Î±-Tubulin (1:5000 dilution; Cat# ab4074, Abcam). Quantification and analysis were conducted using the Odyssey Image Studio Software (LI-COR). Protein levels were normalized to GAPDH protein levels. Levels of NeuN and GABRA6 were quantified in correlation with Pax6 levels (NeuN/Pax6 or GABRA6/Pax6) to determine the proportion of Pax6+ cells expressing mature granule neuron markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image analysis and acquisition</title><p>Images were acquired using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a QCapture Pro camera (QImaging), Zeiss Axioscan Z.1 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using the Zen 2 blue edition software (Zeiss), or the Nikon Ti inverted microscope with CSU-W1 large field of view confocal and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera. All images were imported in tiff or jpeg format. Brightness, contrast, and background were adjusted equally for the entire image between controls and mutants using the âBrightness/Contrastâ and âLevelsâ functions from the âImage/Adjustmentâ options in Adobe Photoshop or NIH ImageJ without any further modification. NIH ImageJ was used to threshold background levels between controls and mutant tissues to quantify fluorescence labeling. To quantify cell density, positively labeled cells within defined EGL regions, as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, were counted. Quantification of double-labeled cells was performed in 1â2 Î¼m optical slices obtained by confocal microscopy. We relied on continuous DAPI nuclear staining to distinguish individual cells in each optical slice to determine the cellular colocalization of specific markers being analyzed (e.g., pERK and Ki-67). All measurements were performed from 2- to 3 20-Î¼m-thick and histologically matched cerebellar sections of 3â6 independent mice per genotype analyzed. Individual points in the bar graphs represent the average cell number (quantified from 2 to 3 sections) from each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Human MB gene expression</title><p>Expression values of FGF5 (ENSG00000138675) were assessed using Geo2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2013</xref>) from published human MB subtype expression dataset accession no. GSE85217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalli et al., 2017</xref>). GEO2R is an interactive web tool that compares expression levels of genes of interest (GOI) between sample groups in the GEO series using original submitter-supplied processed data tables. We entered the GOI Ensembl ID and organized data sets according to age and MB subgroup or MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtype classifications. GEO2R results presented gene expression levels as a table ordered by FDR-adjusted (Benjamini and Hochberg) p-values, with significance level cutoff at 0.05, processed by GEO2Râs built-in limma statistical test. The resulting data were subsequently exported into Prism (GraphPad). Scatter plots presenting FGF5 expression levels across all MB subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We performed additional statistical analyses to compare FGF5 expression levels between MB subgroups and MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes and graphed these data as violin plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and E</xref>). For these analyses, we used one-way ANOVA with HolmâSidakâs multiple comparisons test, single pooled variance. p-value â¤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Graphs display the mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM). Sample sizes analyzed were MB<sup>WNT</sup> n = 70, MB<sup>SHH</sup> n = 224, MB<sup>GR3</sup> n = 143, MB<sup>GR4</sup> n = 326, MB<sup>SHHÎ±</sup> n = 66, MB<sup>SHHÎ²</sup> n = 35, MB<sup>SHHÎ³</sup> n = 47, and MB<sup>SHHÎ´</sup> n = 76.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Prism 8.1 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. Two sample experiments were analyzed using Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test, and experiments with more than two parameters were analyzed by ANOVA. In one- or two-way ANOVA, when interactions were found, follow-up analyses were conducted for the relevant variables using HolmâSidakâs multiple comparisons test. All experiments were conducted at least in triplicate with sample sizes of n = 3â6 embryos/animals per genotype. p-value â¤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The B-subtype occurs mostly in infants, is often metastatic, and lacks specific treatment. Yabut et al. found Fgf5 was highly expressed in the B-subtype of SHH driven medulloblastoma by examining a published microarray expression dataset. They then investigated how Fgf5 functions in the cerebellum of mice that have embryonic Sufu loss of function. This loss was induced using the hGFAP-cre transgene, which is expressed multiple cell types in the developing cerebellum, including granule neuron precursors (GNPs) derived from the rhombic lip. By measuring the area of Pax6+ cells in the external granule cell layer (EGL) of Sufu-cKO mice at postnatal day 0, they find Pax6+ cells occupy a larger area in the posterior lobe adjacent to the secondary fissure, which is poorly defined. They show that Fgf5 RNA and phosphoErk1/2 immunostaining are also higher in the same disrupted region. Some of the phosphoErk1/2+ cells are proliferative in the Sufu-cKO. Western blot analysis of Gli proteins that modulate SHH signaling found reduced expression and absence of Gli1 activity in the region of cerebellar dysgenesis in Sufu-cKO mice. This suggests the GNP expansion in this region is independent of SHH signaling. Amazingly, intraventricular injection of the FGFR1-2 antagonist AZD4547 from P0-4 and examined histologoically at P7 found the treatment restored cytoarchitecture in the cerebella of Sufu-cKO mice. This is further supported by NeuN immunostaining in the internal granule cell layer, which labels mature, non-diving neurons, and KI67 immunostaining, indicating dividing cells, and primarily found in the EGL. The mice were treated beginning at a timepoint when cerebellar cytoarchitecture was shown to be disrupted and it is indistinguishable from control following treatment. Fig.3 presents the most convincing and exciting data in this manuscript.</p><p>Sufu-cKO do not readily develop cerebellar tumors. The authors detected phosphorylated H2AX immunostaining, which labels double strand breaks, was in some cells in the EGL in regions of cerebellar dysgenesis in the Sufu-cKO, as was cleaved Caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis.

The manuscript by Yabut et al. establishes a connection between ectopic FGF5 expression and GNP over-expansion in a late stage embryonic Sufu LoF model. The data provided links region-specific interaction between aberrant FGF5 signaling with SHH subtype of medulloblastoma. New data from Yabut et al. suggest that ectopic FGF5 expression correlates with GNP expansion near the secondary fissure in Sufu LoF cerebella. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of FGF signaling inhibits GNP proliferation. Interestingly, the data indicate that the timing of conditional Sufu deletion (E13.5 using the hGFAP-Cre line) results in different outcomes compared to later deletion (using Math1-cre line, Jiwani et al., 2020). This study provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms driving GNP expansion in SHH subgroup MB, particularly in the context of Sufu LoF.

The B-subtype occurs mostly in infants, is often metastatic, and lacks specific treatment. Yabut et al. found that Fgf5 was highly expressed in the B-subtype of SHH-driven medulloblastoma by examining a published microarray expression dataset. They then investigated how Fgf5 functions in the cerebellum of mice that have embryonic Sufu loss of function. This loss was induced using the hGFAP-cre transgene, which is expressed in multiple cell types in the developing cerebellum, including granule neuron precursors (GNPs) derived from the rhombic lip. By measuring the area of Pax6+ cells in the external granule cell layer (EGL) of Sufu-cKO mice at postnatal day 0, they find Pax6+ cells occupy a larger area in the posterior lobe adjacent to the secondary fissure, which is poorly defined. They show that Fgf5 RNA and phosphoErk1/2 immunostaining are also higher in the same disrupted region. Some of the phosphoErk1/2+ cells are proliferative in the Sufu-cKO. Western blot analysis of Gli proteins that modulate SHH signaling found reduced expression and absence of Gli1 activity in the region of cerebellar dysgenesis in Sufu-cKO mice. This suggests the GNP expansion in this region is independent of SHH signaling. Amazingly, intraventricular injection of the FGFR1-2 antagonist AZD4547 from P0-4 and examined histologically at P7 found the treatment restored cytoarchitecture in the cerebella of Sufu-cKO mice. This is further supported by NeuN immunostaining in the internal granule cell layer, which labels mature, non-diving neurons, and KI67 immunostaining, indicating dividing cells, and primarily found in the EGL. The mice were treated beginning at a timepoint when cerebellar cytoarchitecture was shown to be disrupted and it is indistinguishable from control following treatment. Figure 3 presents the most convincing and exciting data in this manuscript.</p><p>Sufu-cKO do not readily develop cerebellar tumors. The authors detected phosphorylated H2AX immunostaining, which labels double-strand breaks, in some cells in the EGL in regions of cerebellar dysgenesis in the Sufu-cKO, as was cleaved Caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis. P53, downstream of the double-strand break pathway, the protein was reduced in Sufu-cKO cerebellum. Genetically removing p53 from the Sufu-cKO cerebellum resulted in cerebellar tumors in 2-month old mice. The Sufu;p53-dKO cerebella at P0 lacked clear foliation, and the secondary fissure, even more so than the Sufu-cKO. Fgf5 RNA and signaling (pERK1/2) were also expressed ectopically.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are largely supported by the data, but some data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>(1) The rationale for examining Fgf5 in medulloblastoma is not sufficiently convincing. The authors previously reported that Fgf15 was upregulated in neocortical progenitors of mice with conditional loss of Sufu (PMID: 32737167). In Figure 1, the authors report FGF5 expression is higher in SHH-type medulloblastoma, especially the beta and gamma subtypes mostly found in infants. These data were derived from a genome-wide dataset and are shown without correction for multiple testing, including other Fgfs. Showing the expression of other Fgfs with FDR correction would better substantiate their choice or moving this figure to later in the manuscript as support for their mouse investigations would be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess FGF5 (ENSG00000138675) expression in MB tissues, we used Geo2R (Barrett et al., 2013) to analyze published human MB subtype expression arrays from accession no.

However, the causal relationship between FGF5 and MB remains unestablished. Based on the current data, FGF5 can only be considered a biomarker for stratifying MB.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our studies do not provide direct evidence that FGF5 cause MB. Future investigation focusing on determining if FGF5 inhibition leads to phenotypic rescue will strongly establish the relationship between FGF5 and MB. The reviewer is also correct that our studies reveal that FGF5 acts as a potential biomarker, as we mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The upregulation of Fgf5 in Sufu-deficient cerebella is crucial to this study, yet the presented data are unconvincing to support this conclusion. In comparing Fgf5 expression between WT and Sufu mutants (Figures 2E, F and 4I), the cerebellar sections differ significantly, with mutant sections seemingly from a more lateral position. The authors should provide images of mutant sections from more comparable positions to accurately assess the effect of Sufu deficiency on Fgf5 expression. Additionally, the signals in Figure 2F resemble non-specific backgrounds rather than specific RNAscope signals.</p></disp-quote><p>The WT and mutant sections analyzed were carefully selected from comparable levels. The abnormal foliation in Sufu-cKO make the mutant sections look like they are from the lateral cerebellum.</p><p>Figure 2F (enlarged regions) point to punctate RNAScope signals which is characteristic of this labeling method (see RBFOX3 or GFAP labeling in DAPI-labeled cells in the mouse brain at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://acdbio.com/science/applications/research-areas/neuroscience">https://acdbio.com/science/applications/research-areas/neuroscience</ext-link>). The higher number of punctate signals in some, but not all, DAPI-labeled cells in Figure 2F indicate that the FGF5 RNAScope signal is specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Jiwani et al. (2020) reported that Fgf8 also expressed in region B of the EGL, is upregulated in Sufu-deficient cerebella and is necessary and sufficient for Sufu mutant GCP proliferation. The current study does not distinguish whether the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 blocks Fgf5 and Fgf8 function in restoring cerebellar histology in Sufu mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>AZD4547 potently inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 autophosphorylation (Gavine et al., Cancer Research, 2012). FGF8 is reported to bind to these receptors (Ornitz and Itoh, 2015). Thus, the reviewer is correct that the studies will not distinguish between FGF5 or FGF8 activity. Further investigation on FGF8 expression and the effects of its inhibition in the Sufu-cKO neonatal cerebellum will determine whether tumorigenic processes are driven by either FGF5 or FGF8. Nevertheless, we postulate that FGF5 is exerting a greater effect in activating FGF signaling in the developing cerebellum given that it is highly expressed along the external granule layers of the developing cerebellum (Author response image 3).</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Expression of FGF5 and FGF8 in the P4 mouse cerebellum (Allen Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://developingmouse.brain-map.org">https://developingmouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100767-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should show whether AZD4547 treatment restores normal Fgf5 expression.

However, we are unable to address since these mice are now unavailable. We hope that future studies will address these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Jiwani et al. (2020) showed that deleting Sufu with Atoh1-Cre promotes Gli3R and suppresses Gli2 levels, leading to increased cell proliferation and delayed cell cycle exit in the central lobe. The findings of the current study (Supplementary Figure 1) seem to differ from this previous report, yet both studies conclude that Sufu-KO disrupts differentiation. The authors should provide an explanation for this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results align completely with the findings by Jiwani et al. (2020). Both studies showed reduced levels of Gli3R, showing nearly 50% reduction, when Sufu is deleted (see Figure 4A-4D in Jiwani et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The hGFAP-Cre mouse line is used to delete Sufu from the cerebellum, but it is not commonly used for GCP-specific deletion. The authors need to provide a reference or more details on the temporal and spatial activity of the Cre line, as the cited paper describes its generation but offers little information on its activity in the developing cerebellum.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs reminder to include the reference for the Schuller et al. 2008 paper. This study characterized the hGFAP-Cre temporal and spatial expression in the developing cerebellum, including granule cell precursors. We will include this reference in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Based on the provided data, it is difficult to determine which cell types express Fgf5. Given that hGFAP-cre may delete Sufu in other cerebellar cell types, the authors should demonstrate that Fgf5 is expressed in granule cells or granule cell precursors.</p></disp-quote><p>Future studies will focus on further characterization of the role of FGF5 in cerebellar development, including the identity cells expressing FGF5. The reviewer is correct in that hGFAP-Cre also targets other cell types and that Sufu deletion in these cells induced ectopic FGF5 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The provided data show an increase in pERK+ cells in GCPs at the secondary fissure. This increase may simply reflect an accumulation of GCPs. It is unconvincing that there is an increase in pERK due to the loss of Sufu.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the increase in GCPs will also result increase the number of pERK+ cells. To control for this, our quantification reflects the number of cells per unit area where Ki67+ cells. With these parameters, we found that there is an increased density of pERK+ cells in a given Ki67+ region. All quantification were performed from 2-3 20 um cerebellar sections of 3-6 independent mice per genotype analyzed. Individual points in the bar graphs represent the average cell number (quantified from 2-3 sections) from each mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) No data are provided on MB formation in Sufu-cKO; p53- mutants, and it is unknown whether FGFR inhibitors block tumor formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that performing AZD4547 treatment on Sufu-dKO mice will strengthen these studies.

What evidence supports this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>Preneoplastic lesions are defined as cells carrying genetic and phenotypic alterations that show higher risk of malignancy (such as MB) but lack the capacity to grow autonomously in the absence of a secondary factor (Feo et al., 2011). In Sufu-cKO mice, we see abnormally proliferating and behaving granule precursor cells that do not grow autonomously, in the absence of a p53 LOF. The combined deletion of Sufu and p53 transforms these cells to become neoplastic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Fgf5 is normally expressed in region B. What is its potential function? Does AZD4547 affect normal development?</p></disp-quote><p>Future studies will focus on further characterization of the role of FGF5 in cerebellar development, including the identity cells expressing FGF5. Regarding AZD4547, we did not observe any obvious difference between AZD4547-treated and vehicle-treated cerebelli. These indicate that AZD4547 inhibition of FGFRs under physiologic conditions does not significantly disrupt normal cerebellar development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Figure 3G: It is unclear which specimens were treated with AZD4547.

The cited paper describes more abundant SHH MB in the cerebellar hemisphere. The authors need to elaborate on their statement to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that Tan et al., 2018 observed tumors arising from the cerebellar hemisphere. More specifically, these tumors arise in the posterior/ventral regions of the cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 2 in Tan et al., 2018). Similarly, Sufu-cKO mice have more severe defects in the posterior/ventral regions of the cerebellar hemisphere (Figures 2A and 3F) and therefore corroborate the findings by Tan et al., that abnormal SHH signaling in these regions results in increased sensitivity to MB formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure1 [Upregulated FGF5 expression in MBS-HH tumors]</p><p>- Statistical analysis from the Geo expression dataset does not provide enough detail.

GSE85217 (Cavalli et al., 2017). GEO2R is an interactive web tool that compares expression levels of genes of interest (GOI) between sample groups in the GEO series using original submitter-supplied processed data tables. We simply entered the GOI Ensembl ID and organized data sets according to age and MB subgroup or MBSHH subtype classifications. GEO2R results presented gene expression levels as a table ordered by FDR-adjusted (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg) p-values, with significance level cut-off at 0.05, processed by GEO2Râs built-in limma statistical test. Resulting data were subsequently exported into Prism (GraphPad). We generated scatter plots presenting FGF5 expression levels across all MB subgroups (Figure 1A) and MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes (Figure 1D). We performed additional statistical analyses to compare FGF5 expression levels between MB subgroups and MB<sup>SHH</sup> subtypes and graphed these data as violin plots (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1E). For these analyses, we used one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidakâs multiple comparisons test, single pooled variance. <italic>P</italic> value â¤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
