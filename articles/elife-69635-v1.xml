How PBS transfers the light energy to photosystem II (PSII) remains to be elucidated. Here we report the in situ structure of the PBS–PSII supercomplex from <italic>Porphyridium purpureum</italic> UTEX 2757 using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. Our work reveals the organized network of hemiellipsoidal PBS with PSII on the thylakoid membrane in the native cellular environment. In the PBS–PSII supercomplex, each PBS interacts with six PSII monomers, of which four directly bind to the PBS, and two bind indirectly. Additional three ‘connector’ proteins also contribute to the connections between PBS and PSIIs. Two PsbO subunits from adjacent PSII dimers bind with each other, which may promote stabilization of the PBS–PSII supercomplex. By analyzing the interaction interface between PBS and PSII, we reveal that α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD connect with CP43 of PSII monomer and that α<sup>LCM</sup> also interacts with CP47' of the neighboring PSII monomer, suggesting the multiple light energy delivery pathways. The in situ structures illustrate the coupling pattern of PBS and PSII and the arrangement of the PBS–PSII supercomplex on the thylakoid, providing the near-native 3D structural information of the various energy transfer from PBS to PSII.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>phycobilisome</kwd><kwd>photosystem II</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>in

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis for the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy. Red algae living in deep water can efficiently use dim and green light that cannot be absorbed by plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tschudy, 1934</xref>). This ability is mainly due to two primary photosynthetic components: the light-harvesting antenna and the photochemical reaction centers. The primary light-harvesting antenna is the phycobilisome (PBS), which is located on the stromal surface of the thylakoid membrane and captures light energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gantt and Conti, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gantt and Conti, 1966</xref>). The two reaction centers, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), are located in the thylakoid membrane. PBS mainly transfers the light energy to PSII, leading to water splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biggins and Bruce, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley and Butler, 1977a</xref>). PBS could also directly couple with PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mullineaux, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Su et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ueno et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PBSs are composed of chromophore-bearing phycobiliproteins (PBPs) and linker proteins, which further assemble into central core and peripheral rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gantt et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zilinskas and Greenwald, 1986</xref>). Recently, the cryo-electron microscope (cryo-EM) structures of PBS from red algae at resolutions of 3.5 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and 2.82 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). The cryo-EM structure of PBS in red alga <italic>Porphyridium purpureum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) shows that the PBS consists of a tricylindrical PBS core, 14 rods (Rod a–Rod g, Rod a’–Rod g’), 8 individual extra PE (αβ)<sub>6</sub> hexamers (Ha–Hd, Ha’–Hd’), and 24 individual extra PE α or β subunits. The core contains one top cylinder B, composed of two allophycocyanin (APC) (αβ)<sub>3</sub> trimers, and two bottom cylinders (A and A’), each of which is assembled by three APC trimers (A1–A3, A2 and A3 form APC hexamer). The rods consist of phycoerythrin (PE) and phycocyanin (PC) hexamers or only PE hexamers. For example, Rod a is composited of one basal PC hexamer and two distal PE hexamers. Thus, the energy absorbed by Rod transfers unidirectionally from the distal PE to the basal PC, and then funnels to APC in the core, and eventually to the two terminal emitters, including chromophores in the core–membrane linker protein (L<sub>CM</sub>, also called ApcE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capuano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lundell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2015</xref>) and allophycocyanin D (ApcD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glazer and Bryant, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PSII is a multi-pigment transmembrane protein complex involved in converting light energy into electrochemical potential energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>).

The main subunits of PSII include the reaction center D1, D2 protein, and chlorophyll-a binding proteins, CP43 and CP47. Both CP43 and CP47 subunits have been reported to mediate the energy transfer from PBS to the reaction center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ueno et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The structural mechanism of energy transfer from PBS to PSII has been studied for many years. The organization of PBS and PSII on the thylakoid membrane has been studied using ultrathin section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gantt and Conti, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wanner and Kost, 1980</xref>), freeze-fracture analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 1990</xref>), negative staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Folea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hellmich et al., 2014</xref>), atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rast et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wietrzynski et al., 2020</xref>). PBSs in red algae are tightly arranged in ordered rows on the thylakoid in most regions and randomly packed in some areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). PBS arrangement in the two regions is dynamically regulated, varying with the cell’s age, the supply of nutrients, and available light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagert and Schubert, 1995</xref>). However, the stoichiometric ratio of PBS/PSII in red algae and cyanobacteria remains controversial, ranging from 1:1 to 1:4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohki et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>), which likely reflects different growth conditions. Different approaches showed that PBS connects with PSII through ApcD, α<sup>LCM</sup> (the α domain of L<sub>CM</sub>), and ApcF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 1992</xref>). In particular, ApcD and α<sup>LCM</sup> are well known as terminal emitters for mediating the transfer of energy from PBS to PSII. The negative staining structure of the purified PBS–PSII supercomplex in the <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 proposed that α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcF of PBS play important roles in mediating PBS interaction with PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). The cross-linking structure of the purified PBS–PSII–PSI megacomplex in the cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 identified five interlinks associated with α<sup>LCM</sup> and PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). However, the organization and precise connection between PBS and PSII in the cellular environment are not fully understood.</p><p>In situ cryo-ET in combination with cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling is currently a powerful approach for directly dissecting macromolecular structures in the unperturbed cellular environment at molecular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). The obtained structure is complementary to the structure of the isolated complex and reveals elements of the in vivo organization that can never be obtained through structures of the isolated complex, no matter how high the resolution. Here, by using this approach, we identified the native PBS–PSII supercomplex and the double PBS–PSII supercomplex containing two adjacent PBS–PSII supercomplexes at resolutions of 14.3 Å and 15.6 Å, respectively. These results illustrate the coupling pattern of PBS and PSII and the arrangement of PBS–PSII supercomplexes on the ordered distribution region of the thylakoid membrane, which cannot be determined with other methods. The newly found structural information provides a better understanding of energy transfer from PBS to PSII.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of PBS and PSII on the thylakoid membrane</title><p>The red alga, <italic>P. purpureum</italic>, was cultured under low-light conditions to mimic its natural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>) and to increase the population of regularly distributed PBS–PSII supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Cells were harvested in the exponential phase of growth and were immediately vitrified on cryo-EM grids to minimize environmental affection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaňa et al., 2014</xref>). Cryo-FIB milling was then used to prepare thin lamellae with ~150 nm thickness for cryo-ET data collection. We first imaged the whole cells. The tomogram slice shows that most PBS–PSII supercomplexes are packed in an orderly fashion on the thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In the cross-section view, adjacent PBSs were attached to the upper and lower thylakoid membrane in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D</xref>). In the two orthogonal views, opposite PBSs are stacked into linear rows respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These PBS rows are arranged in parallel, forming a large two-dimensional pattern covering the thylakoid membrane. In the cross-section view, densities are evident at the bottom of PBSs, which are embedded within the thylakoid membrane. Protrusions are visible on the luminal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

From this, we can infer that these represent PSIIs.

In the sub-tomogram map, two PBSs (labeled as PBS1 and PBS2) interact with a linear array of PSII dimers (labeled as A, B, C, A', B', C', C&quot;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (left panel), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Considering the map contains two PBSs, we named the structure double PBS–PSII supercomplex. After mapping this sub-tomogram map back into the tomogram, we observed long linear arrays of the PBS–PSII supercomplexes on the thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). In this array, the PBS/PSII ratio is 1:6, that is, one PBS with six associated monomeric PSIIs periodically repeated along with the linear array. In the double PBS–PSII map, each PBS is directly anchored to a pair of PSIIs dimers, i.e., PBS1 on the A–B pair and PBS2 on the A’–B’ pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel). The C' dimer connects the A–B pair to the A’–B’ pair, while the two PSIIs in the C' dimer respectively interact with the lateral disc-like densities on both sides of PBS, which have features of PBS hexamer (discussed later), and thus indirectly attach to PBS1 and PBS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The slice view shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> indicates that the PSII dimers are arranged repeatedly in parallel. Thus, C and C’’ should also be the PSII dimer, although their densities are weak. The structure shows PBS1 is associated with PSII monomer A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C’2, and PBS2 connect with A’1, A’2, B’1, B’2, C’1, C’’2. Therefore, each PBS is associated with six monomeric PSIIs.</p><p>To study the geometry of the PBS–PSII supercomplex, we manually picked 34,380 individual PBSs with the interacting PSIIs particles. These were aligned and averaged into a structure at a higher resolution, 14.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). In the PBS–PSII map, the PSII dimers (PSII dimers A and B) are clearly shown. With a large threshold, the other two PSIIs corresponding to PSII dimer C in double PBS–PSII are visualized in the map and tomogram slice view (indicated with red stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). The distance between the PSII dimers A and B is approximately 12.4 nm, and the face planes of the two PSII dimers make a lateral angle of approximately 14° with the plane of the PBS central core. The centers of the two PSII double dimers shift approximately 3 nm along the plane of the PBS central core, which makes the twofold symmetry axes of PBS and 6 PSIIs coincide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The improved PBS–PSII structure enables us to confirm that PSII dimers A and B bind with each other through a rigid density. By analyzing the fitting results, we suppose the density is most likely contributed by the two adjacent PsbO subunits: one is from the PSII monomer 1 of the PSII dimer A and the other from the PSII monomer 4 of the PSII dimer B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). However, we are limited by the current resolution and could not exclude that other factors may contribute to the density. The PsbO protein is found in PSII of all oxygenic organisms ranging from cyanobacteria and red algae to higher plants and serves as the manganese-stabilizing protein directly involved in the stability of photosynthetic water-oxidizing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ifuku and Noguchi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Popelkova and Yocum, 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that PsbO could play an additional role in stabilizing adjacent PSII dimers in PSII dimer rows.</p><p>To analyze the lateral densities on both sides of PBS connecting PBS to PSII dimer C, we further improved the resolution of the PBS–PSII supercomplex to 13.2 Å after post-processing from the 14.3 Å resolution map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The slice view of the PBS–PSII map shows that the densities are round discs with solid densities in the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E–G</xref>). These features are reminiscent of the structure of the extra hexamer found in the single-particle cryo-EM structure of <italic>P. purpureum</italic> PBS. Moreover, the lateral densities are of the same size and shape as the extra hexamer. As all eight extra hexamers in <italic>P. purpureum</italic> PBS are PE hexamers, we hypothesize that the lateral density could be contributed by a PE hexamer, which is referred to as the lateral hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Further analysis indicated that the lateral hexamer connects with the bottom hexamer of Rod a and the second hexamer of Rod e, which are the PC and PE hexamers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interaction pattern between PBS and PSII</title><p>In the PBS–PSII map, extensive interfaces between PBS core and PSII are observed.

These results in diverse organizational structures between PBS and PSII. Hemidiscoidal PBSs of the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> strain PCC 6803 and the <italic>Anabana</italic> sp. strain PCC 7120 are associated with one PSII dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rast et al., 2019</xref>).

The hemiellipsoidal PBS connects with monomeric PSII at a ratio from 1:1 to 1:4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohki et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). Using in situ cryo-ET, our work reports the native PBS–PSII supercomplex structure of red algae. The structure reveals a different ratio (1:6) of hemiellipsoidal PBS and PSII on the native thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Each PBS directly interacts with two PSII dimers and indirectly interacts with two PSII monomers from two peripheral bridging PSII dimers, forming the interconnected array of the PBS–PSII supercomplex with the support of three unassigned connectors. With 14° rotation and 30 Å shift of PSII dimer pair relative to PBS core, the terminal emitters, ApcD and α<sup>LCM</sup>, in the two symmetric a2a3 and a2'a3' hexamers of the core, connect with CP43 of PSII monomers A1 and B2, and CP47 in PSII monomers B1 and A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A similar geometry of the PBS–PSII supercomplex was reported in cyanobacteria and red algae possessing hemidiscoidal PBS, suggesting that hemidiscoidal PBSs use the same strategy for energy transfer from PBS to PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arteni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteni et al., 2008</xref>). This structure also enables the extra lateral hexamers in <italic>P. purpureum</italic> to associate with PSII monomers C1 and C'2 through connector 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of the PBS–PSII supercomplex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The front view of the schematic model of the PBS–PSII supercomplex.

Two PsbO subunits from the adjacent PSII dimers bind with each other and may promote stabilization of the PBS–PSII supercomplex.

Previous research conducting fraction freezing analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 1990</xref>) has found that the PBS–PSII complexes on random distribution regions could have lower stoichiometry (between 1:1 and 1:4), which are represented as an PSII monomer, dimer, trimer, or double dimer. These observations show the possible diversity of PBS–PSII organization on the thylakoids.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The connection between PBS and PSIIs</title><p>Extensive studies have shown that α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD are the terminal emitters of the energy coupling between PBS and PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zlenko et al., 2019</xref>). In our structures, we detailed the connections of α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD with PSII, which contribute to the energy flows from PBS to PSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). ApcF was also reported to be involved in the energy transfer in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calzadilla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). However, we could not find a solid connection between ApcF and PSII. Thus, it is very likely that ApcF only plays an auxiliary role for direct energy transfer to reaction centers in red algae.</p><p>Additionally, these in situ structures reveal that three extra connectors are associated with PSII by the PBS core, Rod a, and the lateral hexamer, respectively. While the current resolution limited additional detailed analysis of the connectors, we attempted to estimate the molecular weights of these connectors at around 30–80 kDa according to the size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We found a class of PSII dimer C (PSII dimer C, C', and C&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that does not directly bind to PBS but is closer to the lateral hexamer. Since PSII dimer C can only absorb energy from the independent lateral hexamer instead of the whole PBS through connector 3, they could have fewer bilins feeding into them than the other PSIIs and could become saturated with light at higher intensities. If the PSII dimer C is more sensitive to light intensity than the others, it could be involved in the transition between the ordered distribution region and the random distribution region. The transient absorption spectroscopic measurements and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy at low temperatures (77k or 4k) could help confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>The energy transfer from PBS to PSII could follow multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The two terminal emitters, α<sup>LCM</sup> and ApcD, funnel light energy to PSII by distinct structural connections. The chromophore of α<sup>LCM</sup> mediates energy transfer via interaction with CP43 and CP47. In contrast, the chromophore of ApcD is mediated by interactions with CP43. Since connector 2 connects with both the basal PC hexamer of Rod a and CP47 of PSII, we speculate that alternative routes of energy transfer bypassing the PBS core to PSII could exist: connector 2 and connector 3 could mediate the energy flow from the basal hexamer of Rod a to PSII and from lateral hexamer to PSII, respectively. Ueno et al. have reported light energy flows from CP43 to CP47 by energy transfer between the neighboring PSII monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ueno et al., 2017</xref>). Our in situ structure reveals that α<sup>LCM</sup> transfers energy to CP43 as well as the neighboring CP47, may suggesting that α<sup>LCM</sup> provides the modulation activity of energy flow between CP43 and the neighboring CP47. However, it is currently unclear whether the connector proteins play a specific role in the energy transfer between PBS and PSII, and this topic requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The perforations and stairs of the thylakoids</title><p>In several tomograms, we observed the thylakoid membrane branching and fusion regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Within the limited thickness of the tomogram, we observed a small area of thylakoid membranes present branching and fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The two parallel thylakoid membranes are split into two branches. One branch approaches and fuses with another branch from the neighboring thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The 3D segmentation model shows that the branching and fusing membranes built ‘stairs’ between two neighboring thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). On the top of the ‘stairs’ is the large perforation on the thylakoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Conrad W Mullineaux (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were overall excited by the insights your in-situ cryo-ET analysis gave into the organization of the PBS/PSII complex. However in some places we felt the descriptions of atom level interactions were not justified by the data. In other regions the descriptions are speculative but worth including.</p><p>Please remove the following discussions:</p><p>– Page 4 lines 35-36. The claim of a 45 deg rotation is unsupported by the data and should be removed.</p><p>– Page 7, lines 1-11. This section is too speculative and conclusions are drawn regarding missing residue of a loop which are really not supported by the data.</p><p>Please modify other parts of the manuscript to make it clear that the descriptions are more speculative:</p><p>– Page 7, lines 18-20.</p><p>– Page 8, lines 5-13.</p><p>– Page 8, lines 20-24.</p><p>2) The methods section needs more detail to allow readers to understand how the structure were solved. Please see the comments by reviewer 2 below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports the in-situ structure of the red algal phycobilisome while still bound to the thylakoid membrane. It is a follow-up to the same group's impressive cryo EM structure of the isolated phycobilisome from the same organism (Ma et al. Nature 2020). While the resolution of the current structure is significantly lower than that of the isolated complex, (13+ A vs 2.8 A), it has the advantage of revealing the organization in the membrane, the connections to Photosystem II and additional details of the structure that may be too labile to survive the isolation of the complex.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an impressive study. Of particular note is the discovery of the Type C PSII, which I don't think has been previously reported. The emphasis on the excitation energy coupling pathways to PSII is also important new information, although the relatively low resolution of the current structure makes that analysis less certain.</p><p>I suggest that the authors emphasize in clearer terms that this is an in-situ structure that is complementary to the structure of the isolated complex and reveals elements of the in vivo organization that can never be obtained through structures of the isolated complex, no matter how high the resolution. I think some readers may not appreciate that point sufficiently, and the current manuscript does not emphasize this critical point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Li et al., report the in situ structure of the phycobilisome (PBS) – photosystem II (PSII) complex in P. purpureum cells. They prepare cells by cryo-FIB/SEM, and collect cryo-tomograms around thylakoid membrane regions that are decorated by PBS/PSII regular arrays. They then perform subtomogram averaging of PBS pairs and single complexes to obtain structures at resolutions ranging between 13 and 16 A. These allow fitting of available atomic models and analysis of the molecular architecture and interfaces that characterise the complex.</p><p>The authors are able to confirm the overall architecture of PBS which was obtained from previous studies, but also reveal a number of novel features, including unexpected stoichiometry of PBS:PSII, and some uncharacterised interfaces. The results are organised into three main sections:</p><p>– Overall structure of the PBS-PSII supercomplex</p><p>Here the authors describe how each unit is composed of a PBS and three PSII dimers, two of which contact PBS directly, and two seem connected through some novel densities (here called 'lateral densities'), which are assigned to extra PBS hexamer. This was not reported before and it might be an interface that is stable only in an in situ context. This section is strong and the conclusions are well justified.</p><p>– Interaction pattern between PBS and PSII</p><p>Here the authors utilise the fitted atomic models to analyse interfaces between PBS and the PSII dimers at the molecular level. While the resolution of their subtomogram averaging map is sufficient for rigid body fitting of the relevant structures, I find the analysis here too speculative, particularly when it comes to analysis of subdomains (i.e. the PB-loop and the 33 missing residues, and the 117deg rotation of CP43 N-terminus).</p><p>The claim of two pathways for electron transfer and their description is unsupported by the data.</p><p>– Supplementary interactions intermediated by three connector proteins</p><p>Here the authors identify regions of density that cannot be explained with the fitted atomic models, and cautiously assign them to connecting proteins. They then analyse the positions of these connecting proteins and describe the interfaces they bridge. While the discovery of these new densities and the overall description of their contacts is convincing, I feel that again the authors draw conclusions at a level of molecular detail that is too speculative given the resolution.</p><p>Overall this is a novel and solid paper with regards to the overall description of PBS/PSII in situ, its stoichiometry and general architecture, which should be of interest to the fields of electron transport and in situ cryo-tomography.

A crucial feature of work is that it reports structures in situ, in intact flash-frozen sections. That's important for 2 reasons. Firstly, the in situ data reveals the larger-scale organisation of the complexes in the membrane, which is crucially important for photosynthetic performance. Secondly, the association between phycobilisomes and reaction centres appears rather plastic and is highly unstable (at least in vitro), raising the possibility of significant artefacts in any preparation of isolated complexes. So, in situ information of this sort is really needed to provide convincing answers. I am not well qualified to judge the technical aspects of the tomographic analysis, but it all looks sound as far as I am able to judge. The manuscript is very well-written and well-presented, and there is an excellent, balanced discussion of the findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69635.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were overall excited by the insights your in-situ cryo-ET analysis gave into the organization of the PBS/PSII complex.

It is a follow-up to the same group's impressive cryo EM structure of the isolated phycobilisome from the same organism (Ma et al. Nature 2020). While the resolution of the current structure is significantly lower than that of the isolated complex, (13+ A vs 2.8 A), it has the advantage of revealing the organization in the membrane, the connections to Photosystem II and additional details of the structure that may be too labile to survive the isolation of the complex.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an impressive study. Of particular note is the discovery of the Type C PSII, which I don't think has been previously reported. The emphasis on the excitation energy coupling pathways to PSII is also important new information, although the relatively low resolution of the current structure makes that analysis less certain.</p><p>I suggest that the authors emphasize in clearer terms that this is an in-situ structure that is complementary to the structure of the isolated complex and reveals elements of the in vivo organization that can never be obtained through structures of the isolated complex, no matter how high the resolution. I think some readers may not appreciate that point sufficiently, and the current manuscript does not emphasize this critical point.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your insightful suggestions. We have incorporated your suggestions into the last paragraph of the introduction part (Page 4, lines 9-12, lines 16-17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Li et al., report the in situ structure of the phycobilisome (PBS) – photosystem II (PSII) complex in P. purpureum cells. They prepare cells by cryo-FIB/SEM, and collect cryo-tomograms around thylakoid membrane regions that are decorated by PBS/PSII regular arrays. They then perform subtomogram averaging of PBS pairs and single complexes to obtain structures at resolutions ranging between 13 and 16 A. These allow fitting of available atomic models and analysis of the molecular architecture and interfaces that characterise the complex.</p><p>The authors are able to confirm the overall architecture of PBS which was obtained from previous studies, but also reveal a number of novel features, including unexpected stoichiometry of PBS:PSII, and some uncharacterised interfaces. The results are organised into three main sections:</p><p>– Overall structure of the PBS-PSII supercomplex</p><p>Here the authors describe how each unit is composed of a PBS and three PSII dimers, two of which contact PBS directly, and two seem connected through some novel densities (here called 'lateral densities'), which are assigned to extra PBS hexamer. This was not reported before and it might be an interface that is stable only in an in situ context. This section is strong and the conclusions are well justified.</p><p>– Interaction pattern between PBS and PSII</p><p>Here the authors utilise the fitted atomic models to analyse interfaces between PBS and the PSII dimers at the molecular level. While the resolution of their subtomogram averaging map is sufficient for rigid body fitting of the relevant structures, I find the analysis here too speculative, particularly when it comes to analysis of subdomains (i.e. the PB-loop and the 33 missing residues, and the 117deg rotation of CP43 N-terminus).</p><p>The claim of two pathways for electron transfer and their description is unsupported by the data.</p><p>– Supplementary interactions intermediated by three connector proteins</p><p>Here the authors identify regions of density that cannot be explained with the fitted atomic models, and cautiously assign them to connecting proteins. They then analyse the positions of these connecting proteins and describe the interfaces they bridge. While the discovery of these new densities and the overall description of their contacts is convincing, I feel that again the authors draw conclusions at a level of molecular detail that is too speculative given the resolution.</p><p>Overall this is a novel and solid paper with regards to the overall description of PBS/PSII in situ, its stoichiometry and general architecture, which should be of interest to the fields of electron transport and in situ cryo-tomography. However some of the claims are not justified by the data, in particular those that analyse interactions in molecular detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your precious comments.

We have included the introduction about Rod a, Rod b, PBS core, PSII composition in the introduction section as follows:</p><p>“The cryo-EM structure of PBS in red alga Porphyridium purpureum (Ma et al., 2020) shows that the PBS consists of a tricylindrical PBS core,14 rods (Rod a – Rod g, Rod a’– Rod g’), 8 individual extra PE (αβ)<sub>6</sub> hexamers (Ha – Hd, Ha’– Hd’) and 24 individual extra PE α or β subunits. The core contains one top cylinder B, composed of two allophycocyanin (APC) (αβ)<sub>3</sub> trimers, and two bottom cylinders (A and A’), each of which is assembled by three APC trimers (A1-A3, A2 and A3 form APC hexamer). The rods consist of phycoerythrin (PE) and phycocyanin (PC) hexamers or only PE hexamers. For example, Rod a is composited of one basal PC hexamer and two distal PE hexamers. Thus, the energy absorbed by Rod transfers uni-directionally from the distal PE to the basal PC, and then funnels to APC in the core, and eventually to the two terminal emitters, including chromophores in the core–membrane linker protein (L<sub>CM</sub>, also called ApcE) (Capuano et al., 1991; Lundell et al., 1981; Tang et al., 2015) and allophycocyanin D (ApcD) (Glazer and Bryant, 1975; Peng et al., 2014).”</p><p>(Page 2, lines 32 - 36, Page 3, lines 1-7).</p><p>&quot;The main subunits of PSII include the reaction center D1, D2 protein, and chlorophyll-a binding proteins, CP43 and CP47.

In the revised manuscript, we claimed the lateral hexamer might be a PE hexamer as follows:</p><p>“To analyze the lateral densities on both sides of PBS connecting PBS to PSII dimer C, we</p><p>further improved the resolution of the PBS-PSII supercomplex to 13.2 Å after post-processing from the 14.3 Å resolution map (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). The slice view of the PBSPSII map shows that the densities are round discs with stronger densities in the center (Figure 2—figure supplement 3E–G). These features are reminiscent of the structure of the extra hexamer found in the single-particle cryo-EM structure of P. <italic>purpureum</italic> PBS. Moreover, the lateral densities are of the same size and shape as the extra hexamer. As all eight extra hexamers in P. <italic>purpureum</italic> PBS are PE hexamers, we hypothesize that the lateral density could be contributed by a PE hexamer, which is referred to as the lateral hexamer (Figure 2B). Further analysis indicated that the lateral hexamer connects with the bottom hexamer of Rod a and the second hexamer of Rod e, which are the PC and PE hexamers, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 3E).” (Page 6, lines 34 -36, Page 7, lines 1-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There are a series of unsupported claims:</p><p>– Page 7, lines 1-11.
