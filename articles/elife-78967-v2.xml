How is the cell cycle regulated to promote or suppress heterogeneity and differentiation? We explore this question combining time lapse imaging with single-cell RNA-seq in the contexts of self-renewal, priming, and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards the Primitive Endoderm (PrE) lineage. Since ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mammalian blastocyst, ESCs in standard culture conditions are transcriptionally heterogeneous containing dynamically interconverting subfractions primed for either of the two ICM lineages, Epiblast and PrE. Here, we find that differential regulation of cell cycle can tip the balance between these primed populations, such that naïve ESC culture promotes Epiblast-like expansion and PrE differentiation stimulates the selective survival and proliferation of PrE-primed cells. In endoderm differentiation, this change is accompanied by a counter-intuitive increase in G1 length, also observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. While fibroblast growth factor/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (FGF/ERK) signalling is a key regulator of ESC differentiation and PrE specification, we find it is not just responsible for ESCs heterogeneity, but also the inheritance of similar cell cycles between sisters and cousins. Taken together, our results indicate a tight relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and cell cycle regulation in lineage specification, with primed cell populations providing a pool of flexible cell types that can be expanded in a lineage-specific fashion while allowing plasticity during early determination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>selection</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R198-2015-412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001825</institution-id><institution>Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-8020-00100B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Trusina</surname><given-names>Ala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R286-2018-1534</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perera</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R303-2018-2939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monteiro</surname><given-names>Rita S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF21CC0073729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17CC002785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The simultaneous expansion of G1 and acceleration of the cell cycle, while ensuring synchronous inheritance of these properties, progressively induces cell identity in differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Naïve mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are karyotypically normal, immortal cell lines derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Kaufman, 1981</xref>).

In mouse, pluripotent stem cells can be derived from several stages of development and exhibit gene expression profiles matching these developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morgani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riveiro and Brickman, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Under specific conditions, mESCs can recapitulate several aspects of the ICM specification. When cultured in serum and the cytokine LIF, they constitute a dynamically heterogeneous cell culture model that contains populations that are primed, but not committed, for both primitive endoderm (PrE) and Epiblast. These populations exhibit biases in differentiation but will readily interconvert when left in self-renewing culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Illingworth et al., 2016</xref>). While these conditions involve serum, we recently defined a culture condition that supports heterogeneous ESC culture, and at the same time sustains effective propagation of pluripotency and high levels of germline transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). We refer to this culture condition as NACL for N2B27, Activin A, Chiron, and LIF. A similar defined media with the same components but an RPMI base (RACL) supports PrE differentiation and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). As NACL ESC media is almost identical to the media used for PrE differentiation (RACL), this culture model is an ideal system for the comparison of self-renewal and differentiation.</p><p>Several time lapse studies have explored the role of heterogeneity in ESCs, and comparisons have been made between naïve culture in serum and media based on small molecule inhibitors of GSK3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), in addition to LIF (2i/LIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abranches et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filipczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hastreiter et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these studies have focussed on the dynamic heterogeneity of pluripotency factors which are associated with supporting the pluripotent state and Epiblast specification <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although they have explored the role of pluripotency factors in lineage priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strebinger et al., 2019</xref>), they have not assessed the expression of lineage-specific markers, how cells progress into differentiation and the role of priming in differentiation. Here, we explore these questions with respect to PrE priming and differentiation.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, the segregation of PrE from Epiblast is regulated by the FGF/ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chazaud et al., 2006</xref>). The inhibition of this pathway results in an expansion of Epiblast identity and loss of PrE, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nichols et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton and Brickman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saiz et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the activity of this pathway in supporting PrE differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, inhibition of the kinase upstream ERK, MEK, with a pharmacological antagonist (PD03) is an important component of the defined ESC culture system known as 2i/LIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ying et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, ERK activation is also associated with cell cycle progression and is thought to stimulate G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ter Huurne et al., 2017</xref>). Although G1 lengthening has been functionally related to endoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>), it is not clear how ERK stimulation of cell cycle progression relates to its capacity to induce differentiation.</p><p>Here, we focus on the dynamics of PrE priming and differentiation exploiting both time lapse imaging and single-cell RNA-seq to link both events to regulation of the cell cycle. ESC culture (NACL) was found to support the more rapid proliferation of the Epiblast-primed population, and PrE differentiation (RACL) promotes the more rapid proliferation of cells primed for endoderm differentiation. We found that FGF signalling regulates cell states and proportions through both coordinating inheritance of cell cycle lengths as well as rates of endoderm priming. This functional regulation of cell cycle in heterogeneous cell cultures indicates that cell cycle synchronization supports self-renewal as well as preparing cells for further differentiation. Furthermore, we found that G1 length is adjusted independently from the cell cycle, pointing to a model where cells receive signals from cytokines during G1, while still actively proliferating. Taken together, our work suggests that cell cycle length is not only tightly regulated by the culture context, but that this coordination has a functional role in both heterogeneity and lineage choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq of PrE differentiation reveals the presence of both endoderm and Epiblast-like populations in differentiation</title><p>To assess lineage-specific transcriptional heterogeneity in PrE differentiation and compare the events occurring <italic>in vitro</italic> to those occurring <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing by MARS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>) on samples from 2i/LIF and days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 of <italic>in vitro</italic> PrE differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We found that 12.6 ± 0.6% of the total population upregulated <italic>Hhex</italic> expression during the first 72 hr, thereby transitioning into the PrE cluster. However, after the 72-hr time point, only 1.9 ± 1.2% of the cells were able to transit between clusters. This suggested that competence to enter the endoderm lineage was lost after the first 3 days of the differentiation, indicating that proliferation was enhanced following lineage choice. Hence, even though only a small population of cells entered differentiation, the selective expansion of these cells allowed them to take over the final culture.</p><p>To assess whether the combination of this small amount of lineage conversion followed by enhanced proliferation was sufficient to account for the behaviour of differentiating cultures, we sought to generate a simple model introducing the transition probability observed in time lapse (<italic>t</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This minimal set of parameters was not enough to recapitulate our lineage trees. We found that only after introducing both differential survival rates for PrE and NEDiff cells (<italic>s</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as well as different cell cycle contributions (<italic>d</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) we could reproduce the cell populations observed. Thus, this minimal model predicted that selective cell death was also required to explain differentiation. To quantify the extent of this during differentiation, we determined the survival rates in our cultures. Before commitment took place at day 3, 86% of prospective PrE cells survived to generate colonies of PrE, whereas only 61% of the NEDiff survived (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This difference in survival was further enhanced following commitment at 72 hr and continuing throughout differentiation: from this point onwards, 92% of cells in the PrE cluster survived, whereas only 39% of the cells in the NEDiff cluster did (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We explored the possible contributions of proliferation and survival in our mathematical model by tuning the survival rates and the division times for both populations in order to predict which parameter is more important in shaping the distributions of populations observed for each day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that on day 3, the cell cycle contribution has a more significant impact on the population composition, while cell survival has an increasing dominant impact on days 4 and 5. Therefore, it appeared that differentiation was selecting for committed endoderm at two levels: proliferation first, and cell survival later. Furthermore scRNA-seq suggested that the PrE population also accrued more endodermal identity as it expanded, such that endodermal gene expression not only became more homogeneous, but the level of endodermal transcription in individual cells increases from days 2 to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a process we refer to as progressive induction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Analysis of Primitive Endoderm (PrE) progenitor cells demonstrates functional priming of Hhex-high cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A mathematical model that considers the difference in cell death rate between the two populations as well as the proliferation rate can recapitulate the PrE dataset collected (see Methods for description of the Mathematical Modelling).

The compartments were called High (cells within the highest 25% intensities), Low (cells within the lowest 25% intensities), and Mid (the rest of the intensities) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We used the division time of each cell to express transitions per 24 hr unit and observed a similar rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, we obtained residence times for each compartment to decipher whether a particular Hhex state was more stable than others, and we found no difference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). The residence time was calculated as the number of generations (or hours) that a cell remains in one state. To compare transitions in NACL to early differentiation, we measured the transition rates in RACL on days 1–3 of PrE differentiation and found that RACL promotes transitions towards higher Hhex compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we investigated the influence of cell cycle. In RACL (PrE media), the Hhex-expressing primed population had a short cell cycle, but in NACL, where ESC self-renewal predominates, we found the opposite.

Thus, the proportion of cells in the Low Hhex compartment increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To understand if this increase stems from changes in cell death, proliferation, or switching probabilities, we compared these between the NACL and PD03 conditions. At the level of cell survival, PD03 treatment had little effect (80% cells that survived vs. 86% in NACL, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). However, culture in PD03 produced significant alterations to both cell cycle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and cell state transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While the influence of PD03 on cell state transitions is difficult to quantify robustly as PD03 can induce rapid cell state changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>), we observed a high transition rate from the rare High Hhex cells found in PD03 conditions. We also observed shorter residence times for the High Hhex state in PD03, and longer times for the Low Hhex state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>), suggesting that inclusion of PD03 in cell culture media suppresses the stability of the High state, such that any cell that escapes the Low Hhex and Mid compartments, rapidly returns.</p><p>We observed a shorter division time in the population of cells treated with PD03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, confirmed by bootstrap analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Similar to the results observed in NACL, in PD03, cells in the Low Hhex compartment (Epiblast-like) had a shorter cell cycle than those in the other two compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). However, when we compared the division time in the same compartment, but different media conditions (i.e. plus and minus PD03), we did not observe significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together with an increased fraction of cells in the Low Hhex compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), this indicated that on a population level, PD03 decreased cell cycle length by increasing the fraction of fast proliferating cells in the Low Hhex (Epiblast-like) state. Thus, the change in cell cycle length observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> appears to be a population effect and not a result of PD03 regulating the cell cycle at the level of individual cells.</p><p>It has previously been shown that cell cycle lengths are inherited. This does not occur transgenerationally, as mothers and daughters do not have correlated cell cycle lengths, but sisters and cousins do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandler et al., 2015</xref>). Does this imply that synchronous cell cycle inheritance is a fundamental facet of lineage specification? In NACL, we found that cell cycle length was correlated between sisters and cousins, but not mother–daughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Given that PD03 produced a more homogeneous population of Low Hhex cells that divided faster, we hypothesized that cell cycle inheritance might therefore be better correlated. However, we found that cell cycle correlation between sisters and cousins was reduced or eliminated in the presence of PD03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This capacity of PD03 to inhibit cell cycle correlations suggests that the mechanisms governing cell cycle entrainment are likely dependent on signalling downstream of MEK.</p><p>We considered two possible paradigms for ERK-dependent regulation of cell cycle synchronization: either the symmetric inheritance of a kinase activity, or the paracrine activity of a cytokine that drives MEK/ERK activation. FGF4 is a prominent cytokine known to activate the ERK pathway in ESCs and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, defined durations of FGF/ERK signalling can induce ESCs to adopt a PrE-primed state homogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton and Brickman, 2014</xref>). This suggests that the paracrine signalling with FGF and its receptor (FGFR) may be responsible for cell cycle synchronization in ESC culture. To test this idea, we followed ESC cell cycle and lineage heterogeneity in response to pharmacological inhibition of FGFR with PD17 (PD173074, an FGFR1/3 inhibitor). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows that culture in NACL with PD17 resulted in the same loss of cousin and sister correlation as that in response to inhibition of its downstream kinase MEK, further supporting the role for this pathway as a primary determinant of cell cycle synchronization. Furthermore, PD03 was both more effective at inducing Low Hhex populations and producing a general decrease in cell cycle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). However, despite the reduced effect of PD17 in ESC heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right), PD17 was at least as effective as PD03 in its capacity to block synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, even though PD17 containing cultures had significant proportions of Mid Hhex and High cells, that proliferated slowly, PD17 still blocked their synchronization, suggesting that this pivotal pathway independently regulates cell state transitions and cell cycle synchronization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>G1 length regulation accompanies the changes observed in cell cycle</title><p>To further elucidate the differences in cell cycle length in this context, we performed time lapse using the FUCCI cell cycle reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>), engineered with an H2B lineage reporter (see Methods, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

Although the significance of this increased G1 length may require additional measurement, the increase in G1 length relative to cell cycle length was significant. Thus, in steady state, G1 either remains unaffected or is marginally increased despite the decreasing cell cycle time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). We confirmed these unexpected changes by bootstrap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively our results suggest that G1 length is increased relative to the cell cycle in response to PD03. As we cannot combine the G1 reporter with <italic>Hhex</italic> lineage, we cannot assess whether it is the High Hhex or Low Hhex cells which present a longer G1. However, as the impact of PD03 on cell cycle is a consequence of stimulating the Low Hhex population, we presume an increase in this population accounts for the change in the ratio of G1 to the cell cycle. We therefore used division time to infer cell identity and found that fast dividing cells (Low Hhex) have a higher ratio of G1 to cell division than slow cells (0.15 ± 0.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.04), suggesting Low Hhex cells have a longer G1. Taken together, our results suggest that PD03 promotes the faster proliferating Low Hhex population, but that the decreased cell cycle time in this population is not a result of stimulating G1/S transition, consistent with the role of this drug in inhibiting it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ter Huurne et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also assessed alternation in G1 during PrE differentiation (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Since this cell line did not have a <italic>Hhex</italic> marker, we stained for GATA6 at the end of the time lapse and retrospectively identified PrE lineage trees, mapping the progenitor cells that would give rise to GATA6-positive colonies. Using this approach, we were able to locate the progenitors of fully differentiated PrE cells and determine their cell cycle parameters on different days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Despite the decreased cell cycle length observed for endoderm committed cells at day 3, we observed a progressive increase in G1 itself and the G1 ratio in the PrE colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right). This increase in G1 appeared in parallel with the increase in proliferative capacity that we assumed associated with endoderm commitment arising from days 3 to 4, further strengthening the apparently contradictory correlation between increased G1 and higher rates of cell division. While there is an enhanced ratio of G1 length in Epiblast-primed ESCs, the changes in G1 during differentiation are much more significant, with G1 itself doubling as cells progress in differentiation.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video4" xlink:href="elife-78967-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Example of an imaged FUCCI colony during Primitive Endoderm (PrE) differentiation.</title><p><italic>mCherry-Cdt1</italic> is shown in cyan, and <italic>H2B-miRF670</italic> is shown in magenta.

We found an increase in cells expressing G1 transcripts as they progressed into the endodermal lineage <italic>in vivo.</italic> Around the time of implantation E4.5, there was a robust difference in cell cycle phase between Epiblast, which was mostly in S phase, and PrE, where almost half of the cells were in G1. This suggests the coupling we observed between cell cycle and differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> might be recapitulated in endoderm specification <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the shift in cell cycle would need to occur quite rapidly <italic>in vivo</italic> as the time scale for differentiation is much shorter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we describe a close relationship between cell cycle length, lineage priming, and differentiation. In ESC self-renewal <italic>in vitro</italic>, naïve Epiblast-like cells proliferate faster than those primed for PrE differentiation, but when the base media is changed, the tides are turned, and the PrE-primed population develops the proliferative advantage. This suggests that differential culture conditions identify the appropriate lineage-biased populations and stimulate their relative expansion. Our observation that similar alterations in cell cycle exist in peri-implantation development suggests that while this facet of differentiation is exploited <italic>in vitro</italic>, aspects of it could be a fundamental component of cell specification <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The differentiation process we define is both selective and progressively inductive. Heterogeneities arise, and these appear to be captured in early differentiation. However, the lineage-specific nature of these primed cells increases inductively (or progressively) such that endodermal identity accrues with each cell cycle. Primed cells that fail to enhance endodermal gene expression tend to die. By day 3 in differentiation, all the future founder cells in the culture are set, and further commitment does not occur. At this point, a combination of selective cell survival, increased rates of proliferation and enhanced endodermal transcription leads to the final differentiated cell populations. By the later time points in differentiation, the combination of single-cell sequencing, time lapse imaging, and mathematical modelling, suggests that cells that fail to enter the endoderm program selectively die, but at early time cell division dominates. Moreover, while differentiation promotes more rapid cell cycling, it also produces apparently contradictory increases in G1 length.</p><p>What are the factors that govern a cell’s choice to differentiate? An increase in G1 would give cycling cells more time to respond to inductive signals, ultimately leading to increased responsiveness to differentiation cues. This would suggest that cells progress into early differentiation, lengthening their G1 phase, thereby improving accessibility to cues promoting commitment, and enabling signalling dependent transcription factors to accumulate ahead of replication. While the link between G1 phase and commitment of pluripotent stem cells into differentiation was first described in 1987 in embryonal carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mummery et al., 1987</xref>), the recent development of the cell cycle reporter cell line FUCCI has allowed for more detailed findings in this field. It has been functionally demonstrated that the G1 fraction of ESCs has an enhanced capacity to respond to endoderm differentiation signals both in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>). In broad terms, these studies support the notion of G1 phase as a window where pluripotent stem cells can respond more effectively to differentiation cues, and specifically towards the endoderm lineage. Our findings that during the early stages of PrE differentiation cells lengthen their G1 phase as well as proliferate faster provide an explanation for how selected G1-responsive cells can also compete with other populations occupying the same niche. In self-renewing ESCs, PrE-primed Hhex-expressing cells are slowed. Culture conditions that promote a more homogeneous expansion of an Epiblast-like state include PD03, an inhibitor of G1/S transition, suggesting that the expansion of Epiblast-like cells could also involve similar cell cycle regulation. The notion that G1 phase lengthening accompanies differentiation has been shown in other cell lineages such as neural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roccio et al., 2013</xref>), pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krentz et al., 2017</xref>), and intestinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In general, we described a tendency for increased rates of proliferation accompanied by increases in G1, and hence cells exhibiting a shorter cell cycle had a longer G1. While G1 progression has previously been linked to phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ter Huurne et al., 2017</xref>), this does not fit with our observations in differentiation or for PrE specification <italic>in vivo</italic>, where there is a progressive increase in G1 despite the robust activation of ERK signalling. Cell cycle progression is tightly regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 produces G1 lengthening and spontaneous differentiation in pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filipczyk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neganova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>). In mESCs, it has been shown that the ERK pathway is a regulator of G1 length upstream of CDK/cyclin complex which phosphorylates Rb. Taking into account the heterogeneous distribution of cyclins and CDK proteins in the different cell types across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wianny et al., 1998</xref>), we propose that during PrE differentiation a different CDK/cyclin complex is regulating G1 phase length, and this complex is no longer a target of ERK phosphorylation in this context.</p><p>Mammalian cells share the striking quality of being synchronized in cell cycle length between members of the same generation (sisters and cousins), but not with the previous generation (mother–daughter). This was originally demonstrated in both a lymphoblast cell line and ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Waisman et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, as alluded to above and suggested by previous work, this correlation might be determined based on factors that are inherited by related cells. This means that sister cells would inherit the same amount of determinant, which would be different from the previous generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sandler et al., 2015</xref>). Our observations suggest that this determinant is a factor located within the ERK pathway downstream of MEK, as culture with either the MEK inhibitor PD03 and/or the FGFR antagonist PD17 eliminates these correlations. Thus FGF/ERK regulation is likely a key nexus for this activity, and our observations suggest this activity is independent of its role in regulating differentiation. Whether this reflects a paracrine interaction of related cells with a common cytokine source or the level of receptor on the surface of these cells cannot be distinguished based on our observations. However, as ERK signalling is a known regulator of the G1/S transition, cell cycle synchronization could be mediated via this check point.</p><p>Given that cell cycle synchronization can be observed on both fast and slow proliferating cells, its relevance to differentiation is difficult to discern. If changes in proliferation are a response to differentiation cues, then synchronous inheritance could ensure that daughter cells retain an equivalent enhanced cell cycle state from their parents regardless of their position relative to the source of the signal. <italic>In vivo</italic>, where PrE differentiation occurs in a salt and pepper pattern in three dimensions, synchronization could enable cells to retain the memory of a signal regardless of their position and despite cell mixing. Moreover, if G1 represents the window of opportunity for cells to act upon signalling cues, we envision cell synchronization could represent inheritance of signalling opportunity, promoting similar durations of active transduction in clones of differentiating cells. If ERK is regulating both differentiation and cell cycle synchronization via G1, it is also possible that cell cycle synchronization is a consequence of ERK-mediated alterations to the temporal window over which a cell responds to cytokine signalling.</p><p>Differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> occurs over several days, while in embryonic development the segregation of Epiblast from PrE occurs over a much shorter time scale, approximately 24 hr. While this difference limits the extent to which our observations <italic>in vitro</italic> can be extrapolated to embryonic development, the similarities between both transcriptome and G1 regulation are striking. Therefore, we speculate that cell cycle synchronization could facilitate a coordinated change in cell division time and G1 length in the context of embryonic lineage specification, enabling coordinated signalling responses.</p><p>Altogether, our data suggest that ESC cultures and their differentiation are complex models that involve an interplay of both priming-based selection and proliferation. We find that cell state changes are major drivers of culture-specific changes in proliferation that, in turn, contribute to the final state of a culture. Despite the increasing rates of proliferation, cells exploit G1 to integrate the signals coming from their environment and evaluate their choices. Although the time scale of the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation is different, it appears that the use of increasing G1 to drive increasing levels of commitment is a fundamental facet of cell fate choice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse ESC culture</title><p>Mouse ESC lines were cultured in standard conditions in NACL as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>.

Pre-processing steps and quality control were done as described previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaitin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rothová et al., 2022</xref>. In short, the reads were aligned using HISAT (version 0.1.6) and mapped to mouse mm9 genome. Further downstream analysis was done using scanpy (version 1.4.6). After filtering 2028 cells and 17,769 genes were normalized and log transformed. We identified 2000 highly variable genes using seurat flavour. Genes were further scaled to mean variance followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension reduction. Neither cell cycle regression nor batch correction were necessary. Finally, we used unsupervised Louvain clustering with resolution set to 0.8 and which identified nine overall clusters (04_analysis.Rmd). Cell cycle was estimated using Seurat’s (4.0.1) <italic>CellCycleScoring</italic> function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cluster Alignment Tool</title><p>To estimate similarity between clusters we used CAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rothová et al., 2022</xref>). First, the tool normalized the datasets using non-zero median which removes the influence of outlier genes. Both datasets are subset for unique and common genes. Next, Euclidean distance is calculated between each pair of clusters by randomly sampling cells with replacement to cluster size. This step is repeated 1000 times generating two distributions. If the distance is significant (sigma = 1.6 representing <italic>p</italic> value = 0.05) we define these clusters transcriptionally similar.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Code availability</title><p>We deposited the original MATLAB scripts behind the data mining and mathematical models on Github: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SilasBoyeNissen/TranscriptionalHeterogeneityAndCellCycleRegulationAsCentralDeterminantsOfPrimitiveEndodermPriming">https://github.com/SilasBoyeNissen/TranscriptionalHeterogeneityAndCellCycleRegulationAsCentralDeterminantsOfPrimitiveEndodermPriming</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:533dba64191a723866cc3e44855be56458cdb5ba;origin=https://github.com/SilasBoyeNissen/TranscriptionalHeterogeneityAndCellCycleRegulationAsCentralDetermin;visit=swh:1:snp:a4c5a9efd71c984d2df90a0d3acd01df73a6fbcf;anchor=swh:1:rev:4ccfdb66c16705ac4171b284235c7d90c589b668">swh:1:rev:4ccfdb66c16705ac4171b284235c7d90c589b668</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nissen, 2022</xref>).</p><p>All scRNA-seq analyses were also uploaded to Github at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/brickmanlab/perera_et_al_2022/">http://github.com/brickmanlab/perera_et_al_2022/</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:f80b91e3c7cdbefadc691134c7d3df76677636e7;origin=https://github.com/brickmanlab/perera_et_al_2022;visit=swh:1:snp:86c105055d5ede20f0354c71dce5bbde5fe9163b;anchor=swh:1:rev:b1adac3f247d4a106e5fb6c0cb880a2402dc38d6">swh:1:rev:b1adac3f247d4a106e5fb6c0cb880a2402dc38d6</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Proks, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data availability</title><p>The scRNA-seq data used in this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>, the accession number is GSE200534.

The authors report a number of interesting findings, including that: differential regulation of the cell cycle can tip the balance between populations of cells primed to different cell fate choices ( PrE vs Epi), different culture conditions favor acceleration/stimulation of cell cycle of different cell populations, and that only a small population of cells from the original culture enters a differentiation process which is followed by selected expansion and/or survival of their progeny. They also observed that during endodermal specification (towards PrE), the cell cycle was shortened with a proportional relative increase of G1 phase length and that FGF activity is responsible for cell cycle synchronization and the inheritance of similar cell cycles between sisters and cousins. The reviewers agree that this work is interesting and well done and would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once the below concerns have been addressed.</p><p>1) There was concern about the massive amount of cell death in the time-lapse data underlying Figures 2 and 3. The media-specific effects on cell survival need to be explained and discussed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) There was also concern about the extent to which parallels can be drawn between findings in ESCs and embryonic development. For example, ESCs have a normal growth phase and so all these cells in culture have the same size but early embryo cleavages occur without a growth phase. Similarly, the timeline of PrE vs Epi specification in vivo and in vitro are completely different. In embryos, PrE is specified within 24h, whereas in vitro it takes 6 days. Thus it is difficult to see how these two timelines together with the different cell cycle lengths can be reliably compared. These limitations should be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>3) At least for the PrE differentiation conditions, the authors need to better emphasize the strong survival effects of the media and discuss the relative contributions of selective cell death and cell cycle changes for generating a homogeneously differentiated PrE culture.</p><p>4) The authors should address whether RACL is purely selective through changes to cell survival and cell cycle, or does it in addition trigger an increase in priming towards the Hhex-positive population before the acceleration of the cell cycle between days 2 and 3? It would be informative to compare transition rates towards the Hhex-high state between NACL and RACL to address this question</p><p>5) The authors should clarify their reasoning as to why cell cycle synchronization is relevant for the differentiation of a culture, or lineage priming (Lines 72, 73, 235). How does the absence or presence of cell cycle synchronization between daughter cells impact the composition of cell populations at a steady state or upon differentiation, as both long and short cell cycles appear to be equally well correlated?</p><p>6) The use of the term &quot;differentiation&quot; is somewhat confusing (,e.g. in line 136 &quot;differentiation proceeds by providing an environment that favored the proliferation of a PrE-primed population&quot;). As this is an initially heterogeneous cell population transiting to a more homogeneous, different state there may be a better way of describing this without terming it differentiation.</p><p>7) The data underlying the table in Figure S5C seem important as they address how state transitions shape the population structure in addition to the cell cycle properties of the different compartments. This should be discussed more extensively in a revised manuscript and perhaps moved to the main Results section. It would also be interesting to quantify residence times and rates of state transitions in units of time-1. These analyses could then be quantitatively compared to corresponding transitioning rates in the presence of PD03 (current Figure S8A, and lines 221 – 225)</p><p>8) In Line 24 of the abstract the authors state that there is a lengthening of G1 in PrE-favouring conditions, but in the main body of the text it is the proportion between G1 and the rest of the cycle that is changing, ( &quot;Thus, G1 either remains unaffected or is marginally increased despite the decreasing cell cycle time (Figure 6A, Table S5)&quot;). Similar claims about the lengthening of the G1 are made in the Discussion. The authors should ensure that the result is described consistently throughout the manuscript</p><p>9) In Line 123 of the Results section, the authors state that: &quot;The identity and distribution of PrE and NEDiff states were confirmed with GATA6 and NANOG staining (Figure S4A).&quot; but the data presented by the authors are not sufficient to support this claim. Pairwise correlation between individual marker intensity needs to be calculated to prove this point with appropriate controls (for example with the use of the same primary antibody with two different secondary antibodies)</p><p>10) In Line 274 of the Results section, the authors state: &quot;As we cannot combine the G1 reporter with Hhex lineage, we cannot assess whether it is the High Hhex or Low Hhex cells which present a longer G1.&quot; – I wonder why the authors cannot use here the same combination of the time-lapse plus immunostaining images as in the earlier experiments.</p><p>11) The figure legend for figure S1 needs more detail so that it can be followed without cross-referencing with the main text and figure 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78967.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was concern about the massive amount of cell death in the time-lapse data underlying Figures 2 and 3.

This is also observed in other differentiation and reprogramming protocols (Ying and Smith 2003; Hayashi et al., 2011; Yasunaga et al., 2005; Argelaguet et al., 2019; Rugg-Gunn 2022).</p><p>While our original analyses were focused on cell cycle, we did not mean to imply that survival is irrelevant to selecting the correct populations at the end of differentiation. Although there is clearly an increase in NEDiff cell death, these rates fluctuate during differentiation (Table 2) and it is difficult to make any hard conclusions about the timing of selection. In addition, we find no signature for apoptosis in all scRNA-seq clusters associated to early NEDiff. However, we thank the reviewers for raising this issue and we address the issue of survival more extensively in the revised manuscript (lines140-142, and 342-347, in addition to a new modelling section described below).</p><p>To further explore when relative survival is most important for effective differentiation, we have reformulated our model. Our new modelling results show that changes in the survival rates have stronger impact shifting the cell proportions at later stages of differentiation. Phase diagrams in Figure 3- Supplement 1 show that at day 5 reaching an appropriate proportion of PrE requires less change in the survival rates than in doubling times, suggesting that survival can have greater impact on the ratio than cell division. However, at day 3, the modelling suggests the opposite, consistent with a first wave of a cell cycle regulation and PrE fastest division time (Figure 2D). We have discussed this in the Results section, lines 162-168.</p><p>We have added survival alongside proliferation to the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was also concern about the extent to which parallels can be drawn between findings in ESCs and embryonic development.

How does the absence or presence of cell cycle synchronization between daughter cells impact the composition of cell populations at a steady state or upon differentiation, as both long and short cell cycles appear to be equally well correlated?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question and we can only speculate as to how cell synchronization impacts on population composition. We have added a discussion of this point (lines 393-403) and quote it here for convenience.</p><p>“If changes in proliferation are a response to differentiation cues, then synchronous inheritance could ensure that daughter cells retain an equivalent enhanced cell cycle state from their parents regardless of their position relative to the source of the signal. in vivo, where PrE differentiation occurs in a salt and pepper pattern in three dimensions, synchronization could enable cells to retain the memory of a signal regardless of their position and despite cell mixing. Moreover, if G1 represents the window of opportunity for cells to act upon signalling cues, we envision cell synchronization could represent inheritance of signalling opportunity, promoting similar durations of active transduction in clones of differentiating cells. If ERK is regulating both differentiation and cell cycle synchronization via G1, it is also possible that cell cycle synchronization is a consequence of ERK mediated alterations to the temporal window over which a cell responds to cytokine signalling”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The use of the term &quot;differentiation&quot; is somewhat confusing (,e.g. in line 136 &quot;differentiation proceeds by providing an environment that favored the proliferation of a PrE-primed population&quot;). As this is an initially heterogeneous cell population transiting to a more homogeneous, different state there may be a better way of describing this without terming it differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the phrasing on line 136, now corresponding to line 139. Current phrasing is as follows:</p><p>“This is the point in time when PrE clones became distinguishable from NEDiff cells in the time lapse video (Video 1) and suggested that culture conditions promoted endoderm specification by providing an environment that favoured the proliferation of a PrE-primed population.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data underlying the table in Figure S5C seem important as they address how state transitions shape the population structure in addition to the cell cycle properties of the different compartments. This should be discussed more extensively in a revised manuscript and perhaps moved to the main Results section. It would also be interesting to quantify residence times and rates of state transitions in units of time-1. These analyses could then be quantitatively compared to corresponding transitioning rates in the presence of PD03 (current Figure S8A, and lines 221 – 225)</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved Figure S5C to Figure 4E and discussed it further in the text (lines 213-216). We have also calculated transitions times using the division times from the dataset, and we added this to Figure 4 – Supplement 1C (and lines 217-220) for NACL and Figure 5 – Supplement 2A for PD03 (line 247). We observed the same trend for transition time than what we described for transition probability.</p><p>We have also calculated residence times for each state in NACL and PD03 (Table 4) and discussed it further in the text (Lines 221-223 for NACL and 250 for PD03). We calculated residence times based on generations and in hours.</p><p>Based on this information, it appears that the major impact of PD03 is to reduce the residence time in the High Hhex state while increasing the residence time in the Low Hhex state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Line 24 of the abstract the authors state that there is a lengthening of G1 in PrE-favouring conditions, but in the main body of the text it is the proportion between G1 and the rest of the cycle that is changing, (“Thus, G1 either remains unaffected or is marginally increased despite the decreasing cell cycle time (Figure 6A, Table S5)&quot;). Similar claims about the lengthening of the G1 are made in the Discussion. The authors should ensure that the result is described consistently throughout the manuscript</p></disp-quote><p>While the claim in line 24 refers to PrE differentiation conditions, where we see a lengthening of G1 phase (Figure 6B), the line referring to G1 being marginally increased refers to Figure 6A, where G1 and division times are measured in steady state conditions (NACL, PD03 and 2i/LIF). We apologize if our claims were confusing and we have added a clarification in lines 297 and 318.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Line 123 of the Results section, the authors state that: &quot;The identity and distribution of PrE and NEDiff states were confirmed with GATA6 and NANOG staining (Figure S4A).&quot; but the data presented by the authors are not sufficient to support this claim. Pairwise correlation between individual marker intensity needs to be calculated to prove this point with appropriate controls (for example with the use of the same primary antibody with two different secondary antibodies)</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed the progressive acquisition of GATA6 cells and the loss of NANOG cells at different time points of PrE differentiation by quantifying multiple images from the immunostaining to Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B, together with a negative control corresponding to a sample without a primary antibody. The plots show individual datapoints corresponding to single cells, segmented based on DAPI staining.</p><p>To address this point we have also revised the text (line 127) to read “The identity and time evolution of PrE and NEDiff states were confirmed with GATA6 and NANOG staining (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2A, B).&quot; We did this as we realized the word “distribution” may be misleading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Line 274 of the Results section, the authors state: &quot;As we cannot combine the G1 reporter with Hhex lineage, we cannot assess whether it is the High Hhex or Low Hhex cells which present a longer G1.&quot; – I wonder why the authors cannot use here the same combination of the time-lapse plus immunostaining images as in the earlier experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>High and Low Hhex states are too dynamic to infer cell states based on antibody staining of ESC culture. If we stain with Hhex at the end of a FUCCI time lapse, there is no way to infer whether that High Hhex cell was also High 3 days prior to the staining. In the case of GATA6, we were labelling cells at the end of differentiation, and then inferring the nature of progenitors of these differentiated cells.</p><p>Our means of assigning dynamic identity in ESCs therefore required a different approach. Here, we know that fast dividing cells correspond to the Low Hhex, and slow dividing cells represent the High Hhex fraction. We therefore used division time to infer cell identity and found that fast dividing cells have longer G1 Ratio than slow cells (0.15 ± 0.055 vs 0.141 ± 0.043), suggesting Low Hhex cells have a longer G1, as indicated in the Results section, line 303-305.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The figure legend for figure S1 needs more detail so that it can be followed without cross-referencing with the main text and figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have supplied detail.</p><p>References:</p><p>Argelaguet, Ricard, Stephen J.
