In bacteria, these channels are built as dual-topology dimers whereby the two subunits assemble in antiparallel transmembrane orientation. Recent crystal structures suggested that Fluc channels contain two separate ion-conduction pathways, each with two F<sup>−</sup> binding sites, but no functional correlates of this unusual architecture have been reported. Experiments here fill this gap by examining the consequences of mutating two conserved F<sup>−</sup>-coordinating phenylalanine residues. Substitution of each phenylalanine specifically extinguishes its associated F<sup>−</sup> binding site in crystal structures and concomitantly inhibits F<sup>−</sup> permeation. Functional analysis of concatemeric channels, which permit mutagenic manipulation of individual pores, show that each pore can be separately inactivated without blocking F<sup>−</sup> conduction through its symmetry-related twin. The results strongly support dual-pathway architecture of Fluc channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18767.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18767.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>fluoride ion channel</kwd><kwd>permeation</kwd><kwd>membrane protein architecture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolmakova-Partensky</surname><given-names>Ludmila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-GM107023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolmakova-Partensky</surname><given-names>Ludmila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining crystal structures with single-pore analysis of Fluc-family fluoride channel mutants demonstrates that Fluc channels have two separate fluoride ion permeation pathways within the channel complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The F<sup>−</sup> ion, ubiquitous in the aqueous biosphere since the dawn of life, has been generally considered an irrelevant nonparticipant in membrane biology. This view was recently upended by the discovery of F<sup>−</sup>-specific riboswitches in many bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2012</xref>), a breakthrough that over the past few years has revealed F<sup>−</sup>-transporting membrane proteins underpinning a widespread microbial physiology of resistance to environmental F<sup>−</sup> toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li S et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). These F<sup>−</sup> exporters fall into two phylogenetically unrelated classes: energy-consuming anion transporters of the CLC superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brammer et al., 2014</xref>), and electrodiffusive, F<sup>−</sup>-specific ion channels of the Fluc family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). While CLC proteins have been studied for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Miller, 2015</xref>), Flucs represent a novel and idiosyncratic class of ion channels. Bacterial Fluc channels assemble as dimers of small subunits (120–130 residues, 4 transmembrane helices) arranged in antiparallel transmembrane topology. This dual-topology architecture, originally inferred from biochemical and electrophysiological behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stockbridge et al., 2014</xref>), was recently observed in crystal structures of two homodimeric Fluc homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. The hourglass-shaped channel is complexed with two 'monobody' crystallization chaperones, which plug each of the wide vestibules facing the two aqueous solutions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These ~10 kDa engineered monobodies are also high-affinity channel blockers whose long-lived block-times are readily observed in single-channel recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stockbridge et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18767.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluoride ions in Fluc-Ec2 channels.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) View of Ec2 channel imagined in membrane (black lines) with subunits colored cyan and yellow and F<sub>1</sub><sup>-</sup>, F<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ions indicated by grey, pink spheres, respectively.

In contrast to most ion channels, in which a single ion-permeation pore spans the membrane along a central axis, Flucs were proposed to contain two pores running along the sides of the complex, with each pore built by residues from both subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). However, this is a crystallographically 'dry' inference based on structural results alone, unaccompanied by any functional behavior that would add mechanistic vitality to support or refute this otherwise unprecedented picture. An additional crystallographic ambiguity is that the crevices housing the anion densities are too narrow to show themselves at 2.1–2.6 Å resolution as clearly delineated aqueous pores traversing the protein. For these reasons, we consider that the argument for dual-pathway construction is not yet consummated; it calls for tests based on functional properties of the pores manipulated individually. By solving crystal structures of ion-permeation mutants of a bacterial Fluc channel and analyzing the behavior of fused-dimer constructs, we now unambiguously establish the two-pore character of Fluc channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All experiments here employ the previously described 'Ec2' Fluc homologue from an <italic>E. coli</italic> virulence plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). The homodimeric channel's symmetric, dual-topology structure demands that the pores adopt antiparallel orientations and that the two chemically distinct F<sup>−</sup> ions in one pore, designated F<sub>1</sub><sup>−</sup> and F<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, are mirrored symmetrically in the other. In each pore, the two ions are coordinated by dipolar H-bond donors situated along a transmembrane 'polar track' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) that constitutes a possible ion pathway through the channel. Moreover, the F<sup>−</sup> coordination shells are completed by conserved phenylalanine residues interacting edge-on with the bound anions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), Phe80 associated with the F<sub>1</sub><sup>−</sup> pair and Phe83 with the F<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> pair. These four aromatic side chains adopt a striking side-to-face 'Phe-box' arrangement that supports an unusual aromatic-halide coordination motif proposed to be essential for F<sup>−</sup>-specific binding and permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). Edge-on aromatic-anion coordination geometry makes chemical sense in light of the electropositive hydrogens of the quadrupolar aromatic ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jackson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Philip et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Schwans et al., 2013</xref>). The two antiparallel polar tracks and their associated bound F<sup>−</sup> ions are well-separated in the crystal structure, with no plausible pathway for ions to transfer between tracks. These structural features led to the proposal, to be tested here, that the two polar tracks represent two separate pores.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phe-box residues are essential for F<sup>−</sup> binding and transport</title><p>Mutation of the conserved Phe-box residues in a Fluc homologue from <italic>B. pertussis</italic> was previously shown to severely inhibit F<sup>−</sup> transport, an effect presumed to reflect the replacement of F<sup>−</sup>-friendly binding sites in the conduction pathways with kinetic barriers to ion movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). This idea is now tested in Ec2, where we here examine occupancy of the F<sup>−</sup>-binding sites by solving crystal structures of Phe-box mutants F80I and F83I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and assessing their transport function. Substitution of each aromatic side chain by Ile specifically extinguishes the corresponding pair of F<sup>−</sup> densities, one in each pore, while leaving the other pair Phe-coordinated and unperturbed. The mutations cause only local structural disturbances such as alternate rotamers at nearby sidechains Ser84 and Ser110 (Cα rmsd 0.4 Å, 0.2 Å for F80I, F83I). Functionally, the mutations are dramatic, reducing F<sup>−</sup> flux in reconstituted liposomes to undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), a &gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold rate inhibition compared to the wildtype (WT) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). These facts imply that Phe80 and Phe83 lie along F<sup>−</sup> permeation pathways and that the functional defect in the mutants stems directly from the loss of the aromatic ring as a F<sup>−</sup>-binding partner in these pathways.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18767.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Data collection and refinement statistics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18767.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18767.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>F80I (PDB 5KBN)</th><th>F83I (PDB 5KOM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td>P4<sub>1</sub></td><td>P4<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td> cell dimensions</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>  α, β, γ (°)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>37.9–2.48 (2.58–2.48)</td><td>38.0–2.69 (2.82–2.69)</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>merge</sub></td><td>0.085 (1.42)</td><td>0.083 (1.04)</td></tr><tr><td>I/σ</td><td>20.4 (2.0)</td><td>15.9 (2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>CC<sub>1/2</sub></td><td>1.00 (0.851)</td><td>1.00 (0.819)</td></tr><tr><td>Completeness</td><td>0.999 (1.00)</td><td>0.999 (1.00)</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplicity</td><td>15.0 (15.2)</td><td>7.4 (7.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"> <bold>Refinement Statistics</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Resolution (Å)</td><td>37.9–2.48</td><td>38.0–2.69</td></tr><tr><td>No. Reflections</td><td>36356</td><td>28695</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub></td><td>0.219 / 0.239</td><td>0.217 / 0.230</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran Favored</td><td>0.972</td><td>0.982</td></tr><tr><td>Ramachandran Outliers</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>RMS deviations</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>  Bond Lengths (Å)</td><td>0.0080</td><td>0.0084</td></tr><tr><td>  Bond Angles (°)</td><td>1.19</td><td>1.28</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inactivation of individual pores</title><p>The results above point to the importance of the Phe-box side chains in F<sup>−</sup> binding and permeation, and the physical organization of their associated F<sup>−</sup> ions makes single-pore architecture implausible. But the homodimeric nature of Ec2 limits our ability to examine individual pores functionally, since any such mutation appears twice in the channel. We therefore constructed a tandem dimer by connecting two copies of the WT Ec2 sequence with a linker containing a foreign transmembrane helix to force an antiparallel arrangement of the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This construct, denoted 'WT/WT', mimics eukaryotic Fluc genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>), and it reprises an engineered homologue previously used to infer dual-topology assembly of Fluc channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). The concatemer expresses poorly (~40 μg/L culture), but well enough for purification and reconstitution in liposomes and planar lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). The concatemer is functionally indistinguishable from the homodimeric WT channel with respect to unitary current, high intrinsic open probability, brief, infrequent closings, F<sup>−</sup> selectivity, and submicromolar affinity block by monobody proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

The complete inhibition of F<sup>−</sup> flux by either Phe mutant in the homodimer suggests a simple experimental design to test whether Fluc contains two functional pores. We use a liposome-based F<sup>−</sup> efflux assay under 'Poisson-dilution' conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maduke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wu et al., 2007</xref>), where most reconstituted liposomes carry only a single Fluc concatemer. Since efflux through a single channel is much faster than the time response of the F<sup>−</sup> detection system, the assay provides a straightforward all-or-none indicator for the presence of functional channels; liposomes containing active channels release F<sup>−</sup> immediately upon initiating efflux, regardless of whether one or two pores are active, while liposomes devoid of active channels, as with the functionally disabled Phe mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>), show no F<sup>−</sup> efflux.</p><p>The flux behavior of the Phe-box mutants in the fused-domain channels meet all expectations of two-pore assembly, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates. All four single Phe mutants, each of which leaves one pore unaltered, score active in these efflux experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Since the two Phe residues from the same domain contribute to different pores, and thus each pore harbors Phe80 from one domain and Phe83 from the other, we can distinguish two classes of double mutants: <italic>trans</italic>, wherein the two mutations reside in different pores, or <italic>cis</italic>, with both mutations in the same pore.

Single-channel electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers provides such information by directly comparing F<sup>−</sup> current through WT channels and functionally active mutants. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) are unambiguous: all single Phe-box mutants show unitary conductance of 5.7 <underline>+</underline> 0.3 pS, roughly half that of WT/WT fused-domain or WT homodimeric channels (10.6 <underline>+</underline> 0.1 pS).

We additionally note that the <italic>cis</italic> double mutants also show clear single-channel conductance that is nonetheless lower (2.3 <underline>+</underline> 0.2 pS) than the single mutants, possibly due to subtle, non-local structural disturbance of the conducting pore arising from the double mutation in the inactive pore.

We consider this to be a property of the entire Fluc family, a conclusion further supported by indications of genetic drift in non-symmetric Flucs and the asymmetrical effects of mutations in yeast Fluc channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). The results also highlight the importance of the conserved Phe-box residues in crafting coordination spheres for which F<sup>−</sup> ions are willing to shed their extensive aqueous hydration shells and enter the water-depleted confines of the ion-conduction pathway.</p><p>Two unexpected features of the mutant channels invite further comment. First, WT Ec2 channels show infrequent, brief excursions to a substate of ~6 pS, approximately one-half the conductance of the open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). It is natural to envision these as full closings of a single pore in a two-pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>), a picture demanding that such partial closings be absent in the single-pore mutants. However, this idea is plainly contradicted by the kinetically similar substates of ~3 pS appearing in the single-pore mutants here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,c</xref>). Instead, the substates in both wildtype and mutant channels must reflect a rare conformation that acts simultaneously on both pores to reduce F<sup>−</sup> current in each, perhaps occurring in the wide, water-filled vestibules on the two ends of the channel complex. Second, the striking and aesthetically appealing edge-to-face arrangement of the Phe-box in the WT channel had originally suggested to us that these four sidechains mutually stabilize and orient each other so as to properly coordinate the F<sup>−</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>). However, the Phe-mutant crystal structures here, while validating F<sup>−</sup> coordination by the aromatic rings, refute the idea of a mutually stabilizing quartet, since the two Phe side chains remaining in each Ile substitution, though distant from each other, adopt identical orientations and crystallographic order as in the full Phe-box of WT (side chain rmsd 0.2 Å upon backbone alignment).</p><p>Finally, despite the well-defined locations of the F<sup>−</sup> ions and the span of the polar track residues, we acknowledge that the detailed trajectories of the two pores remain uncertain due to their very narrow bore. However, as indicated in the conjectural cartoon of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is likely that the pores originate and end in the two aqueous vestibules that give the channel a symmetrical hourglass shape. This suggestion follows from monobody interaction with Fluc channels. In crystal structures of both Fluc homologues, monobodies cap and intrude into the vestibules with long loops bearing their diversified sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>); in channel recordings here, the S9 monobody inhibits both double- and single-pore channels fully to the zero-current level, as though both pores are occluded simultaneously by the blocker. This proposal thus envisions the vestibules as common regions of low selectivity from which F<sup>−</sup> ions gain access to the separate F<sup>−</sup>-specific pathways.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18767.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposal for trajectory of F<sup>−</sup> permeation pathways.</title><p>Cartoon envisions the dual-topology homodimeric channel with F<sup>−</sup> ions (spheres) in the selective pores (dashed curves) connecting the vestibules.

Re-refinement of the previously collated WT Ec2 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>) additionally used SAD data directly for additional phase information. Real-space refinement was done in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), and Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) was used to carry out model validation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Kenton Swartz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Last and colleagues investigates the ion conduction mechanism through a novel family of fluoride selective ion channels, called Flucs. In recent years the Fluc family was characterized at the functional and structural level by the Miller lab. These proteins are dual topology dimers whose structure had raised the possibility that they contain two independent pathways for F-. However, electrophysiological recordings of single Fluc channel currents had failed to reveal any of the hallmarks of double barreled channels, such as closures to half conductance states. Actually, the location of the ion permeation pore remained somewhat elusive: four electron density peaks for F- were visible in the structure, but no continuous pore could be discerned. Therefore proof that the Fluc channels form one or two pathways was missing. In the present manuscript Last and colleagues perform a series of brilliantly designed and executed experiments to test the double barreled hypothesis. They show that 2 Phe residues in each Fluc monomer are essential for F- binding and permeation through the channel, mutation of either Phe abolishes one density peak and ion conduction. Then they use a concatameric construct where two Fluc monomers, one mutant and one WT,are tethered together. They show that in these constructs, one pore has WT properties while the other is non-conductive, showing that the Flucs are indeed double-barreled ion channels.</p><p>Overall this is an excellent manuscript and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is beautifully but densely written – it takes a bit of effort for the non-aficionado to navigate, and so it would be of benefit to include more detailed explanations in places. For example:</p><p>In the initial part of the results it is quite hard to discern that the structures of the single F to I mutants are new. The authors should emphasize this a bit more clearly and spell out the new information that they set out to obtain and why.</p><p>The channel records in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> should be labeled &quot;WT homodimer + monobody&quot; (not just &quot;WT homodimer&quot;), and then in the legend you could explicitly remind us that the channels don't substantially gate on their own and that closures are monobody-blocking events. (In the current version, it is simply stated that these are records in the presence of monobody.)</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> is hard to understand because it is presented before introduction of the F80I/F83I mutant.</p><p>Results section, subsection “Single-channel behavior of single-pore mutants it is stated that &quot;the single-pore channels all recapitulate the high open probability, brief closings, and monobody block of WT&quot;. However, you haven't actually shown us any single-channel records of these single-pore channels in the absence of monobody.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> it is not obvious what is meant by &quot;substate fraction&quot; and &quot;fractional substance conductance&quot;. Please tell us in the figure legend (not just in the text) that this means the substrate current level normalized to the full current level.</p><p>2) It is not clear to us that activity of the heteromeric concatamers in the flux assay can be taken as evidence of a two-pore assembly. While this is certainly a possible interpretation of the data, it is not the only one. Given the limited time-resolution of these fluxes, which are essentially all-or-nothing, if the mutant's effect were to reduce conductance of a common pore (or alter Po) high transport would still be expected. Similarly the inactivity of the double mutants could be explained within the context of a single-pore model.</p><p>The observation that the WT/F80I and F83I/WT concatameric channels display half the single-channel current as WT/WT is nicely consistent with the idea that one of two identical pores was eliminated. But then the F801/F83I concatamer, which in principle should also eliminate only one pore, has an even smaller conductance. Given the close proximity of the two apparent pores, this is not so surprising. But then can we really conclude that they are separate pores and not co-joined pores to start with? The authors are careful about the conclusion in their title but not in the abstract. The alternative interpretation really should be discussed, and the wording in the abstract softened. Indeed, even if there are two separate pores, if they can't be gated (&quot;shot&quot;) independently, it's not really a &quot;double-barreled&quot; architecture, so the abstract is a bit misleading. Even without concluding that Flucs are bona fide double-barreled channels, the results still contribute importantly to our understanding of these channels.</p><p>We suggest you tone down your statements in the abstract and at the beginning of the paragraph &quot;The flux behavior of the Phe-box mutants in the fused-domain channels meet all expectations of two-pore assembly[…]&quot; and then discuss alternate interpretations in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18767.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The manuscript is beautifully but densely written – it takes a bit of effort for the non-aficionado to navigate, and so it would be of benefit to include more detailed explanations in places.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge and agree with the reviewer's general point and have endeavored to expand in several places to make the reader's journey through the paper a bit easier.</p><p><italic>For example:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In the initial part of the results it is quite hard to discern that the structures of the single F to I mutants are new.

Given the close proximity of the two apparent pores, this is not so surprising. But then can we really conclude that they are separate pores and not co-joined pores to start with?</italic> </p><p>We disagree that there is insufficient evidence to conclude two-pore assembly. Taken in isolation and without knowledge of the protein's structure, the functional behavior would, as the reviewer asserts, be difficult to interpret in terms of pore-disposition. However, our experimental design for the functional assays explicitly relies upon the crystallographic results, which show the two pairs of bound F<sup>-</sup> ions, isolated along two well-separated polar tracks. The structure alone implies the two-pore construction and makes obvious predictions for the flux behavior, which are herein borne out by the functional assays. It is the combination of structural data and functional results that tells the complete story and nails down a compelling case in favor of two-pore construction.</p><p>This point may not have been highlighted as it should have been in the original text, so we have added explanations to both the results and Discussion section to try and make this crucial point more clearly.</p><p>We do actually agree with the reviewer that the pores are likely to be &quot;co-joined&quot; – in the vestibules. We were too terse in our original text and neglected to point out that we consider the pores, though separate in the depths of the protein, are probably accessed by ions from the wide vestibules, where the monobody blockers bind. We now expand the narrative to discuss this picture and the evidence for it (last paragraph of Discussion), and have added a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to make this idea explicit.</p><p><italic>The authors are careful about the conclusion in their title but not in the abstract. The alternative interpretation really should be discussed, and the wording in the abstract softened. Indeed, even if there are two separate pores, if they can't be gated (&quot;shot&quot;) independently, it's not really a &quot;double-barreled&quot; architecture, so the abstract is a bit misleading. Even without concluding that Flucs are bona fide double-barreled channels, the results still contribute importantly to our understanding of these channels.</italic> </p><p>We are reluctant to enter into a semantic tussle about the meaning of &quot;barrel.&quot; We do understand that to the reviewer &quot;double barreled&quot; carries the connotation that the pores are completely separate along their entire transmembrane trajectories from bulk solution to bulk solution, as with CLC channels. While we do not have quite the same interpretation of the metaphor, we suggest a compromise, now embodied in the revised text – replacement of some references to double barrels by less connotative phrases such as &quot;dual-pathway&quot;, but not total extirpation of the offending phrase.</p><p> <italic>We suggest you tone down your statements in the abstract and at the beginning of the paragraph &quot;The flux behavior of the Phe-box mutants in the fused-domain channels meet all expectations of two-pore assembly…&quot; and then discuss alternate interpretations in the discussion.</italic></p><p>We do not consider the statements put forward in the abstract and cited paragraph to be excessive. The cited paragraph seems quite bland to us, as it simply lists the results observed, which are indeed consistent with the 2-pore assembly previously predicted by the crystal structure. We hope that our expanded results and discussion, along with the additional <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, clarifies this issue and addresses the reviewer's valid point about co-joining the pores on the two ends of the channel. We have softened the abstract a bit, however, according to the reviewer's suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
