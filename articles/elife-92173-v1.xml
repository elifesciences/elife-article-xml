stress. Although acute activation of this pathway restores cellular homeostasis, intense or prolonged ISR activation perturbs cell function and may contribute to neurodegeneration. DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small-molecule ISR inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. DNL343 reduced CNS ISR activity and neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner in two established in vivo models – the optic nerve crush injury and an eIF2B loss of function (LOF) mutant – demonstrating neuroprotection in both and preventing motor dysfunction in the LOF mutant mouse. Treatment with DNL343 at a late stage of disease in the LOF model reversed elevation in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and prevented premature mortality. Several proteins and metabolites that are dysregulated in the LOF mouse brains were normalized by DNL343 treatment, and this response is detectable in human biofluids. Several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B LOF and chronic ISR activation, supporting their potential translational relevance. This study demonstrates that DNL343 is a brain-penetrant ISR inhibitor capable of attenuating neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies several biomarker candidates that may be used to assess treatment responses in the clinic.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017117</institution-id><institution>Denali Therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yulyaningsih</surname><given-names>Ernie</given-names></name><name><surname>Suh</surname><given-names>Jung H</given-names></name><name><surname>Fanok</surname><given-names>Melania</given-names></name><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Roni</given-names></name><name><surname>Solanoy</surname><given-names>Hilda</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Bakardjiev</surname><given-names>Anna I</given-names></name><name><surname>Becerra</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Benitez</surname><given-names>N Butch</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Chi-Lu</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Sonnet S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dowdle</surname><given-names>William E</given-names></name><name><surname>Earr</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><name><surname>Estrada</surname><given-names>Anthony A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Audrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Connie</given-names></name><name><surname>Haddick</surname><given-names>Patrick CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Henne</surname><given-names>Kirk R</given-names></name><name><surname>Larhammar</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>Amy W-S</given-names></name><name><surname>Maciuca</surname><given-names>Romeo</given-names></name><name><surname>Memarzadeh</surname><given-names>Bahram</given-names></name><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Hoang N</given-names></name><name><surname>Nugent</surname><given-names>Alicia A</given-names></name><name><surname>Osipov</surname><given-names>Maksim</given-names></name><name><surname>Ran</surname><given-names>Yingqing</given-names></name><name><surname>Rebadulla</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Roche</surname><given-names>Elysia</given-names></name><name><surname>Sandman</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewcock</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name><name><surname>Scearce-Levie</surname><given-names>Kimberly</given-names></name><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>Lesley A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Pascal E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNL343, a brain-penetrant integrated stress response inhibitor, reduces neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies biomarker candidates for assessing treatment responses in clinical settings.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a heterodecameric protein that plays an indispensable role in regulating translation of mRNA into protein. This process is initiated by the assembly of GTP-bound eIF2 and methionine-carrying initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) into a ternary complex (TC) which, along with other initiation factors, delivers Met-tRNAi to the AUG start codon. Upon recognition of the start codon, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the resulting eIF2-GDP dissociates from the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). The continual success of translation initiation is dependent on replenishment of active GTP-bound eIF2 through the exchange of GDP for GTP by eIF2B, a dedicated guanidine exchange factor for eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogorad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanson et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>eIF2B activity is dynamically modulated by the integrated stress response (ISR), an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that is activated in response to diverse cellular stresses, such as viral infection, amino acid deprivation, protein misfolding, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). ISR activation centers on the phosphorylation of eIF2B binding partner, eIF2, which led to structural changes that alter its interaction with eIF2B, turning it from a substrate into a competitive inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adomavicius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordiyenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schoof et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, the availability of eIF2-GTP and the subsequent TC become limited, leading to attenuation of global translation. This also gives rise to the paradoxical increase in translation of some stress response proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). A common feature of these proteins are upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5’ region that act as translational decoys to the main protein coding sequence (MCS). Under non-stress conditions these regulatory elements are translated instead of the MCS. However, during ISR activation, when TC and initiation cofactors are limited, translation of these uORFs are bypassed in place of the MCS due to leaky ribosomal scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wethmar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Young and Wek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Tarn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>).

DNL343 was administered in food at a concentration of 100 mg/kg chow for 4 weeks starting when the animals were 19–26 weeks of age, which corresponded to an advanced disease stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As expected, and previously established, this led to robust unbound plasma and brain exposure that is equivalent to an oral gavage dose of 10 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Within only 4 weeks of treatment, DNL343 fully restored normal body weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and reduced the elevated expression of ISR transcripts in the eIF2B HOM brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), suggesting that administration of DNL343 can not only prevent ISR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), but also reverse it in animals with advanced disease. With this short duration of DNL343 treatment, neither motor function nor plasma NfL were fully rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Given the robust effects on both ISR markers and weight gain, we evaluated the effects of longer treatment with DNL343 in this treatment paradigm starting when the animals were 24–32 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>), when independently generated eIF2B mutant mice were approaching their survival limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, 20 weeks of DNL343 treatment normalized the elevated plasma NfL level in eIF2B HOM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This dosing paradigm also reversed the increased level of plasma GFAP in eIF2B HOM mice and normalized it to wild-type control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We were unable to evaluate the impact of DNL343 on motor function by the balance beam test as animals of both genotypes were unable to complete the training after 8 weeks of treatment. This impairment appeared to be driven by distinct factors in the two genotypes: age-associated obesity in wild-type animals and severe motor impairment in the eIF2B HOM mice, irrespective of treatment. This and our earlier data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>) suggest that DNL343 could prevent but not reverse functional deterioration, which is in line with our understanding of DNL343 mechanism of action that does not include neuronal regeneration, a therapeutic effect that is likely required for functional recuperation. Nonetheless, correction in the plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration was accompanied by a robust extension of survival in the eIF2B HOM mice. As expected, in this 20-week study only 25% (N=3/12) of vehicle-treated eIF2B HOM mice survived to the end of the study.

Here, we showed that DNL343 robustly inhibited the ISR in the CNS whether activated acutely by mechanical crush injury to the optic nerve or chronically by an eIF2B LOF mutation. DNL343 also exerted a neuroprotective effect in both models by preventing either degeneration of the RGC or elevation in a plasma biomarker of neurodegeneration, NfL, and motor function deterioration. Initiating DNL343 treatment after disease onset in the eIF2B LOF model led to equally robust inhibition of the ISR and even reversed the elevated levels of plasma markers of neurodegeneration, NfL, and neuroinflammation, GFAP, and prolonged survival in the model. Our study also put forth candidate biomarkers that were identified in the mouse model and cross-validated in clinical samples from patients with VWMD to potentially enable clinical assessment of CNS ISR activation and modulation, and their downstream consequences. Together these data demonstrate the therapeutic effects of DNL343 in nonclinical in vivo settings and present clinical biomarker candidates.</p><p>DNL343 is a novel small-molecule eIF2B activator that was engineered for high CNS penetration. Consistent with this, data across multiple dosing studies in mice showed that DNL343 achieved comparable unbound exposures in the plasma and brain. DNL343 exposure also showed a favorable dose-dependent profile with no notable differences between healthy animals and disease models. In a chronic setting, DNL343 steady-state concentration was rapidly achieved and maintained, and the compound was well tolerated at above neuroprotective exposure levels in the ONC and eIF2B LOF models. In line with its preclinical pharmacokinetic data, DNL343 showed low pharmacokinetic variability and high CSF distribution in healthy volunteers and participants with ALS, supporting its progression as an investigational therapeutic for CNS indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Data from our in vivo models showed that DNL343 can inhibit the ISR in multiple mouse models. In an acute ONC model, we showed significant ISR upregulation in the retina 2 days following ONC as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>). This activation persisted but was less pronounced after 14 days suggesting that the ISR is activated most strongly as an early response to acute injury. At both timepoints, DNL343 dose-dependently normalized the ISR pathway leading to protection against RGC loss with mice treated at doses ≥3 mg/kg showing numbers of surviving RGCs that were comparable to that of uncrushed controls. The neuroprotective potential of ISR inhibition in the model was previously demonstrated using ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to our data however, treatment with ISRIB at a higher and more frequent dose of 10 mg/kg (b.i.d.) led only to a partial correction of <italic>Chac</italic>1 (an ISR marker that is assessed in both the published data and our study) and RGC survival. This points to improved potency as a potential differentiator between DNL343 and the previous generation ISR inhibitor. Another consideration could be that the greater extent of ISR activation seen in the published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>) exceeded the cellular threshold beyond which ISRIB would have no effect. To date, such a phenomenon had only been demonstrated in vitro in the context of sodium arsenite-induced stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rabouw et al., 2019</xref>); whether it also underlies the discrepancy in these in vivo studies remains to be evaluated. Other possible explanations include greater unbound DNL343 exposure in the brain owing to greater CNS penetration and/or lower protein binding, and improved cellular potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The robust ISR inhibition and neuroprotection in the acute nerve injury model led us to study the effect of DNL343 in chronic ISR-dependent neurodegeneration in an eIF2B LOF model. Our independently generated eIF2B LOF mouse exhibits features that are consistent with previously reported models, namely prominent ISR activation in the CNS that was detectable in early adulthood and persisted throughout life, accompanied by stunted body weight growth that does not appear to be driven by hypophagia and motor function impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we showed a progressive escalation in the level of a plasma neurodegeneration biomarker, NfL, that corresponded to the degree of motor function loss. DNL343 treatment, initiated before overt disease manifestation, dose-dependently normalized these phenotypes with doses ≥3 mg/kg reverting body weight gain, plasma NfL level, and motor function to wild-type-like levels. While preventative modulation of some of the endpoints shown in this study is consistent with published literature utilizing other eIF2B activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2019</xref>), our data provided further insight to DNL343 effects not previously explored. Our longitudinal data on plasma NfL levels throughout the dosing study allowed us to observe that DNL343, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, not only led to reduction but reversal of plasma NfL elevation that hinted at the potential for this molecule to reverse the consequences of chronic ISR activation. Indeed, when dosed in a therapeutic paradigm starting at ages that corresponded to end of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dooves et al., 2016</xref>), DNL343 not only suppressed ISR activation in the eIF2B LOF brain but also robustly reversed the elevated levels of plasma NfL and GFAP. Reduction in these markers were apparent after 8 weeks, but not at the earlier timepoint of 4 weeks of treatment and this timeframe appears consistent between the prophylactic and the therapeutic dosing studies, suggesting that resolution of active neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is predicated on correction of upstream consequences of CNS ISR activation. Further, 4 weeks of therapeutic dosing with DNL343 did not restore motor function. While this could not be further tested, we postulate that prolonging the treatment may not lead to further improvement as motor neurons likely were already degenerated at the time of treatment initiation. On the other hand, longer treatment with DNL343 in the clinically relevant therapeutic dosing paradigm extended the otherwise shortened lifespan of the eIF2B LOF mouse with most mice surviving past 50 weeks of age when the study was terminated. These key insights that DNL343 can robustly inhibit the ISR reverse disease biomarkers and extend lifespan in an in vivo model when treatment was administered after the onset of disease has direct clinical relevance and is a major step forward in understanding the therapeutic potential of eIF2B activators.</p><p>We conducted both targeted and unbiased analyses using brain, CSF, and plasma samples from DNL343-treated eIF2B LOF mice to discover biofluid-based biomarkers that could be harnessed to monitor CNS ISR activation and modulation, and their downstream consequences in the clinic. We found a disconnect between proteins that were altered in the eIF2B LOF mouse CSF relative to those in the brain. Multi-omics approach undertaken allowed us to cross-validate ATF4-regulated changes in expression of cellular amino acid transport and metabolism at transcriptomic, proteomics level leading to phenotypic alterations in cystathionine and alanine levels. While bulk brain transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show consistent changes in transcripts and proteins that belong to the ISR and amino acid metabolism pathways, as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2019</xref>), our CSF proteomic findings identify proteins that represent downstream disease consequences such as demyelination and neuroinflammation. These findings were replicated in two cohorts of animals at 3–4 and 5–7 months of age which correspond to stages before and when disease presentation becomes evident in the eIF2B LOF model, respectively, speaking to the robustness of the findings but also highlighting the early onset of neurodegeneration in the model that precedes functional manifestation. Chronic treatment with DNL343 corrected these genotype-associated changes in the respective samples. Targeted analyses of proteins led us to discover additional markers of the ISR and neuroinflammation that could be measured in biofluids. Increased transcript or protein level of GDF-15, GFAP, and TIMP-1 in the eIF2B LOF brain and their dose responsive modulation by DNL343 were reflected by their changes in the CSF (GDF-15 and TIMP-1) and plasma (GFAP). Of these, we showed that GDF-15, a transcriptional target of ATF4, and GFAP, a marker of neuroinflammation and reactive astrocytes, were also elevated in the CSF and plasma of patients with VWMD, a rare neurodegenerative indication that is caused by biallelic recessive mutations in <italic>EIF2B1-5</italic> and in which the ISR is a central mechanism. While astrocytes are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of VWMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Knaap et al., 2006</xref>), astrocyte dysfunction is also increasingly being recognized to contribute to the initiation and progression of diverse neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandebura et al., 2023</xref>), so GFAP is of particular interest as a CNS biomarker. NfL, a marker of axonal degeneration that is increased and correlated with disease progression in other neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uphaus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelban et al., 2022</xref>) and in the eIF2B LOF mouse model, was also significantly elevated in both the plasma and CSF from VWMD patients. Inflammatory markers, such as TIMP-1 and MCP-1, that we identified in the mouse model based on changes relative to wild-type control and dose responsiveness to DNL343 were unchanged in samples from patients with VWMD, highlighting contrasts that may be driven by species-specific differences. Nonetheless, the eIF2B LOF mouse serves as an important tool that models the biological consequences of chronic ISR activation in the CNS and from which biomarkers identified have broad applicability in other neurodegenerative indications. To this point, our DNL343 studies in two in vivo models allowed us to observe commonality in ISR transcript markers despite the distinct modes of activation and CNS tissues (acute activation in the retina after ONC and chronic activation in the eIF2B HOM brain). To our knowledge, our study is the first to perform multi-omics characterization of the CNS-adjacent and clinically accessible CSF in an ISR-dependent model of neurodegeneration. The biofluid-based candidate biomarkers we cross-identified in patients with VWMD – GDF-15, GFAP, and NfL – could serve as potential biomarkers to monitor the extent and consequences of ISR activation and therapeutic modulation in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>CSF and plasma from VWMD patients and healthy controls: CSF and plasma from VWMD patients were obtained under a material transfer agreement with Baylor Scott &amp; White Research Institute (Dallas, TX, USA).

If an animal paused on the beam, or tried to turn and advance the wrong way, it was gently touched on the hindquarters and encouraged to keep moving toward the escape box. Animals were habituated to the experimental room for at least 1 hr prior to testing. To begin an experiment, each subject was placed on the starting end of the beam and allowed a cutoff time of 30 s to cross. The elapsed time was only recorded while the subject actively moved toward the finish line. If a fall occurred, the subject was restarted at the beginning of the beam. Each subject was given three attempts to complete the balance beam. If a subject failed all three attempts, it was assigned a time of 30 s and a value of three falls.

For mouse CSF, samples were processed via an in-solution digest. Briefly, 4 µl CSF per sample was reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAM). 100 mM HEPES pH 8.5 was added and the samples were digested overnight with Tryp/LysC. The digestion was quenched with 10% TFA, desalted using C18 PhyTips (PhyNexus) and dried by SpeedVac and reconstituted in 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.5. Samples were assigned respective TMT channels in one of four 8-plexes with the final channel being a pool of all the samples to normalize between TMT plexes. Samples were labeled with respective 8-plex TMT channels at RT for 1 hr. Approximately 1% of sample from each channel were mixed, dried down, stage-tipped, and injected into the mass spec for label check then the reaction was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, mixed in equal amounts, dried down, and cleaned up using C18 PhyTips (PhyNexus). For mouse CSF, due to the low sample amount no fractionation was performed prior to injection on the MS.</p><p>Tissue samples were lysed in 5% SDS in triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.1 and assayed for concentrations. 6 µg of each sample was processed using the STrap MS sample prep device according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Protifi). More specifically, samples were reduced with DTT and alkylated with IAM; the IAM reaction was then quenched with DTT; the resulting samples were digested in the STrap device with Trypsin/Lys-C overnight. Digested samples were eluted from the STrap according to the manufacturer’s protocol. An aliquot of 1 µg was taken from each eluted sample; and the aliquots were pooled to form a composite for TMT bridging. Four aliquots of 5 µg were taken out as four TMT bridges, with each bridge being used for each TMT batch. All samples were dried by SpeedVac. The samples were reconstituted with 50 mM TEAB pH 8.5 and incubated with their assigned TMT channels for 1 hr at RT. For each of the four TMT batches: the same amount of each TMT-labeled sample was aliquoted; and the aliquots were pooled and mixed with 1% formic acid. The four resulting mixtures were loaded onto the nano LC-MS/MS system for Label Check. After the Label Check was passed, all samples were dried by SpeedVac and reconstituted with 2% formic acid. The reconstituted samples of each batch were combined. The resulting three mixtures were further desalted using EVOLUTE EXPRESS ABN according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biotage). The eluted samples were dried by SpeedVac, reconstituted with high-pH reversed-phase buffer A, and loaded onto the offline HPLC for fractionation. Either 8 or 12 fractions were obtained from each sample batch.</p><p>All samples were reconstituted with mobile phase A and loaded onto the nano LC-MS/MS system.

They first assessed the pharmacokinetics of DNL343, demonstrating its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit good bioavailability. In an acute ISR model induced by optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, DNL343 treatment reduced ISR-induced transcriptional changes and neuronal loss, demonstrating neuroprotective effects. Next, the authors generated an eIF2B loss-of-function mice model by knocking in disease-causing Eif2b5 variants. The model presents a chronic ISR and mimics vanishing white matter disease (VWMD). DNL343 treatment from the pre-symptomatic stage improved body weight and motor functions, corrected transcriptional changes, and reversed proteomic and metabolomic alterations in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. DNL343 treatment initiated at an advanced disease stage also showed positive effects, restoring body weight gain, suppressing ISR, reducing neurodegeneration biomarkers, and extending lifespan. These findings highlight DNL343 as an effective ISR inhibitor with potential applications in treating VWMD and other neurodegenerative disorders involving ISR.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study's findings regarding the novel compound DNL343 offer significant promise in addressing VWMD, a condition currently lacking disease-modifying treatment. DNL343 directly targets eIF2B, the disease-causing complex in VWMD, and demonstrates notable efficacy in reversing the integrated stress response (ISR) and mitigating neurodegeneration in a VWMD mouse model. These results raise hope for the potential application of DNL343 in VWMD treatment, a development eagerly anticipated by patients and the VWMD research community. Moreover, the study hints at the broader potential of DNL343 in treating other ISR-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as ALS, a prospect that holds broader interest. Additionally, the study's identification of potential biomarkers for VWMD represents a notable strength, potentially leading to improved disease progression assessment pending further confirmation in future research.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Direct biochemical evidence confirming DNL343's activity in eIF2B activation and its toxicity profile have been previously documented in a separate study. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed introduction to this information, establishing a robust knowledge foundation for the in vivo study described in this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92173.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed DNL343, a CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor, to treat neurodegenerative diseases caused by ISR.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. The therapeutic efficacy of DNL343 has been extensively characterized in two animal models. Importantly, plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can be reversed with DNL343 treatment. Remarkably, several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) upon DNL343 treatment. Overall, this study is very exciting that targets ISR for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My main questions center around the characterization of DNL343.</p><p>(1) Is there any biochemical evidence showing DNL343 activates eIF2B, such as binding and in vitro biochemical activity assays?

What are the off-targets of DNL343, particularly when DNL343 is administered at a high dose? Thermal-proteasome profiling or photoaffinity labeling experiments could be considered.</p><p>(3) What are the total drug concentrations in the brain and plasma? What are the unbound ratios?</p><p>(4) If DNL343 is given intravenously, what are the concentrations in the brain and plasma after 5 minutes and 1 h or longer time points?

However, all previously identified ways to target ISR have problems. PERK inhibitors suppress ISR by inhibiting eIF2alpha phosphorylation and cause pancreatic toxicity in mice. In order to bypass eIF2alpha, previous studies have identified ISR suppressors that target eIF2B, such as ISRIB and 2BAct. These molecules suppress neurodegeneration but do not cause detrimental effects in mouse models. However, ISRIB is water-insoluble, and 2BAct causes cardiovascular complications in dogs, preventing their use in clinics. Here, the authors showed that DNL343, a new ISR inhibitor targeting eIF2B, suppresses features that can be related to neurodegeneration in mouse models. Combined with their previous results of a clinical phase I trial showing the safety of DNL343, these findings suggest the promise of DNL343 as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases in which ISR contributes to pathogenesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The finding is important and has disease implications.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>The authors did not provide evidence that DNL343 suppresses the demise of nervous systems in their VWMD model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors evaluated a novel eIF2B activator, DNL343, in two mouse models representing different forms of the integrated stress response (ISR). They first assessed the pharmacokinetics of DNL343, demonstrating its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit good bioavailability. In an acute ISR model induced by optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, DNL343 treatment reduced ISR-induced transcriptional changes and neuronal loss, demonstrating neuroprotective effects. Next, the authors generated an eIF2B loss-of-function mice model by knocking in disease-causing Eif2b5 variants. The model presents a chronic ISR and mimics vanishing white matter disease (VWMD). DNL343 treatment from the pre-symptomatic stage improved body weight and motor functions corrected transcriptional changes, and reversed proteomic and metabolomic alterations in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. DNL343 treatment initiated at an advanced disease stage also showed positive effects, restoring body weight gain, suppressing ISR, reducing neurodegeneration biomarkers, and extending lifespan. These findings highlight DNL343 as an effective ISR inhibitor with potential applications in treating VWMD and other neurodegenerative disorders involving ISR.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study's findings regarding the novel compound DNL343 offer significant promise in addressing VWMD, a condition currently lacking disease-modifying treatment. DNL343 directly targets eIF2B, the disease-causing complex in VWMD, and demonstrates notable efficacy in reversing the integrated stress response (ISR) and mitigating neurodegeneration in a VWMD mouse model. These results raise hope for the potential application of DNL343 in VWMD treatment, a development eagerly anticipated by patients and the VWMD research community. Moreover, the study hints at the broader potential of DNL343 in treating other ISR-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a prospect that holds broader interest. Additionally, the study's identification of potential biomarkers for VWMD represents a notable strength, potentially leading to improved disease progression assessment pending further confirmation in future research.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are a couple of notable concerns in this study. Firstly, while the in vivo evidence strongly supports the efficacy of DNL343 in mitigating ISR and neurodegeneration, there is a lack of direct biochemical evidence to confirm its activity in eIF2B activation. Secondly, the potential for cardiovascular toxicity, which has been reported for a related eIF2B activator in a canine model (as mentioned in the manuscript), has not been evaluated for DNL343 in this study. This data gap regarding toxicity could be crucial for informing the future development of DNL343 for potential human use. Further investigation into these areas would be valuable for a comprehensive understanding of the compound's mechanisms and safety profile.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful feedback and an opportunity to provide further clarification. To address the first question regarding biochemical evidence of the mechanism of action of DNL343, we agree that additional data is helpful to interpreting the results presented in this manuscript. We now include a citation to Craig et al (Craig, R.A., 2nd, J. De Vicente, A.A. Estrada, J.A. Feng, K.W. Lexa, M.J. Canet, W.E. Dowdle, R.I. Erickson, B.N. Flores, P.C.G. Haddick, L.A. Kane, J.W.

We have also completed a Phase 1 (NCT04268784) and Phase 1B double-blind (NCT05006352) trials in healthy and ALS participants, respectively and these trials are referenced on page 4, lines 102-103. The safety profile observed in these clinical studies supported further development of DNL343 for ALS in the Healey Platform trial (NCT04297683, Regimen G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed DNL343, a CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor, to treat neurodegenerative diseases caused by ISR.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small molecule integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. The therapeutic efficacy of DNL343 has been extensively characterized in two animal models. Importantly, plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration can be reversed with DNL343 treatment. Remarkably, several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD) upon DNL343 treatment. Overall, this is a very exciting study to target ISR for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My main questions center around the characterization of DNL343.</p><p>(1) Is there any biochemical evidence showing DNL343 activates eIF2B, such as binding assays or in vitro biochemical activity assays? A conference presentation was cited - &quot;Osipov, M. (2022). Discovery of DNL343: a Potent Selective and Brain-penetrant eIF2B Activator Designed for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases. Medicinal Chemistry Gordon Research Conference. New London, NH.&quot; However, there needs to be public information about this presentation.</p></disp-quote><p>Information from this presentation and more details on the discovery and characterization of DNL343 can be found in Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024) and this citation has been replaced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How was the selectivity of DNL343 demonstrated? What are the off-targets of DNL343, in particular when DNL343 is administered at a high dose? Thermal-proteasome profiling or photoaffinity labeling experiments could be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024) for full details. In brief, there were no significant off target effects observed for DNL343 in a Cerep panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) What are the total drug concentrations in the brain and plasma? What are the unbound ratios?</p></disp-quote><p>Following a single oral dose of DNL343 in mice, unbound brain-to-unbound plasma exposures ratios (Kp,uu) of 0.8 to 1.1 were observed, indicating high CNS penetrance. This was further supported by CSF-to-unbound plasma exposures ratios at 0.9 in the same mouse study. The CNS penetrance was also confirmed in rats and NHP by CSF-to-unbound plasma ratios near unity as reported in Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) If DNL343 is given intravenously, what are the concentrations in the brain and plasma after 5 minutes and 1 hour or longer time points? In other words, does DNL343 cross BBB through passive diffusion or an active process?</p></disp-quote><p>Unbound brain-to-unbound plasma exposure ratios following a single oral dose in the mouse were 0.8 to 1.1 and showed no time dependence. These measurements were made prior to, near, and following plasma tmax of DNL343, indicating unbound DNL343 crosses the BBB through passive diffusion and rapidly reached equilibrium between the brain and systemic circulation. Details can be found in Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) What is the complete PK profile of DNL343 for intravenous and oral dosing?</p></disp-quote><p>DNL343 administered orally to mice as a suspension formulation showed plasma PK consistent with prolonged absorption with tmax ranging from 3 to 4 h, and a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of ~10 h. Details can be found in Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Are there any major drug metabolites that could be of concern?</p></disp-quote><p>DNL343 metabolism is through Phase 1 biotransformation pathways. None of the in vivo circulating metabolites show potency towards eIF2B activation. Given that none of these metabolites are of concern, we believe this information is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>ISR contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, FTD, VWMD, etc. Targeting ISR is a promising avenue for potential therapeutics. However, previously identified ways to target ISR present some challenges. PERK inhibitors suppress ISR by inhibiting eIF2alpha phosphorylation and cause pancreatic toxicity in mice. In order to bypass eIF2alpha, previous studies have identified ISR suppressors that target eIF2B, such as ISRIB and 2BAct. These molecules suppress neurodegeneration but do not cause detrimental effects in mouse models. However, ISRIB is water-insoluble, and 2BAct causes cardiovascular complications in dogs, preventing their use in clinics. Here, the authors showed that DNL343, a new ISR inhibitor targeting eIF2B, suppresses neurodegeneration in mouse models. Combined with their previous results of a clinical phase I trial showing the safety of DNL343, these findings suggest the promise of DNL343 as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases in which ISR contributes to pathogenesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The finding is important and has disease implications, and the conclusion is not surprising.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experimental design and data are hard to comprehend for an audience with a basic research background. This reviewer suggests that the authors use the same way that previous studies on ISRIB and 2BAct (e.g., Wong et al; eLife, 2019) designed experiments and interpret data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for their feedback and recognition that DNL343 has a promising potential as treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. While our studies share some similarities to Wong et al., <italic>eLife</italic> (2019) and Abbink et al., <italic>ACTN</italic> (2019), our study design is intentionally distinct (e.g. inclusion of both prevention and treatment dosing paradigms, determining dose-response impact of drug treatment across biomarkers) which necessitates tailored data visualization to effectively communicate our findings. However, we understand the importance of clarity for a broader audience and to this end, we have made a number of changes to the data figures, in particular data from omics experiments in Figures 3 and 5. We also provided additional supplemental tables to aid data interpretation. This would hopefully cater to both audiences familiar with previous work and those with a less specialized background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Demyelination is a significant pathological feature in the VWMD mouse model. The authors should clarify whether they observed similar demyelination in their study and if DNL343 had any impact on reversing this demyelination. These findings are crucial for assessing the compound's effectiveness in mitigating neurodegeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>Demyelination is indeed an important feature in the eIF2B LOF (VWMD) mouse model. Given that this phenotype and the ability to rescue the histological phenotype with this MOA (Wong et al; eLife, 2019, cited in introduction) is very well characterized, along with our limitation from the size and number of mouse tissues, we prioritized non-histological targeted and unbiased analyses that were aimed at identifying translatable biomarkers. Nonetheless, the totality of our data, in different mouse models and cell types, strongly supports DNL343 as a potent ISR inhibitor that is effective in attenuating neurodegeneration:</p><p>· In the optic nerve crush model, DNL343 dose-dependently reduced retinal cell degeneration</p><p>· In the VWMD mouse model, DNL343 attenuated the increase in a plasma biomarker of neurodegeneration, neurofilament-light, which corresponded to normalization in motor function.</p><p>· Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses in the VWMD mouse model brain showed increases in oxysterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol, and cholesterol esters and these lipids are associated with demyelination (Nugent et al, 2020). DNL343 treatment attenuated the levels of these oxysterols, indicating decreased demyelination.</p><p>· When initiated at an advance disease stage, reversal of plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration (Nf-L) and neuroinflammation (GFAP) by DNL343 in this model was accompanied by extension in the lifespan that is otherwise shortened as the mutant animals succumb to disease.</p><p>These data highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of DNL343 in the broader context of ISR-mediated neurodegeneration which can include but may not be limited to VWMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 6 presents several biomarkers with significantly increased levels in VWMD mice and patient biofluids. However, these biomarkers are not reflected in the brain proteomics data presented in Figure 3. The discrepancy between these findings should be addressed and discussed in the manuscript to provide a more comprehensive understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>Proteins detected in Figure 6 were not detected by TMT proteomics in the CSF. In the brain, only GFAP was detected and the overall abundance in tissue were similar in both genetic groups. Cytokines such as TIMP1, MCP1 are usually present in low abundances and therefore are challenging to detect in broad discovery proteomics method applied in this study. Antibody-based immunoassays are better suited to specifically measure low abundant proteins than mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, while mass-spectrometry based methods offer wider dynamic range to detect more highly abundant proteins. Differences in detection sensitivity between immunoassay vs mass spectrometry assays has been previously noted (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00641">Petrera et al, J Proteome Res, 2021</ext-link>). We have added new text to address this point in the revised manuscript (page 7, line 274-277).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 7 discusses the effects of DNL343 treatment initiated at an advanced disease stage. Since the 4-week treatment did not rescue performance in the balance beam test (as shown in Figure 6A), it is important to clarify if a 20-week treatment had any impact on this parameter.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer raised an important question that we were unfortunately unable test. When the balance beam training was administered after 8 (out of 20) weeks of dosing, most animals of both wildtype and mutant genotypes struggled to remain on or maintain balance on the beam and were unable to progress traversing the beam, making the assay unsuccessful in this cohort. This impairment appeared to be driven by distinct factors in the two genotypes: age-associated obesity in wild-type animals and severe motor impairment in the eIF2B HOM mice, irrespective of treatment. While it is possible that other less demanding and more sensitive assays could reveal more nuanced differences, this, and our earlier data (Figure 4G-I), suggest that DNL343 could prevent but not reverse functional deterioration. This is in line with our understanding of DNL343 mechanism of action that does not include neuronal regeneration, a therapeutic effect that is likely required for functional recuperation. We have added this point to the manuscript (page 8, line 319-326).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, considering the significant increase in Gdf15 levels in the disease model, it would be valuable to know if DNL343 treatment affected Gdf15 levels. If these assays were conducted, reporting the data would greatly assist in evaluating the compound's efficacy when administered at an advanced disease stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not able to measure GDF15 levels in the 20-week study due to limitation in the in-life collected plasma samples which was dedicated to assessing biomarkers of neurodegeneration (Figure 7E-F). However, data from our 4-week treatment study, which was initiated at a similar age range to the 20-week treatment study (19-26 and 24-33 weeks of age, respectively), showed that DNL343 was able to reduce GDF15 levels in the brain (mRNA and protein) and CSF (protein) (Supplemental Figure 5A-C), suggesting that DNL343 reduces ISR activation at an advanced disease stage in the model. We expect that this reduction observed at 4 weeks of treatment would persist for the duration of the extended treatment in the 20-week cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A minor point. In Figures 5A, 5C, and 5E, it appears that the red-colored group should likely be labeled as &quot;HOM 0 mg/kg&quot; instead of &quot;HOM 3 mg/kg&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been amended, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) The cellular function of DNL343 needs to be clarified. The authors claim that it activates eIF2B, but no cellular or molecular evidence is provided. Does it bind to eIF2B? Does it not affect eIF2alpha phosphorylation? Does it restore translation upon stress that causes eIF2alpha phosphorylation? Does it suppress stress granule assembly? The authors cited Sun, Tsai et al. 2023 and Osipov et al., 2022. However, these citations are conference abstracts with no published figures available for review.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional data outlining the biochemical evidence of the mechanism of action of DNL343 was needed. We now include a citation to Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024) that includes the full details on the discovery and molecular characterization of DNL343.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It needs to be clarified how the authors selected the ISR marker genes. ISR genes are more than those selected. How about others? How did the authors measure the mRNA levels, bulk RNA-seq or RT-PCR? If the former, have the authors verified their results using RT-PCR? Have the authors measured the protein levels for nerve crush experiments (by both proteomic and individual protein analyses)? Also, no statistical analyses were found for the heat maps.</p></disp-quote><p>The ISR marker genes were selected by a combination of experimental and literature data. Transcriptomics analysis of the eIF2B HOM brains was conducted using untargeted RNAseq (Supplemental Figure 1B). Here, we found an enrichment of transcripts previously reported to be ISR dependent, namely <italic>Atf4</italic>, <italic>Chac1</italic>, <italic>Ddit3</italic>, <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> (Larhammar et al., 2017), <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Asns</italic>, <italic>Mthfd2</italic>, <italic>Psat1</italic>, <italic>Sesn2</italic>, <italic>Slc1a5</italic>, <italic>Slc7a5</italic>, <italic>Slc7a11</italic>, <italic>Trib3</italic> (Wong et al., 2019, Abbink et al., 2019). These transcripts were assayed using targeted qPCR in the eIF2B HOM brains, spleen and PBMC (Supplemental Figure 1A, C, D) and in the retinas from the ONC experiments (Figure 2C). We have further clarified the analysis method for the gene expression data in the figure legends.</p><p>We did not interrogate the proteome of the retina in the ONC model. Our study in this model was intended as a proof-of-concept evaluation of DNL343 effects in this acute ISR-dependent model of neurodegeneration. To this end, we performed gene expression (Figure 2C) and immunofluorescence analyses (Figure 2D-F). Each of these analyses were conducted using dedicated whole retinas; conducting additional protein analyses would necessitate a separate cohort of animals.</p><p>We believe that heatmaps provide the best visualization of the data, particularly the dose dependent effects of DNL343 on multiple genes, but we understand the value for also providing statistical analyses. To address this, we provide additional Supplemental tables to show the outcome of statistical analyses undertaken. Statistical data relating to Figure 2C can be found on new Supplemental Tables 1 &amp; 2; those relating to Supplemental Figures 1A, C, and D on new Supplemental Tables 3, 5, 6, respectively; that from Figure 4D on new Supplemental Table 8, and that from Figure 7D on new Supplemental Table 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Both the authors and Wong et al. (eLife, 2019) performed transcriptomic analyses on HOM mice. How do the authors compare the two data sets? Are they the same?</p></disp-quote><p>In this work, transcriptomic approach was applied to confirm induction of ISR response in our in vivo model. While data are not identical, all of the top annotated genes shown in supplementary figure 1B were also deemed to be significant by Wong and coworkers (Bayes factor &gt; 10). More importantly, as explained in our responses to question #2 from reviewer 3, ISR genes highlighted in supplementary Figure 1B were also confirmed in two other studies (Larhammar et al., 2017, Abbink et al., 2019). These data support our interpretation that eIF2B HOM have elevated ISR relative to WT mice. We have added new text to line 164 on page 5 to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Can the authors interpret their omic data using volcano plots for HOM rescue experiments, as Wong et al. did in eLife 2019? Heat maps with statistical analyses are more straightforward to comprehend. Can the authors verify some of these data using RT-PCR, Western blot, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional pathway interpretation in our Figure 3 and 5 to highlight key biological processes altered in the brain and cellular compartment origin of CSF proteins changed in eIF2B HOM at baseline and following treatment with DNL343. Our treatment designed employed multiple dosing levels and as such, summarization by volcano plot would have resulted in creation of many figures that can be more easily captured by a single heat map plot. However, to provide additional quantitative information, we now added supplementary tables showing full statistical analysis for all heat maps for added clarity and transparency.</p><p>We demonstrated 100% correlation between the select genes we examined by qPCR in supplemental Figure 1A and those identified from brain by RNA-seq. In addition, question of reliability of RNA-seq data has been previously been examined in great detail (Everaet et al, <italic>Sci Rep</italic> 2017) and found ~85% concordance between RNA-seq and qPCR data and those that were discordant tended to have &lt; 2 log2FC and were present in low abundance. Given that top core ISR genes identified in our study have &gt;2 log2FC and have been verified by other independent labs (Larhammar et al., 2017, Abbink et al., 2019, Wong et al., 2019). Based on these, we do not think that there is a rationale need for technical confirmation of RNAseq data.</p><p>Risks for mis-annotation of proteins in TMT data were further mitigated by removing protein with coverage &lt; 20% and having less than 8 unique peptides detected and setting protein annotation FDR to &lt;1%.</p><p>Additionally, TMT-labelling based proteomics offers wider dynamic range and sensitivity than western blotting. Validation of TMT logFC data with western blot technique, which is less quantitative and has lower dynamic ranges of detection may not be very informative. Furthermore, similar trends of changes in key ISR genes and proteins shown in figures 4D and 5A (e.g PSAT, SLC7A11, SLC7A5) provides additional support for the authenticity of proteins identified in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, for Figures 4E and F, it is assumed that each line represents an individual animal, but why their body weight gains are so different for the wild type? Can the authors plot the mean and s.e.m.? Also, there are no data about neurodegeneration. The authors need to show microscopy images, count the numbers, and assess the morphology of nerve cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The large data spread in the body weight gain in our wild-type mice reflect the normal variability of this endpoint which can be influenced by sex and age. Indeed, both factors are present in our cohorts as animals of both sexes were included and there was a 7-week age-range (10-17 weeks of age at dosing start). Each line in Figures 4E-F indeed represents data sampled from individual animal over time. We chose to represent the data this way for transparency and have provided additional visualization (new Supplemental Figure 3) showing both body weight gain and plasma Nf-L levels as mean ± SEM as requested by this reviewer.</p><p>In this study we chose to use a clinically-relevant biomarker of neurodegeneration, plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) (Figure 4F). This allowed us to prioritize the tissue samples from these studies to execute comprehensive unbiased analyses for more complete characterization of the phenotype of these eIF2B LoF mice. NfL is a biomarker that has been recognized as a sensitive measurement of neuronal/axonal damage regardless of cause (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/90/8/870.long">Gaetani et al., 2018</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-018-0058-z">Khalil et al., 2018</ext-link>). Elevated levels of plasma (and CSF) NfL levels has been demonstrated across neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293849/">Giacomucci et al., 2022</ext-link>), multiple sclerosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8055958/">Ferreira-Atuesta et al., 2021</ext-link>), and in ALS (Huang et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) How ISR is connected to metabolomic changes? Can the authors explain it?</p></disp-quote><p>ISR caused significant increases in amino acid transporter and serine/glycine/1-carbon metabolism enzymes transcript and protein abundances that were highlighted in Figure 3A and C and lines 237-255 in the main text. Similar patterns were also observed in prior published studies (Larhammar et al., 2017, Abbink et al., 2019, Wong et al., 2019). Consistent with these changes we observed increased levels of Alanine (transported by SLC3A2, SLC7A11, SLC7A3) and decreased cystathionine levels (associated with increased expression of CTH). ATF4 is one of the main orchestrator of ISR response to stress (e.g., amino acid deprivation) and it is required for expression of amino acid transporters and enzymes required for synthesis non-essential amino acids (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28494858">28494858</ext-link>). ATF4 increases cellular amino acid uptake and deliver AA needed for synthesis of proteins and glutathione needed for survival.</p><p>We also observed prominent changes in CE in eIF2B HOM and its normalization with DNL343 treatment shown in Figure 5C. We checked for changes in expression levels of CEL, CES1, LCAT, LIPA, SOAT1, and NCEH1 proteins involved in CE metabolism and failed to detect any changes in protein or RNA abundances. This suggests that a rapid demyelination is a more likely trigger for CE accumulation as reported in FTD-GRN (Marian OC et al., 2023 <italic>acta neuropathol commun</italic> <bold>11</bold>, 52), and in experimental demyelination models (Nugent AA et al., 2020 Neuron). We have added new text to the discussion section of the manuscript page 9, lines 408-411 to discuss how these results relate to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is hard to understand the biomarker part. The authors said &quot;potential translational biomarkers are elevated...&quot; Do the authors mean they are elevated so they can be potential biomarkers? If their levels are unchanged (e.g., TIMP-1), how can they be biomarkers? Also, this part needs a conclusion/summary. Also, what does &quot;reversed biomarkers...&quot; mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to clarify and included a concluding sentence for this section of the results (page 7, lines 297-299). In assessing whether a given protein could be a potential translational biomarker for human disease we evaluated if the following two conditions were met: (1) Increased or decreased gene expression or protein levels of the biomarker in the brain or biofluids (CSF or plasma) of <italic>Eif2b5 R191H</italic> homozygote mice relative to wild-type controls that is modulated or normalized by administration of DNL343 and (2) protein levels in biofluids from VWMD patients that show differential levels than healthy controls in the same directionality as what is seen in the mouse model. GDF-15, GFAP, and NfL meet these criteria, but TIMP-1 and MCP-1 do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>(1) Please explain which multiple comparison tests the authors used.</p></disp-quote><p>This information has been further clarified in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Administrating the drug at an advanced stage led to a trend of NfL reduction but did not rescue function. Can the authors discuss what this means?</p></disp-quote><p>Further elaboration and discussion about this finding have been added to the results section on page 8, line 319-325.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For statistical analyses on the bar graphs, it would be better if the authors labeled the comparison pairs on the graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that labelling comparisons in bar graphs could aid the readership and have added this modification. Additionally, comparisons are indicated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors need to state clearly that 2BAct's cardiovascular toxicity was observed in dogs, not mice. The current study does not exclude similar DNL343 toxicity. However, previous clinical trials suggest that DNL343 may be safe for humans.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion to specify cardiovascular toxicity in dogs has been added (page 3, line 101), thank you. We now include a citation to Craig et al <italic>J Med Chem</italic> (2024) that provides evidence in a non-human primate (cynomolgus monkey) model that DNL343 dosing did not result in QT prolongation or any functional cardiac changes. We have also completed a Phase 1 (NCT04268784) and Phase 1B double-blind (NCT05006352) trials in healthy and ALS participants, respectively and now include reference to these trials on page 4, lines 102-104. The safety profile observed in these clinical studies supported further development of DNL343 for ALS in the Healey Platform trial (NCT04297683, Regimen G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
