Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice (<italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus</italic>) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the POA for males and females of both <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior based on known functions of these cell types. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in <italic>P. polionotus</italic>, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our POA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals display an astounding variety of behaviors that they perform instinctively without needing prior experience. But how does the brain evolve to give rise to these behaviors? Two closely-related species of deer mice found in the United States display very different instinctive behaviors for mating and parental care. The individuals of one species mate with lots of different partners (referred to as promiscuous) and only the females care for the offspring. On the other hand, mice of the other species only have one mate at a time (monogamous) and share the parental care.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that a region of the brain called the preoptic area of the hypothalamus regulates mating, parental care and other instinctive behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether there are any differences in the brain cells of the monogamous and promiscuous deer mice that may account for the differences in their behavior. Chen et al. used an approach called single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to compare the cells in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus in these two species.</p><p>The experiments identified four types of cells that are present at different levels in the two species. For example, the monogamous deer mice had more cells that express a protein known as galanin, which is known to have a role in regulating parenting behavior in mice, frogs and fish. Furthermore, the cells of the monogamous deer mice, also had fewer “sex-biased” genes, that is, genes that are expressed at different levels in males and females, compared to the promiscuous species.</p><p>In both species, two types of cells that are able to sense sex hormones including estrogen and androgen were more abundant in males than females. These cells express many genes that are sex-biased indicating they may play roles in regulating male- or female-specific behaviors.</p><p>This work provides a large set of data for further investigations into how genes control behavior and evolve in deer mice and other animals. In the future, this may enable researchers to identify specific genes governing instinctive social behaviors, which may in turn lead to new diagnostic tools and treatments for neurodevelopmental diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Peromyscus</italic></kwd><kwd>preoptic area</kwd><kwd>single-nucleus RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Peromyscus polionotus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM146243-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018077</institution-id><institution>Harvard Data Science Initiative, Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Phoebe R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirby</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Hopi E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of the hypothalamic preoptic area of monogamous and promiscuous deer mouse species reveals neuronal differences that may be responsible for innate changes in mating and parental care behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large, heritable differences in complex behavior are observed even across closely-related species and across sexes within the same species. What are the molecular substrates, encoded by genes, that facilitate this variation in innate animal behavior? Two molecular traits known to govern behavior are: (1) abundances of specific neuronal cell types, which may be controlled by developmental genes involved in neurogenesis and apoptotic pathways, and (2) abundances of proteins within neuronal cells, which may be controlled by genes involved in transcriptional and translational regulation.</p><p>Variations in both types of traits have been documented to change behavior across species and sex. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of song-patterning neurons underlies a species-specific loss of a type of courtship song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ye et al., 2024</xref>) while the expansion of an olfactory neuronal population contributes to <italic>D. sechellia</italic>’s species-specific specialization for feeding on the noni fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auer et al., 2020</xref>). In mammals, neuronal number differences mediating behavioral traits have largely been described across sexes rather than species. Neuronal population sizes, particularly of cell types within the preoptic area and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, are thought to be regulated by sex-specific levels of neuroestrogens that control apoptosis, thereby leading to sex-biased cell abundances and sex-specific control of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amateau and McCarthy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsukahara and Morishita, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Across species, gene expression level differences of neuronally-important proteins such as neurotransmitter receptors, smell and taste receptors, and protein kinases are also known to cause behavioral differences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bendesky and Bargmann, 2011</xref> for review). For example, the expression level of the vasopressin 1 a receptor gene in the ventral pallidum contributes to the evolution of partner preference formation in monogamous voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 1999</xref>). Across sexes, differential expression of sex-steroid receptors in the mammalian brain is well-known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gegenhuber and Tollkuhn, 2020</xref>), and the resulting consequences for sex-specific gene expression and control of sex-specific behavior is an area of heavy investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knoedler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gegenhuber et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karigo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Advances in single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing have enabled high-throughput characterization of both cell type abundance evolution and cell type-specific expression evolution, and recent single-cell profiling of the brain of behaviorally-divergent species have revealed intriguing insights about both modes of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tosches et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shafer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>). However, the majority of comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing in mammals has been performed across fairly diverged species with many phenotypic differences, such as human and mouse ~90 million years diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>) or across primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Welch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khrameeva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakken et al., 2021b</xref>) such as humans and marmosets (~40 million years diverged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>]), lending limited insight into which of the specific behavioral difference may be affected by which of the many observed molecular changes.</p><p>Closely-related species of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> deer mice that exhibit variation in heritable behaviors give us an opportunity to more precisely dissect the molecular neuronal mechanisms that can alter innate mammalian behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedford and Hoekstra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dewey and Dawson, 2001</xref>). In particular, <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus</italic> diverged only ~2 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schenk et al., 2013</xref>), but lie on opposite ends of the monogamy-promiscuity spectrum and exhibit large, heritable differences in their parental care behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foltz, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). Both males and females of the monogamous <italic>P. polionotus</italic> are more parental than the promiscuous <italic>P. maniculatus (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foltz, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). Further, this difference is much more distinct across males: while promiscuous <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> fathers exhibit little to no parental care in laboratory assays, monogamous <italic>P. polionotus</italic> fathers provide care to nearly the same level as <italic>P. polionotu</italic>s mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foltz, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). These differences provide an opportunity to identify the molecular products that evolve to modulate social behavior, and how they do so in a sexually dimorphic manner.</p><p>Evolution of the hypothalamus has been implicated in social behavior differences across many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie and Dorsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alié et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanda, 2019</xref>), including across these two species of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile the POA, a region of the hypothalamus known for its many cell types involved in mating and parenting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mei et al., 2023</xref>), amongst other innate behaviors. We profiled males and females of both <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus</italic> species and, by comparing to <italic>Mus</italic> data, identified POA cell types conserved across rodents. We identified cell type abundance and gene expression differences across species and sex, and hypothesized how these differences may contribute to species- and sex-specific behaviors. Finally, we characterized how sex-bias is evolving across these two <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species and proposed potential cell type abundance and gene expression changes that may be co-evolving with monogamy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A transcriptional cell atlas of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> POA</title><p>We performed droplet-based snRNA-seq on the POA of 6 males and 6 females from each of the <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus</italic> species (Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An atlas of the POA in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> was previously developed that combined single-cell RNA-seq data with imaging-based spatial information and data on specific neuronal populations activated by social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>). To create a comparable dataset, we used a dissection strategy identical to that used for creating the <italic>Mus</italic> POA atlas to dissect a region containing the POA and surrounding nuclei (~2.5 mm × 2.5 mm × 0.75 mm equivalent to <italic>Mus</italic> Bregma +0.5 to –0.6) (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To reduce batch effect, thereby increasing statistical power for detecting species and sex differences, we took advantage of the genetic diversity of our outbred study system and pooled nuclei from a male and female from each of the <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus</italic> species (i.e. 4 samples) into each snRNA-seq run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We collected a total of 105,647 nuclei across 6 replicates (i.e. 24 samples) (Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To computationally demultiplex the pooled data, we used bulk RNA-seq or whole genome sequencing data to call single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each animal. We then used SNP data to assign sample information to each nucleus in the snRNA-seq dataset (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). In total, we were able to confidently assign a single sample to 95,057 nuclei.

We first performed a low-granularity clustering using the first 30 principal components (PCs) of our data and a low resolution parameter of 0.2 to obtain a small number of clusters. This procedure identified 21 major cell classes which were assigned as neurons, microglia, astrocytes, immature and mature oligodendrocytes, endothelial, and ependymal cells using known marker genes from <italic>Mus</italic> hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steuernagel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then focused only on neuronal nuclei (52,121 nuclei), and reclustered the data at a higher granularity using the first 100 PCs of our data and a resolution parameter of 1.8 (Methods). This resulted in 53 neuronal cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We did not find major biases in sex or species across our clusters, as shown by the even distribution of each sex and species across the UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Our cell clusters reflect known cell types of the POA as well as surrounding nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus, including the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and more. For example, arginine vasopressin (<italic>Avp</italic>) and oxytocin (<italic>Oxt</italic>) are exclusively and highly expressed in clusters 34 and 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), respectively, and reflect the well-known populations of AVP and OXT neurons that are found in the PVN and SON. Additionally, vasoactive intestinal protein (<italic>Vip</italic>) is highly expressed in clusters 41 and 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), which together represent the VIP neurons of the SCN that play a major role in regulating circadian rhythms. Further inspection of these two clusters finds specific expression of neuromedin S (<italic>Nms</italic>) only in cluster 41 and gastric releasing peptide (<italic>Grp</italic>) only in cluster 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that these two clusters actually represent two subpopulations of VIP neurons, Vip/Nms and Vip/Grp, that have recently been reported as genetically and functionally distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Todd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While some neuropeptidergic cell types were obviously identifiable in our data, they were the minority of our cell clusters. We sought to provide more biological context for the rest of our data by identifying homology between our cell clusters and cell types defined from the <italic>Mus</italic> POA atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>). We used Seurat’s integration workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) to identify conserved gene correlation structures across the <italic>Mus</italic> and <italic>Peromyscus</italic> datasets and transfer <italic>Mus</italic> cell type labels onto each <italic>Peromyscus</italic> nucleus (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because the <italic>Mus</italic> POA atlas consists of separate inhibitory and excitatory datasets, we first defined each of our nuclei as inhibitory or excitatory based on whether it expressed higher levels of inhibitory markers <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic> or excitatory marker <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). We then transferred inhibitory and excitatory <italic>Mus</italic> cell type labels only onto inhibitory and excitatory nuclei, respectively.</p><p>For each <italic>Peromyscus</italic> cluster, we calculated the proportion of nuclei within the cluster assigned to each <italic>Mus</italic> cell type and labeled clusters if at least 15% of the cluster was predicted to belong to the same <italic>Mus</italic> cell type label (Methods). This procedure identified mappings for 34 of our 53 neuronal cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). (<italic>Mus</italic> cell type labels were denoted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref> as inhibitory (i) or excitatory (e), and named after marker genes identified from <italic>Mus</italic> POA atlas.) The cell clusters for which we were able to assign <italic>Mus</italic> homology include four cell types activated by relevant social behaviors in <italic>Mus</italic>: cluster 5 (i18: Gal/Tac2), which is activated by mating behaviors; cluster 17 (i23: Crh/Nts) which is activated by parenting behaviors; and clusters 20 (i16: Gal/Th) and 9 (i20:Gal/Moxd1), which are activated by both mating and parenting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We were unable to assign <italic>Mus</italic> homology for 19 <italic>Peromyscus</italic> cell clusters. These cell clusters had similar numbers of reads and genes per nuclei compared to clusters for which we did find <italic>Mus</italic> homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>), and therefore we do not believe the lack of homology assignment is due to technical artifacts. Instead, clusters unassignable to <italic>Mus</italic> cell types likely fall into two categories: First, dissection and/or anatomical differences between <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> may influence the presence and absence of certain cell types. For example, cluster 2 forms a clear ‘island’ on our UMAP and is transcriptionally specified by high expression of <italic>Pvalb</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, and <italic>Gad2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). This cluster very likely consists of inhibitory interneurons that have been reported to reside primarily in the thalamus in <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clemente-Perez et al., 2017</xref>) but may have been inadvertently captured in our dataset due to differences in dissection or differences in spatial distribution of these interneurons between species. Second, some cell types may not be transcriptionally well-defined and homology would not be assignable based on gene expression data alone. For example, cell clusters that lie in the middle of our UMAP (e.g. clusters 0, 13, 25, 8, etc.) likely do not have strong transcriptional signatures captured by our snRNA-seq and were also less likely to be mapped to a homologous <italic>Mus</italic> cell type. Still, we were able to assign homology for the majority of our nuclei enabling us to better interpret cellular and molecular changes in the context of their biological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differential abundance of cell clusters across species and sex</title><p>With our <italic>Peromyscus</italic> POA cell atlas, we first asked if there were differences in cell abundance across species or sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, we previously reported based on bulk RNA-seq data that the expression level of <italic>Avp</italic> was nearly 3 x higher in <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> hypothalamus compared to <italic>P. polionotus</italic>, and that this expression difference mediates the different amounts of parental nesting behavior performed by each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggests this difference in <italic>Avp</italic> expression and parental nesting behavior may be driven, at least in part, by a neuronal number difference across species.</p><p>Two cell clusters were found to be more abundant in the monogamous <italic>P. polionotus</italic> compared to the promiscuous <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>: cluster 43 (i26:Tac1/Prok2) (3.4 x higher; FDR = 0.08) and cluster 20 (i16:Gal/Th) (1.6 x higher; FDR = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We were intrigued by the latter cluster because of its known roles in parental care. In <italic>Mus</italic>, i16:Gal/Th is activated by pup exposure and successful mating in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>).

In <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, we also observed robust and specific expression of galanin in this cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, we have shown that <italic>P. polionotus</italic> of both sexes perform more parental care than their <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> counterparts, and that this behavioral difference is heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>).

As expected, CALB1-ir cells were found in the SDN-POA and BNST. Because the cell density of CALB1-ir cells is so high in the BNST, we calculated the area of immunoreactivity in the BNST rather than counting cells individually. We note that this metric may include fibers and terminals whose signal may originate from projections from regions outside the BNST. The area of immunoreactivity in the BNST was ~2 x larger in males in both <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> (p=0.004, one-sided Mann Whitney test) and <italic>P. polionotus</italic> species (p=0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

However, using immunostaining to better capture spatial information, we actually find that the two subregions of i20:Gal/Moxd1 are evolving differently across species: while sex-bias in the BNST has remained conserved, sex-bias in the SDN-POA has become more reduced in the monogamous <italic>P. polionotus</italic>.</p><p>In sum, we computationally identified six neuronal cell types of the hypothalamus that have changed in abundance across species or sex, and experimentally confirmed three cell types with abundance changes. Our findings align with previous work: we identified a species difference in AVP neurons, which had been reported to be differentially abundant across our focal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cushing, 2016</xref>), and sex-bias of i20:Gal/Moxd1, which is known to be male-biased across mammalian species. Our findings also identified four neuronal cell types with differential abundance across species, two of which are candidates for underlying species differences in behavior: differential abundance of AVP neurons may be partially responsible for a differential expression level of AVP across species, which we previously implicated in parental nesting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>), and an increased abundance of a galanin-expressing cell type known to govern parental care behavior, i16:Gal/Th, was observed in the monogamous species that performs more parental care. Finally, our immunostaining found that regional populations of transcriptionally identical cell types may evolve differently across species, and suggests that regional-specificity of sex-bias in i20:Gal/Moxd1 cells may be important to the evolution of sex-specific behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differential neuronal gene expression across species and sex</title><p>We next asked what gene expression differences there were across species and sex.

Here, we explored this question by performing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in the POA of males and females of a monogamous, biparental species of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and a species that is promiscuous and exhibits maternal-only care. We focused on the POA as it is a region known to be important for mating and parenting behaviors, and took advantage of an existing <italic>Mus</italic> POA single-cell atlas to assign homology between <italic>Peromyscus</italic> cell clusters and functionally characterized cell types.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Differential abundance of parenting-related cell types</title><p>Of the four cell types differentially abundant across species, three have obvious ties to parenting behavior: AVP (cluster 34), OXT (cluster 40), and i16:Gal/Th (cluster 20) neurons. The differential abundance we observed in AVP neurons both supports our prior finding that variation in <italic>Avp</italic> levels appears to contribute to a parental nesting behavior difference across our focal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>), and adds to our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref> previously used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis to link parental nest building to two genomic loci, one of which encompasses the <italic>Avp</italic> locus. With bulk RNA-sequencing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref> found <italic>Avp</italic> was 3 x more highly expressed in the promiscuous, less parental species (<italic>P. maniculatus</italic>), and further experimentally showed that an increase in intracerebroventricular Avp in <italic>Peromyscus</italic> inhibits parental nesting behavior. The genetic linkage between the <italic>Avp</italic> locus and parental nesting was partially attributed to a <italic>cis</italic>-effect that leads to differential expression across species, though this <italic>cis</italic>-effect changes expression by ~1.1 x and does not explain the full difference in expression across species.</p><p>In our study, we found AVP <italic>neuron count</italic> was ~2 x higher in the promiscuous <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>, suggesting that a difference in neuron number may additionally contribute to <italic>Avp</italic> expression and behavioral differences. Additionally, we observed 1.8 x higher expression of <italic>Avp</italic> within <italic>Avp</italic> neurons of <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> compared to <italic>P. polionotus,</italic> corroborating the <italic>cis</italic>-effect found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>. Together, the combination of expression difference and abundance difference better matches the full 3 x difference observed in bulk RNA-sequencing. Our data proposes that evolution may be modulating behavior by changing expression levels through both local, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory pathways and upstream pathways in neurogenesis and neurodevelopment.</p><p>We also found the OXT neuron number to be ~3 x higher in the promiscuous species. The direction of differential abundance is opposite to what may be expected given oxytocin’s known roles in pair bonding and monogamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Froemke and Young, 2021</xref>). The species difference in oxytocin neurons may simply be due to the shared developmental lineage between AVP and OXT neurons, which are formed from the same precursor cells and only differentiate from each other later in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schonemann et al., 1995</xref>). Our data suggests that genetic changes upstream of AVP/OXT differentiation have evolved across our focal species. Still, more work needs to be done to understand if the OXT abundance difference leads to behavioral changes, or if, perhaps, they have been compensated for through other changes such as in expression and/or spatial distribution of the oxytocin receptor.</p><p>Finally, we find a subtype of galanin neurons, i16:Gal/Th (cluster 20), to be more abundant in monogamous species. Galanin neurons of the MPOA were first reported to be specifically activated by parental care behavior in <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), a finding that has since been replicated in cichlids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butler et al., 2020</xref>) and frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest galanin has an evolutionarily conserved role in parenting behavior. In a study of biparental poison frogs (<italic>Ranitomeya imitator</italic>), frogs that performed parental behavior in a laboratory assay had significantly more galanin neurons than non-parental frogs, independent of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). This study and ours find a correlation between galanin neuronal number and increased propensity for parental care behavior, both within and across species. However, further investigation is required to understand whether these observations are causally linked.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two cell types play important roles in sex-specific biology</title><p>Across sexes, we found two cell types, i20:Gal/Moxd1 (cluster 9) and i18:Gal/Tac2 (cluster 5), that were sex-biased in cell abundance and had an enrichment of sex-biased genes across both <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species. i20:Gal/Moxd1 (cluster 9) is known to be more abundant in males across many mammalian species in two hypothalamic regions: BNST and SDN-POA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campi et al., 2013</xref> for an overview). However, our immunohistochemistry experiments found the male-bias in abundance to be significantly reduced in the SDN-POA of the monogamous species, though conserved across species in the BNST.</p><p>Our findings mirror a previous study comparing sister species of polygamous and monogamous voles, which found the volume of the SDN-POA to be sexually dimorphic in the polygamous species, but not in the monogamous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shapiro et al., 1991</xref>). Another study in <italic>P. californicus</italic>, an independent lineage of monogamous <italic>Peromyscus</italic>, found male-bias in the volume of SDN-POA, but noted that the volume difference was half of what had been reported in other, promiscuous rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campi et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the male-bias found in the volume of the BNST was consistent with fold-differences reported in other rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campi et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that (1) sex differences in the neuronal number of the BNST and SDN-POA can be independently evolving, even within transcriptionally similar cell types, and (2) sex differences in the neuronal number of the SDN-POA, but not BNST, may be co-evolving with monogamy.</p><p>Much less is known about the second sexually dimorphic cell type, i18:Gal/Tac2 (cluster 5). In <italic>Mus</italic>, it is activated by mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>) and also reported to be enriched in estrogen receptor (<italic>Esr1</italic>) expression and sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaplan et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, this cell type appears to play conserved sex-specific roles, possibly in mating and copulatory behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sexual dimorphism in gene expression is reduced in monogamous species</title><p>Finally, we found significantly fewer sex-biased genes in the monogamous species compared to the promiscuous species. A prevailing hypothesis, first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Darwin, 1871</xref>, suggests that males of promiscuous species have a larger variance in reproductive success compared to those of monogamous species, leading to greater intrasexual competition and more extreme sexual dimorphisms. Correlations between monogamy and reduced sexual dimorphism have been repeatedly observed in morphological traits such as body size and animal ornamentation (e.g. coloration or plumage) across diverse taxa including primates, birds, fish, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kvarnemo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kraaijeveld et al., 2007</xref>). However, much less is known about whether the reduction of sexual dimorphism extends to molecular phenotypes such as gene expression. Work by us and others previously failed to find consistent genome-wide patterns in bulk RNA-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishra et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kautt et al., 2024</xref>). The striking reduction we see in our snRNA-seq data highlights the importance of quantifying gene expression at the level of specific cell types to better understand evolution of gene expression and its relationship with organismal-level phenotypes.</p><p>Across our study species, there is also a reduction of sexual dimorphism in behavior, with the emergence of biparental care in the monogamous species (in contrast to maternal-only care exhibited by the promiscuous species). Whether the reduced sexual dimorphism in neuronal gene expression may be actually mediating the reduced sexual dimorphism in social behavior is an interesting avenue for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study begins to characterize molecular differences in a region of the brain responsible for mating and parenting behaviors across two species with divergent mating systems. Overall, we find cell abundance and gene expression changes across sex and species, both of which contribute to differential levels of neuronally-important proteins. Though not explored here, changes in cell abundance may additionally accompany neuronal circuitry changes that affect behavior. Finally, we find intriguing differences in neuropeptidergic cell types as well as cell types expressing high levels of sex steroid hormone receptors, implicating two key classes of signaling molecules – neuropeptides and sex hormones – as important evolutionary dials for modulating species and sex-specific behavior.</p><p>We note that while our two focal species most obviously differ in mating and parenting behaviors, they also differ in other behaviors including thermoregulatory behavior and burrowing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedford and Hoekstra, 2015</xref>). Additionally, the POA is known to regulate behaviors other than mating and parenting behavior, including sleep and thermoregulation. Therefore, further experimental characterization is required to more precisely understand the behavioral consequences of the species differences we observed in the POA, and to reveal the precise nature of how genes can encode for the substrates needed for generating variation in innate behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample <break/>(<italic>Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dissections of <break/>preoptic area</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peromyscus Genetic <break/>Stock Center <break/>(Columbia, SC, USA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Freshly isolated from <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample <break/>(<italic>Peromyscus polionotus subgriseus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dissections of <break/>preoptic area</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peromyscus Genetic <break/>Stock Center <break/>(Columbia, SC, USA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Freshly isolated from <italic>Peromyscus polionotus subgriseus</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Avp <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImmunoStar</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 20069<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_572219">AB_572219</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:4000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Oxt (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMD Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# MAB5296</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Calb1 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# C9848</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 X Genomics 3’ V3 Chip</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 x Genomics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nuclei were loaded at a target of 20,000 nuclei/run</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CellRanger v5.0.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 x Genomics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_023221">SCR_023221</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p><italic>P. maniculatus bairdii</italic> and <italic>P. polionotus subgriseus</italic> animals were originally acquired from the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center (Columbia, SC, USA).

The POA was dissected on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S) at –20 °C. Brains were sectioned coronally until reaching the widening of the anterior commissure. The dorsal and lateral regions of the brain were removed so that only a ~2.5 mm × 2.5 mm region that contained the POA remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Samples were collected in Trizol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Poly(A) enrichment, directional mRNA library preparation, and paired-end sequencing of 150 base pair reads on a NovaSeq 6000 were performed by Novogene. Samples were sequenced to a depth of ~35 million read pairs.

We extracted genomic DNA from tail tissue using proteinase K digestion followed by the Maxwell RSC (Promega) DNA extraction. We prepared DNA libraries using the Nextera DNA Flex kit with Illumina adapters.

Our in-house transcriptome annotations were generated using Comparative Annotational Toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>) and GENCODE v15 annotations of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (GRCm38 mm10) as reference. We used the standard CellRanger pipeline to filter out droplet barcodes associated with background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). For each droplet that passed the background filter, we preliminarily assigned each droplet to the species for which the majority of reads mapped to (which we refer to as the ‘primary’ species). Droplets clearly fell into two clusters: one cluster that represents singlets in which a small percentage of reads incorrectly maps to the secondary species and a second, sparser cluster of droplets that represent multiplets in which genetic material from two species were truly captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To delineate between the two clusters, we examined the number of reads mapping to the primary genome and binned droplets in increments of 500 reads. Within each bin, we then plotted the distribution of reads mapping to the <italic>secondary</italic> genome. We fit this distribution with a mixture model of two Gaussians using normalmixEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benaglia et al., 2010</xref>) and identified the point at which the two distributions cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then found the line of best fit through all intersection points across the bins and used this line as the threshold between singlets and multiplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Within each species, we next used demuxlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2018</xref>) to infer sample identity based on the known sample genotype data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Demuxlet additionally identifies multiplets when mixtures of sample genotypes are detected.</p><p>For each 10 x run, we expected our detectable multiplet rate to be ~9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Genomics, 2022</xref>) and our assigned detectable rate ranged from 8–13% across our replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that our assigned singlets were evenly distributed across the four samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and the distribution of the number of genes detected per droplet was similar across samples and replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Finally, when we checked the expression level of the female-specific gene, <italic>Xist</italic>, we found that female-assigned cells had significantly higher <italic>Xist</italic> read counts than male-assigned cells and the median read counts of <italic>Xist</italic> across male-assigned cells was 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). After sample demultiplexing, we used CellRanger v5.0.0 to map reads from each nucleus to the transcriptome of its assigned species and used these read counts for all subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell type clustering</title><p>All normalization, data integration, and clustering of scRNA-seq data were performed with Seurat v4.1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hao et al., 2021</xref>).

Briefly, Seurat learns a conserved gene correlation structure between two data sets using canonical correlation analysis and identifies pairwise correspondences between single nuclei across datasets in order to transform data sets into a shared space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). We created UMAPs using the runUMAP function, and clustered the integrated data by using the FindNeighbors function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Homology mapping of inhibitory and excitatory cell types</title><p>We defined each cell cluster and all nuclei within that cluster as inhibitory or excitatory based on higher expression levels of <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic> (inhibitory) or <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (excitatory) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).

Briefly, Seurat first identifies pairwise correspondences between single nuclei across datasets (‘anchors’) and then ‘transfers’ cell type labels by weighting the cell type identities of each anchor with their distance to the nuclei at hand. For each nuclei, this procedure calculates the probability that it belongs to each cell type label and assigns the cell type label which received the highest probability.</p><p>To find cluster-to-cell-type mappings, we calculated the proportion of each cluster that was assigned to each <italic>Mus</italic> cell type label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).

We then retained only cell clusters and <italic>Mus</italic> cell type labels if 15% of a cluster or more were predicted to belong to the same <italic>Mus</italic> cell type label. The cutoff value was chosen empirically after examining clusters where homology to the <italic>Mus</italic> atlas that could be established by marker genes. The proportion of these clusters that mapped to <italic>Mus</italic> labels ranged from 17.3% (cluster 15 - i14:Avp/Cck) to 92.6% (cluster 38 – i4:Gaba/Mylk), and therefore a 15% cutoff was chosen. This resulted in 17 excitatory clusters mapping onto 11 <italic>Mus</italic> excitatory cell type labels and 17 inhibitory clusters mapping onto 18 <italic>Mus</italic> inhibitory cell type labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Differential abundance of cell clusters</title><p>Differential abundance analysis was conducted with edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>).

To test for enrichments of each gene category, we compared foreground genes (i.e. a significantly differentially expressed gene) to background genes that were matched in expression level to control for the fact that genes that are more highly expressed are more accurately quantified and thus more likely to be identified as differentially expressed. We created backgrounds with the following procedure: We binned all genes by their expression level in bins of 0.5 log<sub>10</sub>(counts per million). For each gene in our foreground, we randomly chose a gene from our entire dataset from the same expression bin. If the same gene was DE in multiple cell types, we matched the highest expression level. To obtain an empirical <italic>p</italic>-value, we repeated this procedure 5000 times and calculated the number of times a background list contained equal or higher numbers of foreground genes within a gene category, and we accounted for multiple hypothesis testing of several gene categories using an FDR correction.

P. polionotus show high levels of parental care from both sexes of parent, and P. maniculatus show lower levels of care, predominantly displayed by dams rather than sires. The overall goal of understanding the genomic basis of behavioral variation is significant and of broad interest and comparative studies in POA in these two species is an excellent approach to tackle this question. The authors correctly point out that existing studies largely compare species that are highly divergent, such as mice and humans, which confounds the association of specific neuronal populations or gene expression patterns with distinct behaviors. They identify neuronal populations with differential abundance between species and sexes, and additionally report sex and species differences in gene expression within each transcriptomic cell type. Their cell type classification is aided by mapping their Peromyscus cells onto a previously existing POA single cell dataset generated in lab mice. The detection and validation of previously observed sex differences in the Gal/Moxd1 cell type, and species differences in Avp expression provides additional support that their data are robust. Importantly, the authors demonstrate reduced sexual dimorphism in the POA of P. polionotus, compared to P. maniculatus, and prior knowledge in rats and mice. This finding suggests a potential neural substrate for the increased parental behavior in P. polionotus.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a pioneering comparative snRNA-seq study that provides a roadmap for similar approaches in non-traditional model organisms.</p><p>The authors have identified populations that may underlie sex- and species- differences in parenting behavior in rodents.</p><p>A significant strength of the manuscript is the histological validation of their most robust marker genes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My primary concern is that the dataset is limited: 52,121 neuronal nuclei across 24 samples, which does not provide many cells per cluster to analyze comparatively across sex and species, particularly given the heterogeneity of the large region dissected, which contains adjacent regions such as the PVN and SCN.</p><p>There is no explanation for the finding that there is a female-bias in gene expression across all cell types in P. polionotus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103109.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Phoebe R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kirby</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Hopi E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments.</p><p>Based on their suggestions we will:</p><p>(1) Use more accurate language to describe the hypothalamus regions under investigation in this study. While we aimed to primarily investigate the medial preoptic area (MPOA), our dissections and sequencing data in fact capture several regions of the anterior hypothalamus including the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV), paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and more. We will revise the language in our manuscript to reflect that our study in fact investigates the cellular evolution of the anterior hypothalamus across behaviorally divergent deer mice.</p><p>(2) Revise our language to clarify that while our study provides a rich dataset for generating hypotheses about which cell types may contribute to behavioral differences, it does not provide any evidence of causal relationships. We hope to investigate this further in future work.</p><p>(3) Clarify specific methodological choices for which reviewers had questions, especially about the hypothalamic regions for which we did histology to validate cell abundance differences and methodological choices related to mapping our cell clusters to <italic>Mus</italic> cell types.</p><p>Our responses to each reviewer’s specific comments are below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The major limitation of the study is the absence of causal experiments linking the observed changes in MPOA cell types to species-specific social behaviors.

We hope that the dataset is of value for generating hypotheses about how hypothalamic neuronal cell types may govern species-specific social behaviors, and for these hypotheses to be functionally tested by us and others in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Some methodology could be further explained, like the decision of a 15% cutoff value for cell type assignment per cluster, or the necessity of a multi-step analysis pipeline for gene enrichment studies.</p></disp-quote><p>A 15% cutoff value for cell type assignment was chosen to include all known homology correspondences between our dataset and the <italic>Mus</italic> atlas. For example, i14:Avp/Cck cells from the <italic>Mus</italic> atlas represent Avp cells from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Though only 17.3% of cluster 15 maps to i14:Avp/Cck, we know these two clusters correspond based on the expression of <italic>Avp</italic> and additional SCN marker genes in cluster 15 (Supp Fig 6). We will further explain this cutoff in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Our gene enrichment study includes a multi-step analysis pipeline because we wanted to control for confounders that may be introduced because of gene expression level. Genes that are more highly expressed are more accurately quantified and thus more likely to be identified as differentially expressed. Therefore, we wanted to test for gene enrichments in our set of DE genes against a background of genes with similar expression levels. We will clarify this motivation in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should exercise strong caution in making inferences about these differences being the basis of parental behavior. It is possible, given connections to relevant research, but without direct intervention, direct claims should be avoided. There should be clear distinctions of what to conclude and what to propose as possibilities for future research.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that we are unable to make direct claims about neuronal differences being the basis of parental behavior. We will revise our language to be clearer about which relationships we are hypothesizing and what we propose as possibilities for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Histology is not performed on all regions included in the sequencing analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our language describing the hypothalamic regions included in the sequencing analysis and those included in the histology is unclear. We aimed to dissect the medial preoptic region for the sequencing analysis, but additionally captured parts of the anterior hypothalamus including the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and more. Our histology was performed across the entire hypothalamus and includes all regions included in the sequencing data. We will revise the manuscript to more accurately describe the hypothalamic regions for which we investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>My primary concern is that the dataset is limited: 52,121 neuronal nuclei across 24 samples, which does not provide many cells per cluster to analyze comparatively across sex and species, particularly given the heterogeneity of the region dissected. The Supplementary table reports lower UMIs/genes per cell than is typically seen as well. Perhaps additional information could be obtained from the data by not restricting the analyses to cells that can be assigned to Mus types. A direct comparison of the two Peromyscus species could be valuable as would a more complete Peromyscus POA atlas.</p></disp-quote><p>Our dataset reports ~1,500 genes and ~1,000 UMIs per nuclei which is indeed lower than is typically reported in other single nuclei datasets. Some of this discrepancy is due to a lower quality genome and annotated transcriptome available for <italic>Peromyscus</italic> compared to <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, which results in a lower mapping rate than is typically reported in <italic>Mus</italic> studies. However, our dataset was sufficient to identify known peptidergic cell types (Supp Fig 6) and to map homology to <italic>Mus</italic> cell types for 34 (64%) of our 53 clusters. Additionally, although some of our clusters contain small numbers of cells, our differential abundance analysis accounts for the variance in cell numbers observed across samples and should be robust against any increase in variance due to small numbers. In fact, even differential abundance of very small cell clusters such as oxytocin neurons (cell type 40) was validated by histology.</p><p>We would like to clarify that all analyses were performed on all cell clusters, regardless of whether or not they could be assigned homology to a <italic>Mus</italic> cell type. All the cell types that we identified as differentially abundant or contained significant sex differences happened to be cell types for which homology to a <italic>Mus</italic> cell type could be defined. This may arise for a relatively uninteresting reason: cell types that have more distinct transcriptional signatures will be more accurately clustered, leading to more accurate identification of homology as well as more accurate measurements of differential abundance / expression. We will revise language to make this more clear in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Supplement 7, it appears that most neurons can be assigned as excitatory or inhibitory, but then so many of these cells remain in the unassigned &quot;gray blob&quot; seen in panel 1E. Clustering of excitatory and inhibitory neurons separately, as in prior cited work in Mus POA (refs 31 and 57) may boost statistical power to detect sex and species differences in cell types. Perhaps the cells that cannot be assigned to Mus contain too few reads to be useful, in which case they should be filtered out in the QC. The technical challenges of a comparative single-cell approach are considerable, so it benefits the scientific community to provide transparency about them.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain about why we are unable to cluster and assign homology to many of our cells (i.e. cells in the unassigned “gray blob”). However, we note that even in the <italic>Mus</italic> atlas, many cells did not belong to obvious clusters by UMAP visualization and that several clusters lacked notable marker genes and were designated simply as “Gaba” and “Glut” clusters. Therefore, it is unsurprising that our own dataset also contains cells that lack the transcriptional signatures needed to be clustered and/or mapped to <italic>Mus</italic> cell types. We do know, however, that the median number of reads/nuclei is uniform across cell clusters and does not explain why some clusters could not be assigned to <italic>Mus</italic>. We will add this information to our revised manuscript.</p><p>We do not think that a two-stage clustering (i.e. clustering first by excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons) is expected to gain power to resolve cell types in this case. Excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons are clearly separable on our UMAP (Supp Fig 7) so that information is already being used by our clustering procedure. However, we will explore this further in our revised manuscript to see if doing so will boost statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Calb1 dimorphism as observed by immunostaining, appears much more extensive in P. maniculatus compared to P. polionotus (Figures 3 E and F). This finding is not reflected in the counts of the i20:Gal/Moxd1 cluster. The use of Calb1 staining as a proxy for the Gal/Moxd1 cluster would be strengthened if the number of POA Calb1+ neurons that are found in each cluster was apparent. There may be additional Calb+ neurons in the cells that are not annotated to a Mus cluster. This clarification would add support to the overall conclusion that there is reduced sexual dimorphism in P. polionotus.</p></disp-quote><p>From the <italic>Mus</italic> MPOA atlas (which includes both single-cell sequencing data and imaging-based spatial information), it is known that the i20:Gal/Moxd1 cluster comprises sexually dimorphic cells that make up both the BNST and the SDN-POA. These sexually dimorphic cells are well-studied and known to be marked by <italic>Calb1</italic>, which we used in immunostaining as a proxy for i20:Gal/Moxd1.</p><p>However, we would like to clarify that in our study, the immunostaining of Calb1+ neurons and the sequencing counts of the i20:Gal/Moxd1 cluster are not completely reflective of each other because our sequencing dataset only captured the ventral portion of the BNST. Therefore our i20:Gal/Moxd1 counts contain a combination of some Calb1+ BNST cells and likely all Calb1+ SDN-POA cells and is difficult to interpret on its own. Our histology, however, covers the entire hypothalamus and is more reliable for identifying sex and species differences in each region. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The relationship between the sex steroid receptor expression and the sex bias in gene expression would be improved if the sex bias in sex steroid receptor expression was included in Supplementary Figure 10.</p></disp-quote><p>We will include this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no explanation for the finding that there is a female bias in gene expression across all cell types in P. polionotus.</p></disp-quote><p>We also find this observation interesting but don’t have a good explanation for why at this point.
