sclerosis (ALS). The proteasomal and autophagic degradation of proteins are two major pathways for protein quality control in the cell. Here, we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen uncovering a major regulator of cytotoxicity resulting from the inhibition of the proteasome. Dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) was found to be a robust suppressor, the loss of which protects against proteasome inhibition-associated cell death through promoting clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Loss of DBT altered the metabolic and energetic status of the cell and resulted in activation of autophagy in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism in the presence of proteasomal inhibition. Loss of DBT protected against proteotoxicity induced by ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian neurons. DBT is upregulated in the tissues of ALS patients. These results demonstrate that DBT is a master switch in the metabolic control of protein quality control with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell culture</kwd><kwd>ES cell</kwd><kwd>fruit flies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS089616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS074324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS128494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013013</institution-id><institution>Target ALS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000971</institution-id><institution>The ALS Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide screen identifies the BCAA catabolizing enzyme DBT as a master metabolic switch in the regulation of protein quality control when proteasomal activity is impaired.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of protein homeostasis is essential for cell viability, but protein often misfolds during the life of the cell as a result of destabilizing mutations, environmental stress, or metabolic challenges. Protein misfolding is a common theme in human neurodegenerative disorders, among a growing list of ‘conformational diseases,’ which often manifest with pathologies of proteinaceous inclusions in the affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prusiner, 2012</xref>). These neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD), Huntington’s (HD) diseases, ALS, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>). For instance, protein inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including the majority of ALS cases and significant subsets of FTD and AD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cairns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010</xref>). The accumulation of misfolded proteins can overwhelm the protein quality control systems in the cell and lead to functional impairment or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, proteotoxicity is considered a critical step in the pathogenesis of relevant neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms through which the cell organizes its protein quality control systems to alleviate proteotoxicity are not fully understood.</p><p>To guard against proteotoxicity, the cell has evolved elaborate machinery that can detect and degrade abnormal proteins to maintain the health of its proteome. The protein degradation machinery, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Varshavsky, 2017</xref>), play a critical role in removing the misfolded or aggregated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a selective proteolytic system based on the tagging of substrate proteins with ubiquitin molecules, plays a pivotal role in protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002</xref>). Autophagy is another major pathway for protein quality control, which mediates bulk or selective protein degradation or removal of protein aggregates in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yamamoto and Yue, 2014</xref>). Impairment of both the UPS and autophagic systems has been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong and Cuervo, 2010</xref>). Although proteotoxicity is known to be counteracted by the quality control systems including UPS and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pohl and Dikic, 2019</xref>), how these systems are regulated in a coordinated manner to mount an effective defense against proteotoxic stress remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, in search of critical regulators of proteotoxicity and protein quality control, we conducted an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for suppressors of cytotoxicity as a result of proteasomal impairment and then identified DBT as a major regulator of protein quality control. We found that loss of DBT robustly enhanced the survival of cells under stress induced by proteasomal impairment. The mechanisms through which loss of DBT conferred resistance to the proteasomal inhibition was through an AMPK-dependent signaling that retained autophagic activities when the proteasomal activity was diminished. Loss of DBT also protected against proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative models. Abnormal upregulation of DBT in ALS patient tissues suggests that the DBT-dependent protein quality control pathways are dysregulated in the human disease conditions. These results have revealed a previously unknown mechanism of maintaining proteostasis that has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide screening identifies DBT as a potent suppressor of proteasomal inhibition-induced cytotoxicity</title><p>To identify critical regulators of proteotoxicity as a result of proteasomal impairment, we designed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to search for suppressors that confer resistance to toxicity induced by proteasomal inhibition in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The screen was performed on human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells, a genomically stable diploid cell line, through infection with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from the human GeCKO (Genome-Scale CRISPR Knock-out) lentiviral pooled library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>). A potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kisselev and Goldberg, 2001</xref>), which is a peptide aldehyde and analog of proteasomal substrates, was applied to induce proteotoxicity. The sensitivity of RPE1 cells to proteasome inhibition was tested with MG132 treatment at a range of concentrations, with 2  μM of MG132 observed to cause lethality in most of the cells within 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The CRISPR screen was then performed with 2  μM of MG132 as the optimized concentration for selecting suppressors that would confer resistance to the proteasomal inhibition-induced toxicity. The RPE1 cells were infected with the GeCKO pooled lentiviral sgRNAs and cultured in the presence of 2  μM of MG132 for 6 days, and the surviving cells were allowed to recover without MG132 and grow into single cell-derived colonies. These colonies were then harvested and sequenced for further analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide screen reveals that loss of dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) protects cells against the toxicity of proteasomal inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of the CRISPR screen in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells, which were transduced with a lentiviral Genome-Scale CRISPR Knock-out (GeCKO) single guide RNA (sgRNA) library and selected for the sgRNA expression and then survival after treatments with the proteasome inhibitor MG132.

The cell line that had the most potent resistance phenotype was found to harbor a specific sgRNA against the DBT gene. Sanger sequencing of the genomic locus targeted by the sgRNA revealed a homozygous mutation, where a 1 bp insertion in exon 2 resulted in a premature stop codon in exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The loss of the C-terminal 77 amino acids from the 482 a.a. full-length protein suggests that this is a null mutant of DBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The phenotype of the DBT knockout (KO) cell line was verified through a series of cell survival experiments, in which the cells were subjected to MG132 treatment at a range of concentrations or over a period of time, and the DBT KO cells exhibited the robust phenotype of resisting MG132-induced cytotoxicity when compared to the wild-type (WT) control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, the resistance of DBT KO cells to proteasome inhibition-induced cytotoxicity was confirmed using another proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. The results from the bortezomib assay were consistent with those of MG132, as the DBT KO cells consistently demonstrated better survival rates than the WT control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). To further confirm the role of DBT in the cell survival phenotype through an independent approach of removing DBT protein, we knocked down DBT in RPE1 cells by using a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the gene and observed a similar phenotype, indicating that DBT deficiency indeed underlies the resistance of the cells to MG132-induced cell toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the resistance of the DBT KO cells to MG132-induced cell toxicity could be rescued by exogenous DBT. We engineered a DBT cDNA (DBT’) harboring seven synonymous point mutations in the gRNA-targeted region, which rendered the cDNA resistant to the Cas9 cleavage in the DBT KO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The expression of DBT’ in the DBT KO cells completely restored the cell lethality phenotype induced by MG132 treatment, as measured by the fluorescence signals from Calcein AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), a cell-permeant dye that stains live cells. Moreover, the MG132-induced cell death can be measured by the cleavage of marker proteins such as PARP1 and Caspase 3 through immunoblotting analysis. While WT RPE1 cells exhibited pronounced cell death as indicated by an increase in cleaved PARP1 and Caspase 3 after treatment with 2  μM MG132 for 48 hr, loss of DBT markedly suppressed the cleavage of these cell death marker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that loss of DBT robustly suppresses cell toxicity induced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of DBT prevents the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins</title><p>Next, we sought to identify the underlying mechanism through which DBT regulates MG132-induced cytotoxicity. The primary action of MG132 is to block the proteolytic activity of the 26 S proteasome complex, which is responsible for the degradation of most ubiquitinated proteins. To assess the effect of MG132-induced proteasomal inhibition on protein ubiquitination in WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells, we performed immunoblotting analysis of ubiquitinated proteins, which showed an accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the WT cells upon the MG132 treatment, whereas the MG132-induced changes in the levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the DBT KO cells were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In the absence of MG132 treatment, the LC3II levels were similar between WT and DBT KO cells. Treatment with the lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 blocks the degradation of LC3II, and the Bafilomycin A1-induced increase in LC3II was comparable between WT and DBT KO cells, indicating that the DBT KO cells had normal autophagy flux levels similar to those of WT cells under the resting condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loos et al., 2014</xref>).

ULK1 is an important regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and can be activated by AMPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of MG132 treatment, there was no difference in the levels of total ULK1 protein or its activity, as measured by the phosphorylation at its serine 371 (S<sup>371</sup>) site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Upon the treatment with 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr, there was little change in the ULK1 activity in WT RPE1 cells; however, the DBT KO cells exhibited a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ULK1-S<sup>371</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that loss of DBT specifically induced the activation of ULK1 under the MG132 treatment, concomitant with the AMPK activation under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, the elevated expression of DBT significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated ULK1 and phosphorylated AMPK in both WT and DBT KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results indicate that loss of DBT specifically induces the activation of the AMPK-ULK1 signaling under MG132 treatment.</p><p>Activated AMPK also inhibits the mTOR signaling, which negatively regulates autophagy. AMPK is reported to regulate the mTOR signaling by phosphorylating TSC2 on serine 1387 (S<sup>1387</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup> enhances the activity of TSC2 as a Rheb GAP, leading to the inhibition of mTOR. We found that the changes in the phosphorylation of TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup> were in accordance with that of AMPK-T<sup>172</sup> in the WT and DBT KO cells under the MG132-induced proteotoxic stress. There was little difference in the phosphorylation levels of TSC2 between the WT and DBT KO cells in the absence of MG132 treatment; however, under the treatment of 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr, the DBT KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup>, while the WT cells did not show any change in the phosphorylation levels of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR signaling is another mechanism through which loss of DBT leads to autophagic activation under proteasomal impairment.</p><p>Next, we modulated the activity of the mTOR signaling in the DBT KO cells to test its roles in the observed phenotypes of autophagic activation and resistance of MG132-induced cell toxicity. Since inhibition of mTOR signaling is associated with autophagic activation, as observed in the DBT KO cells, we targeted TSC1, a negative regulator of mTOR, via shRNAs to increase the mTOR signaling in the DBT KO cells. The increase in the mTOR activity as a result of TSC1 knockdown, as confirmed by the upregulated S6K phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), led to a significant reduction in LC3II protein levels as well as in the autophagy flux measured by the LC3II ratios before and after Bafilomycin treatment, confirming that the autophagic activation in the DBT KO cells was dependent on the inhibition of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, in accordance with the changes in autophagic activities, the knockdown of TSC1 abolished the enhanced survival phenotype of the DBT KO cells under the MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To confirm the role of the mTOR signaling in the cell survival phenotype of DBT KO cells, we applied an mTOR agonist, MHY1485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2012</xref>), and found that it also abolished the protective effects of loss of DBT and rendered the DBT KO cells sensitive to the MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Conversely, treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD001 or AZD8055 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beuvink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Willems et al., 2012</xref>), increased the resistance of WT cells to MG132-induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 proteins, including the M337V variant, are prone to misfolding and aggregation, providing a disease-related molecular model for studying proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>). We asked whether loss of DBT protects cells from mutant TDP-43-associated proteotoxicity. TDP-43<sup>M337</sup> or a GFP-like control protein Dendra2 was expressed in RPE1 cells for 48 hr, and the number of live cells was quantified by Calcein-AM staining. The WT cells expressing TDP-43<sup>M337</sup> showed significantly lower cell viability than those expressing the control protein, indicating that the WT cells were highly sensitive to TDP-43<sup>M337</sup>-induced proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the DBT KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of cell survival than the WT cells when expressing TDP-43<sup>M337</sup>, indicating strong protection by the loss of DBT.

In immunoblotting analysis, TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> transiently expressed in the DBT KO RPE1 cells showed substantially lower protein levels than that expressed in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine whether the decrease in the steady-state levels of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> protein was a consequence of increased protein degradation, we performed the cycloheximide chase assay to measure the turnover rate of the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> protein. As analyzed by immunoblotting of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> over a period of time after cycloheximide-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, the degradation of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> took place at a much faster rate in the DBT KO cells than in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The half-life of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> was estimated to be over 24 hr in the WT cells but only ~4.5 hr in the DBT KO cells. Furthermore, consistent with the faster turnover rate of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>, the DBT KO cells exhibited a higher degree of autophagy flux than the WT cells, as measured by LC3II levels before and after the Bafilomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Additionally, the elevated expression of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> selectively increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the DBT KO cells but not in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that loss of DBT promoted the clearance of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> and reduced its proteotoxicity through enhanced AMPK signaling and autophagic functions.</p><p>To study the TDP-43-associated proteotoxicity in an in vivo system, we employed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, which expresses the ALS-associated human mutant TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> under the GMR-GAL4 driver and develops a rough-eye phenotype as a result of loss of photoreceptors and retinal degeneration in adult eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ritson et al., 2010</xref>). By crossing with a transgenic strain with stable RNAi-induced reduction of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human DBT, CG5599 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">St Pierre et al., 2014</xref>), we found that the knockdown of the DBT homolog produced a significant rescue of the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>-induced rough eye phenotype, resulting in a smoother eye appearance and increased pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To confirm the observation, we generated a DBT KO <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain by mating Cas9 flies with DBT sgRNA flies and obtained a homozygous mutant with a 1 bp deletion in exon 2 of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DBT gene, which yielded a null allele with a premature stop codon in exon 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When we crossed the DBT KO flies with TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> transgenic flies, a similar protection against the rough eye phenotype was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that loss of DBT protects against TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration.</p><p>To extend the analysis of DBT-dependent proteotoxicity from TDP-43 to another disease-associated protein, we focused on the polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat, which is a misfolded protein domain associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>). In cell survival assays, we found that WT RPE1 cells expressing polyQ showed significantly lower cell viability than DBT KO cells, indicating that loss of DBT protects against polyQ-induced proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In immunoblotting analysis, we found that polyQ transiently expressed in the DBT KO cells exhibited substantially lower protein levels than those in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that the resistance of the DBT KO cells to polyQ-induced proteotoxicity was associated with enhanced turnover of the polyQ protein. Additionally, we utilized a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to confirm the protective effects of loss of DBT polyQ-induced toxicity in an in vivo system. Based on the analysis of the rough eye phenotype in the polyQ transgenic fly model, we observed significant protection against eye degeneration in both DBT RNAi and KO flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

First, we carried out the immunoblotting analysis of spinal cord tissue extracts from 24 ALS patients and eight non-neurological controls. Although the immunoblot signals showed variability among the individuals, we found that DBT protein levels were significantly elevated in the majority of ALS cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we performed immunofluorescence staining to analyze the quantity and distribution of DBT proteins in the human spinal cord tissue sections. In the control cases, DBT could be seen clearly expressed in motor neurons, which are characterized by their large soma and unique nuclear morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Compared with the controls, the DBT immunofluorescence signals showed much higher intensity and broader distribution across the spinal cord sections, suggesting elevated levels of DBT in neuronal soma and neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Indeed, stronger signals of DBT immunofluorescence could be detected in large neuronal cell bodies in the ALS cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

The observations of DBT’s robust regulatory effects on the proteotoxicity in models of neurodegenerative diseases and the upregulation of DBT in ALS patient tissues suggest that DBT is an important player in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The loss of DBT leads to the accumulation of BCAAs as a result of the blocked catabolism of these amino acids, which tilts the balance of intracellular energy and reduces the levels of ATP, under the condition of proteasomal inhibition. This energy imbalance triggers the activation of AMPK, which then promotes autophagy through its regulation of mTOR and ULK1.

Recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggested that BCAA metabolism plays complicated roles in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with deficiency in components of the BCKD complex negatively impacting the ubiquitin-proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ravanelli et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, we found in the present study that mammalian cells deficient in DBT exhibited a remarkable degree of resistance to cell death from proteotoxicity induced by the proteasomal inhibition. In accordance with the enhanced cellular survival under the proteotoxic stress induced by proteasomal inhibition in cells lacking DBT, the DBT-deficient cells exhibited a remarkable capacity to prevent the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins as a result of the proteasomal inhibition. Although proteasomal inhibition itself may activate autophagy as an adaptive cellular response in wild-type cells during the early stages of stress, we have observed diminished autophagic activities after the persistent stress, likely due to the overloaded burden of proteotoxicity from proteasomal inhibition. The efficient clearance of the poly-ubiquitinated proteins despite the proteasomal inhibition in the DBT-deficient cells was attributable to a robust preservation of autophagic activities in the absence of DBT.</p><p>Conventionally, elevated levels of BCAAs are associated with inhibition of autophagy due to their ability to activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhenyukh et al., 2017</xref>), the nutrient sensor that negatively regulates autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunlop and Tee, 2014</xref>). While the expected increase in BCAAs was observed following the loss of DBT, our findings indicate that additional factors beyond BCAAs play a role in the regulation of autophagy, since DBT-deficient cells exhibited improved preservation of autophagic activities under the conditions of proteasomal inhibition compared to WT cells. Consistent with the preservation of autophagic activities, the DBT-deficient cells showed significant activation of AMPK signaling under the conditions of proteasomal inhibition. The activation of AMPK, as a synergistic effect of proteasomal inhibition and DBT deficiency, is driven by the depletion of intracellular ATP under the combined conditions. The ATP-producing OXPHOS complexes are sensitive to the regulation of protein quality control, as its many components are regulated by proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Szczepanowska and Trifunovic, 2021</xref>), consistent with our observation of lower ATP levels upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor. We also found that the DBT deficiency decreased the intracellular ATP levels under the condition of proteasomal inhibition, suggesting that DBT-dependent BCAA catabolism is a critical source of energy production under the condition of proteasomal inhibition. Furthermore, the net outcome of better preservation of autophagic activities, upon inhibition of both proteasomal degradation and BCAA catabolism, underlies the important roles of the energy metabolism and the cognate AMPK signaling, which regulates autophagy regulators including mTOR and ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alers et al., 2012</xref>), as the driving force for the autophagic activation under these conditions. Although cells have complicated networks that regulate metabolism and proteostasis, the present study has revealed the pivotal role of DBT as a master switch for protein quality control and cell survival under proteotoxic stress such as that induced by the proteasomal inhibition.</p><p>The newly recognized function of DBT in regulating proteotoxicity is further demonstrated through the protective effects of DBT deficiency in cellular and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of TDP-43 proteotoxicity. Together with the observations that DBT exhibits aberrant accumulation in ALS patients’ spinal cord tissues, these results suggest that DBT may modulate proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. Both DBT and BCAAs play important roles in metabolism important for physiology and diseases. Defective BCAA catabolism is associated with metabolic disorders, such as maple syrup urine disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holeček, 2018</xref>). Abnormal regulation of the levels and metabolism of BCAAs has been implicated in a variety of other human pathological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and liver diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dimou et al., 2022</xref>). The role of DBT as a critical regulator of protein quality control through metabolic and energetic controls under proteotoxic stress, as revealed in the present study, opens a new avenue for understanding the complex regulation of protein homeostasis in human health and pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA plasmids</title><p>The human DBT cDNA plasmid was obtained from the Ultimate ORF collection (Thermo Fisher).

Following centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris and other insoluble materials, the samples were transferred into a 96-well assay plate and mixed with the reaction buffer, and then the OD at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader (BioTek, Synergy H1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ATP/ADP measurement</title><p>The ATP/ADP ratio was analyzed using an ADP/ATP Ratio Assay Kit (MAK135, Sigma), which converts ATP and ADP into their respective intermediates and measures their concentrations in a bioluminescent assay. Cells were directly cultured in the assay microplate. Following overnight incubation, the culture medium in the assay microplate was replaced with the ATP reagent, and after an additional 1 min incubation, the ATP signal was measured on a plate reader (BioTek, Synergy H1). In the second step, ADP was converted into ATP through an enzyme reaction and its signal was then measured. The ATP/ADP ratio was calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse motor neuron differentiation</title><p>Mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, provided by Shelly E. Sakiyama-Elbert laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis and authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis, were cultured and differentiated into motor neurons as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCreedy et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 2×10<sup>6</sup> mES cells were cultured in suspension in 10 ml DFK5 medium for 2 days, followed by incubation in DFK5 medium containing 2 μM retinoic acid and 0.6 μM smoothened agonist for 4 days. Differentiating embryonic bodies were dissociated, plated into a laminin-coated 12-well plate (5×10<sup>5</sup>), and incubated in DFK5 medium with GDNF, BDNF, and NT-3 (5 ng/ml each) for 24 hr. After 24 hr, the medium was replaced with DFKNB medium supplemented with 1 X B27, GDNF, BDNF, and NT-3.</p><p>Before changing the medium, cells were infected with a lentivirus construct expressing DBT shRNAs for 6 hr in 4 μg/ml polybrene. After a 6 hr infection, the medium was replaced with DFKNB supplemented with 1 X B27, GDNF, BDNF, and NT-3 for 48 hr. After 48 hr, cells were infected with herpes simplex viruses expressing TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> or GFP in 4 μg/ml polybrene for 6 hr, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). After infection, motor neurons were incubated in a DFKNB medium supplemented with 1 X B27, GDNF, BDNF, and NT-3 for an additional 48 hr. On the last day, motor neurons were subjected to a cell survival assay using the Calcein AM method as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and assays</title><p>Flies were reared and crossed on standard yeast agar cornmeal medium at 25 °C.

The GMR-GAL4, hTDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>/TM3 fly strains were then crossed to RNAi transgenic strains. The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center or Vienna Stock Center: RNAi strains including Luc (y1 v1; P{TRiP.

They were transferred to freshly made food every 2–3 d. Flies were aged for 21 d, and their eye morphology was examined. Changes in pigmentation, ommatidial structure, and glossiness phenotypes were monitored for enhancement or suppression. The pigment content was detected at 488 nm and the background corrected at 600 nm using fly head protein extracts as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Periz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). For the generation of CRISPR knockout flies, DBT sgRNA flies were crossed with Cas9 flies, then the filial generation flies were analyzed with Sanger sequencing of the genomic locus targeted by the sgRNA. A homozygous mutation was confirmed, where a 1 bp deletion in exon 2 resulted in a premature stop codon in exon 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analyses were performed with Student’s t-tests for two-group comparisons and one-way ANOVA with the Tukey post hoc test for multiple group comparisons using the Graphpad Prism software.

I have two more suggestions:</p><p>(1) Since the authors found that MG132 inhibits autophagy, which is inconsistent with previous findings that it promotes autophagy (e.g., PMID: 26648402, 30647455, 28674081), they should discuss this discrepancy in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We agree with the reviewer that it has been well known in the literature that MG132 can lead to activation of autophagy. Indeed, we have observed in this study that MG132 itself can lead to time-dependent increases in LC3II levels in the first 8 hours of the MG132 treatment (Fig. S5B). These observations reflect the adaptive response of the cell to activate autophagy following proteasomal inhibition. However, as the MG132-mediated proteasomal inhibition persists, it is expected that the accumulation of misfolded protein substrates may overwhelm protein degradation systems, including the autophagylysosome pathway. Indeed, we have observed a reduction of the autophagic flux after 48 hours of the MG132 treatment (Fig. 3). Importantly, the DBT KO cells were able to maintain significantly higher levels of autophagic activities than the WT cells at this time point, consistent with their resistance to MG132-induced cell death. As suggested, we have added more discussion on the dynamic changes in the autophagic activities following proteasomal inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A grammar issue: consider removing some of the article &quot;the,&quot; e.g.:</p><p>page 6: &quot;the increase in cleaved PARP1 &quot;--&gt;&quot;an increase in cleaved PARP1&quot;; &quot;the loss of DBT &quot;--&gt;&quot;loss of DBT&quot;</p><p>page 7: &quot;the loss of DBT &quot;--&gt;&quot;loss of DBT&quot;; &quot;The ubiquitin modification&quot;--&gt;&quot;Ubiquitin modification&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments.
