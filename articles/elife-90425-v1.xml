regulated during this transition is unknown. In budding yeast, SBF and MBF transcription factors initiate the mitotic gene expression program. Here, we report two mechanisms that work together to restrict SBF activity during meiotic entry: repression of the SBF-specific Swi4 subunit through LUTI-based regulation and inhibition of SBF by Whi5, a functional homolog of the Rb tumor suppressor. We find that untimely SBF activation causes downregulation of early meiotic genes and delays meiotic entry. These defects are largely driven by the SBF-target G1 cyclins, which block the interaction between the central meiotic regulator Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6. Our study provides insight into the role of <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> in establishing the meiotic transcriptional program and demonstrates how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>LUTI</kwd><kwd>uORF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM140005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Astera Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Amanda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Investigation of how cells rewire their transcriptional programs during transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate reveals a two-pronged mechanism for inactivating a key mitotic transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key aspect in understanding developmental programs and cell state transitions is mapping the interplay between transcription factors and their associated gene regulatory networks. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the transition from mitotic growth to meiotic differentiation is a crucial decision that is regulated by multiple inputs, such as nutrient availability, respiration competence, and cell identity. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, a diploid cell enters the meiotic program to produce four haploid gametes. The process of meiotic entry is tightly controlled by the master transcriptional regulator Ime1, as both extrinsic (e.g. nutrient status, extracellular pH) and intrinsic (e.g. mating type, mitochondrial function) cues are integrated at the <italic>IME1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honigberg and Purnapatre, 2003</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). Once translated, Ime1 is phosphorylated by the Rim11 and Rim15 kinases to promote its nuclear localization and interaction with Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vidan and Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pnueli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malathi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malathi et al., 1997</xref>). In mitotically dividing cells, Ime1 target genes are repressed by Ume6 through its association with the Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kadosh and Struhl, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rundlett et al., 1998</xref>). However, under nutrient starvation, entry into the meiotic program is initiated by the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, which together function as a transcriptional activator, culminating in the induction of early meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowdish et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris and Ünal, 2023</xref>). Mitosis to meiosis transition requires dynamic remodeling of the gene regulatory networks to maintain the mutual exclusivity of these programs. While entry into the mitotic program is initiated by the central transcription factors SBF and MBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>), whether and how these complexes are regulated during meiotic entry is unknown.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms regulating entry into the mitotic cell cycle, also known as G1/S transition, are functionally conserved from yeast to metazoans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>). SBF and MBF are heterodimeric transcription factors composed of Swi4-Swi6 and Mbp1-Swi6 subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although there is no sequence homology, these transcription factors are functionally homologous to the mammalian E2Fs. E2Fs are negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor protein Rb, which is homologous to the budding yeast Whi5 that inhibits SBF in early G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasan et al., 2014</xref>). Whi5-based SBF inhibition is relieved by cyclin/CDK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent re-localization of Whi5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>). Although SBF and MBF act in parallel during the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>), they activate functionally specialized subsets of gene targets. SBF regulates the expression of genes involved in budding and cell morphogenesis, while MBF-regulated genes are involved in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simon et al., 2001</xref>). Despite the well-characterized function in budding yeast mitotic growth, the regulation and function of SBF and MBF during meiotic entry remains largely unknown. In contrast to mitotic divisions where budding and DNA replication occur simultaneously, the meiotic program requires DNA replication and repair, but not bud morphogenesis or asymmetric growth. Accordingly, the regulation and subsequent activity of SBF and MBF are likely to be divergent to establish meiotic entry.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Swi4 subunit of the SBF and SBF targets are downregulated during early meiosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of SBF and MBF complexes and the general functional groups of the genes they regulate.

For example, overexpression of a hyperactive allele of <italic>SWI4</italic> can trigger premature entry into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sidorova and Breeden, 2002</xref>). Additionally, <italic>SWI4</italic> has also been shown to be haploinsufficient and rate limiting during G1/S progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McInerny et al., 1997</xref>). These results suggest that the precise levels of SBF and MBF subunits are important for activating the G1/S regulon at the correct time.</p><p>Three key observations support differential regulation of SBF and MBF during the meiotic program: First, a meiotic mass spectrometry dataset suggests that Swi4 has dynamic protein behavior, which is not observed for its counterparts Swi6 and Mbp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Second, meiotic cells express a non-canonical mRNA from the <italic>SWI4</italic> locus called LUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>), which stands for Long Undecoded Transcript Isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). Third, two SBF-specific targets, namely the G1-cyclins <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, have been shown to repress early meiotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>LUTI-based gene regulation repurposes gene-activating transcription factors as repressors by a two-pronged mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tresenrider and Ünal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>). First, transcription factor-dependent activation of the LUTI promoter results in co-transcriptional silencing of the downstream canonical gene promoter. Second, the coding sequence (CDS) within the LUTI is translationally repressed due to competitive translation of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the LUTI-specific 5′ leader. Consequently, upregulation of the LUTI results in downregulation of the canonical mRNA and corresponding protein. While LUTIs are conserved from yeast to humans and have been identified in different cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hollerer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jorgensen et al., 2020</xref>), their biological significance remains poorly understood. In fact, only a single LUTI has been assigned a biological role so far with distinct phenotypic outcomes resulting from its loss or gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the differential regulation of SBF and MBF during the meiotic program and determine how the untimely activation of SBF impacts meiotic entry. We found that overexpression of Swi4 results in the activation of SBF targets and concomitant downregulation of the early meiotic genes. SBF targets Cln1 and Cln2 inhibit meiotic entry by blocking the interaction between Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6. Furthermore, the LUTI-based mechanism causes downregulation of Swi4 protein synthesis and acts in conjunction with Whi5 to restrict SBF activity during meiosis. Overall, our study reveals the functional role of a LUTI in establishing the early meiotic transcriptome, demonstrates how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity, and provides mechanistic insights into how SBF misregulation impedes transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Swi4 is the sole downregulated subunit within the SBF and MBF complexes during meiosis</title><p>While the SBF and MBF transcription factors have been heavily studied in the context of the mitotic cell cycle, their involvement in regulating the meiotic transcriptional program is not well understood. To understand the regulation and function of these complexes during meiosis, we first monitored the levels of SBF and MBF subunits throughout a meiotic time course. Cells were first grown in rich media overnight and were then transferred to pre-sporulation media. After additional overnight growth, cells were shifted to sporulation media (SPO) to induce meiosis, and samples were taken hourly for protein extraction and immunoblotting to monitor the abundance of each subunit. Unlike the mitotic G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kelliher et al., 2018</xref>), meiotic entry resulted in ~30% decrease in Swi4 levels after 2 hr, while Mbp1 and Swi6 levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). These data indicate that Swi4 is the sole subunit within SBF and MBF whose level declines during meiotic entry and are consistent with a published mass spectrometry dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the expression of a set of well-characterized transcripts that are regulated by SBF or MBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smolka et al., 2012</xref>) using a published meiotic RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis revealed that compared to mitotically dividing cells, most of the SBF-specific target genes had either low or no expression during early meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, most of the MBF targets displayed increased expression upon meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Based on our findings thus far, we propose that Swi4 levels are downregulated in meiosis to ensure that SBF targets, including <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, are turned off during meiotic entry. If so, then higher Swi4 levels should lead to increased expression of SBF targets. To test this possibility, we overexpressed <italic>SWI4</italic> by placing it under the regulation of the <italic>ATG8</italic> promoter (<italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic>), which is highly expressed in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). The steady-state level of <italic>pATG8</italic>-driven Swi4 was five times higher than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using reverse transcription coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we measured the transcript levels of well-characterized SBF targets and observed a significant increase in the expression of <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p=0.0351 [<italic>CLN1</italic>], p=0.0013 [<italic>CLN2</italic>], two-tailed t-test). In contrast, the MBF-specific targets <italic>CDC21</italic> and <italic>RNR1</italic> remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p=0.8488 [<italic>CDC21</italic>], p=0.0859 [<italic>RNR1</italic>], two-tailed t-test). These findings indicate that upregulation of <italic>SWI4</italic> is sufficient to induce the expression of SBF-specific targets <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> in meiosis without affecting MBF-specific targets.</p><p>To test whether the downregulation of <italic>SWI4</italic> is functionally important for meiotic progression, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and visualized the kinetics of meiotic divisions in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells relative to wild type.

To further investigate the relationship between these two transcription factors at a single-cell level, we generated strains carrying endogenous fluorescent protein tags for each transcription factor (<italic>GFP-IME1, SWI4-mCherry</italic>). Using DAPI as a nuclear marker, we measured the mean nuclear intensity of each transcription factor before (0 hr) and after meiotic entry (4 hr) (see Materials and methods for details on image quantification). In wild type, most cells exhibited decreased nuclear Swi4 and increased nuclear Ime1 upon meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Conversely, in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant, there was a significant shift in the fraction of cells with higher nuclear Swi4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney test,). Additionally, the cells with increased nuclear Swi4 had reduced levels of nuclear Ime1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). This inverse relationship between Swi4 and Ime1 nuclear localization further indicates that higher levels of Swi4 are antagonistic to Ime1 function.</p><p>Ime1 is necessary for the expression of early meiotic genes. Therefore, we next characterized the changes in the early meiotic transcriptome upon <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression by mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq). Using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref>), we identified differentially expressed genes in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant compared to wild type during meiotic entry (2 hr in SPO). To investigate general pathways being affected by increased Swi4 levels in meiosis, we ran gene ontology analysis of statistically significant (padj &lt;0.05) output from DESeq2, which revealed that the genes with significantly increased expression were involved in mitosis while those with significantly decreased expression were involved in meiotic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Regarding the SBF targets, we noticed increased expression of many genes, including <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We focused on a cluster of previously identified early meiotic genes involved in DNA replication and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brar et al., 2012</xref>) and observed that more than 50% had a significant decrease in their expression upon <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression (padj &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Finally, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to test whether expression of either the early meiotic gene set or SBF target gene set is enriched in wild type or <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). This gene set level analysis revealed significant enrichment of SBF target gene expression (NES=2.88, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), as well as significant disenrichment of early meiotic gene expression (NES=–2.88, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the increased levels of Swi4 during transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate abruptly activates SBF and disrupts the early meiotic transcriptome, highlighting the importance of <italic>SWI4</italic> regulation.</p><p>As an orthogonal approach, we performed live-cell imaging of Rec8, endogenously tagged with GFP (Rec8-GFP), which is a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit and a direct transcriptional target of Ime1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Primig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klein et al., 1999</xref>).

To assess meiotic entry, we performed fixed-cell imaging for GFP-Ime1 and found that when <italic>CLN2</italic> was overexpressed, only 5% of the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> cells displayed nuclear GFP-Ime1 signal during early meiosis as opposed to &gt;84% of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, 2 hr in SPO). In parallel, we measured <italic>IME1</italic> transcript and Ime1 protein levels. In both cases, we observed ~30% decrease in abundance in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data raise the possibility that the meiotic entry defect observed in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant arises from downregulation of <italic>IME1</italic> expression.</p><p>To test whether the increased levels of Ime1 can rescue the meiotic defect of <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant, we replaced the endogenous <italic>IME1</italic> promoter with a copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We adapted a previously well-characterized overexpression allele of <italic>IME1</italic>, <italic>pCUP1-IME1,</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>) and included a functional, N-terminal GFP tag to track Ime1’s subcellular localization (<italic>pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic>). Use of the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter was successful in elevating <italic>IME1</italic> transcript and protein levels in the presence of <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Despite the rescue of <italic>IME1</italic> expression, gamete formation was still severely perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using a single z-slice to measure mean nuclear intensity, we noticed that the intensity of the nuclear Ime1 signal was significantly lower in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2; pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic> cells compared to the <italic>pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). This finding indicates that rescue of <italic>IME1</italic> expression did not also rescue sporulation, further suggesting a defect in Ime1 nuclear localization. To test this possibility, we utilized a nanobody trap strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>) where we C-terminally fused a single-domain anti-GFP antibody to Pus1, a constitutively nuclear localized protein (<italic>PUS1-αGFP</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In this background, control strains carrying a <italic>GFP-IME1</italic> allele sporulated efficiently, demonstrating that tethering of Ime1 to Pus1 does not interfere with Ime1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, mean nuclear intensity of GFP-Ime1 was indistinguishable between <italic>PUS1-αGFP</italic> and <italic>pATG8-CLN2; PUS1-αGFP</italic>, indicating that nuclear localization was fully rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.6563 [<italic>PUS1-αGFP</italic> vs. <italic>pATG8-CLN2; PUS1-αGFP</italic>], Mann-Whitney test). Surprisingly, these cells still failed to undergo meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that G1 cyclins interfere with Ime1 function at an additional step beyond misregulating its expression and localization. Alternatively, G1 cyclins could disrupt a different meiotic factor in addition to Ime1.</p><p>To induce early meiotic genes, Ime1 must interact with another transcription factor called Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>). Since Ime1 itself does not possess a DNA-binding domain, its binding to Ume6 is essential for targeting Ime1 to early meiotic gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>). To address whether the G1 cyclins might disrupt the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, we fused the anti-GFP nanobody to Ume6 (<italic>UME6-αGFP</italic>) in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> strain carrying a GFP tagged Ime1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This nanobody trap should lead to constitutive tethering of Ime1 to Ume6, as evidenced by the rescue of Ime1 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K and L</xref>, p=0.035 [wild type vs. <italic>pATG8-CLN2 UME6-αGFP</italic>] Mann-Whitney test). Under these conditions, the sporulation defect of <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant was rescued, reaching similar levels to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since <italic>IME1</italic> is expressed from its endogenous promoter in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2; UME6-αGFP</italic> strain, these data suggest that overexpression of G1 cyclins results in meiotic failure due to reduced Ime1-Ume6 interaction.</p><p>Our findings thus far highlight the biological significance of restricting SBF activity during the transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate. Among the SBF targets, G1 cyclins pose a major block to meiotic entry by interfering with Ime1 function, critically at the level of Ime1-Ume6 interaction.

RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Two distinct probes were used: one, conjugated to Quasar 670 (Q670) and complementary to the <italic>SWI4</italic> coding sequence (CDS) and the other, conjugated to CAL Fluor Red 590 (CF590) and unique to the 5′ extended LUTI sequence. Accordingly, a spot where the two probe sets colocalized indicated a <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> transcript, whereas a spot marked with Q670 probe alone highlighted a <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcript. We used a well-established meiotic cell synchronization system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>) to investigate the precise temporal expression of these two mRNA isoforms. In comparison to premeiotic state, meiotic cells displayed a significant increase in <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> transcripts (p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) as well as a significant decrease in <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcripts (p=0.0007, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), thus confirming their inverse expression pattern.</p><p>To characterize the functional contribution of the LUTI to <italic>SWI4</italic> downregulation, we eliminated <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> production (<italic>∆LUTI</italic>) by deleting its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>) and used RNA blotting to visualize the <italic>SWI4</italic> mRNA isoforms. In wild-type cells, <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> was readily detectable after 1 hr in SPO, corresponding to early meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). During the time points when <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> was highly expressed, <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcript levels were lower, consistent with the smFISH data. In <italic>∆LUTI</italic> cells, we observed an increase in the abundance of <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This finding corroborates previous reports, where LUTI expression leads to co-transcriptional silencing of the canonical gene promoter, thereby silencing expression of the protein-coding transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wende et al., 2022</xref>).

However, after 1 hr of <italic>IME1</italic> induction, Swi4 levels started to decrease dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>). Therefore, reduction in Swi4 levels is dependent on Ime1 rather than being driven by nutrient deprivation in SPO, a condition that is known to trigger autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich and Klionsky, 2001</xref>).

In this case, even when the LUTI-based regulation fails, SBF would remain largely inactive due to a backup mechanism. In support of this notion and consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argüello-Miranda et al., 2018</xref>), the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was expressed during early meiosis (0 hr in SPO) and localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the mitotic G1 phase, Whi5 associates with promoter-bound SBF, thereby preventing the transcription of SBF target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>). Shortly before the G1/S transition, phosphorylation of Whi5 via the Cln3/CDK pathway activates SBF by promoting nuclear export of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>).

Without Cln3/CDK, Whi5 is expected to inhibit SBF in a constitutive manner.</p><p>To determine whether Whi5 and <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> act in parallel to restrict SBF activity, we removed Whi5 from the nucleus using the anchor-away method, which enables compartment-specific depletion of a target protein via inducible dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>). Whi5 was tagged with FRB and ribosomal protein Rpl13a was tagged with FKBP12. Upon addition of rapamycin, Rpl13a-FKBP12 and Whi5-FRB formed a heterodimer, leading to successful nuclear exclusion of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Using Whi5 anchor away (<italic>WHI5-AA</italic>) alone or in combination with removal of LUTI-based <italic>SWI4</italic> regulation (<italic>∆LUTI</italic>), we performed mRNA-seq to measure expression of SBF targets and early meiotic genes.

The dual inhibition of SBF converges on its unique subunit Swi4 and is important for proper transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate. Swi4 inhibition occurs through: (1) meiosis-specific expression of a LUTI from the <italic>SWI4</italic> locus, <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, which downregulates Swi4 protein levels, and (2) repression of Swi4 activity by Whi5, which occurs even when the LUTI-based regulation is disrupted. Conditions that lead to elevation of Swi4 levels at meiotic entry result in abrupt activation of the SBF and a concomitant decline in the expression of early meiotic genes, leading to meiotic progression delays. Additionally, we show that the SBF targets <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> are major drivers of the meiotic entry defect resulting from SBF misregulation. The <italic>CLN</italic>-dependent phenotypes can be largely rescued by tethering of the central meiotic regulator Ime1 to its cofactor Ume6, suggesting that the primary reason for meiotic failure caused by these G1 cyclins is due to a defect in Ime1-Ume6 interaction. Our findings reveal the functional role of a LUTI in establishing the meiotic transcriptional program, demonstrate how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity, and provide mechanistic insights into how SBF misregulation impedes transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rewiring of the G1/S regulon</title><p>It has long been known that entry into the mitotic cell cycle and meiotic differentiation are regulated differently. During the mitotic cell cycle, budding yeast cells must reach a critical size before commitment to division in late G1 phase, an event termed the ‘Start’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartwell et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnston et al., 1977</xref>). Start depends on the activation of the G1/S regulon by SBF and MBF, which regulate ~200 genes that function in polarized growth, macromolecular biosynthesis, DNA replication, and repair among other critical processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>). In contrast, entry into meiosis requires the transcriptional activator, Ime1, which is exclusively induced in diploid cells through the integration of several extrinsic cues including nitrogen levels, carbon source, and extracellular pH (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). Ime1 initiates the first transcriptional wave of early meiotic genes required for DNA replication, recombination, and chromosome morphogenesis. Before our study, it was unclear whether and how SBF-MBF activity is regulated during the transition from mitosis to meiosis, despite the transcriptome-wide differences between these two developmental programs. We found that during meiotic entry, the SBF-specific Swi4 subunit is downregulated, which indicates that the activity of SBF, but not MBF, is constrained. Consistently, SBF-specific targets display either low or no expression during early meiosis, while MBF targets are upregulated upon meiotic entry. MBF targets are involved in processes shared between mitosis and meiosis including DNA replication and repair, whereas SBF targets are predominantly involved in processes unique to mitosis such as budding and cell wall biosynthesis. This functional specialization might have enabled adaptations to accommodate specific cell fates. Likewise, SBF-specific targets that are detrimental to meiosis, such as the G1 cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>, and this study), might contribute to the mutually exclusive nature of the mitotic and meiotic programs.</p><p>Absolute measurements of the concentrations of SBF and MBF in single cells during mitotic G1 demonstrated that these transcription factors are sub-saturating with respect to their target promoters in small cells, but that SBF and MBF levels increase as cells grow, suggesting that their abundance is a limiting factor in activating the G1/S regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorsey et al., 2018</xref>). Corroborating these findings, we show that overexpression of <italic>SWI4</italic> as well as the simultaneous disruption of the two pathways that normally restrict SBF activity at meiotic entry – namely LUTI and Whi5 – result in abrupt activation of the SBF regulon and a concomitant decrease in early meiotic gene expression. However, MBF targets do not seem to be affected in response to increased SBF activity. This is surprising given that SBF and MBF share a common subunit, Swi6, and that an upsurge in Swi4 abundance might be expected to titrate Swi6 away from MBF. It is possible that meiosis-specific regulators like Ime1 and Ime2 compensate to maintain MBF target expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brush et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies are necessary to dissect the meiotic roles of MBF and potential compensatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibition of G1 cyclins during meiotic entry and vice versa</title><p>We found that the meiotic entry delay due to untimely SBF activation can be partially rescued by loss of either <italic>CLN1</italic> or <italic>CLN2</italic>, demonstrating that both cyclins are responsible for the meiotic defects associated with SBF misregulation.

Therefore, it is crucial to dissect the mechanisms that govern the downregulation of G1 cyclins during this process. Among the G1 cyclins that are known to inhibit meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>), only the mechanism of <italic>CLN3</italic> restriction was previously known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parviz and Heideman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallego et al., 1997</xref>).

Whether additional mechanisms play a role in restricting SBF and/or <italic>CLN1-CLN2</italic> remains to be determined.</p><p>Our findings also shed light on the mechanism by which G1 cyclins prevent meiotic entry. Previous work demonstrated that G1 cyclin overexpression leads to downregulation of <italic>IME1</italic> expression and inhibition of Ime1 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>). Even though we observed similar defects in <italic>IME1</italic> in response to <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression, increasing <italic>IME1</italic> expression or targeting Ime1 to the nucleus did not result in successful meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, we found that restoring the interaction between Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6 was sufficient to bypass the meiotic blockage exerted by Cln/CDK. Collectively, our analyses suggest that the primary reason why G1 cyclins cause a meiotic failure is due to a deficiency in Ime1-Ume6 interaction. A previous study reported that G1 cyclins do not affect the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>). However, this conclusion was based on the use of a truncated Ime1 protein that only contained the Ume6 interaction domain. Therefore, CLN-dependent regulations on full-length Ime1 might be missed in this context.</p><p>Future work could be aimed at dissecting how G1 cyclins affect the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 and whether their impact on Ime1’s subcellular localization is primarily due to G1 cyclin-dependent changes in Ime1-Ume6 interaction. Since there are no CDK consensus phosphorylation sites on Ime1 itself, other players are likely to be involved. Rim11 and Rim15 are potential candidates since these two kinases have been implicated in Ime1-Ume6 phosphorylation as well as regulation of Ime1 localization and its interaction with Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vidan and Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowdish et al., 1994</xref>).

Second, premature activation of SBF through <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression or simultaneous disruption of <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> and Whi5 pathways results in a significant delay in the chromosomal localization of Rec8, a direct transcriptional target of Ime1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>).

Third, <italic>IME1</italic> is inhibited by the G1 cyclins, which are themselves targets of Swi4/SBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The antagonistic relationship between Swi4 and Ime1 is further evidenced by their mutually exclusive pattern of nuclear localization at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

We found that the LUTI-based mechanism works together with the Whi5 pathway to inhibit SBF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As a result, only when both mechanisms are simultaneously disrupted, do cells exhibit abrupt activation of SBF targets and subsequent meiotic entry defects. This two-pronged inhibition of SBF activity is reminiscent of how meiotic cells prevent microtubule-kinetochore interactions during prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, LUTI-based regulation represses the expression of a limiting outer kinetochore subunit, Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Even when the outer kinetochore assembles upon disruption of <italic>NDC80<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, microtubules are still unable to engage with the kinetochores due to restriction of Clb/CDK activity. The loss of both regulations results in meiotic chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Integrating LUTI-based repression into larger regulatory networks likely ensures robustness in cellular decision-making, providing a fail-safe system. However, combinatorial use of the LUTI-based mechanism with other regulatory pathways poses a challenge to uncover their functional importance. Despite 8% of the yeast genes being subject to LUTI-based regulation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), the biological significance of only two LUTIs, <italic>NDC80<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> and <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, have been uncovered thus far. Therefore, systematic studies aiming to dissect the biological roles of LUTIs in meiosis and beyond would benefit from simultaneous perturbation approaches, including synthetic genetic interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Cell state changes are primarily governed by transcription factors. Our study highlights how transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate is ensured by inhibition of the SBF transcription factor through two distinct mechanisms. The SBF regulon includes G1 cyclins, whose untimely expression blocks meiotic entry by disrupting the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, a key transcriptional co-activator of meiosis. SBF and Ime1-Ume6 antagonize each other, thereby helping establish a mutually exclusive state between the mitotic and meiotic transcriptional programs. Mammalian cells have functional homologs to both sets of transcription factors. First, similar to Ume6, MEIOSIN binds to the promoters of early meiotic genes and recruits Ime1-like STRA8 to activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kojima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishiguro et al., 2020</xref>). Second, SBF and MBF counterparts in mammalian cells are known as E2Fs, nine of which control the G1/S transition (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>). Each E2F regulates a distinct sets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaubatz et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, some members of the E2F family are involved in tissue-specific regulation of cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Julian et al., 2016</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms driving the rewiring of these complex gene networks are not well understood. Our investigation could help shed light on the regulatory mechanisms governing the interplay between mitotic and meiotic transcription factors outside of yeast.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

In this study, the authors analyzed the genetic link between the mitotic cell cycle regulator SBF (the Swi4-Swi6 complex) and a meiosis inducing regulator Ime1 in the context of meiotic initiation. The authors' comprehensive analyses with cytology, imaging, RNA-seq using mutant strains lead to the conclusion that Swi4 levels regulates Ime1-Ume6 interaction to activate expression of early meiosis genes for meiotic initiation.</p><p>The authors first show a down regulation of Swi4 at the protein level upon meiosis entry and then investigate downstream consequences. This study reveals several regulations: (1) Mutations in CLN1 and 2, which are targets of Swi4, allow rescuing the delay in meiotic entry observed when Swi4 is overexpressed; (2) Ime1 activity is antigonized by Swi4, and more specifically its interaction with Ume6. (3) Expression of SWI4 is regulated by LUTI-based transcription at the SWI4 locus that impedes expression of canonical SWI4 transcripts (4) The expression of SWI4 LUTI is likely negatively regulated by the Ime1-Ume6 complex (5) Whi5 restrict SBF activity during meiotic entry, thereby ensuring Cyclin repression.</p><p>The important implication in this paper is that meiotic initiation is regulated by the balance of mitotic cell cycle regulator and meiosis-specific transcription factor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90425.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ünal</surname><given-names>Elçin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Amanda J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yendluri</surname><given-names>Siri C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berkeley</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Su et al propose the existence of two mechanisms repressing SBF activity during entry into meiosis in budding yeast. First, a decrease in Swi4 protein levels by a LUTI-dependent mechanism where Ime1 would act closing a negative feedback loop. Second, the sustained presence of Whi5 would contribute to maintaining SBF inhibited under sporulation conditions. The article is clearly written and the experimental approaches used are adequate to the aims of this work. The results obtained are in line with the conclusions reached by the authors but, in my view, they could also be explained by the existing literature and, hence, would not represent a major advance in the field of meiosis regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer about their comment that this work can be explained by the existing literature. First, while SWI4LUTI has been previously identified in meiotic cells along with ~ 380 LUTIs, the biological purpose of these alternative mRNA isoforms and their effect on cellular physiology still remain largely unknown. Our manuscript clarifies this gap in understanding for SWI4LUTI. Loss of SWI4LUTI contributes to dysregulation of meiotic entry and does so by failing to properly repress the known inhibitors of meiotic entry, the CLNs. Furthermore, even though Cln1 and Cln2 have been previously shown to antagonize meiosis, the mechanisms that restrict their activity was unclear prior to our study.</p><p>We recognize work done by others demonstrating Whi5-dependent repression of SBF during mitotic G1/S transition (De Bruin et al., 2004; Costanzo et al., 2004). We further examined Whi5’s involvement during meiotic entry and found that it acts in conjunction with the LUTI-based mechanism to restrict SBF activity. Combined loss of both mechanisms results in the increased expression of G1 cyclins, decreased expression of early meiotic genes, and a delay in meiotic entry (Figure 6). Neither mechanism was previously known to regulate meiotic entry. Our study not only adds to our broader understanding of gene regulation during meiosis but also raises additional questions regarding how LUTIs regulate gene expression and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the first mechanism, Fig 1 shows that Swi4 decreases very little after 1-2h in sporulation medium, whereas G1-cyclin expression is strongly repressed very rapidly under these conditions (panel D and work by others).

This is consistent with the range of protein level decrease typically accomplished by LUTI-based gene regulation (Chen et al., 2017; Chia et al., 2017; Tresenrider et al., 2021), and while it is a modest reduction, it is consistent across replicates. Furthermore, we don’t make the argument that reduction in Swi4 levels alone is the sole regulator of G1 cyclin levels. In fact, we report that in addition to Swi4 downregulation, Whi5 also functions to restrict SBF activity during meiotic entry, thereby ensuring G1 cyclin repression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the LUTI-deficient SWI4 mutant does not cause any noticeable relief in CLN2 repression, arguing against the relevance of this mechanism in the repression of G1-cyclin transcription during entry into meiosis.

On the other hand, the double WHI5-AA SWI4-dLUTI mutant does not upregulate CLN2, the G1 cyclin with the strongest negative effect on sporulation, raising serious doubts on the functional relevance of this backup mechanism during entry into meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to replicate variance, CLN2 did not make the cut by our mRNA-seq data analysis as a significant hit.

In this study, the authors addressed a genetic link between mitotic cell cycle regulator SBF (the Swi4-Swi6 complex) and a meiosis inducing regulator Ime1 in the context of meiotic initiation. The authors' comprehensive analyses with cytology, imaging, RNA-seq using mutant strains lead the authors to conclude that Swi4 levels regulates Ime1-Ume6 interaction to activate expression of early meiosis genes for meiotic initiation. The major findings in this paper are that (1) the higher level of Swi4, a subunit of SBF transcription factor for mitotic cell cycle regulation, is the limiting factor for mitosis-to-meiosis transition; (2) G1 cyclins (Cln1, Cln2), that are expressed under SBF, inhibit Ime1-Ume6 interaction under overexpression of SWI4, which consequently leads to downregulation of early meiosis genes; (3) expression of SWI4 is regulated by LUTI-based transcription in the SWI4 locus that impedes expression of canonical SWI4 transcripts; (4) expression of SWI4 LUTI is likely negatively regulated by Ime1; (5) Action of Swi4 is negatively regulated by Whi5 (homologous to Rb)-mediated inhibition of SBF, which is required for meiotic initiation. Thus, the authors proposed that meiotic initiation is regulated under the balance of mitotic cell cycle regulator SBF and meiosis-specific transcription factor Ime1.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The most significant implication in their paper is that meiotic initiation is regulated under the balance of mitotic cell cycle regulator and meiosis-specific transcription factor. This finding will provide a mechanistic insight in initiation of meiosis not only into the budding yeast also into mammals. The manuscript is overall well written, logically presented and raises several insights into meiotic initiation in budding yeast. Therefore, the manuscript should be open for the field. I would like to raise the following concerns, though they are not mandatory to address. However, it would strengthen their claims if the authors could technically address and revise the manuscript by putting more comprehensive discussion.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors showed that increased expression of the SBF targets, and reciprocal decrease in expression of meiotic genes upon SWI4 overexpression at 2 h in SPO (Figure 2F). However, IME1 was not found as a DEG in Supplemental Table 1. Meanwhile, IME1 transcript level was decreased at 2 h SPO condition in pATG8-CLN2 cells in Fig S4C.</p><p>Now this reviewer still wonders with confusion whether expression of IME1 transcripts per se is directly or in directly suppressed under SBF-activated gene expression program at 2 h SPO in pATG8-SWI4 and pATG8-CLN2 cells. This reviewer wonders how Fig S4C data reconciles with the model summarized in Fig 6F.</p><p>One interpretation could be that persistent overexpression of G1 cyclin caused active mitotic cell cycle, and consequently delayed exit from mitotic cell cycle, which may have given rise to an apparent reduction of cell population that was expressing IME1. For readers to better understand, it would be better to explain comprehensively this issue in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there was an oversight here. In supplemental table 1, IME1 expression is reported as significantly decreased.

Is the Ime1 protein level comparable or different between pATG8-CLN2 strain and pATG8-SWI4 strain? Since it is difficult to compare the quantifications of Ime1 levels in Fig S1D and Fig S4B, it would be better to comparably show the Ime1 protein levels in pATG8-CLN2 and pATG8-SWI4 strains.</p><p>Further, it is uncertain how pATG8-CLN2 cells mimics the phenotype of pATG8-SWI4 cells in terms of meiotic entry.

This data is convincing. However, the authors also showed that GFP-Ime1 protein level was decreased compared to WT in pATG8-CLN2 cells by WB (Fig S4A).</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to wild type, pATG8-CLN2 cells have lower levels of Ime1. Consequently, reviewer 2 suggests that this reduction may be responsible for the observed meiotic defect. However, we tested this possibility and found it not to be the primary cause of the meiotic defect in pATG8-CLN2 cells. As shown in Figure S4A, when IME1 was overexpressed from the pCUP1 promoter, Ime1 protein levels were similar between wild-type and pATG8-CLN2 cells. Despite this similarity, we still observed a decrease in nuclear Ime1 (Figure 4F) and no rescue in sporulation (Figure 4A). Therefore, the reduction in Ime1 protein levels alone cannot explain the meiotic defect caused by CLN2 overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, GFP-Ime1 signals were overall undetectable through nuclei and cytosol in pATG8-CLN2 cells (Fig 4B), and accordingly cells with nuclear Ime1 were reduced (Fig 4C). Although the authors raised a possibility that the meiotic entry defect in the pATG8-CLN2 mutant arises from downregulation of IME1 expression (Line 282-283), causal relationship between meiotic entry defect and CLN2 overexpression is still not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer 2 comments, we initially considered the possibility that meiotic entry defect induced by CLN2 overexpression could be attributed to decreased IME1 expression. However, in the following paragraph in the manuscript, we demonstrate equalizing IME1 transcript levels using the pCUP1-IME1 allele does not rescue the meiotic defect caused by CLN2 overexpression. Consequently, we conclude that the decrease in IME1 transcript levels alone cannot explain the meiotic defect caused by increased CLN2 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the Ime1 protein level reduced in the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain compared to WT? It would be better to comparably show the Ime1 protein levels in the pATG8-CLN2 strain and the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain by WB. Also, it would be nice if the authors could show quantification of the % of cells that enter meiosis in the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain to see how and whether artificial tethering of Ime1 to Ume6 rescued normal meiosis program rather than simply showing % sporulation in Fig4A.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree with the suggestion to compare the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP with wild type as the kinetics of meiosis is rather different. The more appropriate comparison is UME6-⍺GFP and pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP which shows GFP-Ime1 bulk protein levels are slightly lower (Author response image 5). However, when we use a more sensitive measurement of meiotic entry through the nuclear accumulation of Ime1 in single cells, as illustrated in Figure 4L, it becomes evident that the Ume6-Ime1 tether is capable of restoring nuclear Ime1 levels, even in the presence of CLN2 overexpression. Given that these cells exhibited wild type levels of nuclear Ime1 and underwent sporulation after 24 hours, we make the fair assumption that they have successfully initiated the meiotic program.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Wild type (UB22199), pATG8-SWI4 (UB35106), UME6-⍺GFP (UB35300), and UME6-⍺GFP; pATG8-CLN2 (UB35177) cells collected between 0-3 hours (h) in sporulation medium (SPO) and immunoblots were performed using α-GFP.</title><p>Hxk2 was used a loading control</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90425-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed Ume6 binding at the SWI4LUTI promoter (Figure 5K). However, since Ume6 forms a repressive form with Rpd3 and Sin3a and binds to target genes independently of Ime1, Ume6 binding at the SWI4LUTI promoter bind does not necessarily represent Ime1-Ume6 binding there. Instead, it would be better to show Ime1 ChIP-seq at the SWI4LUTI promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that Ime1 ChIP would be the ideal measurement. Unfortunately, this has proved to be technically challenging. To address this limitation, we utilized a published Ume6 ChIP-seq dataset along with a published UME6-T99N RNA-seq dataset. Cells carrying the UME6-T99N allele are unable to induce the expression of early meiotic transcripts due to lack of Ime1 binding to Ume6 (Bowdish et al., 1995). Accordingly, RNA-seq analysis should reveal whether or not the LUTIs identified by Ume6 ChIP are indeed regulated by Ime1-Ume6 during meiosis. For SWI4LUTI, this is exactly what we observe. Not only is there Ume6 binding at the SWI4LUTI promoter (Figure 5K), but there is also a significant decrease in SWI4LUTI expression in UME6-T99N cells under meiotic conditions (Figure S5). Based on these data, we conclude that the Ime1-Ume6 complex is responsible for regulating SWI4LUTI expression during meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors showed ∆LUTI mutant and WHI5-AA mutant did not significantly change the expression of SBF targets nor early meiotic genes relative to wildtype (Figure 6A, C). Accordingly, they concluded that LUTI- or Whi5-based repression of SBF alone was not sufficient to cause a delay in meiotic entry (Line451-452), and perturbation of both pathways led to a significant delay in meiotic entry (Figure 6E). This reviewer wonders whether Ime1 expression level and nuclear localization of Ime1 was normal in ∆LUTI mutant and WHI5-AA mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our observations in Figure 4, Ime1 protein and expression levels were not reliable indicators of meiotic entry. Consequently, we opted for a more downstream and functionally relevant measure of meiotic entry, which involved time-lapse fluorescence imaging of Rec8, an Ime1 target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors would like to mention previous work showing that G1-cyclin overexpression decreases the expression and nuclear accumulation of Ime1 (Colomina et al 1999 EMBO J 18:320). In this work, the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 had been found to be resistant to G1-cyclin expression, arguing against a direct effect on the recruitment of Ime1 at meiotic promoters. Alternatively, differences in the experimental approaches used could be discussed to explain this apparent discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, in the paper that reviewer 1 is referring to (Colomina et al., 1999), the authors determine that the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 is regulated by the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source. Additional work by others reveals that Ime1 undergoes phosphorylation by the protein kinases Rim11 and Rim15, promoting its nuclear localization and enabling interaction with Ume6 (Vidan and Mitchell, 1997; Pnueli et al., 2004; Malathi et al., 1999, 1997). Furthermore, both Rim11 and Rim15 kinase activities are inhibited by the presence of glucose via the PKA pathway (Pedruzzi et al., 2003; Rubin-Bejerano et al., 2004; Vidan and Mitchell, 1997). Accordingly, the elimination of cyclins in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source (glucose) in (Colomina et al., 1999) is unlikely to result in an interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, as Rim11 and Rim15 remain repressed. Removal of cyclins in acetate does not further increase Ime1-Ume6 interaction leading the authors to conclude that G1 cyclins do not block Ime1 function through its interaction with Ume6. This work however uses loss of function (removal of G1 cyclins) to study the G1 cyclins’ effect on Ime1-Ume6 interaction while using timepoints that are well beyond meiotic entry. Additionally, Ime1-Ume6 interaction is being tested using yeast-two hybrid analysis with just the proposed interaction domain of Ime1 (amino acids 270-360). Therefore, the interpretation that G1 cyclins are dispensable for regulating the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 is unclear from this work alone.</p><p>There are many differences that can explain the discrepancy between our work and (Colomina et al., 1999). Our work uses increased expression of cyclins during meiotic entry. Additionally, in our study, we collected timepoints to measure meiotic entry (2 h in SPO) and sporulation (gamete formation) efficiency (24 h in SPO). Finally, we are using the endogenous, full length Ime1. These differences could very well explain the discrepancy with previous work. Lastly, in our discussion we acknowledge the lack of CDK consensus phosphorylation sites on Ime1. Therefore, it is most likely that G1 cyclins are not directly phosphorylating Ime1 and that other factors like Rim11 and Rim15 could be direct targets of the G1 cyclins, considering their involvement in the phosphorylation of Ime1-Ume6, as well as their role in regulating Ime1 localization and its interaction with Ume6. We have included these points in the revised manuscript (lines 547-551).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This reviewer thinks that the findings in this paper are of general interest to meiosis field and help understanding the mechanism of meiotic initiation in mammals. The way of the current manuscript seems to be written for limited budding yeast scientists, and should not limited to the interest by the budding yeast scientists. Thus, it would be better to discuss more about what is known about the mechanism of initiation of meiosis not only in budding yeast but also in other species to share their finding to more broad scientists using other organisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer 2’s comment and have added more discussion about the parallels between yeast and mammalian systems in meiotic initiation (lines 613-624).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The effect of overexpression of Swi4 is tested for MI and MII (Fig1F): this is a very indirect readout of meiotic entry. The authors could present Rec8 localization (Fig2I) at this stage. However, this is still a superficial description of the meiotic phenotype: is the phenotype only a delay or is the meiotic prophase altered. It is specifically important to analyse this in more detail to answer whether the overexpression of Swi4 leads to an identical phenotype to the one of CLN2. Also the comparison between overexpression of Swi4 and Cln2 is difficult to evaluate: what is the level of CLN2 when SwI4 is overexpressed compared to CLN2 overexpression. The percentage of nuclear Ime1 is 50% vs 5% when Swi4 or Cln2 are overexpressed. What is the interpretation? What are the levels of Ime1?

The key experiment that establishes causality between SWI4 and CLNs is reported in Figure 3, where deletion of either CLN1 or CLN2 rescues the meiotic entry delay exerted by SWI4 overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig3EF: What is the phenotype of Cln1 and Cln2 without overexpression of Swi4?</p></disp-quote><p>Meiotic entry is not faster in cln1∆ or cln2∆ cells compared to wild-type.

It would be a misleading comparison since the two meiosis would have different kinetics. Figure 4F reports that despite similar IME1 transcript levels and Ime1 protein levels, CLN2 overexpressing cells still have reduced nuclear Ime1. Since side-by-side comparison of pATG8-CLN2 and pCUP1-IME1 is not possible, we chose to measure sporulation efficiency at 24 h in Figure 4A. These data together suggest that elevated IME1 transcript and protein levels cannot rescue the defects associated with increased CLN2 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig5E: in wild type, by Northern blot, Swi4canon level is increasing during meiosis, not decreasing?, whereas protein level is decreasing, what is the interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>Northern data is less quantitative than smFISH, which show that SWI4canon transcript levels are significantly lower in meiosis compared to vegetative cells (Figure 5D).

Finally, additional analysis of a transcript leader sequencing (TL-seq) dataset from synchronized cells (Tresenrider et al., 2021) further confirms the decrease in SWI4canon transcript levels upon meiotic entry.
