However, the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we identified a loss-of-function mutation in the novel gene IQ motif-containing H (<italic>IQCH</italic>) in a Chinese family with male infertility characterized by a cracked flagellar axoneme and abnormal mitochondrial structure. To verify the function of IQCH, <italic>Iqch</italic> knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 technology. As expected, the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO male mice exhibited impaired fertility, which was related to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structures of the axoneme and mitochondria, mirroring the patient phenotypes. Mechanistically, IQCH can bind to CaM and subsequently regulate the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB), which are indispensable for spermatogenesis. Overall, this study revealed the function of IQCH, expanded the role of IQ motif-containing proteins in reproductive processes, and provided important guidance for genetic counseling and genetic diagnosis of male infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IQCH</kwd><kwd>CaM</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>male infertility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0802101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Suren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IQCH is required for acrosome and axoneme development during spermatogenesis in humans and mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is one of the most complex biological processes in male organisms and functions to produce mature spermatozoa from spermatogonia in three phases: (i) mitosis, (ii) meiosis, and (iii) spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hess and Renato de Franca, 2008</xref>). This delicate process can be easily disturbed and further cause male reproductive disorders. Male infertility affects 7% of men in the general population, and its causes vary and include anatomical or genetic abnormalities, systemic diseases, infections, trauma, iatrogenic injury, and gonadotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krausz et al., 2018a</xref>). Approximately 10% of the human genome is related to reproductive processes; thus, male infertility is often predicted to be largely genetic in origin, whereas only 4% of infertile men are diagnosed with a distinct genetic cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla, 2018b</xref>). Genetic causes are highly heterogeneous and involve chromosomal abnormalities, point mutations in single genes, copy number variations, microRNA dysfunction, and polygenic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meschede and Horst, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Traven et al., 2017</xref>). The highest percentage of known genetic factors that account for up to 25% of male infertility are karyotype anomalies, Y chromosome microdeletions, and <italic>CFTR</italic> mutations, which are mostly associated with azoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla, 2018b</xref>). However, in a relatively high proportion of infertile men (40%), the etiology cannot be recognized and is also referred to as idiopathic. With the help of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), some men have the chance to reproduce; however, there is a risk of passing on undetermined genetic abnormalities. In addition, genetic defects leading to fertilization failure and embryo development arrest cannot be effectively rescued by ART; thus, discovering novel genetic factors and further confirming their molecular mechanisms are of clinical importance.</p><p>CaM is defined as a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that activates many kinds of enzymes in response to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through interactions with a diverse group of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klee et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Means et al., 1982</xref>). CaM has a completely conserved amino acid sequence across all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, in the human genome, there are three independent CaM genes (<italic>CALM1-3</italic>), while in the mouse genome, there are five CaM genes (<italic>Calm1-5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=calm+mouse">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=calm+mouse</ext-link>). Previous studies have reported that CaM is extraordinarily abundant in the mammalian testis and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smoake et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kakiuchi et al., 1982</xref>). Moreover, CaM is predominantly expressed in the mammalian testis, from the pachytene to meiotic division stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smoake et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kakiuchi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamamoto, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sano et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kägi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moriya et al., 1995</xref>). CaM binds to proteins through recognition motifs, including the short CaM-binding motif containing conserved Ile and Gln residues (IQ motif) for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nie et al., 2009</xref>). The identified IQ motif-containing proteins included a good range of proteins with biological functions, one of which is a sperm surface protein, suggesting that IQ motif-containing proteins might play a potential role in male reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dolmetsch et al., 2001</xref>). Currently, 15 IQ motif-containing proteins have been identified in humans, namely, IQCA1, IQCB1, IQCC, IQCD, IQCE, IQCF1, IQCF2, IQCF5, IQCF6, IQCG, IQCH, IQCJ, IQCK, IQCM, and IQCN. With the exception of IQCF2, mice possess a similar set of IQ proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IQCF2">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=IQCF2</ext-link>). Notably, IQCF4 is present in mice but absent in humans. However, among these IQ motif-containing proteins, only a few have been reported to be responsible for male fertility. It has been shown that the IQ motif-containing D (IQCD) primarily accumulates in the acrosome area of spermatids during mouse spermiogenesis, and the acrosome reaction is inhibited in human spermatozoa by the anti-IQCD antibody, suggesting a potential function of IQCD in fertilization and the acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Iqcf1</italic> KO male mice showed signiﬁcantly less fertility, which was related to reduced sperm motility and acrosome reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Iqcg</italic> is required for mouse spermiogenesis, which is attributable to its role in ﬂagellar formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). Humans and mice without IQCN presented failed fertilization rates related to manchette assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). Although reliable findings provide substantial insight into IQ motif-containing proteins that participate in male reproductive processes, the relevant regulatory mechanism and the function of many other IQ motif-containing proteins in spermatogenesis have not been determined thus far.</p><p>Here, we revealed a testis-specific IQ motif containing the H gene, <italic>IQCH</italic>, which is essential for spermiogenesis and fertilization. Disruption of IQCH leads to deficient acrosome activity and abnormal structure of the axoneme and mitochondria in both humans and mice. Moreover, it is suggested that the interaction of IQCH with CaM is a prerequisite for IQCH function, which further regulates the expression of RNA-binding proteins (especially HNRPAB) during spermatogenesis. Collectively, our findings unveiled a novel genetic diagnostic indicator of male infertility, and the uncovered mechanism of IQCH in spermatogenesis might shed new light on the treatment of this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a novel homozygous variant of <italic>IQCH</italic> involved in male infertility</title><p>A 33-year-old man from a consanguineous family with primary infertility for four years was recruited for our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Semen analysis of this patient revealed inordinate decreases in sperm motility and count, as well as abnormal sperm morphology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to the proband, his great uncle was also affected, and he had never conceived during sexual intercourse without contraception in his marriage. We further explored the possible genetic cause through whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis, and a homozygous deletion variant in <italic>IQCH</italic> (c.387+1_387+10 del, NM_0010317152) was identified in the proband. This variant is rare in the general human population according to the 1000 Genomes Project (0.007%), ExAC Browser (0.059%), and gnomAD databases (0.024%). We further clarified the putative contribution of this variant in this family by Sanger sequencing. Noticeably, this homozygous variant was confirmed in his infertile great uncle, and the fertile parents of the proband carried the heterozygote of this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of a homozygous splicing mutation in IQ motif-containing H (<italic>IQCH</italic>) in a consanguineous family with male infertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pedigree analysis of the consanguineous family with two infertile males (II-1 and IV-1), with the black arrow pointing to the proband.

The electrophoresis results revealed that wild-type <italic>IQCH</italic> (WT-<italic>IQCH</italic>) yielded one transcript with a size of 381  bp, whereas the mutant <italic>IQCH</italic> (Mut-<italic>IQCH</italic>) resulted in one strong band of 263  bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and i</xref>). Sanger sequencing further showed that the variant resulted in the absence of the whole exon 4, which was expected to translate into a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, ii and iii</xref>). Therefore, we constructed a plasmid containing the aberrant cDNA sequence of <italic>IQCH</italic> caused by the splicing mutation to verify the effect of the variant on protein expression. The western blotting results showed that the Mut-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did not express IQCH, while the WT-c<italic>IQCH</italic> plasmid did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, iv</xref>). We further conducted immunofluorescence staining of spermatozoa from the proband and the control.

As an RBP, HNRPAB has been suggested to play an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating the translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukuda et al., 2013</xref>).

As a novel CaM-binding protein, IQCH was first identified in human and mouse testes and exclusively localized in spermatocytes and spermatids, suggesting its potential activity in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yin et al., 2005</xref>). However, since IQCH was identified, no other findings have supported its function in male reproduction. In this study, we found that the <italic>IQCH</italic> mutation impaired male fertility, as indicated by flagellar morphological abnormalities and axoneme cracking. An aberrant ultrastructure in sperm with the <italic>IQCH</italic> mutation was associated with severe defects in acrosomes and mitochondria. Furthermore, <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice exhibited similar irregularities in the flagellum, especially the axoneme and mitochondria. We also found that <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice exhibited different degrees of functional defects in acrosomes. Thus, our work supported the vital role of IQCH in flagellar and acrosome development.</p><p>To date, only four IQ motif-containing proteins, IQCD, IQCF1, IQCG, and IQCN, have been suggested to participate in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). Most IQ motif-containing proteins function in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent biological processes by binding to CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2015</xref>); thus, IQCD, IQCF1, and IQCN are involved in fertilization and are relevant to the acrosome reaction, sperm capacitation, or manchette assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, because CaM has an impact on the actin cytoskeleton, <italic>Iqcg</italic> KO mice exhibit detachment of sperm heads from tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice also showed an impaired acrosome reaction, which caused reduced fertilization. Intriguingly, axoneme breaks at the annulus and mitochondrial defects were prominent in the flagella of the <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice, whose phenotypes were unexplored in the previously discovered IQ motif-containing proteins. Because CaM activation can stimulate changes in the actin cytoskeleton, it is reasonable that ﬂagellum formation is defective when IQCH is absent. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key player in the regulation of mitochondrial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bravo-Sagua et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the absence of IQCH leads to a failure of interaction with CaM and disruption of normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which consequently causes mitochondrial defects in <italic>Iqch</italic> KO mice and patients with <italic>IQCH</italic> variants. Our findings suggested that fertilization is the main action of IQ motif-containing proteins, and each specific IQ motif-containing protein also has its own distinct role in spermatogenesis.</p><p>However, there are few publications regarding the underlying mechanism by which IQ motif-containing proteins manipulate reproductive processes, except for a recent study showing that IQCN interacts with CaM to regulate the expression of CaM-binding proteins, including manchette-related proteins (LZTFL1, KIF27, and RSPH6A), IFT family proteins and their motor proteins (IFT22, IFT43, IFT74, IFT81, IFT140, IFT172, WDR19, TTC21B, and DYNC2H1), and ribosomal protein family proteins (RPS5, RPS25, RPS27, and RPSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, IQCH was shown to regulate the expression of RBPs via interactions with these proteins. RBPs are a large class of proteins that assemble with RNAs to form ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). RBPs function at various stages of RNA processing, including alternative splicing, RNA modification, nuclear export, localization, stability, and translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corley et al., 2020</xref>). RNA processing in male reproductive biology is essential for the production of mature sperm, and many RBPs have been demonstrated to be indispensable during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morgan et al., 2021</xref>). Among the RBPs, HNRPAB, a heterogeneous nuclear RNP, showed the most significant reduction among the downregulated interactors of IQCH, suggesting that HNRPAB might be the most important downstream effector protein of IQCH. It has been reported that HNRPAB plays a central role in spermatogenesis by regulating stage-specific translation of testicular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukuda et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay using an anti-HNRPAB antibody revealed binding between HNRPAB and the mRNAs of several important genes (<italic>Catsper1</italic>, <italic>Catsper2</italic>, <italic>Catsper3</italic>, <italic>Ccdc40</italic>, <italic>Ccdc39</italic>, <italic>Ccdc65</italic>, <italic>Dnah8</italic>, <italic>Irrc6</italic>, and <italic>Dnhd1</italic>) involved in spermatogenesis. We further found that the interaction between IQCH and CaM is a prerequisite for regulating HNRPAB expression. We thus hypothesized that IQCH regulates male fertility by binding to CaM and controlling HNRPAB to manipulate the expression of key mRNAs involved in spermatogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identified a novel IQ motif-containing protein-coding gene, <italic>IQCH</italic>/<italic>Iqch</italic>, which is responsible for spermatogenesis in humans and mice, broadening the scope of known male infertility-associated genes and thus further illustrating the genetic landscape of this disease. In addition, our study suggested an unexplored mechanism in which IQCH regulates the expression of key RBPs involved in spermatogenesis, especially HNRPAB, by interacting with CaM to play crucial roles in fertilization and axoneme assembly.

The peptides separated by liquid phase chromatography were ionized by a nanoESI source and then passed to a Q Exactive HF X tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, USA) for DDA (data-dependent acquisition) mode detection. The raw data were converted to mgf files for bioinformatics analysis, and protein identification from tandem mass spectra was performed by database searching (UniProt). The protein quantification process included the following steps: protein identification, tag impurity correction, data normalization, missing value imputation, protein ratio calculation, statistical analysis, and results presentation.

The authors examined sperm from a male infertility patient with an inherited IQCH mutation as well as Iqch CRISPR knockout mice. The authors found that both human and mouse sperm exhibited structural and morphogenetic defects in multiple structures, leading to reduced fertility in Ichq-knockout male mice. Molecular analyses such as mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation indicated that RNA-binding proteins are likely targets of IQCH, with the authors focusing on the RNA-binding protein HNRPAB as a critical regulator of testicular mRNAs. The authors used in vitro cell culture models to demonstrate an interaction between IQCH and calmodulin, in addition to showing that this interaction via the IQ motif of IQCH is required for IQCH's function in promoting HNRPAB expression. In sum, the authors concluded that IQCH promotes male fertility by binding to calmodulin and controlling HNRPAB expression to regulate the expression of essential mRNAs for spermatogenesis. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and how important factors for sperm morphogenesis and function are regulated.</p><p>The strengths of the study include the use of mouse and human samples, which demonstrate a likely relevance of the mouse model to humans; the use of multiple biochemical techniques to address the molecular mechanisms involved; the development of a new CRISPR mouse model; ample controls; and clearly displayed results. Assays are done rigorously and in a quantitative manner. Overall, the claims made by the authors in this manuscript are well-supported by the data provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88905.6.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ruan</surname><given-names>Tiechao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ruixiuixi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Junchen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Gan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Siyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Su-Ren</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Beijing Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to us why you did not adjust the title to better reflect the well-supported claims of the paper, i.e., that this is a valuable model for human loss-of-function mutations in IQCH.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the editor’s suggestion.
