Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Congenital disorders are medical conditions that are present from birth. Although many congenital disorders are rare, they can have a severe impact on the quality of life of those affected.</p><p>For example, congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a rare congenital disorder that occurs in around 1 out of every 25,000 pregnancies. In CPAM, abnormal, fluid-filled sac-like pockets of tissue, known as cysts, form within the lungs of unborn babies. After birth, these cysts become air-filled and do not behave like normal lung tissue and stop a baby’s lungs from working properly. In severe cases, babies with CPAM need surgery immediately after birth.</p><p>We still do not understand exactly what the underlying causes of CPAM might be. CPAM is not considered to be hereditary – that is, it does not appear to be passed down in families – nor is it obviously linked to any environmental factors. CPAM is also very difficult to study, because researchers cannot access tissue samples during the critical early stages of the disease.</p><p>To overcome these difficulties, Luo et al. wanted to find a way to study CPAM in the laboratory. First, they developed a non-human animal ‘model’ that naturally forms CPAM-like lung cysts, using genetically modified mice where the gene for the signaling molecule Bmpr1a had been deleted in lung cells.</p><p>Normally, Bmpr1a is part of a set of the molecular instructions, collectively termed BMP signaling, which guide healthy lung development early in life. However, mouse embryos lacking Bmpr1a developed abnormal lung cysts that were similar to those found in CPAM patients, suggesting that problems with BMP signalling might also trigger CPAM in humans.</p><p>Luo et al. also identified several other genes in the Bmpr1a-deficient mouse lungs that had abnormal patterns of activity. All these genes were known to be controlled by BMP signaling, and to play a role in the development and organisation of lung tissue. This suggests that when these genes are not controlled properly, they could drive formation of CPAM cysts when BMP signaling is compromised.</p><p>This work is a significant advance in the tools available to study CPAM. Luo et al.’s results also shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning this rare disorder. In the future, Luo et al. hope this knowledge will help us develop better treatments for CPAM, or even help to prevent it altogether.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BMP signaling</kwd><kwd>lung mesenchymal cells</kwd><kwd>pulmonary cysts</kwd><kwd>lung development</kwd><kwd>Bmpr1a</kwd><kwd>airway smooth muscle cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL151699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL141352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disrupted mesenchymal Bmpr1a-mediated signaling in fetal mouse lung leads to abnormal airway development and congenital pulmonary cyst formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital pulmonary cysts, resulting from abnormal fetal lung development, cause respiratory distress, infection, and pneumothorax in neonates. The dynamic pathogenic process and mechanisms are difficult to study in humans and few animal models are available. It is known that lung development begins with the specification of the respiratory domain in the ventral wall of the anterior foregut endoderm, as indicated by the expression of Nkx2-1, and the separation of the respiratory tract from the dorsal esophagus. The primary lung epithelial buds then undergo reiterated elongation and division to form the conducting airways (branching morphogenesis), followed by distal saccular formation and peripheral alveolarization to give rise to millions of gas exchange units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCulley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>). This well-known process literally describes the growth of respiratory epithelium based on the extensive studies done in the past decades. It is notable that lung morphogenesis is a complex process relying on the highly coordinated development of both lung epithelium and lung mesenchyme. Evidence has increasingly suggested that lung mesenchymal lineages, including airway and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), pericytes, and stromal fibroblasts, are as important as epithelial cells in proper lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to acting as a mechanical framework that supports the formation of the bronchi, bronchioles, and the distal alveoli, the lung mesenchyme provides a microenvironment that regulates the growth of epithelium through a variety of morphogenic signals, such as Wnts, fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCulley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolić et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morrisey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>BMPs are a family of growth factors that direct many biological processes, including organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). BMPs bind to the receptor complex of BMP receptor II (Bmpr2) and BMP receptor I (Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b), which in turn activates the intracellular Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Massagué, 2003</xref>). Mice with conventional <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> gene deletions are early embryonic lethal (E7.5–9.5) before lung organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishina et al., 1995</xref>). As reported by us and other groups, both hyperactivation and inhibition of BMP signaling in fetal lung epithelial cells result in lung malformation, which is primarily due to the defects in distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellusci et al., 1996</xref>). However, the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in regulating fetal lung development has not been studied due to the lack of lung mesenchyme-specific targeting tools in the past. We recently generated a lung mesenchyme-specific <italic>Tbx4</italic> lung enhancer-driven <italic>loxP</italic>/Cre mouse driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) which enables us to manipulate BMP signaling specifically in lung mesenchymal cells in vivo and to study its role in the lung development.</p><p>Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage (embryonic day [E]12.5 to E14.5), its expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is also evident during mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Herein, we specifically deleted <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation. This pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abrogation of Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme disrupted fetal lung development</title><p>By crossing the <italic>Tbx4-rtTA/TetO-Cre</italic> driver line to the <italic>floxed-Bmpr1a</italic> mice (<italic>Tbx4-rtTA/TetO-Cre/Bmpr1a<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic>), <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> was specifically knocked out in the lung mesenchyme with doxycycline (Dox) induction from the beginning of lung formation (E6.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was validated at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). For example, in E15.5 mesenchyme-specific <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> conditional knockout (CKO), Bmpr1a immunostaining was absent in lung mesenchyme but present in the epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) while Bmpr1a was detected in both mesenchyme and epithelia of wildtype (WT) lungs. By gross view with quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), early embryonic lung morphogenesis between <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs and WT controls was comparable prior to E13.5. Decreased epithelial branching and increased size of branching tips were observed from E14.5. As lung development progressed, the terminal airways in <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs displayed dilation and exhibited increasingly extensive cystic changes. However, the overall size of the lungs remained relatively unchanged. The dynamic change of the lung cysts in <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs was further analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The walls of the lung cysts were lined with a single layer of epithelial cells, over the course of development, ultimately resulting in the formation of balloon-like cystic lesions by the end of gestation (E18.5). These findings were consistent with the overall morphology of the lungs.

Lung mesenchymal deletion of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. Interestingly, congenital pulmonary cysts are reported in human CPAM patients as a result of abnormal prenatal lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stocker, 2009</xref>). Reduction of airway SMCs and decreased subepithelial elastin fibers are also found to be the common pathological changes in the cystic airways of human CPAM samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Although the congenital pulmonary cysts in CPAM patients can be identified by a prenatal ultrasound examination, the tissue specimens for pathological analysis are only available from postnatal surgery, when advanced airway cysts have already developed. This makes it difficult to study the pathogenic molecular mechanisms that trigger early cyst formation during fetal lung development in human subjects. Studies in mouse models suggest that altered growth factor signaling in a prenatal time window is sufficient to cause cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miao et al., 2021</xref>). The abnormal BMP signaling pathway may be involved in the initiation of CPAM, but not in the later stage when cystic lesions have formed. Interestingly, integrated suppression of BMP signaling pathway was recently found in human CPAM specimens by an RNA-seq approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the lung mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout model developed here is a potentially useful tool for studying the pathogenic process of CPAM.</p><p>It has been reported that epithelial overexpression of Bmp4 appears to induce extensive mesenchymal SMC differentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badri et al., 2008</xref>), and that BMP4 promotes myocyte differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation in cultured human fetal lung fibroblasts via the Smad1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeffery et al., 2005</xref>). Smad1 and Smad5 are critical downstream effectors of BMP type I receptors, mediating BMP canonical signal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katagiri and Watabe, 2016</xref>). However, our in vivo study indicates that simultaneous deletion of <italic>Smad1</italic> and <italic>Smad5</italic> in mouse lung mesenchyme does not affect the differentiation of airway SMCs although it disrupts early embryonic lung morphogenesis. This suggests that the decrease in phosphorylated Smad1 and Smad5 in the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs is not responsible for the defective airway SMC growth. In addition to the Smad-dependent BMP signal pathway, BMP-activated Bmp receptors also function through MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katagiri and Watabe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">von Bubnoff and Cho, 2001</xref>). Many studies have shown that p38 MAPK regulates cell proliferation in a variety of SMC types, including airway SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Khalil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelaia et al., 2008</xref>). The p38 MAPK is also involved in myogenic differentiation and myofibroblast trans-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer-Ter-Vehn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sebe et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, reduced phosphorylation of p38 was detected in mesenchymal <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs while addition of BMP4 activated the p38 signal pathway in mouse primary fetal lung mesenchymal cells. Moreover, the myogenic response to BMP4 stimulation in the cultured fetal lung mesenchymal cells could be blocked by treating the cells with a p38 inhibitor. This suggests that p38 is the primary intracellular signaling component to mediate BMP’s regulatory effects on airway myogenesis.</p><p>Despite being commonly characterized by the expression of a variety of myogenesis-associated genes, airway and vascular SMCs seem to originate from distinct mesenchymal progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms. Our study reveals that <italic>Myocd</italic> is a prominent target gene that links Bmpr1a to the genes associated with airway SMC development. However, Bmpr1a, p38, and Myocd are not critical in fetal pulmonary vascular SMC development, and inhibition of these molecules in vivo and in vitro does not have any observable effect on vascular SMCs in fetal lungs. Our previous study has demonstrated that <italic>Myocd</italic> is abundant in airway SMCs but barely expressed in vascular SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young et al., 2020</xref>), and that cardiovascular SMC development is mediated by myocardin-related transcription factors, the other members of <italic>Myocd</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parmacek, 2007</xref>). Distinct regulation between airway and vascular SMCs is also evidenced by the phenotypes of mice with various mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, hypomorphic FGF-10 mice only display decreased expression of airway smooth muscle actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mailleux et al., 2005</xref>), while deletion of Wnt-7b selectively disrupts the development of vascular SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shu et al., 2002</xref>). Although reduced expression of Bmpr1a is associated with various forms of acquired as well as primary nonfamilial pulmonary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2003</xref>), the role of Bmpr1a-mediated signaling in regulating prenatal lung vascular SMC development has not been studied. Our current data suggest that Bmpr1a is dispensable in fetal vascular SMC development.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that airway SMCs initially develop from local mesenchymal cells around the tips of epithelial buds undergoing bifurcation. These cells wrap around the bifurcating cleft and neck of the terminal buds, and then grow rigidly alongside the elongating bronchial tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of SMC differentiation in embryonic lung explant culture, such as by blocking L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels using nifedipine, or by inhibiting FGF and SHH signaling using SU5402SHH and cyclopamine, prevented airway terminal bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). However, our current and a recently published study demonstrate that abrogation of airway SMCs by deleting mesenchymal <italic>Myocd</italic> does not cause any significant abnormalities in airway branching morphogenesis. This suggests that loss of SMCs is neither the primary nor sole mechanism accounting for the reduction of airway branching, dilation of terminal airways, and development of airway cysts in our <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs. Notably, the airway subepithelial elastin defects were uniquely found in the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> knockout lungs with extensive cystic lesions but not in the <italic>Myocd</italic> CKO lungs. Interestingly, elastin expression in the developing lung parenchyma prior to alveologenesis is predominantly localized to the mesenchyme in the developing airways, as indicated by our elastin immunostaining data, suggesting that elastin plays a role in airway branching. Previous study has revealed that the perinatal development of terminal airway branches is arrested in mice lacking elastin (<italic>Eln</italic> -/-), resulting in dilated distal air sacs that form abnormally large cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wendel et al., 2000</xref>). It is worthy to note that airway smooth muscles are normal in these elastin null mice, implying that loss of elastic fiber alone is not sufficient to cause airway cystic pathology, but could serve as an additional factor contributing to the lesions in vivo. This assumption is also supported by the fact that congenital airway cysts in the lungs of human CPAM patients are characterized by compromised smooth muscle and elastin fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies are needed to investigate whether the combined defects of airway SMCs and elastin fibers are the pathogenic mechanisms behind congenital airway cyst formation.</p><p>The upregulation of multiple Bmp ligands, particularly Bmp4, in the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lung tissues as compared with the WT lungs is a complex scenario. The isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells of <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO mice also showed increased Bmp4 expression as compared to the WT lung cells. This might be due to an autoregulatory feedback loop between Bmp ligand expression and intracellular BMP signaling. Previous studies have shown that disruption of BMP signaling by LDN-193189 can substantially improve Bmp4 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Lee, 2019</xref>), and that deletion of Bmpr1a and Acvr1 in the lens-forming ectoderm increases Bmp2, -4, and -7 transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). These in vitro and in vivo studies clearly suggest the inverse relationship between mesenchymal BMP signaling activity and Bmp ligand expression. Misexpression of BMP4 results in a decrease of Sox2<sup>+</sup> proximal progenitors and an expansion of Sox9<sup>+</sup>/Id2<sup>+</sup> distal progenitors in fetal mouse lungs, leading to malformed airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of Bmp antagonist Xnoggin or gremlin in fetal distal lung epithelium leads to a severe reduction of distal epithelial cell types and a concurrent expanded expression of the proximal epithelial cell markers CC10 and Foxj1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). In our <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs, the proximal-distal patterning of lung airways is also substantially disturbed, as indicated by the aberrant distribution of proximal and distal epithelial cells. Evidence increasingly suggests that the lung mesenchyme is closely involved in respiratory lineage specification and epithelial differentiation by producing many critical signaling molecules, such as Bmp ligands, that direct endodermal expression of specific cell markers in a temporal and spatial fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCulley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the decrease in proximal cell types and ectopic expression of distal cell markers (Sox9) in the <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> CKO lungs may be subsequently caused by abnormal increase of Bmp ligands. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2<sup>+</sup> or expansion of Sox9<sup>+</sup> in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rockich et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis. Disruption of Bmpr1a-mediated mesenchymal signaling causes prenatal airway malformation and cystic lesions. Multiple mechanisms, including deficiency of airway smooth muscle, airway elastin fiber defect, and perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 epithelial progenitor axis, may contribute to the congenital airway cystic pathogenesis. In addition, the downstream Smad-independent p38 pathway appears to be critical in mediating BMP-regulated airway smooth muscle development. Our study helps to understand both normal lung development and the mechanisms of related airway malformation and congenital pulmonary diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Tbx4-rtTA</italic>/<italic>TetO-Cre</italic> transgenic line was generated in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Floxed-Bmpr1a</italic> (<italic>Bmpr1a <sup>fx/fx</sup></italic>) mice were provided by Dr. Yuji Mishina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mishina et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Floxed-Myocd</italic> (<italic>Myocd <sup>fx/fx</sup></italic>) mice were provided by Dr. Michael S Parmacek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Floxed-Smad1</italic> (<italic>Smad1<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic>) mice were originally generated by Dr. Anita Roberts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Floxed-Smad5</italic> (<italic>Smad5 <sup>fx/fx</sup></italic>) mice were provided by An Zwijsen at KU Leuven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umans et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Cspg4-DsRed</italic> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (#008241). <italic>Tagln-YFP</italic> reporter mice were provided by Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

This study by Luo and colleagues provides compelling new evidence that bone morphogenetic protein signaling in distal mesenchymal cells is required for normal mouse lung development. Genetic loss of BMP receptor in mice and in fetal mesenchymal cells causes type 2 or alveolar-like CPAM pathology. Furthermore, this is associated with changes in expression of Sox2-Sox9 suggesting defects in the proximal to distal cellularity of the lung. Interestingly, cysts are formed even when SMAD1 and 5, two major downstream effects of BMP signaling are deleted suggesting a role for non-canonical BMP signalling. Furthermore, they were independent of ablating BMP signaling in non-vascular mesenchymal cells. The findings are compelling and provide strong evidence that cystic lung development is caused by loss of non-canonical BMP signaling in mesenchymal cells. The main weakness of the paper is that it does not identify the downstream non-canonical effector of mesenchymal BMP signaling. The authors provide a plausible suggestion that it may be p38 MAPK that deserves further investigation. Despite this minor weakness, the overall findings are novel and considered important because they provide a foundation for new studies, including experiments that may produce drugs designed to prevent or treat newborn infants with CPAM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91876.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Yongfeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Children's Hospital Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cincinnati</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cincinnati</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Children's Hospital Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cincinnati</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cincinnati</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hong-Jun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cincinnati</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cincinnati</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thornton</surname><given-names>Matthew E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grubbs</surname><given-names>Brendan H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Southern California</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kolb</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McMaster University and The Research Institute of St. Joe's Hamilton</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hamilton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Parmacek</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philandephia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mishina</surname><given-names>Yuji</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cincinnati</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cincinnati</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Importantly, it would be useful to have provided more detailed information on the structure and histological properties of the murine cysts and how such findings relate to human lung cysts.

Unfortunately, there is no GWAS data on this. From the published RNA-seq data, which were obtained from postnatal lung specimen of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) patients, “integrated suppression of BMP signaling pathway” was reported although altered expression of BMPR1A was not presented. We speculate that (1) BMPR1A is critical in embryonic development and a germline deficiency of BMPR1A may lead to early embryonic lethality prior to lung formation as supported by mouse data; (2) As suggested by our previously published study related to TGF-beta signaling and prenatal pulmonary cysts (Miao et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2021), dysregulation of BMPR1A-mediated signaling in a particular time window of fetal lung development may be sufficient to cause cyst formation, so that BMPR1A alteration may not be persistent to postnatal lung specimens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Throughout the paper, there is a lack of quantification for the histological findings. Littermate controls should also be clearly defined genetically,</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and acknowledge the importance of quantitative measurement for the changes. We now add quantitative data on branching number and size of the airway tips to define the difference between wild-type and Bmpr1a CKO mouse lungs in Fig.1.“The littermate controls were the mice without any gene deletion due to lack of transgenes Tbx4-rtTA and/or TetO-Cre”, which is now added in Materials and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1 suppl: &quot;Doxycycline&quot; is misspelled.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure1c Suppl: Hard to discern clear-cut expression of Bmpr1a protein in mesenchyme in WT. Comparable images with similar sizes of airways should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide a clearer comparison of Bmpr1a expression patterns between Bmpr1a CKO and control lungs, we enlarge the fluorescent stained lungs presented in Supplemental Figure 1C as suggested by the editor. Additionally, dotted lines have been added to delineate the airway boundaries from the surrounding mesenchyme to better visualize the Bmpr1a distribution in lung mesenchyme. Bmpr1a expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is easily detected at E15.5 when significant dilation of airways is presented in Bmpr1a CKO lung. It is rare to have comparable sizes of peripheral airways in the Bmpr1a CKO lung at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2a: Expression of several genes studied and altered should be identified on scatter plot.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we now highlight the related genes, including Acta2, Myocd, Eln, Bmp4, Sox2, etc., in the scatter plot. In addition, we also highlight these critical genes in the heatmap (Fig. 2B and Fig. 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 2c: Authors should also consider staining for other smooth muscle markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a panel of Myh11 immunostaining in Figure 2E. Myh11 is another common marker for smooth muscle cells. Lack of Myh11 staining in Bmpr1a CKO lung airways further supports our conclusion that loss of mesenchymal Bmpr1a leads to defective airway smooth muscle growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 3: ELN expression should be defined in a clear quantitative manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We have presented RNA-seq data, Real-time PCR results, immunostaining, and western blot data for in vivo samples. Additionally, we have included in vitro experiment illustrating that Bmp4 induces Eln expression, suggesting that BMP signaling regulates Eln expression. We believe that these datasets collectively support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 4: Additional information on p38 dependent signaling (Including in vivo studies) would potentially help to understand key molecular events and perhaps could help to address key mechanistic events, including their location and identity.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the insightful suggestion from the reviewer. While the study of p38-dependent signaling is definitely important to dissect the entire mechanisms, we are not going to include such experiments in this manuscript due to time constraints associated with in vivo studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 6: Would be helpful to know whether Bmpr1a receptor is expressed in Myocd KO.</p></disp-quote><p>Bmpr1a expression is not changed in Myocd KO lungs, which is now included as Figure 6C. Together with other data, this suggests that Myocd is a downstream target directly mediating Bmpr1a-regulated airway smooth muscle development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 7: Not clear how these findings, though interesting, relate to the body of studies and the pathogenesis of cyst formation. Other points: (1) The authors should re-examine/repeat co-staining in the KO mouse lung (right 2 images in the top group of 4) for Foxj1, Sox2, and CDH (right 2 images, Figure 7A). For one thing, the cadherin stain in the 2 KO images seems localized to the lumen. Secondly, the pattern of cadherin staining looks exactly the same in both KO images, suggesting an error and/or duplication (2) authors should place arrows on the heat map showing the location of SPC, Sox2, Sox9, and FoxJ1 bands (3) figure 7D graph needs numbers on y axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Fig.7 provides an additional potential mechanism by which deficient Bmp signaling leads to abnormally increased Bmp ligand expression, which disrupts the formation of epithelial proximal-distal axis, and results in cystic defects. Further in vivo experiments are needed to test this, which is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The E-cadherin staining signal in the lumen is caused by the tissue section positioned at an interface between lumen and the apical membrane of the lining epithelial cells where the E-cadherin is localized.</p><p>Triple immunostaining of E-Cadherin, Sox2, and FoxJ1 was performed for the same tissue section (upper two panels of Figure 7A) as these antibodies were derived from different species, but the images are presented in two different combinations for simplicity and clarity. For the lower two panels of Figure 7A, double immunostaining of Sox9/E-Cadherin and Spc/E-Cadherin were performed separately on different tissue sections due to both anti-Sox9 and anti-Spc antibodies were produced from rabbits.</p><p>The genes listed in the heatmap are canonical and putative marker genes for differential lung epithelial cell lineages, such as Scgb1a1 for Clara cells and FoxJ1 for ciliated cells. Therefore, progenitor cell marker Sox2 and Sox9 were not included. In the updated heatmap, four widely acknowledged epithelial cell markers—Scgb1a1, FoxJ1, Sftpb, and Sftpc have been distinguished by utilizing a distinct font color (red) to enhance their visibility.</p><p>Label for the y axis of Fig.7D is now added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors may be aware that a recent paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-24858-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-24858-3</ext-link>) reported on transcriptional changes seen in human CPAM. It would seem that some of the molecular changes seen in human CPAM move in the opposite direction of what is reported in mice lacking mesenchymal Bmrp1a. Perhaps the authors could comment on these differences in the discussion and whether they potentially explain the etiology of CPAM or branching morphogenesis in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for referring this paper regarding human CPAM study. CPAM has a variety of histopathology. The type 1 CPAM is assumed to develop from more proximal bronchial/bronchiolar airways while type 2 CPAM is developed from relatively distal bronchiolar airways. In that publication, surgical resected lung specimens were collected from type 1 CPAM patients postnatally (0.5-1 year), in which the cysts were lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells. Gene expression was compared between cystic lung tissues and adjacent non-cystic lung tissues. Interestingly, integrated suppression of BMP signaling pathway was shown by their data analysis. In our mouse model, the histopathology appears as human type 2 CPAM, such as back-to-back cysts lining with a simple layer of epithelial cells. Therefore, several factors could explain the differences between their published data and our study at the molecular level: (1) Different types of CPAM based on the histopathology; (2) Different sampling time points, developing cysts at fetal stage in mouse sample vs. developed cysts in postnatal huma samples; (3) Different comparison of diseased and normal tissues: separate normal lungs vs. cystic lungs in mice while in human cystic tissues vs. non-cystic tissues in the same lungs. We now include this reference in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 shows that BMP4 increases SMADs, p38, and several muscle genes in mesenchymal cells. Figure 5 extends this finding with a clever strategy to label airway and vascular smooth muscle with different fluorescent molecules used to isolate different types of mesenchymal cells. It shows that non-vascular smooth muscle cells but not perivascular smooth muscles are responsive to BMP4 signaling as defined by increased expression of Myh11. Are there cell-restricted responses to the other genes shown in Figure 4? Given the lack of SMAD signaling and the increase seen in p38 signaling, would blocking p38 signaling influence the BMP responsiveness of these nonvascular smooth muscle cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. As we have addressed above, we will leave p38-mediated signaling and cyst formation to next step study due to time constraints associated with these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 6 shows that mesenchymal loss of Myocd causes a deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells, but this was not sufficient to create cysts. Did the authors ever check to see if it changed Sox2-Sox9 staining in the airway epithelium?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no significant change in Sox2 expression in proximal airway epithelia of Myocd CKO lungs as detected by immunostaining. The result was not included in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 7 shows that mesenchymal loss of Bmpr1a proximalizes the distal airway as defined by loss of Sox2 and FoxJ1 (a ciliated marker) and gain in (Sox9 and SP-C) staining. But Club cells expressing Scgb1a1 and Cyp2F2 are the predominant epithelial cells in the distal airway. The transcriptomics data in panel B shows expression of these genes is less in the mutant mice. Does this mean they fail to generate Club cells or there is just less expression per cell? In other words, what are the primary epithelial cells present in the airways of mice with loss of mesenchymal Bmpr1a?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the heatmap of Fig.7b, the dysregulated gene expression in the Bmpr1a CKO extends beyond the featured epithelial cell markers, encompassing alterations in numerous putative marker genes. For example, several putative Club cell markers in addition to Scgb1a1 and Cyp2F2 were reduced in the Bmpr1a CKO lungs, suggesting a compromised differentiation of Club cells. Additionally, we observed upregulations of some molecular markers for distal progenitors and differentiated cells in the proximal region of airways, again suggesting a significant disruption in epithelial differentiation in the Bmpr1a CKO lungs. These abnormal cells can be further defined by a single cell transcriptomic approach in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As discussed above, there may be an issue with the histological images and staining in 2 images in Figure 7A.

Was that also seen through E18.5?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful question about proliferation and apoptosis at later embryonic stages. Our focus here was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying abnormal branching morphogenesis and lung cyst initiation that occur prior to E15.5 in our model. Measuring the dynamic changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis at later timepoints will help to understand cyst progression, which will be our next focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) BMP inhibitors used in Figure 4 show that BMP signaling regulates mesenchymal myogenesis independent of SMAD. But the experiments don't show how the inhibitors impact the control cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the effects of the BMPR1 inhibitor LDN on the control cells. At the same dose (200 nM) and serum-free culture condition, LDN did not affect the basal level of BMP signaling (data not included) but blocked exogeneous BMP4-induced signaling elevation (Fig.4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Bmpr1a was deleted by administering doxycycline to pregnant dams prior to lung bud formation. It caused cystic disorders by disrupting proximal airspace. Could the authors speculate on why it does not impact tracheal and bronchiolar development? In other words, does the TBX4 promoter not target these cells? Do these cells not express Bmpr1a?</p></disp-quote><p>The Tbx4 enhancer does target mesenchymal cells surrounding the trachea and bronchioles. Deletion of Bmpr1a in tracheal mesenchymal cells result in disruption of tracheal cartilage formation and smooth muscle differentiation. These phenotypes are evident in the gross view of lungs from E15.5 and later (Fig.1A). However, our manuscript is focusing on the phenotype of prenatal lung cysts, and we have chosen not to include complex data on tracheal development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
