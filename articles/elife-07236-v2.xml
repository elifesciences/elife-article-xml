are required for centriole duplication and the homo-oligomerisation properties of Sas-6 help establish the ninefold symmetry of the central cartwheel that initiates centriole assembly. Ana2/STIL proteins are poorly conserved, but they all contain a predicted Central Coiled-Coil Domain (CCCD). Here we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ana2 CCCD forms a tetramer, and we solve its structure to 0.8 Å, revealing that it adopts an unusual parallel-coil topology. We also solve the structure of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-6 N-terminal domain to 2.9 Å revealing that it forms higher-order oligomers through canonical interactions. Point mutations that perturb Sas-6 or Ana2 homo-oligomerisation in vitro strongly perturb centriole assembly in vivo. Thus, efficient centriole duplication in flies requires the homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2, and the Ana2 CCCD tetramer structure provides important information on how these proteins might cooperate to form a cartwheel structure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07236.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07236.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07236.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animal cells contain structures known as centrioles. Typically, a cell that is not dividing contains a pair of centrioles. But when a cell prepares to divide, the centrioles are duplicated. The two pairs of centrioles then organize the scaffolding that shares the genetic material equally between the newly formed cells at cell division.</p><p>Centriole assembly is tightly regulated and abnormalities in this process can lead to developmental defects and cancer. Centrioles likely contain several hundred proteins, but only a few of these are strictly needed for centriole assembly. New centrioles usually assemble from a cartwheel-like arrangement of proteins, which includes a protein called SAS-6. Previous work has suggested that in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Sas-6 can only form this cartwheel when another protein called Ana2 is also present, but the details of this process are unclear.</p><p>Now, Cottee, Muschalik et al. have investigated potential features in the Ana2 protein that might be important for centriole assembly. These experiments revealed that a region in the Ana2 protein, called the ‘central coiled-coil domain’, is required to target Ana2 to centrioles. Furthermore, purified coiled-coil domains were found to bind together in groups of four (called tetramers). Cottee, Muschalik et al. then used a technique called X-ray crystallography to work out the three-dimensional structure of one of these tetramers and part of the Sas-6 protein with a high level of detail. These structures confirmed that Sas-6 proteins also associate with each other.</p><p>When fruit flies were engineered to produce either Ana2 or Sas-6 proteins that cannot self-associate, the flies' cells were unable to efficiently make centrioles. Furthermore, an independent study by Rogala et al. found similar results for a protein that is related to Ana2: a protein called SAS-5 from the microscopic worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p><p>Further work is needed to understand how Sas-6 and Ana2 work with each other to form the cartwheel-like arrangement at the core of centrioles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07236.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07236.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>ultra-high resolution structure</kwd><kwd>SAS-6</kwd><kwd>Ana2</kwd><kwd>STIL</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104575/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raff</surname><given-names>Jordan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100298/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lea</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cottee</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the Ana2 Central Coiled-Coil Domain provides insight into how centriolar cartwheel components may be recruited and assembled, and indicates that cartwheel assembly involves more than just SAS-6 oligomerisation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrioles are complex microtubule (MT) based structures that are required for the formation of centrosomes and cilia/flagella. These organelles have many important functions in cells, and their dysfunction has been linked to a plethora of human pathologies, ranging from cancer to microcephaly to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, understanding how these organelles assemble and function is an important goal of both basic and biomedical research.</p><p>Although several hundred proteins are thought to be concentrated at centrioles, only a small number appear to form a conserved ‘core’ pathway that is essential for centriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delattre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gönczy, 2012</xref>). During canonical centriole duplication, the protein kinase Plk4/Sak/ZYG-1 is recruited to the mother centriole by SPD-2 in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delattre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimanovskaya et al., 2014</xref>), by Asterless (Asl) in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blachon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dzhindzhev et al., 2010</xref>), or by a combination of the two (Cep192 and Cep152, respectively) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>). The protein kinase recruits STIL/Ana2/SAS-5 and Sas-6 to a single site on the side of the mother centriole where they assemble with CPAP/Sas-4 into a cartwheel structure that helps to establish the ninefold symmetry of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dammermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delattre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakazawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stevens et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arquint et al., 2012</xref>). CPAP/Sas-4 can interact with tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hung et al., 2004</xref>) and is required to recruit the centriole MTs to the outer region of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>), possibly working together with Cep135/Bld10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiraki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2013</xref>)—although no homologue of this protein has been identified in worms, and it does not appear to be essential for centriole duplication in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mottier-Pavie and Megraw, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roque et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Great progress has been made recently in understanding how these proteins interact and how these interactions are regulated to ensure that a new centriole is only formed at the right place and at the right time. In particular, the crystal structure of Sas-6 from several species has revealed how this protein forms a dimer through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain (C–C) that can then further homo-oligomerise through an N-terminal headgroup interaction (N–N) to form a ring structure from which the C–C domains emanate as spokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>). This Sas-6 ring structure can be modelled into EM tomographic reconstructions of the cartwheel from <italic>Trichonympha</italic> centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2013</xref>), strongly suggesting that these Sas-6 rings form the basic building blocks of the cartwheel. In support of this hypothesis, mutant forms of Sas-6 that cannot homo-oligomerise through the N–N interaction are unable to support efficient centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>), although they can still target to centrioles, a function that seems to rely on the C–C domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A crystal structure of the interface between Ana2/STIL and Sas-4/CPAP has also recently been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</xref>), as has the interaction interface between Plk4 and both Cep192/SPD-2 and Cep152/Asl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2014</xref>); mutations that perturb these interactions in vitro perturb centriole duplication in vivo, indicating that these interactions are also essential for centriole duplication. More recently, it has been shown that Plk4 can recruit STIL to centrioles in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>) and that Plk4/Sak can phosphorylate the conserved <bold>ST</bold>IL/<bold>An</bold>a2 (STAN) domain in STIL/Ana2 proteins in humans and flies, thereby promoting the interaction of the STAN domain with Sas-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>). Mutant forms of STIL/Ana2 that could not be phosphorylated strongly perturbed Sas-6 recruitment to centrioles and centriole duplication. Together, these studies have shed important light on the molecular mechanisms of centriole assembly, but many important questions remain.</p><p>In particular, it has been proposed that the homo-oligomerisation properties of Sas-6 establish the ninefold symmetry of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>), and, remarkably, a ninefold symmetric ring structure is formed in crystallo by <italic>Leishmania major</italic> Sas-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Breugel et al., 2014</xref>). However, although Sas-6 oligomers appear to have a propensity towards ninefold symmetry, Sas-6 proteins spontaneously assemble into oligomers of varying stoichiometry in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the homo-oligomerisation properties of Sas-6 alone may be insufficient to enforce the rigorous ninefold symmetry that is observed in centrioles from virtually all species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cottee et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, recent Cryo-EM analysis suggests that the basic building block of the cartwheel stack is not a single ring and spoke structure, but rather a pair of rings that sit on top of one another: these rings do not make direct contact with each other, but are joined in the more peripheral regions through their spokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2013</xref>). Our current knowledge of Sas-6 self-association cannot explain this important feature of the cartwheel structure.</p><p>We previously showed that overexpressed Sas-6 can form higher-order aggregates in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes, but these aggregates only adopt a cartwheel-like structure when Ana2 is also overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stevens et al., 2010b</xref>), and the STIL/Ana2 protein family is essential for the proper recruitment of Sas-6 to centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned therefore, that Ana2 was likely to also play an important part in determining the structure of the central cartwheel. We set out to investigate the potential structural features of Ana2 that might be important for centriole assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CCCD is required for the centriolar targeting of Ana2</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ana2 protein contains four regions that have significant homology to Ana2/STIL proteins from other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1A, 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, fusions retaining the STAN domain, but lacking the CCCD (constructs 8, 9 and 11) showed a weak and diffuse localisation to the PCM. This PCM localisation appeared to be dependent on the STAN domain, as constructs lacking both the CCCD and the STAN domain were no longer detectable at centrioles or in the PCM (constructs 5, 10, 12 and 13). In contrast, constructs lacking the STAN domain, but retaining the CCCD, localised as a tight dot to centrioles (although much more weakly than constructs that contained both domains) and were not detectable in the PCM (constructs 3 and 4). These observations suggest that the CCCD is required for the centriolar localisation of Ana2, while the STAN domain increases the efficiency of centriolar localisation and can also weakly target Ana2 to the PCM if the CCCD is absent. These findings are in agreement with recent data showing that STIL, the human homologue of Ana2, is recruited to centrioles through a direct interaction between regions of STIL containing the CCCD and Plk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the CCCD alone could not target GFP to centrioles (constructs 14 and 15), demonstrating that, at least in this context, the CCCD was not able to directly target proteins to the centriole.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The CCCD forms a stable tetramer in solution</title><p>We reasoned that the CCCD might function as an oligomerisation domain for Ana2.

The CCCD tetramer was very stable and we could not find in-solution conditions under which it was dissociated, so we could not calculate a Kd.

This promoter consistently results in the strong overexpression of both WT Ana2-GFP and mutant Ana2-CCA-GFP relative to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While Ana2-GFP strongly rescued the centriole duplication defect seen in <italic>ana2</italic> mutants, Ana2-CCA-GFP rescued much more weakly, although at least one centrosome-like structure (CLS) was detectable in ∼35% of cells expressing one copy of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,F′,F′′</xref>). We do not know if these structures contain <italic>bona fide</italic> centrioles, but they stained for multiple centriole/centrosome markers and were almost invariably located at the spindle poles in mitotic cells, demonstrating that they retain at least some centriole and centrosome function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–F′′</xref>; data not shown); we therefore refer to these structures as CLSs. Interestingly, doubling the dosage of the Ana2-CCA-GFP, which already appeared to be overexpressed even with one gene dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), increased the efficiency of rescue, and nearly 90% of cells now contained at least one CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Several of these flies were clearly less uncoordinated than the <italic>ana2</italic> mutant flies (data not shown), strongly suggesting that flies rescued by a double dose of Ana2-CCA-GFP can form at least some functional cilia, again arguing that the CLSs retain some centriole activity. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the ability of Ana2 to tetramerise is important for Ana2 function and for centriole assembly, but that Ana2-CCA retains some residual ability to promote the assembly of CLSs in vivo.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07236.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A Mutant form of Ana2 that cannot tetramerise efficiently in vitro cannot support efficient centriole duplication in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two exposures of a western blot illustrating the relative expression levels of endogenous Ana2 (arrowhead) and either WT Ana2-GFP or Ana2-CCA-GFP (arrow) (expressed from one (1×) or two (2×) copies of the transgene) in third instar larval brains in either a WT or <italic>ana2</italic> mutant background.

In all species examined to date Sas-6 forms dimers through an extended C-terminal coiled-coil region (C–C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qiao et al., 2012</xref>).

In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, however, the SAS-6 headgroup-CC orientation is altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), and SAS-6 dimers appear to oligomerise into a spiral, rather than a flat-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>), potentially explaining why a classical cartwheel with nine spokes has not been visualised by EM in <italic>C. elegans</italic> centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrioles, EM images reveal a clear central cartwheel hub from which emanating spokes are often visible—but it is difficult to visualise more than a few spoke structures at any one time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roque et al., 2012</xref>; Helio Roque, <italic>personal communication</italic>), making it unclear whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-6 oligomerises into a canonical ring or into a spiral.

This promoter consistently resulted in the overexpression of both WT GFP-Sas-6 and GFP-Sas-6-F143D compared to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). While WT GFP-Sas-6 strongly rescued the centriole duplication defect seen in <italic>Sas-6</italic> mutants, GFP-Sas-6-F143D rescued much more weakly, although, at least one CLS was detectable in ∼60% of cells expressing one copy of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–F′′</xref>). As was the case with the rescue of the <italic>ana2</italic> mutation by Ana2-CCA-GFP, these structures stained for multiple centriole/centrosome markers and were usually located at the spindle poles in mitotic cells, demonstrating that they retain at least some centriole and centrosome function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–F′′</xref>; data not shown). From our qualitative analysis, however, the CLSs formed when <italic>Sas-6</italic> mutants were rescued by GFP-Sas-6-F143D often appeared smaller and more fragmented than those observed when <italic>ana2</italic> mutants were rescued by Ana2-CCA-GFP, suggesting that the CLSs formed in the presence of GFP-Sas-6-F143D may be less well organised than those formed in the presence of Ana2-CCA-GFP. Moreover, as described below, females carrying even one copy of this transgene invariably laid embryos that arrested early in development, so we could not generate flies carrying two copies of the transgene to test if the rescuing activity of the transgene increased with gene dosage—as we observed for Ana2-CCA-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the ability of Sas-6 to form higher order oligomers is important for Sas-6 function and for centriole assembly, but that GFP-Sas-6-F143D retains some residual ability to promote the assembly of CLSs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07236.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A Mutant form of Sas-6 that cannot oligomerise efficiently in vitro cannot support efficient centriole duplication in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A western blot illustrating the relative expression levels of endogenous Sas-6 (arrowhead) and either WT GFP-Sas-6 or GFP-Sas-6-F143D (arrow) in third instar larval brains in either a WT or <italic>Sas-6</italic> mutant background.

These observations have important implications for the mechanism of Sas-6-mediated cartwheel assembly as they suggest that GFP-Sas-6-F143D can effectively poison cartwheel assembly in rapidly dividing syncytial embryos that have to assemble centrioles very quickly (and centrioles are essential for early embryo development in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varmark et al., 2007</xref>]), but not in brain cells or spermatocytes that have a slower cell cycle and so can presumably assemble their centrioles over a longer time-frame (see ‘Discussion’).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is now widely accepted that the structure of the centriole cartwheel is formed around a core of 9 Sas-6 dimers that homo-oligomerise to form a ring structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cottee et al., 2011</xref>). Sas-6 molecules can form such ninefold symmetric rings in the absence of any other proteins in vitro, and mutations that perturb the ability of Sas-6 to homo-oligomerise in vitro strongly perturb centriole assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2014</xref>). We previously showed, however, that overexpressed Sas-6 can only form cartwheel-like structures in fly spermatocytes when Ana2 is also overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stevens et al., 2010b</xref>). Here we show that Ana2/STIL proteins also homo-oligomerise and that mutations that perturb the homo-oligomerisation of fly Ana2 in vitro also strongly perturb centriole assembly in vivo. Thus, Sas-6 homo-oligomerisation alone appears unable to drive efficient cartwheel assembly in vivo if Ana2 is unable to homo-oligomerise.</p><p>Our initial structure/function analysis of Ana2 revealed that the CCCD is important for the recruitment of Ana2 to centrioles. This is consistent with the recent discovery that the CCCD in human STIL interacts with Plk4 and is important for STIL recruitment to centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>). In both flies and vertebrates, Sak/Plk4 can also phosphorylate the STAN domain of Ana2/STIL, promoting its interaction with Sas-6, and allowing it to recruit Sas-6 to the newly forming centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we found that although the STAN domain could not localise Ana2 to centrioles in fly embryos in the absence of the CCCD, the centriolar localisation of Ana2 was much weaker in the absence of the STAN domain, suggesting that an interaction with Sas-6 is required for robust Ana2 localisation in flies. This result is in agreement with the finding that fragments of STIL containing both the CCCD and the STAN domain interact most strongly with Plk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>), but contrasts with reports in human cells where deleting the STAN domain did not affect STIL localisation to centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>) and in fly cultured cells, where the depletion of Sas-6 by RNAi did not detectably perturb the centriole localisation of Ana2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>). These latter results suggest that the proper recruitment of Ana2/STIL to centrioles is independent of the STAN domain's interaction with Sas-6. Our findings suggest, however, that although Plk4 may initially recruit some Ana2 to centrioles without Sas-6, the subsequent incorporation of Ana2 into the new centriole is dependent upon the successful assembly of a cartwheel structure, and this cannot occur without Sas-6. In addition, although Plk4 can clearly recruit Ana2/STIL to centrioles in flies and humans, in worms ZYG-1 (the Plk4 functional homologue) can directly recruit SAS-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lettman et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the molecular detail of the interactions between Plk4/Sak/ZYG-1, Sas-6 and Ana2/STIL/SAS-5 involved in cartwheel assembly remain to be fully elucidated, and may vary between different cell types and species.</p><p>The Ana2 CCCD tetramerises as a symmetric, parallel four helical bundle. Such structures are relatively rare in cytoplasmic proteins: most examples in the PDB are either engineered peptides, extensions of larger domains such as tetrameric membrane-associated receptors, or occur within a single polypeptide (and so are not oligomerisation domains). Although Ana2/STIL/SAS-5 proteins are highly diverged, a CCCD is found in all family members described to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our data suggests that the human STIL CCCD can also form tetramers, although it does so more weakly than the fly CCCD; we speculate that tetramerisation via the CCCD could be a common feature of Ana2/STIL proteins. A fragment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAS-5 also behaves as a tetramer, although the relevant oligomerisation domain has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shimanovskaya et al., 2013</xref>). It will be particularly interesting to test whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAS-5 CCCD forms a tetramer, as this organism appears to form a spiral cartwheel rather than a flat-ring cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>). It was recently proposed that fly Ana2 can form tetramers through a different mechanism that is dependent on an interaction with dynein light chain (LC8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slevin et al., 2014</xref>). This interaction may be important for spindle orientation, rather than centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and our results suggest that the observed tetramerisation was likely driven by the CCCD rather than the interaction with LC8.</p><p>We also examined the structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-6 and confirmed that, similar to other Sas-6 orthologues, it associates via two self-interaction interfaces, a C-terminal coiled-coil dimerization (C–C), and an N-terminal headgroup oligomerization (N–N). The interface between the headgroup and the C–C was similar to that seen in most other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2014</xref>), and different to that observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>) strongly suggesting that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-6 assembles into a canonical, flat ring structure. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>), we found that mutations that perturb the ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sas-6 to homo-oligomerise through the N–N interface in vitro (GFP-Sas-6-F143D) cannot support efficient centriole duplication in vivo, and this is also true for mutations that perturb the ability of Ana2 to tetramerise in vitro (Ana2-CCA-GFP). Most importantly, however, we note that both these mutant proteins can support the assembly of some centrosomes, or CLSs, that can recruit other centriole and centrosome proteins and that often concentrate at spindle poles. We suspect that this is because centriole assembly is normally driven by a complex set of interactions between proteins such as Plk4, Sas-6, Ana2/STIL, Sas-4 and Cep135/Bld10 so that some residual (although possibly abnormal) centriole assembly is still possible even if one of these interaction interfaces is perturbed.</p><p>We predicted that GFP-Sas-6-F143D might act as a dominant-negative in cells, forming hetero-dimers with the WT protein that can incorporate into the cartwheel through the WT subunit, but which cannot then support further cartwheel assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Surprisingly, although GFP-Sas-6-F143D appears to be overexpressed in embryos, brains and testes, it only had a dominant-negative effect on centriole duplication in early embryos (although the centrioles in spermatocytes were slightly, but significantly, shorter in the presence of GFP-Sas-6-F143D). These data suggest that WT-mutant heterodimers can transiently incorporate into the cartwheel and perturb assembly but, if given enough time, the heterodimers will dissociate and eventually a cartwheel can assemble from the pool of WT–WT homodimers. This would explain why GFP-Sas-6-F143D has no dramatic dominant-negative effect in somatic cells (where centriole assembly can presumably occur relatively slowly during an S-phase period that can last several hours) but has a dramatic dominant-negative effect in syncytial embryos (where centriole assembly must be completed during an S-phase that lasts only a few minutes). If this interpretation is correct, it implies that partially assembled cartwheel rings must be relatively stable structures that can be maintained in the partially assembled state until enough WT–WT homodimers have been incorporated to complete ring assembly.</p><p>Interestingly, overexpressed Ana2-CCA-GFP had no detectable dominant-negative effect on centriole duplication, even in rapidly dividing syncytial embryos. We speculate that this is because Ana2 is recruited to centrioles as a tetramer; thus, monomeric Ana2-CCA-GFP molecules would not efficiently compete with WT tetramers for centriole binding sites, perhaps because they lack the avidity of the tetramer. The Ana2-CCA-GFP molecules would also not ‘poison’ the WT molecules, as they would be unable to tetramerise with them. It is tempting to further speculate that two dimers of Sak/Plk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Slevin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimanovskaya et al., 2014</xref>) might function as the centriole binding sites for the Ana2 tetramer.</p><p>The Sas-6 crystal structure can be modelled with high precision into the Cryo-EM tomographic map of the <italic>Trichonympha</italic> cartwheel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>). Ana2/STIL proteins contain essential CR2 and STAN domains that interact with Sas-4/CPAP and Sas-6, respectively: these domains are connected to the CCCD by extended, unconserved (and probably relatively unstructured) linkers. Thus, in flies, the Ana2 CCCD parallel tetramer tethers the CR2 and STAN domains in a particular geometry and stoichiometry. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> we present several models of how the Ana2 tetramer might be incorporated into the <italic>Trichonympha</italic> cartwheel structure. An interesting feature of the cartwheel is that its basic building block is two Sas-6 rings assembled on top of each other that are held together by the convergence of their coiled-coil spokes at the outer region of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Every paired spoke comprises four molecules of Sas-6, so we favour the idea that the Ana2 tetramer might interact with these converged spokes, thus stabilising the basic, two ring, building block of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). If each Sas-6 ring has a strong, but not invariant, tendency to adopt a ninefold symmetric organization, having cartwheel assembly dependent on the simultaneous co-assembly of two rings, rather than just one, could dramatically increase the precision of ninefold symmetric ring assembly. Ana2 might also hold the Sas-6 molecules in an orientation that further favours the assembly of ninefold symmetric rings.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07236.013</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic models of how Ana2 tetramers might contribute to cartwheel assembly.</title><p>The grey area shows a representation of the electron density map derived from the <italic>Triconympha</italic> cartwheel structure (emd-2329/2330) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guichard et al., 2013</xref>). A protofilament of the centriole A-MT is shown in green, and full-length Sas-6 molecules (brown/orange) have been placed into the cartwheel density. The Ana2 CCCD tetramer is coloured blue/red, extending out to the N-terminus in blue and to the C-terminus in red. The N-terminal Ana2 CR2 domain (blue) is shown bound to the Sas-4 C-terminal TCP domain (pale green) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</xref>); Sas-4 is located towards the periphery of the cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>) so we place the CR2/TCP interaction in the peripheral pinhead region. The STAN domain (red) binds Sas-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>); as the C–C domain of Sas-6 is required for targeting to the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2014</xref>) (and so presumably for binding to Ana2). We present two alternative models where the STAN domain binds to the Sas-6 C–C region either at the N-terminal head-linker region (<bold>A</bold>) or at a more C-terminal region towards the end of the spoke (<bold>B</bold>). (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) In these models, the Ana2 tetramer interacts with two Sas-6 dimers, one that is incorporated into the top Sas-6 ring, and one that is incorporated into the bottom Sas-6 ring. An attractive feature of this model is that it can explain why the fundamental building block of the cartwheel seems to comprise two Sas-6 rings rather than one. Making cartwheel assembly dependent on the co-assembly of two rings could dramatically reinforce the tendency to form a ninefold symmetric ring (see main text). In these models, the density of the Ana2 molecules would fit well into the existing density model. (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>) In these models, Ana2 forms the same interactions in the same stoichiometry, but the tetramer bridges adjacent paired spoke layers. This model is less attractive as the Ana2 molecules span two of the basic building blocks of the cartwheel (rather than contributing to the stability of the basic building block), and the Ana2 molecules would not fit into the existing density models (although this is possible if they are held in a flexible manner, so their density is not detectable by EM). In these latter models we show Cep135 tethering the SAS-6 spoke to the pinhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). This interaction likely also occurs in the models shown in (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) (although, for ease of presentation, it is not shown); in the models shown in (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>) this putative interaction between Sas-6 and Cep135 would function as the key interaction stabilising the two ring structure. Models where the Ana2 tetramer interacts with Sas-6 molecules in only one layer of the Sas-6 ring structure are also possible, but are not illustrated here.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07236.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07236.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07236-fig9-v2"/></fig></p><p>Previous studies have indicated that STIL molecules can turnover at centrioles, suggesting that they are not ‘locked’ into the cartwheel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>). In our favoured model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>) Ana2 tetramers would help recruit Sas-6 dimers—and presumably also Sas-4 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cottee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilbert et al., 2013</xref>)—in a stoichiometry and conformation that would favour cartwheel assembly. Once incorporated, however, Sas-6 and Sas-4 molecules could quickly become ‘locked’ into the assembled cartwheel/centriole structure. Thus, Ana2 could be important for ensuring proper cartwheel assembly, but may not be required to maintain the assembled cartwheel structure. Although these models are attractive, several other arrangements of the Ana2 tetramer are also plausible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and more data will be required to identify the precise inter-molecular interactions that lead to the efficient assembly of the ninefold-symmetric cartwheel structure. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the Ana2 tetramer plays an important part in cartwheel assembly in flies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Note added in proof</title><p>Rogala et al. have now shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAS-5, the functional homologue of Ana2/STIL, can also form higher-order oligomers and this is essential for SAS-5 function. SAS-5 has two major oligomerisation domains (a central coiled-coil region and an implico domain) that allow the protein to form a mix of tetramers and hexamers in vitro.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “The homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2 is required for efficient centriole assembly in flies” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We are happy to say that your paper has been favourably reviewed, and we have only a few minor comments, which we are sure you will be able to answer.</p><p>Sas-6 and Ana2 are core centriolar components in flies and homologues of these are also important for centriolar assembly in other organisms. In this work, the authors investigate how these proteins contribute to centriolar structure and function. They accomplish this mainly by solving the structures of critical domains of these two proteins, the coiled-coil domain of Ana2 and the N-terminal domain of Sas-6.</p><p>Although the Ana2/STIL proteins are rather poorly conserved overall, the coiled coil domain is a conserved feature and the authors show that this region is required to target Ana2 to centrioles. This region alone is able to form stable tetramers in solution and, accordingly, a crystal structure revealed a parallel, symmetrical 4 helix bundle. Taking advantage of this structure, the authors made specific point mutations predicted to prevent tetramerization. This mutant both prevented tetramerization in vitro and, importantly, prevented localization to centrioles in vivo.</p><p>Sas-6 proteins are more conserved and it had previously been shown that they need to homo-oligomerize to function in centriole duplication. The C-terminus is important for dimerization and the N-terminus is important for homo-oligomerization. The nature of the oligomerization appears to vary between species and may form rings or spirals depending on species. So to address how Sas-6 behaves, they solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Sas-6. This domain formed large aggregates. Mutation of conserved residue important for the N–N interaction in multiple species also prevented oligomerization in Sas-6. The structure of this dimer was solved to investigate how Sas6 may oligomerize into the canonical cartwheel structure. This structure was similar to the homologues region in other organisms and therefore also likely oligomerizes into a 9-fold ring. Importantly, the mutation that prevented Sas-6 oligomerization perturbed centriole duplication in vivo.</p><p>This work is an excellent example of how high resolution structural data allows one to make specific mutations with predictable and testable outcomes in vivo. Prevention of tetramerization of Ana2 and oligomerization of Sas-6 had very specific effects on centriole assembly. Data such as this is critical to tease out the important similarities and differences between species. We recommend publication and have only a couple of minor comments below.</p><p>1) Is there a reason why a Ramachandran Analysis was not included in the refinement statistics for both structures?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, it would be helpful to mention what antibody was used to detect the Ana2 constructs.

The analysis didn’t highlight any issues with our finalised structures, and all modelled residues fall within allowed regions, with all (Ana2 CCCD), or the vast majority (for SAS-6) in favoured regions of Ramachandran space.
