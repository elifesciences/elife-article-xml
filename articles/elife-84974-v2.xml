In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> airway tree, the interplay of apical extracellular matrix (ECM) components with the underlying membrane and cytoskeleton controls tube elongation, but the link between ECM composition with apical membrane morphogenesis and tube size regulation is elusive. Here, we characterized Emp (epithelial membrane protein), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> CD36 homolog belonging to the scavenger receptor class B protein family. <italic>emp</italic> mutant embryos fail to internalize the luminal chitin deacetylases Serp and Verm at the final stages of airway maturation and die at hatching with liquid filled airways. Emp localizes in apical epithelial membranes and shows cargo selectivity for LDLr-domain containing proteins. <italic>emp</italic> mutants also display over elongated tracheal tubes with increased levels of the apical proteins Crb, DE-cad, and phosphorylated Src (p-Src). We show that Emp associates with and organizes the βH-Spectrin cytoskeleton and is itself confined by apical F-actin bundles. Overexpression or loss of its cargo protein Serp lead to abnormal apical accumulations of Emp and perturbations in p-Src levels. We propose that during morphogenesis, Emp senses and responds to luminal cargo levels by initiating apical membrane endocytosis along the longitudinal tube axis and thereby restricts airway elongation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis-recycling</kwd><kwd>airways</kwd><kwd>scavenger receptor</kwd><kwd>src kinase</kwd><kwd>CD36</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samakovlis</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samakovlis</surname><given-names>Christos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008444</institution-id><institution>O.

Failure in normal tube size acquisition leads to cystic, stenotic, or winding tubes. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> respiratory network, the trachea, provides a well-characterized system for the genetic dissection of tubular organ maturation. Like mammalian lungs, the trachea undergoes a precisely timed series of maturation events to convert the nascent branches into functional airways. First, a transient secretion burst of luminal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsarouhas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Förster et al., 2010</xref>) initiates diametric tube expansion. Luminal proteins assemble into a chitinous central rod and into a cuticular apical extracellular matrix (aECM, taenidia), lining the apical membrane. After 10 hr, luminal material becomes rapidly cleared from the tubes by massive endocytosis involving several endocytic pathways. Finally, a liquid clearance pulse converts the tubes into functional airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsarouhas et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic studies suggested an instructive role of luminal chitin and proteins in tube growth coordination and termination. Mutations affecting chitin biosynthesis (<italic>kkv</italic>) or matrix assembly (<italic>knk</italic>, <italic>gasp</italic>) show irregular tube shapes, diametric expansion and tube maturation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tiklová et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>). Tube elongation is continuous during tracheal development and its termination requires chitin biosynthesis and the secreted chitin deacetylases vermiform (Verm) and serpentine (Serp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beitel and Krasnow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>). These luminal proteins presumably modify the structure and physical properties of the aECM and thereby restrict tube elongation. In addition to the luminal matrix pathway, components involved in the assembly of basolateral septate junctions (SJs) also restrict tube elongation, through the regulation of the subcellular localization of Crumbs (Crb), a transmembrane protein that promotes expansion of the tracheal cell apical surface and tube elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laprise et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, the conserved non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src oncogene at 42A (Src42A) was found to promote axial elongation by controlling the apical cytoskeleton and apical cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Förster and Luschnig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olivares-Castiñeira and Llimargas, 2018</xref>). Additionally, Yorkie (Yki) and several components of the Hippo pathway control tube elongation, along with transcription factors like Blimp-1 and Grainy head (Grh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hemphälä et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robbins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McSharry and Beitel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Skouloudaki et al., 2019</xref>). An appealing model suggests that the interaction between apical membrane and aECM elasticity may influence apical cytoskeletal organization and thereby control tube shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). Although ECM integrity and the apical cytoskeleton appear crucial in tube length regulation, it is unknown how ECM signals are perceived by the airway cells to regulate their shapes during tube maturation.</p><p>Scavenger receptors comprise a superfamily of cell surface membrane proteins that bind and internalize modified lipoproteins and various other types of ligands. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) belongs to class B scavenger receptor family, which includes scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) and lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP2). CD36 is expressed on the surface of many cell types including epithelial, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Disruption of CD36 function in mice can lead to inflammation, atherosclerosis, metabolic disorders, tumor growth, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pascual et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). CD36 has several cargoes, including long-chain fatty acids, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), oxidized phospholipids and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Githaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2022</xref>). In vitro imaging studies of macrophages and endothelial cells propose that CD36 clustering at the cell surface upon engagement of multivalent ligands and in conjunction with the cortical cytoskeleton triggers signal transduction and receptor–ligand complex endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Githaka et al., 2016</xref>). The activity of several signaling effectors, including the Src family kinases, Fyn, Yes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thorne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zani et al., 2015</xref>) and the mitogen-activated kinases, Jun-kinase (JNK) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahaman et al., 2006</xref>) can be regulated by CD36. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome includes a family of 14 CD36-like genes, with distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The genetic analysis of a few members in this class B scavenger receptor family implicated them in phagocytosis, immune responses, and photoreceptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Philips et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stuart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voolstra et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial membrane protein (Emp) shows the highest similarity with CD36 and is selectively expressed in embryonic epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hart and Wilcox, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Emp is a selective receptor for internalization, endosomal targeting, and tracheal luminal clearance of proteins with LDLr-domains. <italic>emp</italic> mutants display over elongated tracheal tubes with increased levels of junctional Crb, DE-cad, and phospho-Src. Reduction of Src42A in <italic>emp</italic> mutants, rescues the tube elongation phenotype indicating that Emp modulates junctional <italic>p</italic>-Src42A levels to control apical membrane expansion and tube length. The organization of the beta-heavy spectrin (βH-Spectrin) cytoskeletal network is compromised in <italic>emp</italic> mutants. Emp binds to βH-Spectrin directly, suggesting that it provides a direct link between ECM, apical membrane, and cytoskeleton during tube maturation process. Re-expression of human CD36 in <italic>emp</italic> mutants can ameliorate the mutant tube phenotypes suggesting conserved functions of Emp.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Emp is a selective scavenger receptor required for tube elongation and luminal protein clearance <italic>emp</italic> (or CG2727 in Flybase) encodes a class-B scavenger receptor expressed in embryonic ectodermal epithelial tissues including the tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hart and Wilcox, 1993</xref>). To elucidate the developmental functions of <italic>emp</italic> in the airways, a deletion mutant (<italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup></italic>, referred as <italic>emp</italic> mutant hereafter) was generated using the FLP/FRT recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PCR mapping of genomic DNA identified a 4.8-kb deletion encompassing exon 2 in the <italic>CG2727</italic> locus. Both immunofluorescence and western blots using a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant Emp (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), failed to detect Emp protein in <italic>emp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Similarly, quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA extracted from late embryos showed a strong reduction of <italic>emp</italic> RNA in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). <italic>emp</italic> homozygous or <italic>Df(2R)BSC608</italic>/<italic>emp</italic> mutants were embryonic lethal with few escapers surviving to first instar larvae. This embryonic lethality could be rescued by the re-expression of a transgenic <italic>emp</italic> construct using the ectodermal driver <italic>69BGal4</italic>. This suggests that the deletion generates a strong loss-of function mutation in <italic>emp</italic> and does not affect any neighboring genes required for embryo viability. To examine a potential role of Emp in airway maturation, we visualized the tracheal tubes during embryonic development in <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>emp</italic> mutants. <italic>emp</italic> embryos at stage 16 showed a 30% over-elongation of the dorsal trunk (DT) compared to the <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but showed no defects in tube diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). <italic>emp</italic> mutants also failed to fill their airways with gas at hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Both phenotypes could be rescued by re-expression of <italic>emp</italic> in tracheal cells of the <italic>emp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ic</xref>). These data indicate that Emp is required for normal tube elongation and gas-filling during embryonic development. The survival of <italic>emp</italic> mutants overexpressing <italic>emp</italic> in the airways was limited to larval stages, suggesting that the tracheal-specific re-expression of <italic>emp</italic> is not sufficient for larval or adult survival. This suggests additional roles for Emp in other tissues. The human homolog of Emp, CD36 shares the overall protein architecture and 30% of amino acid identity with Emp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). We generated a transgenic line expressing the coding sequence of human CD36 and drove its expression in fly airways to test if Emp and CD36 have conserved functions. We found that both the tracheal length and gas-filling defects in <italic>emp</italic> mutants were partially reversed by tracheal CD36 overexpression, arguing for a conserved function of CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Id</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup></italic> mutants show over-elongation of the tracheal tubes and severe luminal clearance defect of Serp.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images showing the dorsal trunk (DT) of <italic>wild-type</italic>, <italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup></italic>, <italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup>;btl&gt;Emp</italic>, <italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup>;btl&gt;CD36</italic> embryos stained for the luminal marker Serp.

Serp and Verm, but not Gasp were selectively retained in the <italic>emp</italic> DT airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggesting a role of Emp in the internalization of a subset of luminal proteins. To confirm the protein clearance phenotypes, we generated <italic>emp</italic> mutants carrying <italic>btl&gt;Serp-GFP</italic> or <italic>btl&gt;Verm-GFP</italic> or <italic>btl&gt;Gasp-mCherry</italic> transgenes and analyzed them by live imaging from 17 h to 21 h after egg laying (AEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The three reporters were normally secreted into the lumen of both <italic>emp</italic> mutants and <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos and at 19 hr they were cleared from the tubes of <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos. In <italic>emp</italic> mutants <italic>Gasp-mCherry</italic> was also cleared from the lumen but the Serp-GFP and Verm-GFP reporters remained inside the tube. This suggests that Emp acts as a selective endocytosis receptor during luminal protein clearance. The unperturbed clearance of Gasp-Cherry suggested differential requirements for the internalization of luminal proteins.</p><p><italic>clathrin</italic> (<italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic>) null mutants show defects in luminal ANF-GFP clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsarouhas et al., 2007</xref>) and tube length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behr et al., 2007</xref>). We stained <italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants for Serp, Verm, and Gasp and analyzed them at late embryonic stages, when luminal clearance is completed in <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos. This analysis showed that Serp and Verm were cleared, whereas Gasp clearance was selectively impaired in <italic>chc<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). This indicates that Emp is involved in a selective, clathrin-independent endocytosis pathway internalizing Verm and Serp.

These genetic experiments suggest that Emp controls tracheal tube elongation and luminal clearance of chitin deacetylases presumably by mediating their endocytosis.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic subcellular localization of Emp during tracheal development</title><p>To further elucidate Emp functions, we generated an antibody against its extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and determined its subcellular localization by co-staining for the previously characterized apical membrane proteins, Crb and Ptp10D, markers of adherens junctions (DE-cad, pY) and septate epithelial junctions (Disc Large/Dlg, Coracle/Cora). During tracheal branch elongation (stage 14–16), <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos showed an Emp enrichment in epithelial apical membranes and in subapical cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Similar to the tracheal cells, Emp showed apical localization, initially diffuse in dots in subapical regions and progressively more defined at the apical cortical region in the epidermis, hindgut and tracheal terminal branches of stage 15–16 <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). During late stage 16 to early stage 17, Emp localization became predominantly restricted in the junctional subapical region of tracheal, epidermal, and intestinal cells, where it colocalized with Crb, DEcad-GFP, and Phospho-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The Emp signal showed only weak colocalization with the SJ markers Coracle, Mtf, Dlg, and with the lateral cytoskeleton marked by α-Spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The massive uptake of luminal material correlates with the disassembly of apical actin bundles running along the transverse tube axis. The diaphanous-like formin, DAAM and the type III receptor tyrosine phosphatases, Ptp4E and Ptp10D, control the organization of F-actin bundles running along the perpendicular tube axis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsarouhas et al., 2019</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Ptp10D4E</italic> (<italic>Ptp10D</italic> and <italic>Ptp4E</italic>) or expression of a dominant negative form of DAAM (<italic>btl</italic>&gt;C-DAAM) disrupt the transverse actin bundle arrays and prematurely initiate luminal protein clearance. Similarly, Latrunculin A (Lat-A) injection in embryos destroys the actin bundles and leads to luminal protein uptake. These experiments had suggested that the transverse F-actin bundles restrict the endocytic uptake of luminal cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsarouhas et al., 2019</xref>). We analyzed wild-type embryos over-expressing the GFP-tagged actin-binding domain of moesin (<italic>btl</italic>&gt;moe-GFP) in tracheal cells stained for Emp and GFP. This showed low colocalization (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.218, <italic>n</italic> = 5) suggesting distinct apical membrane domains of Emp and actin bundles (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). We infer that Emp is predominantly localized in F-actin bundle-free membrane regions to promote the endocytosis and recycling of selected luminal cargos along the longitudinal tube axis. Next, we tested whether the localization of Emp may be altered in <italic>Ptp10D4E</italic> mutants and in embryos overexpressing the dominant negative C-DAAM construct in the airways. Embryos of both genotypes showed premature translocation of Emp to the airway cell junctions compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). This suggests, that similar to luminal protein uptake, the relocation of Emp to the apical junctional region can be induced by the premature disassembly of the actin bundles. Additionally, we analyzed the localization and intensity of Emp and Crb protein stainings along the apical membrane in <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>btl</italic>&gt;C-DAAM embryos. DAAM inactivation increased the intensity of apical Emp punctate accumulations compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>), further arguing that the transverse actin bundles restrict Emp localization at the apical membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic apical distribution of Emp during tube maturation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing dorsal trunk (DT) projections, from stage 14, 15, and 17 embryos, stained for Emp and Crb (Crumbs).

The large size of YRab7 vesicles appeared reduced in <italic>emp</italic> mutants, presumably due to impaired apical internalization and targeting of cargoes to late endosomes. Because Emp also shares homology with the mammalian <italic>lysosomal</italic> integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hart and Wilcox, 1993</xref>), we cannot exclude an additional function of Emp in endo-lysosomal integrity and trafficking. Taken together, these results suggest that Emp functions as a receptor for Serp internalization and endosomal targeting.</p><p>To further investigate Emp cargo specificity, we tested the luminal clearance of GFP constructs, tagged with different domains of Serp in <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos and <italic>emp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We used GFP constructs fused to either Serp-full-length or to the Serp-LDLr-domain (low-density lipoprotein receptor-domain) or to the Serp-CBD-domain (chitin-binding domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) and examined their luminal secretion and clearance. The constructs were expressed and similarly secreted into the tracheal tubes of <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>emp</italic> mutant embryos. The Serp-LDLr reporter was cleared from the lumen efficiently as the full-length Serp-GFP but the CBD-GFP fusion was retained in the tracheal lumen of 20% of <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos. Interestingly, both the Serp-GFP and LDLr-GFP were retained in the lumen of <italic>emp</italic> mutants. These results suggest that the LDLr-domain of Serp, targets GFP to Emp-mediated internalization. CBD-GFP clearance failed in only 40% of the <italic>emp</italic> mutants suggesting that this cargo is also internalized by additional unknown receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). To further test if the addition of the LDLr-domain is sufficient to target an unrelated protein for Emp-mediated uptake, we fused the Serp LDLr-domain to the Gasp-mCherry protein, which does not require <italic>emp</italic> for its luminal clearance. As with the Serp-based constructs we analyzed the clearance of <italic>Gasp<sup>FL</sup>-mCherry</italic> and <italic>Gasp<sup>FL+LDLr</sup>-mCherry</italic> in <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>emp</italic> mutant embryos. Both constructs were normally cleared form the airways of <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos. However, <italic>btl&gt;GaspFL<sup>FL+LDLr</sup>-mCherry,</italic> but not <italic>btl&gt;Gasp<sup>FL</sup>-mCherry,</italic> was retained in the airways of <italic>emp</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data suggest that the LDLr-domain can confer cargo specificity for Emp-mediated internalization. Loss of function <italic>verm serp</italic> mutants or overexpression of <italic>Serp-GFP</italic> leads to over elongation of the tracheal tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luschnig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). We thus examined the effects of Serp and Verm on the levels and localization of Emp. <italic>btl&gt;Serp-GFP</italic> overexpressing embryos showed increased punctate accumulations of Emp and Crb at the apical cell surface compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, in <italic>verm<sup>ex245</sup>,serp<sup>ex7</sup></italic> double mutants, we detected more diffuse punctate cytoplasmic accumulations for both Emp and Crb compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). To investigate whether the changes in intensity and localization of Emp and Crb puncta upon Serp-GFP overexpression or <italic>verm</italic> and <italic>serp</italic> deletion were due to changes in protein synthesis or stability we performed western blots of mutant and <italic>wild-type</italic> embryos. The total protein levels of Crb and Emp did not change in the mutants suggesting that the levels of luminal Serp control the punctate accumulation of Emp and Crb at the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). As expected, overexpression of Emp in the airways (<italic>btl&gt;Emp</italic>) increased the overall levels of cytoplasmic Emp, without a major influence on the accumulation of Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the levels of luminal cargo control the punctate accumulation of Emp and Crb at the apical membrane. <italic>btl &gt;Serp-GFP</italic> overexpression also causes DT tube over-elongation. This phenotype is similar to the loss-of-function phenotype of <italic>verm serp</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) and argues that deviations of the normal luminal Serp levels, too low or too high, can similarly cause tube over-elongation.

This uncovered three potential interacting proteins, CG32506 encoding a RabGAP protein, CG34376 encoding a protein with a predicted Zinc Finger motif and βH-Spec/Kst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We further characterized the interaction with βH-Spec/Kst because of its established role in the apical cytoskeleton organization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thomas and Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips and Thomas, 2006</xref>). The α- and β-heavy Spectrin subunits form tetramers, which assemble in two dimensional networks together with actin underneath the apical plasma membranes. Additionally, βH-Spec/Kst is required for the early steps and endocytic trafficking of V-ATPase in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips and Thomas, 2006</xref>). We used a knock-in, fusion construct of Venus into the <italic>kst</italic> locus to detect endogenous, βH-Spec/Kst together with Emp and α-Spectrin in epithelial cells of the trachea and hindgut. As expected Kst-Venus colocalized with Emp apically, whereas α-Spectrin was also detected along the lateral sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To confirm the Emp binding to Kst and also map their interaction domains we used immunoprecipitation experiments of tagged proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. We expressed V5-tagged Emp and a series of constructs expressing different fragments of βH-Spec/Kst protein fused to the FLAG epitope. We found that the intracellular C-terminus of Emp co-precipitates with the C-terminal region of βH-Spec/Kst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) consistent with their interaction detected in the Y2H system. Additionally, <italic>kst<sup>2</sup></italic> mutants show similar tracheal over elongation phenotypes with <italic>emp</italic> suggesting a functional interaction between Emp and Kst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To further test this, we analyzed the localization and abundance of tagged βH-Spec/Kst in the airways of <italic>emp</italic> mutants. The apical levels of βH-Spec/Kst were severely reduced, while Crb staining was increased and staining of an unrelated apical protein Uninflatable remained unaffected in the <italic>emp</italic> mutants compared to the <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). The localization or levels of Emp were not noticeably affected in <italic>kst</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the C-terminal intracellular domain of Emp binds to apical βH-Spectrin (Kst) and controls the spectrin cytoskeleton presumably by stabilizing βH-Spec/Kst.

The endocytosis defects in <italic>emp</italic> mutants become most apparent during the massive endocytosis wave that removes all secreted luminal components just before gas-filling of the airways. Our comparison of the endocytosis requirements of Serp and Gasp together with the LDLr-domain swap experiments defined a subset of Emp cargoes and indicates that the LDLr-domain targets cargoes to Emp through clathrin-independent endocytosis. These selective requirements of Serp and Gasp internalization are consistent with the view that the choice of endocytic route is a cargo-driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The machinery involved in class B scavenger receptor endocytosis have not been characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but an important characteristic of all clathrin-independent endocytosis pathways is their dependance on the dynamic control of actin polymerization to distort the plasma membrane for cargo internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mayor et al., 2014</xref>). Pioneering biochemical experiments suggested that CD36 receptor clustering is essential for its internalization and signaling in response to multivalent cargo binding. Single molecule tracking of CD36 in primary human macrophages showed that the un-ligated receptor diffuses in linear confinement tracks set by the actin cytoskeleton. These diffusion tracks enable clustering and internalization upon oxLDL-ligand addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jaqaman et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in human endothelial cells the actin cytoskeleton is required for the increase of CD36 clustering upon thrombospondin binding and Fyn, a Src-family kinase, activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Githaka et al., 2016</xref>). These studies argue that CD36 is confined in cytoskeletal tracks and cargo/ligand binding induces its clustering and signaling ability. Similarly, to CD36, Emp function is also tightly connected with the apical cytoskeleton. First, <italic>emp</italic> activity is confined in apical ‘macro’-domains along the longitudinal tube axis by the transverse, DAAM-dependent actin filaments. Disruption of these filaments induces massive endocytosis and re-localization of Emp. Additionally, the initially punctate Emp distribution along the apical membrane becomes aggregated upon overexpression of luminal Serp, suggesting that LDLr-domains on chitin-binding proteins induce Emp clustering. Apart from the Emp similarities to CD36, our results also reveal an unexpected direct function of Emp in organizing the apical Spectrin and actin cytoskeleton. The distribution of the DAAM-formin, the transverse actin bundle density and the apical accumulation of Kst are all disrupted in <italic>emp</italic> mutants. Because we showed that the conserved C-terminal intracellular domain of Emp binds directly to Kst, we propose that a central function of Emp, and possibly CD36, is to also directly organize the epithelial cytoskeleton. This notion is supported by the ability of human CD36 to partially rescue the <italic>emp</italic> mutant phenotypes when overexpressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> airways.</p><p>How can a scavenger receptor restrict epithelial tube elongation? In the interval of embryonic stages 13–16, regulated Src and DAAM activities promote tube elongation and the formation and alignment of the transverse actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>). These bundles inhibit Emp internalization and restrict Serp endocytosis and trafficking to the longitudinal tube axis. We showed that Emp is directly linked to the apical βH-Spectrin cytoskeleton and is required for its assembly. This cytoskeletal organization might indirectly interfere with DAAM localization and presumably with Src42A activation and function as also proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>. These data suggest that endocytosis of luminal proteins during tube elongation is controlled by at least two parallel pathways, one enabling Emp-endocytosis along the longitudinal tube axis and one restricting it along the transverse axis. We hypothesize that in the bundle-free membrane domains, Emp associates with Kst and presumably establishes an endocytosis domain, where Serp-mediated Emp clustering leads to internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). A similar function for Kst enabling endocytosis and trafficking of apical H<sup>+</sup> V-ATPase has been proposed in the brush border of the larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine, where its anchoring to the membrane remains unknown. The luminal levels of chitin deacetylases, like Serp, and other chitin modifying proteins are transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yao et al., 2017</xref>) and are predicted to control the biophysical properties of the apical ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cui et al., 2016</xref>). We infer that luminal Serp bound to chitin generates a multivalent ligand and is continuously recognized and endocytosed by Emp selectively along the longitudinal tube axis. Together with the clustered receptors, apical membrane and ‘passenger’ transmembrane proteins are expected to follow in the Emp endocytic vesicles. The over-elongation defects in <italic>emp</italic> mutant airways can be explained by the failure to balance elongation induced by Src activation with endocytosis of membrane and transmembrane regulators on the longitudinal tube axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). Src42A phosphorylation levels have been proposed as a feedback mechanism of the aECM to the underlying cells to modulate proper cytoskeletal organization in airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2016</xref>). Our work is complementary to this mechanism and further argues that Emp senses and responds to the levels of specific ECM cargoes by initiating apical membrane protein endocytosis and recycling during tube elongation. After protein clearance, Emp and Crb accumulate at the subapical region of the longitudinal junctions, where they could enable cytoskeletal interactions and the modulation of apical membrane tension.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The proposed model of Emp regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D drawing shows the multicellular tube (dorsal trunk) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> airways.

The mechanism of Crb recycling in airway cells involves retromer components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olivares-Castiñeira and Llimargas, 2017</xref>) but the selective targeting mechanism to longitudinal junctions is still unknown. The re-localization of Emp to the apical epithelial junctions during airway maturation is accompanied by massive alteration in Src activity, which is not restricted to the tracheal system but is common to several ectodermal organs including neurons. This suggests that scavenger receptor endocytosis has a general, but poorly understood role, in embryonic morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. Our work on Emp provides an entry toward elucidating the roles of scavenger receptor class B in development and pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p>The <italic>emp<sup>e3d1</sup></italic> null mutant was generated by FLP-FRT site-directed recombination using two piggyBac elements (PBacWH#021071 and PBacRB#e0441541).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amin S. Ghabrial (Reviewer #1); Shigeo Hayashi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One point of concern expressed by all three is the phenotype description and interpretation of Srp-GFP overexpression and its effect on Src. Since this is the critical point linking the endocytosis to the anisotropic tube elongation, the authors should be encouraged to address and clarify this.</p><p>2) The authors fail to clearly show the localization of Emp at the apical membrane and its connection to apical actin structures and chitinuous aECM.</p><p>3) Discussing how the junction-enriched Crumbs contribute to selective axial cell elongation will be desirable to expand the scope of this work.</p><p>4) Discussing a possible molecular mechanism linking Emp to pSrc distribution would contribute to a better insight into the regulation of tube length during embryonic tracheal development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of tubulogenesis and of the critical role of vesicle trafficking in this process. I have a number of questions that I would like the authors to address in a revision and several errors that they can correct to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>– p 5. does emp expression driven by 69BGAL4 rescue to adulthood?</p><p>– What does it mean that some embryos did clear their lumens but still (I assume) showed tracheal defects?</p><p>– Is it ultimately pSrc that is the target of Emp? is its distribution affected in all embryos examined (eg. a fully-penetrant defect)?</p><p>– A description of chc mutant phenotype would be helpful – is there overlap with the emp loss of function phenotype?</p><p>– What happens to the 25% of embryos with normal gas-filling? do they have tube length defects? How penetrant is the tube length defects?</p><p>– How does Emp localization look in unicellular tubes? and are unicellular tubes also unable to gas-fill?</p><p>– p 11 and 13.</p><p>However, btl&gt;GaspFL+LDLr-mCherry, but not btl&gt;GaspFL-mCherry, was retained in the airways of emp embryos (Figure 3F compared with Figure 1E).</p><p>BUT, GaspFL+LDLr is not shown in figure 3F. This needs to be added.</p><p>Downregulation of src activity and the levels of luminal Serp-GFP are sensed by Emp to control apical membrane protein endocytosis and trafficking, and thereby</p><p>elongation.</p><p>This is a bit confusing, can it be re-phrased in a wild-type context: whatever Emp is doing normally it is not via an overexpressed transgene (Serp-GFP)? Does pSrc fall just before the surge in endocytosis? Is that dependent upon Emp? does decreased luminal Serp put the breaks on endocytosis? What about verm, serp het embryos; 50% reduction in cargo, does this affect endocytosis? If the activity of Src is regulated downstream of Emp, what is the sensing that Emp is doing? Isn't Emp acting on Src (which seems to be what is shown in the model figure)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 2C it is not clear what is shown in the panel of the btl&gt;cDAAM.

Since this is the critical point linking the endocytosis to the anisotropic tube elongation, the authors should be encouraged to address and clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work has shown that changes in chitin synthesis or ECM integrity affects the levels of phosphorylated Src42A (pSrc) at cell junctions (Ozturk-Colak et al., 2016). Loss of Verm and Serp also causes p-Src upregulation and over-elongation and we also show that Serp overexpression leads to p-Src downregulation as expected (Figure 7b). Counter intuitively, Serp overexpression also results in tube over-elongation (Wang et al., 2006). This overexpression paradox could be explained by an indirect, src-independent effect of the overexpressed luminal Serp-GFP on tube elongation. Although Src42A is necessary and sufficient for cell shape changes during tracheal tube elongation (Forster and Luschnig, 2012; Nelson et al., 2012), there are additional src-independent pathways involving septate junction components affecting normal tube elongation (Laprise et al., 2010). The overexpression experiment is informative on the roles of Emp in shaping the apical membrane and cytoskeleton. But the tube overelongation phenotype, resembles the airway over-elongation of null <italic>serp verm</italic> mutants. We interpret that the luminal levels of Serp are tightly controlled and the tube elongation phenotype of UAS-Serp GFP reflects a dominant effect that could be due to interference with the luminal functions of Serp or it’s recycling back to the membrane or with the function of SJ components.</p><p>In the context of this work, we are not able to delve further on the dominant effect of Serp-GFP overexpression on tube elongation. All we can state with certainty is that the normal levels of Serp are required for optimal elongation and that the Serp-GFP overexpression causes a dominant effect, which is known (Wang et al., 2006). Overall, the novelty of our data and interpretations lies in that there are at least two parallel, spatially segregated, mechanisms converging on the apical cytoskeleton and on the regulation of apical cell shapes (please see Figure 8). One is defined by Src phosphorylation, which promotes the formation of F-actin bundles by DAAM (Matusek et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2012). The other is defined by Emp clustering by Serp and its direct association with βHeavy-Spectrin to facilitate endocytosis and apical recycling (Figure 2 and Figure 2 suppl. 3, Figure 4A, Figure 6 and Figure 6 suppl-1). Our data propose that the two mechanisms are antagonistic, DAAM-bundles restrict the localization of Emp and endocytosis, and Emp clustering in response to normal cargo levels organizes the localization of the actin bundles. It is possible that excessive Emp clustering and/or the interference with the ECM integrity (due to the deacetylase activity of Serp) upon Serp-GFP overexpression may cause additional dominant effects on Src activation, ECM assembly, protein endocytosis, protein and membrane recycling and thereby interfere with tube elongation. We hypothesize that the effects of <italic>verm serp</italic> loss of function (heterozygous or homozygous) and UAS-Serp GFP overexpression on Src activation and tube elongation are significant, but partly mediated by Emp endocytosis. This is supported by the quantification of the p-Src signals in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We have added few sentences addressing this issue in the text (lines: 500-504 and 723-733).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors fail to clearly show the localization of Emp at the apical membrane and its connection to apical actin structures and chitinuous aECM.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure that we understood the meaning of “clearly show” without a concrete example of what experiment would constitute clear evidence for the localization of Emp in the apical membrane. Nevertheless, to address this point, we additionally co-stained wild-type embryos with anti-Emp and anti-Ptp10D (an apical transmembrane protein) and also wild-type embryos expressing the apical membrane reporter UAS-CD4-Tom with anti-Emp and anti-RFP. These new experiments showed strong co-localization of Emp with Ptp10D and CD4-Tom in the apical membrane (Figure 2B and Figure 2 suppl.2) by high resolution confocal microscopy. In the first version, we had shown that Emp colocalizes with the apical trans-membrane protein Crb (Figure 2A) and the Zonula Adherens (ZA) marker pY (Figure 2 Suppl. 1C). Emp also directly binds and colocalizes with apical cytoskeletal organizer βHeavy-Spectrin (Figure 6E). Our analysis, and given that Emp contains two trans-membrane domains, strongly supports the apical membrane localization of Emp in the airways. Typically, an endocytosis scavenger receptor is also internalized in the endosomal compartment and recycled to the membrane or degraded.</p><p>To relate Emp localization to the apical actin bundles, we have co-stained wild type embryos over-expressing a GFP-tagged version of the actin binding domain of moesin (<italic>btl</italic>&gt;moe-GFP) with anti-Emp and anti-GFP in tracheal cells. We have shown earlier that moe-GFP faithfully labels the cortical actin bundles, running perpendicular to the tube axis, during tube maturation (Tsarouhas et al., 2019). Analysis of <italic>xz</italic> or <italic>yz</italic> sections within Z-stacks of airy-scan confocal images in these embryos showed low colocalization (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 218, <italic>n</italic> = 5) and predominantly complementary pattern of apical Emp and actin bundle domains (GFP). These results further support our interpretation that Emp, localizes in the bundle-free membrane regions in physical association with βHeavy-spectrin to promote the endocytosis and recycling of selected cargos. The new data are shown in Figure 2 suppl. 3A-D.</p><p>Regarding the last point of connections between Emp and its cargo Serp, we had shown with high resolution confocal microscopy that the receptor and its cargo, Serp, colocalize in common endosomes. This is disrupted in <italic>emp</italic> mutants, and additionally genetic manipulations of the cargo or the receptor changes the localization of each other (Figure 3A-C), suggesting that the connections between Emp and Serp are functionally significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discussing how the junction-enriched Crumbs contribute to selective axial cell elongation will be desirable to expand the scope of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we view apical membrane, Crb or Ecad as passive cargoes of Serp/Emp endocytosis and recycling in the actin cable-free regions along the longitudinal tube axis (Figure 8 legends). As previously proposed Crb may change the apical actin cytoskeleton and its tensile properties at the junctions. This is very interesting but beyond our focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussing a possible molecular mechanism linking Emp to pSrc distribution would contribute to a better insight into the regulation of tube length during embryonic tracheal development.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not detected any direct molecular link between Emp and Src phosphorylation. In a simple model, p-Src levels during tube elongation would be controlled by the levels of RTK signaling including Stit, InR, EGFR, PTP (Tsarouhas et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2009) (Tsarouhas et al., 2019), (Olivares-Castineira and Llimargas, 2017). p-Src contributes to DAAM-mediated actin cytoskeletal remodeling, tube elongation, and the construction of the perpendicular actin rings (Matusek et al., 2006b; Nelson et al., 2012). We have shown before that these perpendicular structures inhibit endocytosis on the transverse axis (Tsarouhas et al., 2019). The levels of luminal Serp might be sensed by Emp in the apical membrane and Emp clustering induces apical membrane endocytosis. This apical membrane internalization constantly balances actin polymerization by DAAM activity on the bundles and tube elongation. Parts of the membrane and TM proteins are recycled to the apical junctions. We showed that Emp is directly linked to the βH-Spectrin cytoskeleton and is required for its assembly. This cytoskeletal organization indirectly interferes with DAAM localization and presumably Src activation/function as also proposed by (Nelson et al., 2012). We have tried to incorporate the interpretation of our results in the Figure model (Figure 8). We have added a few more sentences in the discussion to clarify this (lines: 799-802 and 820-827).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of tubulogenesis and of the critical role of vesicle trafficking in this process.

There is no available live imaging reporter to precisely quantify pSrc activity in living embryos. The p-Src decrease is dependent on Emp since <italic>emp</italic> mutants show strong increase in p-Src levels during this interval. Luminal Serp levels are a key aspect of Emp internalization. Our data are consistent with the model, where increased Serp accumulation during development is necessary to induce Emp receptor clustering, which culminates with luminal protein clearance.

We had shown before that Serp-GFP overexpression unexpectedly causes similar tube elongation as the double mutant of <italic>serp verm</italic> indicating that the levels of luminal Serp are important for its normal function. Nevertheless, we have followed the suggestion from the reviewer and found that <italic>btl&gt;Serp-GFP</italic> overexpressing embryos showed decreased Crb signals along both longitudinal and transverse junctions, in contrast to emp mutants where Crb signals were only affected along the longitudinal junctions. This suggests that the &quot;artificially&quot; high levels of Serp may interfere with Crb levels and the general tensile properties of the junctions.</p><p>We iterate that tube elongation involves several mechanisms including SJ components, Crb retrograde transport (Dong et al., 2013; Olivares-Castineira and Llimargas, 2017), transcriptional control (Hemphälä et al., 2003; Robbins et al., 2014; Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2018). Future experiments are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which high Serp levels interferes with tube over-elongation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>(A) Confocal images showing the tracheal DT stained for Crb (yellow) in wild-type and btl&gt;SerpFLembryos.
