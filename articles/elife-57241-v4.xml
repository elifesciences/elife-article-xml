<italic>Drosophila</italic> centriole requires that the cartwheel molecule, Sas6, physically associates with Gorab, a trans-Golgi component. How Gorab achieves these disparate associations is unclear. Here, we use hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to define Gorab’s interacting surfaces that mediate its subcellular localization. We identify a core stabilization sequence within Gorab’s C-terminal coiled-coil domain that enables homodimerization, binding to Rab6, and thereby trans-Golgi localization. By contrast, part of the Gorab monomer’s coiled-coil domain undergoes an antiparallel interaction with a segment of the parallel coiled-coil dimer of Sas6. This stable heterotrimeric complex can be visualized by electron microscopy. Mutation of a single leucine residue in Sas6’s Gorab-binding domain generates a Sas6 variant with a sixteenfold reduced binding affinity for Gorab that cannot support centriole duplication. Thus, Gorab dimers at the Golgi exist in equilibrium with Sas6-associated monomers at the centriole to balance Gorab’s dual role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Gorab</kwd><kwd>Sas6</kwd><kwd>centriole duplication</kwd><kwd>Rab6</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovacs</surname><given-names>Levente</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS113930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glover</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MAESTRO (UMO-2014/14/A/NZ1/00306)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fatalska</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><name><surname>Dadlez</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P28231-B28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W-1258 Doktoratskollegs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stepinac</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dual functional protein, Gorab, associates with the Golgi as a dimer but as a monomer with the procentriole cartwheel protein, Sas6, to mediate centriole duplication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrioles are the ninefold symmetrical microtubule arrays found at the core of centrosomes, the bodies that organize cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase and mitosis. Centrioles also serve as the basal bodies of both non-motile and motile cilia, and flagellae. The core components of centrioles and the molecules that regulate their assembly are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brito et al., 2012</xref>). The initiation of centriole duplication first requires that the mother and daughter pair of centrioles at each spindle pole disengage at the end of mitosis. Plk4 then phosphorylates Ana2 (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)/STIL(<italic>human</italic>) at its N-terminal part, which promotes Ana2 recruitment to the site of procentriole formation, and at its C-terminal part, which enables Ana2 to bind and thereby recruit Sas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dzhindzhev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McLamarrah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). The ensuing assembly of a ninefold symmetrical arrangement of Sas6 dimers provides the structural basis for the ninefold symmetrical cartwheel structure at the procentriole’s core. Sas6 interacts with Cep135 and in turn with Sas4 (<italic>Drosophila</italic>)/CPAP (<italic>human</italic>), which provides the linkage to centriole microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hiraki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jerka-Dziadosz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roque et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified an unexpected requirement for the protein, Gorab, to establish the ninefold symmetry of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>). Flies lacking Gorab are uncoordinated due to basal body defects in sensory cilia, which lose their ninefold symmetry, and also exhibit maternal effect lethality due to failure of centriole duplication in the syncytial embryo. Gorab is a trans-Golgi-associated protein. Its human counterpart is mutated in the wrinkly skin disease, gerodermia osteodysplastica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hennies et al., 2008</xref>). By copying a missense mutation in gerodermia patients that disrupts the association of Gorab with the Golgi, we were able to create mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab also unable to localize to trans-Golgi. However, this mutant form of Gorab was still able to rescue the centriole and cilia defects of <italic>gorab</italic> null flies. We also found that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype that can be overcome by a second mutation preventing Golgi targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hiraki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, centriole and Golgi functions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab are separable.</p><p>The Golgi apparatus both delivers and receives vesicles to and from multiple cellular destinations and is also responsible for modifying proteins and lipids. Gorab resembles a group of homodimeric rod-like proteins, the golgins, which function in vesicle tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Short et al., 2005</xref>). The golgins associate through their C-termini with different Golgi domains, and their N-termini both capture vesicles and provide specificity to their tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>). There is known redundancy of golgin function, reflected by the overlapping specificity of the types of vesicles they capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Gorab is rapidly displaced from the <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi apparatus by Brefeldin A, suggesting that its peripheral membrane association requires ARF-GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egerer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies of human Gorab indicated its ability to form a homodimer in complex with Rab6 and identified its putative coiled-coil region as a requirement to localize at the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egerer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Witkos et al., 2019</xref>). Our own studies on its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart supported Gorab’s ability to interact with itself, potentially through the predicted coiled-coil motif. However, we also found this region to overlap with the region required for Gorab’s interaction with Sas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>). These findings raised the questions of how Gorab’s putative coiled-coil region could facilitate interactions with the Golgi, on the one hand, and its Sas6 partner, on the other. To address this, we have employed hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS). HDX enables the identification of dynamic features of protein by monitoring the exchange of main chain amide protons to deuteria in solution. Here, we have used HDX-MS to monitor the retarded exchange of amide protons localized between interacting regions of Gorab and Sas6 to identify the interacting surfaces within the Gorab–Sas6 complex. Together with other biophysical characterizations, this has revealed that Gorab is able to form a homo-dimer through its coiled-coil region but that it interacts as a monomer with the C-terminal coiled-coil of Sas6. Mutation of a critical amino acid in Sas6’s Gorab-binding domain generates a variant of Sas6 with a sixteenfold reduced binding affinity for Gorab that is no longer able to support centriole duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gorab dimerizes through its C-terminus to achieve Golgi localization</title><p>A previous study has identified a Golgi-targeting domain region of human Gorab from amino acids (aa) 200–277 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egerer et al., 2015</xref>). This region, comprising predominantly a putative coiled-coil sequence, corresponds to aa 246–323 of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab. To determine whether this region conferred the ability to homodimerize a characteristic of the golgins, we first wished to determine the oligomeric state of Gorab in solution. To this end, we expressed N-terminally MBP-tagged <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Gorab in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, affinity purified the recombinant protein on amylose resin, and carried out size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) to determine its molecular mass (Mw) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whereas the theoretical mass of monomeric MBP-Gorab is 79.4 kDa, SEC-MALS indicated the Mw of the protein eluting in the major peak as 146.1 kDa. Thus, similar to other golgins, MBP-Gorab behaves as a dimer in solution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gorab dimerizes through its C-terminal part to achieve Golgi localization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Size exclusion chromatography-multiple angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) of Gorab.

The HDX pattern of Gorab after 10 s incubation with D<sub>2</sub>O buffer indicated almost complete exchange of hydrogen with deuterium in the N-terminal (aa 1–200) and very C-terminal parts (aa 318–338) of the protein, indicating high flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Restricted deuterium exchange in the C-terminal part suggested three distinct protected, structured regions (aa 200–220, 230–240, and 252–315) matching the coiled-coil predictions by the COILS program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>). This suggests that the dimerization of Gorab might be driven by coiled-coil interactions on its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SEC-MALS of two Gorab C-terminal truncations (aa 191–338 and 191–279) confirmed the importance of the aa 279–338 region in the dimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the HDX experiment, longer periods of incubation identified regions permitting ‘breathing’ of this secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), such that after 150 min only the region between aa 270–287, and especially aa 278–284, remained protected from the deuterium exchange. The high protection shown by this region is most likely to reflect regions of stability around the core of Gorab’s dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>It is also possible that the regions of stability detected in the above experiment may be caused by allosteric changes coming from interactions elsewhere. Therefore, to test the relevance of the aa 270–287 fragment for homodimerization, we designed a set of MBP-Gorab constructs harboring deletions within the C-terminal part and determined their molecular mass using SEC-MALS. This revealed that the aa 260–286 region is essential for dimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in accord with the findings of HDX-MS. Moreover, SEC-MALS data revealed that deletions within other parts of the C-terminal domain disrupt the dimeric structure of MBP-Gorab and result in the formation of higher-order structures, or mixtures of these with monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the entire C-terminal domain (aa 200–320) is organized in such a way to permit dimerization and that even minor changes within the sequence lead to structural instability.</p><p>To test the consequence of disrupting dimerization in vivo, we created a transgene encoding Gorab with a 282–286 aa deletion. We then generated transgenic flies with full-length (FL) Gorab or Gorab Δ282–286 under the control of constitutive poly-ubiquitin promoter, allowing moderately elevated expression of the given transgene. We used a site-specific integrase system to integrate them into the same genomic location so that they would be expressed at a similar level. An eGFP tag on the N-terminus of the transgenic protein allowed us to determine its subcellular localization in primary spermatocytes and larval imaginal discs. In agreement with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>), the vast majority of wild-type eGFP-Gorab localized in the position of the trans-Golgi, inside the Golgi cisternae and surrounded by the GM130 cis-Golgi marker, in large primary spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Accordingly, the majority of FL eGFP-Gorab colocalized with Golgin-245 trans-Golgi marker as we observed in primary spermatocytes and wing imaginal discs and, in accord with our previous findings, a small fraction of FL Gorab was recruited to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). By contrast, Gorab Δ282–286 did not localize to the Golgi but retained its centrosomal localization both in primary spermatocytes and in wing disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In line with its centriolar localization, Ubq-Gorab Δ282–286 was able to fully rescue the coordination, viability, and fertility defects of <italic>gorab</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>). This indicates that dimerization of Gorab is required for its trans-Golgi localization but not for its centriolar localization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gorab interacts with Sas6 through its C-terminus and forms a heterotrimeric complex</title><p>The above findings indicated that Gorab localizes to the centrosome as monomer, leading us to investigate Gorab’s oligomeric state in relation to its previously reported interaction with Sas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore set out to reconstitute a complex between these two proteins in vitro that we could analyse using SEC and SEC-MALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). SEC confirmed that when mixed in a molar ratio 1 part Gorab : 2 parts Sas6, a stable complex was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). MALS measurements indicated the molecular mass of this complex eluting in the major peak to be 258.7 kDa (±0.061%), which would correspond to a heterotrimer of homodimeric MBP-Sas6 and monomeric MBP-Gorab, whose theoretical mass is 272.2 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

By analyzing the HDX patterns for Gorab, we could observe two distinct changes in deuteration levels. The 230–260 aa segment became slightly more stable when Gorab was in complex with Sas6 than when on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, pink box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the 270–315 aa segment appeared to be destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, blue box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is most likely that the 230–260 aa segment of Gorab, which is stabilized upon Sas6 binding, represents the interaction surface between the two proteins. As Gorab appears to dissociate to a monomer during complex formation with Sas6, this suggests that the aa 270–315 segment at the dimerization core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>) becomes destabilized. To test the importance of the region of Gorab indicated by HDX-MS to form an interaction surface with Sas6, we performed binding assays between Sas6 and a series of deletions and truncations of Gorab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This revealed Gorab Δ244–259 aa as the shortest deletion that gives the maximal observed decrease in Sas6 binding. The flanking deletions, such as Δ219–244 aa and Δ260–286 aa, could still bind Sas6 but weakly. C-terminal truncations showed a weak decrease in binding only when they removed sequence between 260 and 270 aa and a strong decrease in binding if they removed residues between 246 and 260 aa. These findings accord with the HDX data and strongly suggest that the 244–260 aa region of Gorab binds strongly to Sas6 and that weaker interacting surfaces extend between aa 219–244 and aa 260–270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sas6 interacts with Gorab via its C-terminus</title><p>We then wished to determine the region within Sas6 that interacts with Gorab. To do so, we monitored HDX of Sas6 alone and when in complex with Gorab. We observed clear differences in deuteration level within 20 residues (aa 440–460) towards the C-terminus of Sas6 that showed increased stability when in complex with Gorab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also observed less pronounced protection in peptides from other regions. However, our previous study showed that the Sas6 region aa 351–472 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>) is sufficient to bind Gorab. Moreover, we found that the Sas6 segment aa 404–463 forms a stable complex with the 191–279 aa segment of Gorab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore concluded that the Sas6 region aa 440–460, showing the highest protection from HDX upon Gorab binding, lies on the interaction surface. This led us to attempt to identify single residues within the aa 440–460 region that are essential for this interaction. A multiple sequence alignment of this region of Sas6 from various species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) identified highly conserved aa that we mutated to alanine residues (M440A, L447A, S452A, L456A).

In this case, we mixed the fluorescently labeled MBP-Gorab coiled-coil fragment (aa 191–279) with non-fluorescent MBP-wild type Sas6 or the Sas6 L447A mutant, measured the change in the diffusion time with increasing Sas6 concentrations, and determined the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of the Gorab–Sas6 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To control for the ability of wild-type Sas6 dimers to oligomerize through their head-to-head interactions, we also tested Gorab binding to the Sas6-F143D mutant, which abolishes higher oligomerization and found no significant differences in the outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Our measurements revealed that the K<sub>D</sub> of Gorab’s interaction with wild-type Sas6 was in the low nanomolar range of 47 nM, but that the binding strength to Sas6 L447A mutant was 16 times weaker (K<sub>D</sub> = 798 nM). We next investigated the impact of mutations in the aa 440–460 region of Sas6 on its ability to self-associate. We found that Sas6-wild type, Sas6-M440A, Sas6-L447A, Sas6-S452A, and Sas6-L456A all displayed the same elution profile in SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This indicates that all of the Sas6 point mutants behave like Sas6-wild type in being able to form homodimers. Moreover, L447, which is located at the C-terminal region of the coiled coil of Sas6, is predicted to lie at position ‘a’ of the ‘a-g’ heptad repeats with M440 lying in a similar position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). Yet L447A prevents Gorab binding, whereas M440A does not. Our modeling analysis using CCBuilder 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wood and Woolfson, 2018</xref>) predicts that mutants M440A and L447A have a BUDE energy of –717 and –714, respectively, which is very similar to that of Sas6-wild type (−724) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). This is consistent with the confirmed dimeric state of all the Sas6 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Notably, however, residue L447 is closer to the C-terminus of the predicted coiled-coil of Sas6 than M440, and the downstream two heptads following L447 may not hold the dimer tightly together as only one of the residues at positions ‘a’ and ‘d’ of these two heptads, that is, I457, is hydrophobic. We therefore conclude that the L447A does not prevent Sas6 from forming a homodimer but the local structure around L447 might be partially perturbed in the mutant L447A. Such subtle change in the local region seems to be sufficient to prevent the interaction of Sas6-L447A with Gorab.</p><p>To determine the consequences of the Sas6-L447A mutation for interactions with Gorab in vivo, we created transgenic flies expressing either wild-type Sas6 or the Sas6-L447A mutant under the control a GAL4-inducible UAS regulatory sequence. We also generated transgenes of Sas6-M440A as this mutation is predicted to lie adjacent to L447 in the Sas6 coiled coil but does not affect Gorab-binding ability. The transgenes were integrated into the same genomic location using a site-specific integrase system to ensure their expression at comparable levels. The expression of these transgenes was induced either by neuronal elav-GAL4 or by ubiquitous Act5C-GAL4 driver in a <italic>sas6 null</italic> mutant background. We first assessed the ability of Sas6-L447A to rescue the coordination phenotypes of the <italic>sas6 null</italic> mutant raised at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Pharate <italic>sas6 null</italic> adults are uncoordinated to the extent that only about 50% of pupae can eclose from the pupal case and the ones that do emerge are unable to complete our climbing test (to scale within 15 s). These mutant phenotypes were completely rescued by the elevated expression of wild-type or M440A Sas6 transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). In contrast, Sas6 L447A was able to rescue the eclosion phenotype of the <italic>sas6 null</italic> and could only partially the coordination phenotype such that 30% of these flies were able to pass the climbing test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F,</xref> <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). If this reflected failure of Sas6-L447A to bind Gorab, then the phenotype should be similar to that of <italic>gorab</italic> mutants. When <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> flies are raised at 29°C, both mutant alleles display similarly severe uncoordination defects and the flies are completely unable to climb. At 25°C, however, <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> flies showed a similarly severe total loss of coordination, whereas <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> flies were moderately uncoordinated with around 25% being able to climb 5 cm in 15 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Flies with heteroallelic combinations of <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> showed intermediate phenotypes, more similar to <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic>. Thus the extent of rescue of the coordination phenotype of the <italic>sas6 null</italic> by overexpression of Sas6 L447A was reminiscent of the <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> hypomorph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,</xref> <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>) and in accord with the greatly reduced ability of Sas6-L447A to bind Gorab.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57241-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Climbing test of <italic>sas6<sup>o</sup></italic> flies with and without indicated Sas6 variant transgenes.</title><p>Flies were transferred into assay vials without anesthesia and let them accommodate for 15 min, after which they were tapped down, and their climbing ability was assessed.</p></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57241-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Climbing test of <italic>gorab</italic> mutant flies.</title><p>Flies were transferred into assay vials without anesthesia and let them accommodate for 15 min, after which they were tapped down, and their climbing ability was assessed.</p></caption></media><p>To analyze the relative consequences of the above mutations on centrosome number, we used late third larval instar wing discs as a model. The wing pouch part of the disc (the region that will form the wing blades of adults) is formed by columnar epithelial cells, in which interphase centrioles are apically localized and can be imaged and quantified on a single plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As the cells of this layer enter mitosis, they round up and move deeper within the epithelium allowing mitotic centrioles to be imaged at the spindle poles on a different plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that the elevated expression of both wild-type Sas6 and the Sas6-M440A transgene from the Act5C-GAL4 driver fully rescued the centriole loss of <italic>sas6</italic> null larvae in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, Sas6 L447A gave only partial rescue restoring only 8% of centriole numbers. This compares to the <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> null mutant in which centrosomes are absent and the <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> hypomorph, in which centrosome numbers are reduced to around 35% of wild type. Rescue of the <italic>sas6</italic> null by Sas6-L447A restored centrosome numbers to a similar level as in the heteroallelic <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup>/gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> combination, which is strongly hypomorphic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found a similar distribution of centrosomes in the mitotic wing disc cells of the above flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Whereas expression of wild-type Sas6 or Sas6-M440A totally rescued the complete mitotic centrosome loss of the <italic>sas6</italic> null, expression of Sas6-L477A resulted in partial rescue in which we observed several phenotypic categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>): (1) mitotic cells with two normal centrosomes, (2) cells with a single normal centriole, (3) cells with two centrioles with one showing reduced asterless (Asl) and absent Rcd4 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), (4) cells with two centrioles with both showing such reduced staining, (5) cells with only one centriole having reduced staining, and (6) cells with no centrioles. The distribution of cells exhibiting these phenotypes indicated that expression of Sas6 L447A in the <italic>sas6</italic> null background resulted in a phenotype most similar to that of heteroallelic <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup>/gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> flies or <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> null flies. Thus, the consequences of Sas6-L447A upon centrosome number accord with the protein having reduced ability to bind Gorab.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Consequences of Sas6 L447A upon Gorab recruitment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the organization of centrosomes in columnar wing disc epithelia in wandering late third instar larvae.

This led us to determine how Sas6-L447A would affect Gorab localization in wing discs. To this end, we generated fly lines giving constitutive expression of GFP-tagged wild-type Gorab from the poly-ubiquitin promoter and wild-type Sas6, Sas6-M440A, or Sas6-L447A from the UAS promoter driven by Act5C-GAL4. We then stained wing discs to reveal the centriole protein Asl and monitored localization of GFP-Gorab in both interphase and mitotic centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Asl staining revealed centrosomes to be absent in <italic>sas6</italic> null discs and rescued by either wild-type Sas6 or Sas6-M440A in both interphase and mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In all cases, Gorab could be detected on these rescued centrosomes. We were, however, unable to detect Gorab on the rare centrosomes present following expression of Sas6-L447A in the <italic>sas6</italic> null background irrespective of the intensity of Asl or Rcd4 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, n = 243 centrioles counted in total). Thus, Sas6-L447A binds Gorab extremely poorly in vitro and is unable to recruit Gorab onto the centriole in vivo, a property that is associated with dramatically reduced centriole duplication even though Sas6 L447A is still able to localize to the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results show that the L447-dependent interaction of Sas6 with Gorab mediates Gorab’s association with the centrosome, and as a consequence, the phenotype of <italic>Sas6-L447A</italic> strongly resembles that of a <italic>gorab</italic> strong hypomorph.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Gorab undergoes an antiparallel interaction with Sas6</title><p>Having mapped the minimal regions essential for the interaction on both Gorab and Sas6, we wanted to determine the orientation of each of the protein molecules within the complex.

The resulting difference spectra between Gorab alone and Gorab bound to Rab6 over intervals between 10 s and 30 min indicated the interaction to be made by the 190–320 aa segment of Gorab, the coiled-coil region of its C-terminal part. However, the precise amino acid region varied as the period of incubation in deuterated water increased. The shorter incubation times of around 10 s identify regions of intermediate stability, around 220–250 aa, whereas at longer times this region is fully exchanged and this difference no longer observed. Instead, at longer times we also localized changes in the more stable 250–300 aa region.

Whereas Gorab localized to the Golgi alongside GM130 in <italic>rab6+/-</italic> cells, cells from the <italic>rab6</italic>-/- clone had no Gorab at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together, this strongly suggests that interactions between the dimerizing C-terminal part of Gorab and Rab6 are required for Gorab to localize to the Golgi.</p><p>We then considered how Sas6 might interfere with the binding of Gorab to Rab6. To this end, we immobilized Rab6 as bait and then asked if Gorab would bind to it when it is involved in the interaction with Sas6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We showed that Rab6 binds Gorab only as a dimer, but is not able to interact with Gorab when in complex with Sas6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result strongly suggests that the Gorab’s interaction with Sas6 is much stronger than its interaction with Rab6. We were able to confirm this using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which revealed that the Gorab–Rab6 complex showed a K<sub>D</sub> of 2.24 µM. Thus, the interaction between Gorab and Rab6 is significantly weaker than that between Gorab and Sas6 (K<sub>D</sub> = 47 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>A stronger interaction of Gorab with Sas6 than with itself and Rab6 leads to the prediction that increased expression of Sas6 should lead to a reduction in the amount of Gorab associating with the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, we were able to see this in the experiments described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The elevated expression of both wild-type Sas6 and Sas6-M440A in a <italic>sas6</italic> background had the effect of increasing the GFP-Gorab signal intensity at the centrosomes and reducing it at the Golgi. By contrast, elevated expression Sas6-L447A in the <italic>sas6</italic> null background did not affect the Golgi pool of Gorab, which was not recruited to residual centrosomes, that could have robust staining of Asl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, it seems that the relative levels of Gorab at the centriole and Golgi are set by its high affinity to Sas6 and the concentration of Sas6 at the centriole.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Together, our findings indicate that Gorab exists at the trans-Golgi network as a homodimer. Dimerization requires its coiled-coil motif (residues 200–315) within which is a core sequence (residues 270–287) that represents the most stable part of this dimerization region. Dimerization enables Gorab to interact with Rab6, and this in turn enables its association with the trans-Golgi. In contrast, Gorab interacts with Sas6 as a monomer. Gorab’s binding to Sas6 occurs with a higher affinity than its homodimerization, enabling a Gorab monomer to associate with the Sas6 dimer. Thus, the relatively small number of Sas6 molecules at the centriole would more avidly bind the Gorab monomer, allowing greater excess of Gorab to accumulate as dimers at the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Sas6 and Gorab interact through short interfaces within their coiled-coil regions. Disruption of this region of Sas6 through mutation of a single conserved leucine residue, L447, results in a failure of Gorab to bind to Sas6 and localize to the centriole. While we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the L447A mutation affects some other aspect of Sas6 function, the finding that expression of this mutant phenocopies a strong <italic>gorab</italic> hypomorph in its effects upon both co-ordination and centriole duplication suggests that failure to recruit Gorab is responsible for the Sas6-L447A defect. The finding of some residual apparent Gorab-like function in Sas6-L447A-expressing flies may reflect the overexpression of the protein due to the technical requirements of the experiment and the fact that Sas6-L447A still binds Gorab but with a sixteenfold reduced affinity compared to wild-type Sas6. Given that Sas6-L447A greatly diminishes the interaction with Gorab, whereas the mutation, M440A, in the adjoining ‘a’ position of the ‘a–g’ coiled-coil heptad repeat does not, leads us to conclude that Gorab binds to a narrow region near the C-terminus of the coiled coil of Sas6.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of Gorab, its interacting partners Sas6 and Rab6, and the cellular localization of their complexes.</title><p>Gorab is shown in green: N-terminal dynamic domain in dashed dark green and C-terminal putative coiled-coil domain in solid light green. Sas6 is shown in magenta, depicting two N-terminal head domains and the coiled coil formed in a Sas6 dimer. Rab6 is shown in orange. Although Gorab forms a dimer in solution, it dissociates to a monomer upon binding to Sas6 via its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The Sas6–Gorab complex present in the centriole cartwheel is shown superimposed over the outer microtubule wall of <italic>Drosophila</italic> centriole consisting of MT doublets, roughly in scale (scale bar 20 nm). Gorab also interacts with Rab6 via its C-terminal coiled-coil domain, but only as a dimer and with a much weaker binding affinity compared to Sas6 binding. Interaction with Rab6 enables Gorab’s localization to the trans-Golgi network, similarly to other golgins.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57241-fig7-v4.tif"/></fig><p>Gorab shows many of the properties typical of golgins, a family of tentacle-like proteins that protrude from the Golgi membranes to capture a variety of target vesicles. Redundancy between golgins in their ability to bind target vesicles could act as a functional safeguard and might explain why loss-of-function <italic>gorab</italic> mutants display no obvious Golgi phenotype, contrasting to the Golgi defects shown by the C-terminally tagged Gorab molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>). Gorab is similar to other golgins, which also associate with the Golgi membranes through their C-terminal parts in interactions that require Rab family member proteins to interact with the C-terminal part of the golgin dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>). The N-terminal parts of the golgins interact with their vesicle targets. Human GORAB’s N-terminal part interacts with Scyl1 to promote the formation of COPI vesicles at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Witkos et al., 2019</xref>). However, its precise role in the transport of COPI vesicles is not clear, particularly why loss of human GORAB affects Golgi functions in just bone and skin when COPI function is required in multiple tissues. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab also co-purifies and physically interacts with both Yata, counterpart of Scyl1, and COPI vesicle components (our unpublished data), and its importance for transport of COPI vesicles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is similarly unclear.</p><p>Our study offers a perspective on how Gorab interacts with Sas6 at the centriole and suggests the possibilities for why, as we previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovacs et al., 2018</xref>), this interaction is essential to establish the centriole’s ninefold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The heterotrimeric structure formed by a Sas6 dimer and the Gorab monomer will together constitute a single <italic>spoke plus central hub</italic> unit of the centriole’s cartwheel. The C-terminal part of Gorab would be expected to lie in a tight antiparallel association with the C-terminal part of Sas6’s coiled-coil region. Gorab’s N-terminus might thus be expected to extend towards the centriolar microtubules and their associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As the microtubules of <italic>Drosophila’s</italic> somatic centrioles exist as doublets of A- and B-tubules, it is tempting to speculate that Gorab interacts with the centriole wall in a region occupied in other cell types by the C-tubule. This could account for the lack of any requirement for Sas6–Gorab interaction in the male germ-line, where centrioles have triplet microtubules and a C-tubule occupies this space. Gorab’s partner proteins interacting with its N-terminal region are therefore of great interest at both the Golgi and in the centriole, and it will be key to understand the nature of these interactions in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>All expression vectors were generated using the Gateway system (Invitrogen).

Digested peptides were trapped on a C18 column (UPLC BEH C18 Van-Guard Pre-column 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 5 mm, Waters) and then directed into a reverse phase column (UPLC BEH C18 column 1.7 μm 2.1 × 50 mm, Waters) with a 10–35% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 90 μl/min using nanoACQUITY Binary Solvent Manager. Total time of a single run was 12 min. All capillaries, valves, and columns were maintained at 0.5°C inside an HDX cooling chamber, while the pepsin column was kept at 20°C inside the temperature-controlled digestion compartment. Leucine–enkephalin solution (Sigma) was used as a Lock mass. For protein identification, mass spectra were acquired in MSE mode over the m/z range of 50–1950. The spectrometer parameters were as follows: ESI positive mode, capillary voltage 3 kV, sampling cone voltage 35 V, extraction cone voltage 3 V, source temperature 80°C, desolvation temperature 175°C, and desolvation gas flow 800 l/hr. Peptides were identified using ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS) software (Waters). The list of identified peptides containing peptide m/z, charge, and retention time was further processed with the DYNAMX v. 3.0 program (Waters). For HDX experiments, protein samples were diluted in the reaction buffer containing 99.8% D<sub>2</sub>O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Five microliters of protein stock solution was mixed with 45 μl D<sub>2</sub>O reaction buffer, and an exchange reaction was carried out for a specific time period (either 10 s, 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, or 150 min) at room temperature (RT) for Gorab alone and Gorab–Rab6 samples and on ice for Gorab, Sas6, and Gorab–Sas6 samples. The exchange was quenched by reducing the pH to 2.5 by adding the reaction mixture into an Eppendorf tube containing ice-cold stop buffer (2 M glycine pH 2.5, 1.5 M urea, 250 mM TCEP). Immediately after quenching, samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analyzed. Quenched samples were rapidly thawed, digested offline with 2 µl of protease for 30 s at 1°C with shaking, and manually injected into the nanoACQUITY UPLC system. Further digestion, LC, and MS analysis were carried out exactly as described for the non-deuterated sample. For out-exchange control analysis of Gorab samples, measuring the maximum exchange for a given peptide, the 5 μl protein stock was mixed with 45 μl of D<sub>2</sub>O reaction buffer, incubated for 24 hr at RT, mixed with stop buffer, and analyzed as described above. The deuteration level in the out-exchange control experiment was calculated and denoted as 100% exchange (Mex100). For protein complexes (Gorab–Sas6 and Gorab–Rab6) to measure the differences in exchange level between the complex samples and proteins alone as out-exchange control, maximal theoretical exchange was used in the calculations.

Analysis of the isotopic envelopes in DynamX 3.0 software was carried out using the following parameters: retention time deviation ±18 s; m/z deviation ±15 ppm; drift time deviation ±2 time bins. Centroids of the mass envelopes were obtained. The values reflecting the experimental mass of each peptide in all possible states, replicates, time points, and charge states were exported from the DynamX 3.0, and further data analysis was carried out using in-house scripts written in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>).

Error bars for fraction exchanged represent standard deviations calculated from independent replicates. The difference in the fraction exchanged (Δ deuterated fraction) was calculated by subtracting the fraction-exchanged values for peptides in the selected state from the values for the same peptides in the control state.

Each sample was measured consecutively up to 10 times with a data acquisition time of 20 s in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. Three independent measurements were globally fitted in Prism 8 with a Boltzmann sigmoidal fit and normality of residuals tested with D’Agostino–Pearson omnibus (K2) test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Isothermal calorimetry titration</title><p>ITC experiments were carried out using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern). Ligand (His-Rab6) and cell proteins (MBP-Gorab FL WT and MBP-Gorab FL Δ282–286) were dialyzed in the same buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) prior to the measurements. Ligand was used in the concentration range 241–300 μM and cell protein 13–30 μM. Titration settings were as follows: 1 injection of 0.2 μl followed by 18 injections of 2 μl, 180 s spacing time between injections, 750 rpm stirring speed, at 25<bold>°</bold>C. The resulting data was analyzed using the PEAQ-ITC Analysis software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Glover, Dadlez, Dong, and Djinovic labs for their insightful comments and discussions.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>GORAB is an intriguing factor that the Glover lab has shown to display both Golgi and localisation and function in centriole duplication. Importantly, they have shown that these reflect separate functions of GORAB. In this work, the authors examine the structure of GORAB in more detail, mapping the regions important for Golgi targeting, SAS6 binding and centriole duplication in detail. Using this information, they produce a separation of function mutant in SAS6 that cannot bind to GORAB. This L447A mutant has reduced affinity for GORAB in vitro and fails to fully rescue the sas6 mutant, resulting in a phenotype described as similar to that of the gorab mutant. Overall, the authors provide a detailed analysis of GORAB dynamics with some clever use of methodology. This data is also of high quality. However, as detailed below, it appears that further experiments would be needed to bring the findings to the level expected from a paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the key question concerns the interpretation of Sas6 L447A mutant. The authors demonstrate that this mutant protein is severely compromised, both in its interaction with Gorab and in its function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These observations lead the authors to suggest that the in vivo phenotype of Sas6 L447A is due to impaired interaction with Gorab. In light of the available data, this suggestion seems premature. The authors should investigate the impact of the L447A mutation on Sas6 itself. According to Deepcoil, L447 is likely to be within the coiled coil, such that mutating a Leucine occupying an a or d position within the heptad repeat is expected to affect protein stability. Does Sas6 L447A fold correctly? Can it undergo homodimerization? These questions must be addressed. The authors could potentially investigate how the protein looks by rotary metal shadowing on its own, as well as in the presence of Gorab, either in the wild-type or the mutant form lacking the 244-259 stretch normally mediating interaction with Sas6. The authors should also report the localization of Sas6 L447A, something that is currently not shown in Figure 3D. In the absence of such results, one likely explanation could be that Sas6 L447A protein is compromised.</p><p>Even if the Sas6 L447A folding is not compromised, the impact of this mutation may not be caused by the lack of GORAB binding, since another factor could interact with that region. In principle, engineering a compensatory mutation in Gorab that restores interaction with Sas6 L447A would be desirable. If this is not possible, this point needs to be explicitly discussed.</p><p>Is SAS6 binding required for GORAB function or vice versa? We assume the latter is the case due to the previous data where a GORAB mutant unable to target to Golgi that could bind SAS6 did rescue centriole phenotypes. In this work, a SAS6 null rescued with SAS6 L447A has a phenotype the authors describe as resembling the Gorab null. A more detailed analysis of centriole duplication in the SAS6 L447A rescue would help to address this point as well as the points above.</p><p>1) The authors performed an impressive systematic structure/function analysis to uncover the domains needed for Gorab dimerization (Figure 1D), Sas6 binding (Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) and Rab6 interaction (Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). However, the qualitative assessment reported in Figure 2D or Figure 6B does not always match what the gels show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A or Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. For instance, it seems clear from Figure 2—figure supplement 2A that the delta219-244 or the delta267-281 Sas6 constructs bind Gorab very weakly, yet they are reported as regular binders in Figure 1D. This seems to suggest that a much larger swath of Gorab mediates interaction with Sas6. An analogous comments holds for Rab6: the gel in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B shows clearly that delta223-339 hardly binds Rab6, whereas Figure 6B reports this fragment as a regular binder. These apparent inconsistencies must be clarified with a quantitative assessment.</p><p>2) The low magnification views of Figure 1E are difficult to fully understand, as the quality of this immunostaining is not on par with the beautiful distribution of Gorab previously reported by these authors. Moreover, the DNA signal does not appear to be clearly present between what supposedly must be spindle poles. And what does the dashed line delineate? This information is not provided in the figure legend. Moreover, this experiment should be quantified: how many cells were scored and what fraction of them exhibited the illustrated distribution? A related comment holds for Figure 3D, where the contours of individual cells is difficult to make out in addition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57241.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the key question concerns the interpretation of Sas6 L447A mutant.

Our SEC data showed that the L447A mutation does not affect the ability of Sas6 to dimerize. As seen in Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, Sas6-wild type, Sas6-M440A, Sas6-L447A, Sas6-S452A and Sas6-L456A all displayed the same elution profile in size exclusion chromatography. This indicates that all the Sas6 point mutants behave like Sas6-wild type in that they are all able to form homodimers.</p><p>We have also modeled the organization of the coiled-coil structure of Sas6 (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Consistent with the in vitro dimerization of the mutants, our 3D modeling of Sas6-CCD shows a very small change in BUDE energy for both mutants M440A and L447A (-717/-714 vs -724 for WT). Notably, however, all these can only confirm that most of the coiled coil remains intact and intertwined, but cannot exclude a possibility that the local structure around L447 is partially perturbed in the mutant L447A. Both M440 and L447 are predicted to locate at position “a” of the “a-g” heptad repeats, but residue L447 is even closer to the C-terminus of the predicted CCD (i.e. aa464). Additionally, the downstream two heptads after L447 may not hold the dimer tightly together as only one of those residues at positions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in that region are hydrophobic (i.e. I457).</p><p>Therefore, we rephrased our original conclusion by stating that “Given that Sas6-L447A greatly diminishes the interaction with Gorab, whereas the mutation, M440A, in the adjoining “a” position of the “a-g” coiled-coil heptad repeat does not, leads us to conclude that Gorab binds to a narrow region near the C terminus of the coiled-coil of Sas6.”</p><p>The fact that Sas6-M440A, which like L447 is predicted to locate at position “a” of the “a-g” heptad repeats, does not perturb Gorab binding and rescues the Sas6 null mutation to a similar extent as Sas6 wild type, together with the phenotypic similarity of the Sas6 L447A mutant with gorab mutants suggest that the primary cause of the Sas6 L447A phenotype is inappropriate binding of Gorab rather than disturbance in overall structure of Sas6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could potentially investigate how the protein looks by rotary metal shadowing on its own, as well as in the presence of Gorab, either in the wild-type or the mutant form lacking the 244-259 stretch normally mediating interaction with Sas6. The authors should also report the localization of Sas6 L447A, something that is currently not shown in Figure 3D. In the absence of such results, one likely explanation could be that Sas6 L447A protein is compromised.</p></disp-quote><p>As previously indicated by size exclusion chromatography, Sas6-L447A mutant behaves the same as Sas6-wild type and forms a homodimer. Additional 3D modeling also suggests that the coiled coil of Sas6-L447A is intact and intertwined for the most of its length, although local structural disturbance around L447 position cannot be excluded. Even though rotary shadowing beautifully enables us to visualize both the head domains and the elongated coil of Sas6 molecule, the method has a limited spatial resolution and it is not high enough to visualize local disturbances along the rod of the Sas6 coiled coil, if there are any present at all. Since the coiled coil is predicted to be stable in its length otherwise, we would not see a difference in the rod length in the EM micrographs. From our FCS measurement, It seems unlikely that the Sas6-L447A : Gorab interaction is sufficiently strong to withstand the procedures used to prepare the complex for rotary shadowing and the rotary shadowing procedure itself.</p><p>We have carried out transient transfection of cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells with C-terminally tagged Sas6 L447A and now show in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 that all cells expressing the transgene have GFP localized to the centrioles. Thus Sas6-L447A is not only able to dimerise, but also to localize correctly to the centriole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even if the Sas6 L447A folding is not compromised, the impact of this mutation may not be caused by the lack of GORAB binding, since another factor could interact with that region. In principle, engineering a compensatory mutation in Gorab that restores interaction with Sas6 L447A would be desirable. If this is not possible, this point needs to be explicitly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the fact that Gorab is not properly recruited centrioles doesn’t exclude the possibility that other Sas6 interactors are also not affected and include a sentence to this effect in the revised discussion. However, we now show that Sas6 L447A does not just phenocopy the extent of the uncoordination phenotype of gorab flies (Figure 3D-F), but have now added new data to show that it also mimics the extent of centriole duplication and structural defects, which are reminiscent of a strong gorab hypomorph (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Together, the finding that Sas6-L447A phenocopies the centriolar phenotype of gorab mutants, the presence of Sas6-L447A on centrioles and the absence/very low amount of Gorab on such centrioles strongly suggests that the absence of Gorab is the primary cause of the mutant phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is SAS6 binding required for GORAB function or vice versa? We assume the latter is the case due to the previous data where a GORAB mutant unable to target to Golgi that could bind SAS6 did rescue centriole phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated, we previously described a series of separation of function alleles – namely the gorab-V266P and various gorab deletion mutations – that completely rescue the centriolar phenotype but are unable to localize to the Golgi. However, these experiments do not tell anything about dependencies because these mutants are able to bind Sas6 normally. We can now say that Sas6 is epistatic over Gorab because: first, the phenotype of the sas6-null mutant is stronger than the gorab null; and second, because Sas-L447A can localize to centrioles, as we now demonstrate (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D), and rescue the sas6-null phenotype to an extent comparable to the phenotype of a strong gorab hypomorphic mutant. Taken together with our finding that there is either no or very little Gorab at centrosomes in the Sas6-L447A mutant (Figure 4C), this demonstrates that Sas6 is needed for Gorab recruitment to the centrosomes. Thus, Sas6 binding is essential for Gorab’s centriolar function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this work, a SAS6 null rescued with SAS6 L447A has a phenotype the authors describe as resembling the Gorab null. A more detailed analysis of centriole duplication in the SAS6 L447A rescue would help to address this point as well as the points above.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, which we have addressed thoroughly in the revised manuscript. We now describe a detailed analysis of both the coordination and centriolar phenotypes of the Sas6 L447A mutant and two gorab mutants. The coordination phenotypes are presented in panels D and E of Figure 3 and the consequences for centrosome organization and number in interphase and mitosis in a new figure (Figure 4). Our findings show that the coordination and centriolar phenotypes of Sas6 L447A resemble those of a strong gorab hypomorph (the heteroallelic combination of a gorab hypomorph and gorab null) rather than the gorab null itself. We discuss the possibility that the phenotype is not quite as strong as the gorab null because Sas6-L447A can still bind a very low amount of Gorab (there is a 16-fold difference in dissociation constant between L447A and WT) and because, due to technical reasons, Sas6-L447A was expressed at higher levels than wild-type Sas6 would be expressed in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors performed an impressive systematic structure/function analysis to uncover the domains needed for Gorab dimerization (Figure 1D), Sas6 binding (Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) and Rab6 interaction (Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). However, the qualitative assessment reported in Figure 2D or Figure 6Bdoes not always match what the gels show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A or Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. For instance, it seems clear from Figure 2—figure supplement 2A that the delta219-244 or the delta267-281 Sas6 constructs bind Gorab very weakly, yet they are reported as regular binders in Figure 1D. This seems to suggest that a much larger swath of Gorab mediates interaction with Sas6.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We did not wish to make any claims about the strength of binding from band intensities that show some variation – we have now attached further examples from additional experiments in the supplements to Figure 2 to illustrate this better. Together these experiments indicate that del 244-259 is the shortest deletion that does not bind in the gel assay. HDX indicates that 230-260 is the region of the strongest interaction. Further support comes from the gel assay of binding of truncations: Trc 1-246 does not bind; Trc 1-260 binds weakly; Trc 1-270 binds like wild-type (please see additions to the supplementary figure). We have attempted to give an indication of the relative binding strength of the various deletions and truncations from repeated experiments, in so much that it is possible from such gel assays, classifying the binding as -, no binding; +, binding ; and ++, strong binding. In summary, 246-260 is the shortest region crucial for binding. However, the sequences in regions 219-244 (del), as well as 260-270 (trc), could also support the interaction while not being essential.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that region 246-260 is needed for binding but cannot exclude the possibility that some interactions extend out of this region. We have now clarified this in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An analogous comments holds for Rab6: the gel in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B shows clearly that delta223-339 hardly binds Rab6, whereas Figure 6B reports this fragment as a regular binder. These apparent inconsistencies must be clarified with a quantitative assessment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text trying to exclude inconsistencies and to be more cautious in our interpretation. Whereas gel binding assays such as these cannot give accurate quantitative comparisons, they do identify the broad region required for Rab6 binding and the findings we report accord with studies on human Gorab (Egerer et al., 2015)). It is the case that both the Gorab fragments 195-338 and 223- 338 bind Rab6 – the latter is weaker but it is the shortest fragment able to bind Rab6. We label fragment 195-338 on Figure 6B to indicate strong binding, ++, and fragment 223-338 to show binding, +. Together, this accords with the HDX data that shows the entire region C-terminal to residue 200 to change conformation upon Rab6 binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The low magnification views of Figure 1E are difficult to fully understand, as the quality of this immunostaining is not on par with the beautiful distribution of Gorab previously reported by these authors. Moreover, the DNA signal does not appear to be clearly present between what supposedly must be spindle poles. And what does the dashed line delineate? This information is not provided in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which brought to our attention the inadequate explanation of this figure in our original manuscript. In our previous paper we described the localization of Gorab in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and wing imaginal discs. Here we show Gorab localization in squashed preparations of primary spermatocytes because 1) such tissue can be obtained the first transgenic male from the transformation experiment after it has been crossed to virgin females to establish the stock. Once larvae have been obtained to secure the stock, we immediately dissect and analyze the primary spermatocytes from the founder male; 2) instead of the scattered Golgi stacks of cultured cells and wing disc cells, the primary spermatocytes have larger Golgi bodies with distinct outer (cis-Golgi) and inner (trans-Golgi) layers in cross section (Belloni et al., 2012, Sechi et al., 2013). This gives a clear demonstration of whether the outer ring of GM130 (the cis-Golgi marker) is rounding a compartment that either has or does not have Gorab.</p><p>Primary spermatocytes are an extended G2 phase. The spindles have yet to form and the nuclei have a characteristic tri-lobal shape representing the sets of the major chromosome homologues preparing for meiosis. The dashed lines highlight the border of single primary spermatocyte cells in the field of this squashed tissue preparation. We have updated the figure legends for clarification. In addition, we have also imaged GFP-Gorab (full length) and GFP-Gorab Δ282-286 in the mitotic wing disc cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, this experiment should be quantified: how many cells were scored and what fraction of them exhibited the illustrated distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We imaged 32 primary spermatocytes and visually observed many more. All of them showed the same Golgi and centriolar distribution of Gorab WT or Gorab Δ282-286. We note that both wild-type and mutant transgenes were integrated at the same genomic landing site (see Materials and methods) so that the transgenes would be expressed at the same level in every animal and every tissue from a poly-ubiquitin promoter. Thus would guard against variability between spermatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related comment holds for Figure 3D, where the contours of individual cells is difficult to make out in addition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is difficult to make the contours of the interphase cells in wing disc since these are columnar epithelia and are tightly arranged next to each other. We now present new data in alternative figures (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) that quantitate the consequences of Sas6-L447A, Sas6-M440A, and different mutant alleles of gorab upon centrioles in diploid tissues.</p></body></sub-article></article>
