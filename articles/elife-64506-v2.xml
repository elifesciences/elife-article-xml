Currently, it is unknown which human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the receptors of these pruritogens, MRGPRD and MRGPRX1, respectively, and which cutaneous afferents these pruritogens activate in primate. In situ hybridization studies revealed that MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of TRPV1+ human DRG neurons. In electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates (<italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>), subtypes of polymodal C-fiber nociceptors are preferentially activated by ALA and BAM8-22, with significant overlap. When pruritogens ALA, BAM8-22, and histamine, which activate different subclasses of C-fiber afferents, are administered in combination, human volunteers report itch and nociceptive sensations similar to those induced by a single pruritogen. Our results provide evidence for differences in pruriceptive processing between primates and rodents, and do not support the spatial contrast theory of coding of itch and pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>in situ hybridization</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>psychophysics</kwd><kwd>itch</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>cutaneous nociceptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01070875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaMotte</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ringkamp</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01 DA042902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solinski</surname><given-names>Hans JÃ¼rgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship grant 326726541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malewicz</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIADE000721-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS070201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sypek</surname><given-names>Elizabeth I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MRGPRD and MRGRPX1 are co-expressed in primate DRG neurons, but Î²-alanine and BAM8-22, preferentially activate CMH-subclasses, and co-activating different cutaneous nociceptors by pruritogens does not change itch sensation to pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sensations of itch and pain serve a similar purpose, which is to alert the organism of potentially harmful external threats. Although the sensations of itch and pain can elicit different behavioral responses (such as scratching vs. withdrawal, rubbing or guarding), they are closely linked as they appear to be elicited by activity in one and the same type of fiber or functionally similar primary afferents.</p><p>In mice, pruritogens activate at least three populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solinski et al., 2019b</xref>). Among these, two neuronal populations express Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptors (Mrgpr), namely <italic>Mrgprc</italic> and <italic>Mrgprd</italic>, in a non-overlapping fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zylka et al., 2003</xref>), and intradermal administration of their respective agonist, bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8â22 (BAM8-22) and Î²-alanine (ALA), results in scratching behavior. The third population expresses natriuretic polypeptide b (<italic>Nppb</italic>) and mediates mast cell-induced itch. Neurons expressing <italic>Mrgprc</italic> or <italic>Nppb</italic> also express the histamine (HIS)Â receptor <italic>Hrh1</italic> and likely mediate scratching behavior induced by HIS.</p><p>In humans, HIS and the nonhistaminergic pruritogens ALA and BAM8-22 each elicit itch and nociceptive sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sikand et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sikand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sikand et al., 2011b</xref>). HIS preferentially activates mechanically insensitive C-fiber afferents (C-MIAs) in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmelz et al., 1997</xref>) and nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). In nonhuman primates, ALA preferentially excites QCs, a subtype of mechanoheat-sensitive, polymodal C-fiber (CMH) nociceptor that adapts quickly to noxious heat as opposed to those that adapt slowly (SCs), and C-MIAs are unresponsive to ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). The type of afferent nerve fiber activated by BAM8-22, an agonist of MRGPRX1 in primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lembo et al., 2002</xref>), is currently unclear. Based on the non-overlapping expression of <italic>Mrgprd</italic> and <italic>Mrgprc</italic> in mouse dorsal root ganglionÂ (DRG) neurons and the preferential activation of QCÂ fibers by ALA in nonhuman primate, one might expect that in primate MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 would be similarly expressed in non-overlapping DRG neurons and that ALA and BAM8-22 would activate different neuronal afferent populations.</p><p>In humans and other primates, multiple types of nociceptive primary afferents including unmyelinated and myelinated nerve fibers appear to have a role in itch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johanek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johanek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Namer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ringkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmelz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, HIS and nonhistaminergic pruritogens activate distinct sets of nociceptive primary afferents, including mechano-insensitive C fibers (C-MIAs), CMHs, mechanosensitive A-fiber nociceptors (A-MSAs), and spinothalamic projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johanek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Namer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmelz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). The signaling of pruritic stimuli by nociceptive afferents that are also thought to encode nociceptive mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ringkamp et al., 2013</xref>) poses a conundrum regarding the neuronal coding of these distinct sensations in the nervous system. Among the models that have been proposed to explain this conundrum (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carstens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">LaMotte et al., 2014</xref>), the spatial contrast model posits that neuronal activity from a spatially restricted set of nociceptive afferents is interpreted as âitch,â whereas activity from a spatially larger pool of afferents is interpreted as âpainâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Namer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Namer and Reeh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinhoff et al., 2019</xref>). However, it has not been tested in humans whether a combination of pruritogens that activates a greater number and variety of primary afferents and thereby decreases the spatial contrast between activated and silent fibers could lead to reduced itch and/or increased nociceptive sensation.</p><p>Here, we probed the relationship between the expression of receptors for ALA and BAM8-22 in postmortem human DRGs and the physiological responses of these pruritogens in single cutaneous nerve fibers of nonhuman primate. We found that human DRG neurons co-express both, MRGPRD and MRGPRX1, and also transient receptor potential channels from the vanilloid subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1). Further, injection of ALA and BAM8-22 into the receptive fields (RFs)Â of nociceptors in nonhuman primate revealed that QCs respond to ALA, and SCs preferentially respond to BAM8-22, with a large degree of overlap. In accompanying psychophysical studies, we studied the effects of individual pruritogens and their combinations and recorded the reported itch, nociceptive sensations, and dysesthesias in human subjects. Since we know at least three pruritogens that can preferentially activate QCs, SCs, and C-MIAs, we additionally tested the hypothesis that the co-activation of the different sets of primary afferents by ALA, BAM8-22, and HIS would enhance itch and/or nociceptive sensations and dysesthesias in humans. In addition, in primates, HIS and cowhage activate largely non-overlapping spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davidson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, by combining ALA, BAM8-22, and HIS, we tested psychophysically whether activating both types of STT neurons would result in altered itch or nociceptive sensations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD have overlapping expression patterns in human DRG</title><p>The representation of the MRGPR families of receptors in humans and nonhuman primates differs from rodents in that they contain a distinct MRGPRX subfamily of receptors that is absent in rodents and that they do not have either the rodent <italic>Mrgpra</italic> or <italic>Mrgprc</italic> subfamilies of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solinski et al., 2014</xref>). Whether MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD are expressed in non-overlapping DRG neurons in primate, similar to what has been previously reported in mouse for <italic>Mrgprc</italic> and <italic>Mrgprd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zylka et al., 2003</xref>), is currently unclear. We therefore investigated the expression of MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD in human DRG using double-label in situ hybridization (ISH). We found that MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD were co-expressed in the same neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically, on average 89.6 Â± 1.5% of DRG neurons positive for MRGPRD in a given donor were also positive for MRGPRX1 (380/426 neurons from four donors combined), and 93.9 Â± 2.0% (380/407) of DRG neurons positive for MRGPRX1 were also positive for MRGPRD. Previously it has been reported in a <italic>Mrgprd</italic> reporter mouse line that <italic>Mrgprd</italic>+ neurons were TRPV1 negative and non-peptidergic CMHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rau et al., 2009</xref>). If findings in human DRG were comparable to mouse, then one would expect to observe no overlap between TRPV1 and MRPGRD expression. However, we found that MRGPRD neurons nearly always co-expressed TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with 95.2 Â± 1.6% (479/510) of MRGPRD+ neurons being also positive for TRPV1. In the mouse, <italic>Mrgprc</italic> is expressed in a subset of capsaicin-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Recent ISH data from human DRG show that all MRGPRX1+ neurons co-express NPPB, and that NPPB-expressing neurons are a subset of TRPV1+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solinski et al., 2019a</xref>). In agreement with these previous findings, we observed that 100% (429/429) of MRGPRX1+ neurons were also positive for TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of TRPV1+ neurons, 32.5 Â± 3.7% (429/1273) and 36.5 Â± 4.2% (479/1211) of cells also expressed MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In parallel with these studies, we characterized the expression of MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 in DRG of macaques. We also found, in this primate, that these two receptors are expressed in a largely overlapping fashion, although with slight differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). More specifically, of MRGPRD+ neurons, 78.1 Â± 6.1% (199/238) co-express MRGPRX1 while of MRGPRX1+ neurons, only 57.1 Â± 11.6% (199/448) co-express MRGPRD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together our results point to profound species-dependent differences of MRGPR expression patterns between rodents and primates with additional slight differences inside the primate lineage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD are co-expressed in TRPV1-expressing human dorsal root ganglionÂ (DRG) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of MRGPRs from mouse (m), rat (r), macaque (ma), and human (h).

Briefly, heat responses of QCs exhibit a burst of discharge at the onset of the heat stimulus with the discharge adapting during the stimulus plateau. SCs typically have a slower response onset, do not exhibit a burst at the onset of the stimulus, and the peak discharge occurs during the plateau phase of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). QCs and SCs can be formally separated by plotting the time of peak discharge (relative to stimulus onset) against the sum of temperature rise time plus the minimum conduction latency from skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For 31/66 CMHs, the time of peak discharge fell above the line of equality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, black line), indicating that the peak discharge occurred during the plateau phase of the stimulus, and these afferents were therefore classified as âSCâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, blue circles). 29 out of 66 CMH fibers exhibited a burst of discharge at the onset and then an adapting response, and these afferents were classified as âQCâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red circles). For 26/29 QCs, the time of peak discharge fell below or close to the line of equality, indicating occurrence of peak discharge during or at the end of the rising phase of the temperature ramp.

In contrast, for 26/31 SCs, responses to BAM8-22 were greater than those to ALA. In fact, ALA responses in only seven SCs fulfilled the criterion of a positive response (â¥10 APs). Responses to ALA and BAM8-22 differed significantly within and across fiber types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) withâ fiber typeâ as a between-subjects factor andâ pruritogenâ as within-subjects factor; interaction: F<sub>(1,58)</sub>=29.55, p&lt;0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that for SCs (nÂ =Â 31), responses to BAM8-22 were significantly larger than those to ALA (94.00Â Â±Â 12.01 APs vs. 10.32Â Â±Â 3.22 APs, p&lt;0.001, Scheffe test). In QCs (nÂ =Â 29), responses to ALA did not significantly differ from those to BAM8-22 (83.38Â Â±Â 8.42 APs vs. 51.97Â Â±Â 11.17 APs, respectively;Â p=0.25). Between populations, responses to ALA were significantly larger in QCs than SCs (p&lt;0.001, Scheffe test), whereas responses to BAM8-22 were significantly larger in SCs than QCs (p=0.021, Scheffe test). ALA activated 27/29 QCs and 19 of these responded also to BAM8-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Two QCs were only responsive to BAM8-22. In contrast, only 7/31 SCs responded to ALA with 6 of these being also responsive to BAM8-22, whereas 23/31 SCs responded only to BAM8-22. One of 31 SCs did not respond to either agonist. Of the six unclassified afferents, three units responded to both agonists, two responded to ALA only, and the remaining only to BAM8-22. Taken together, these findings suggest that, at the doses tested, QCs and SCs are preferentially activated by ALA and BAM8-22, respectively. The data imply that QCs may represent fibers expressing both MRGPRs at the peripheral terminals, but preferentially MRGPRD, whereas SCs may preferentially express MRGPRX1. To summarize, in contrast to our human ISH data that suggested nearly 100% overlap of MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD expression, we found that only about half of the CMH neurons tested responded to both BAM8-22 and ALA. Focusing more specifically on macaques, our combined ISH and electrophysiology data suggest that some CMHs (i.e., QCs) express both MRGPRs, while others (i.e., SCs) are functionally preferentially activated by BAM8-22 and only express MRGPRX1. Furthermore, in accordance with MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 neurons expressing TRPV1, all of these mechanosensitive C-fibers responded to noxious heat regardless of the selectivity of their responses to BAM8-22 or ALA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>C-MIAs and A-fiber nociceptors are less frequently activated or unresponsive to ALA and BAM8-22</title><p>We also investigated whether BAM8-22 and ALA activate C-MIAs and A-fiber nociceptors that are involved in mediating itch sensation to HIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmelz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>) and cowhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ringkamp et al., 2011</xref>), respectively.

HIS-induced sensations lasted significantly longer than those induced by ALA or by BAM8-22Â +Â ALA (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively).

For each of these measurements, differences in mean response were initially statistically analyzed with a âstimulusâ (5) Ã âsensory qualityâ (3) Ã âsexâ (2) RMANOVA. Only for peak ratings, but not for AUC and duration,â sexâ had a significant effect, with females giving significantly larger peak ratings than males (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=6.53, p&lt;0.017). However, none of the interactions with the other factors reached significance. Therefore, âsexâ was excluded from further analysis, and the RMANOVAs were re-run only with the within-subjects factors using Bonferroni tests for post hoc testing. For peak ratings (nÂ =Â 29 subjects), within-subjects factors âsensory qualityâ and âstimulusâ were significant (respectively, F<sub>(1.67,46.67)</sub>Â =Â 12.13, p&lt;0.001 and F<sub>(3.31,92.80)</sub>Â =Â 3.39, p&lt;0.018). The mean peak ratings for itch and pricking/stinging were each significantly greater than those for burning (p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni test), and theÂ mean peak ratings of itch and pricking/stinging did not differ significantly. For the factor âstimulus,â mean peak ratings were significantly different only between ALA and BAM8-22 (p=0.01), and between ALA and the combined administration of all three pruritogens (p=0.03). The mean peak ratings for each sensory quality and stimulus are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, but the interaction of âstimulusâ and âsensory qualityâ was not significant (F<sub>(4.82,135.02)</sub>Â =Â 2.11; p=0.07).</p><p>Comparisons of mean AUCs and durations between stimuli required subjects to have peak ratings greater than zero in response to each stimulus (because there cannot be a duration of a sensation that was absent, i.e., had zero magnitude). Seventeen subjects had nonzero ratings of all three sensory qualities in response to each stimulus. Only âsensory qualityâ was significant for AUC and duration (F<sub>(1.33,21.32)</sub>Â =Â 4.89, p=0.029 and F<sub>(1.46,23.39)</sub>Â =Â 9.18, p=0.003, respectively, RMANOVA). The mean AUC was significantly larger for itch than for burning (p=0.012, Bonferroni test), and itch lasted significantly longer than burning (p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni test). No statistical differences were found between AUCs and durations of itch, pricking/stinging, and burning evoked by BAM8-22, ALA, HIS, and combinations thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,Â J</xref>).</p><p>Alternative analyses of all 25 subjects that had a nonzero rating of both itch and either of two nociceptive qualities whichever had the greater AUC revealed similar results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, a combination of pruritogens did not alter the magnitude or quality of sensations over those elicited by one of its component single pruritogens. For example, increasing the number of activated mechanosensitive nociceptive afferents by combining BAM8-22 and ALA and then adding in MIAs with HIS included in the mixture did not diminish itch and increase the magnitude of nociceptive sensations.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that any one pruritogen would dominate any of the sensations when a combination was applied, we re-ran the same analysis after selecting for subjects in whom the lowest maximum peak itch rating to any single pruritogen was at least 50% of the highest maximum peak itch rating to any single pruritogen. Analysis of data from subjects that fulfilled this criterion (nÂ =Â 11) did not lead to a different result than when all subjects were included. Taken together, these results suggest that intradermal injection of combinations of pruritogens does not lead to an increased sensation of itch or, alternatively, to a diminished sensation of itch with an increase in nociceptive sensations.</p><p>To test for whether any mean areas of dysesthesia, wheal, and flare differed between stimuli, separate RMANOVAs were performed for each type of area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Specifically, we explored the expression of MRGPRX1 and the physiological effects of its agonist BAM8-22, comparing these with MRGPRD expression and responses of the MRGPRD-activating pruritogen, ALA. Employing ISH, we found that MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD are predominantly co-expressed in human DRG, indicating that primate and mouse pruritogen receptors have different patterns of expression. Using electrophysiology, we discovered that the MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD agonists activated predominantly cutaneous polymodal C-fibers with some differences in BAM8-22 activating almost all and ALA stimulating a smaller defined subset of C-fibers. Lastly, taking advantage of the fact that ALA, BAM8-22, and HIS differentially activate certain types of C-fibers, we investigated sensory coding of itch in humans. We observed that mixtures of these pruritogens elicit itch percepts similar to those evoked by singly applied pruritogens, suggesting that combined versus differential fiber activation does not have a large effect in shaping the quality of sensation.</p><p>Extensive genetic manipulation studies in mice have revealed a great deal about the receptors and sensory neurons that underlie itch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lay and Dong, 2020</xref>). Although less is known about the neuronal mechanisms of itch in primate, it is often assumed that they are similar to those in rodent. An example of this relates to itch induced by the BAM8-22 peptide, a cleavage product of proenkephalin, shown to be a pruritogen in a human psychophysical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sikand et al., 2011a</xref>) that also triggers scratching in mice. In rodents, BAM8-22 activates a receptor named <italic>Mrgprc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grazzini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2002</xref>). Suggestive of a labeledÂ line for itch, this receptor is expressed in a select population of DRG neurons that are required for BAM8-22-induced scratching and sufficient to evoke scratching when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2013</xref>). However, primates lack the <italic>Mrgprc</italic> receptor or a differently named orthologous receptor and instead harbor a distinct subfamily of MRGPRs, named MRGPRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solinski et al., 2014</xref>), thatÂ is, clear orthologous receptors of this subfamily are absent in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zylka et al., 2003</xref>). Despite this major difference in pruritogen receptor families between primates and rodents, a striking pharmacological similarity exists between receptors in primates and mice, with MRGPRX1 in humans, like <italic>Mrgprc</italic> in mice, being activated by BAM8-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lembo et al., 2002</xref>) and MRGPRD being activated by ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shinohara et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we sought to examine the expression profile of MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD in human DRG. Similar to the expression of <italic>Mrgprc</italic> in mice, we found that MRGPRX1 is expressed in a subpopulation of human TRPV1-positive neurons. However, we found that the MRGPRD expression largely overlaps with MRGPRX1 in human DRG. We did not directly quantify the number of neurons expressing MRGPRD or MRGPRX1 in human DRG neurons. However, in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solinski et al., 2019a</xref>), we found that the number of NPPB+ human DRG neurons (9.8%) corresponds well with the number of <italic>Nppb</italic>+ neurons found in mouse DRG neurons. As about four out of five NPPB+ human DRG neurons co-express MRGPRX1, the MRGPRX1/MRGPRD+ population is about 8% of all DRG neurons. Of note, we also observed the overlapping expression of MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 in macaque DRG neurons, indicating a conserved expression pattern in the primate lineage. However, this expression pattern is dramatically different from that found in mice, where <italic>Mrgprd</italic> is present in a distinct subclass of neurons that do not express <italic>Mrgprc</italic> and do not express <italic>Trpv1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zylka et al., 2003</xref>). These results point to primate pruriception in peripheral sensory neurons being different from that in mice. Previously, we reported that MRGPRX1-positive human DRG neurons express NPPB and that these cells express additional pruritogen receptors, HRH1 and IL31RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solinski et al., 2019a</xref>). Again, this expression pattern is different from that found in mice where <italic>Nppb</italic> and <italic>Il31ra</italic> are expressed in a class of neurons distinct from those that express either <italic>Mrgprc</italic> or <italic>Mrgprd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zylka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Nppb</italic> was shown to be necessary for the transmission of pruritic signals between primary afferents and second order spinal cord neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), which in turn is suggestive of the idea that the MRGPRX1/MRGPRD/NPPB neuronal population is also involved in primate itch. Thus, our findings expand our previous knowledge on human sensory neurons and indicate that, at least at the level of the DRG soma, pruritogen receptors are expressed in a largely overlapping fashion in humans.</p><p>To complement our studies examining the expression of pruriceptive receptors in human DRG, we stimulated cutaneous afferents in monkeys with BAM8-22 and ALA and measured evoked neuronal activity using a teased-fiber preparation. Previously, we reported that pruritogens activate a number of physiologically distinct subtypes of nerve fibers, including cutaneous CMHs, C-MIAs, as well as A-fiber nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ringkamp and Meyer, 2014</xref>). In addition, we showed that cutaneous CMHs can be distinguished into two types based on their responses to a stepped heat stimulus, namely QC and SC fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johanek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meyer and Campbell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, ALA or BAM8-22 did not activate A-fiber nociceptors, and C-MIAs were activated rarely by BAM8-22 (2/6 responsive), and not at all by ALA. Because BAM8-22 could elicit a small flare (~5 cm<sup>2</sup> on average) in our psychophysical experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect C-MIA activation via mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>). However, taken together, these findings suggest that C-MIAs and A-fiber nociceptors are not major contributors to sensations produced by ALA and BAM8-22.</p><p>In contrast, we show that CMHs are excited by intradermal injections of ALA and BAM8-22. Confirming our earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>), we found that the MRGPRD agonist ALA preferentially activated QCs, indicating that about 60% of cutaneous CMHs (nearly all QCs but only 23% of SCs) are sensitive to ALA in monkeys. In agreement with our human expression data, BAM8-22 also activated a large proportion of QCs (72% of QCs responded to BAM8-22), indicating that MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 are co-expressed in this functional class of cutaneous primary afferents. Surprisingly, given our expression data, we observed that BAM8-22 evoked APs in the SC class of CMHs (93% of SCs responded to BAM8-22) that was largely unresponsive to ALA. Furthermore, BAM8-22-induced responses in SCs were about twice as large as in QCs.</p><p>Several explanations could account for this apparent discrepancy between our expression and functional data: (1) species-specific differences, between monkeys and humans, in the DRG expression pattern of MRGPRD/MRGPRX1 might exist. In fact, our comparative analysis of MRGPRD/MRGPRX1 expression in human and primate DRG supports this explanation and points to MRGPRD marking a subpopulation of the bigger MRGPRX1+ group of neurons in macaques. This pattern is consistent with a recent report characterizing the rhesus macaque DRG with single-cell transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kupari et al., 2021</xref>). (2) While ISH was used to study MRGPR expression at the neuronal soma, our physiological assay probes the functional activation of receptors in cutaneous axonal terminals. It is conceivable that mRNA expression in the soma might not be a relevant predictor for functional receptor in the periphery. (3) Potency and efficacy of GPCR agonists not only depend on the expression of the cognate receptor protein but can be modulated allosterically by binding partners of the receptor and associated proteins involved in AP firing, which could potentially be expressed differentially between QCs and SCs. Thus, we might have missed co-expression of MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 in functional studies due to cell-autonomous pharmacological differences.</p><p>That a large proportion (54/66) of CMHs is responsive to BAM8-22 is consistent with previous findings showing that spicules of cowhage, a tropical legume, activated all tested CMHs in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Namer et al., 2008</xref>), nearly all QC and SC mechanoheat nociceptors in monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johanek et al., 2008</xref>), and that mucunain, the pruritic cysteine protease contained in these spicules, activates MRGPRX1 in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reddy et al., 2018</xref>). However, although about half of A-fiber nociceptors in nonhuman primate is activated by cowhage spicules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ringkamp et al., 2011</xref>), BAM8-22 did not activate this fiber type. This suggests that cowhage responses in these fibers may be mediated through a different mechanism, for example, protease-activated receptors 2 and 4, which mucunain has previously been shown to activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In nonhuman primates, we found that all mechanosensitive unmyelinated cutaneous afferents responsive to MRGPR agonists were also activated by heat, and we found previously that QCs and SCs are sensitized to heat stimuli following a mild burn injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). These observations are consistent with the expression of TRPV1 in these neurons and are in agreement with the overlapping expression of TRPV1 and MRGRX1 and MRGPRD that we observed in human DRG. This is in contrast to mice in which about half of the GFP-labeled <italic>Mrgprd</italic>+ neurons in a <italic>Mrgprd</italic> reporter line were unresponsive to heat stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these findings show that there are key differences in the gene expression of pruriceptive receptors between mice, human, and macaques, and in the functional properties of cutaneous unmyelinated afferents between mice and nonhuman primate. Although DRG-enriched genes are conserved between mice and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray et al., 2018</xref>), our findings extend results from a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shiers et al., 2020</xref>) reporting substantial differences in the co-expression of several genes (including, e.g., P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub> and CGRP; TRPV1 and TRPA1) between mice and human DRG neurons. These results will in the future likely be supplemented by the advent of single-cell sequencing technologies to determine the transcriptome of DRG neurons in humans. Such studies should also help explain theÂ potential difference in pruriceptive sensitivity between different physiologically defined subclasses of primary afferent neurons.</p><p>In electrophysiological experiments, the peak discharge recorded from nociceptive primary afferents in our present and previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>) study and from pruriceptive STT neurons in the monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davidson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>) occurred within the first 10â30 s after cutaneous application of different pruritogens. In contrast, in psychophysical experiments, the time courses of itch and nociceptive sensations were similar for the different pruritogens with a peak intensity occurring between 1 and 2 min after injection. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the delayed peak in sensory intensity is due to the recruitment of additional nerve fibers, STT- and cortical neurons when the injected pruritogen spreads over time, thereby activating additional primary afferents or central neurons. The peak intensity of sensation would then occur when all primary afferents or central neurons within the reach of the pruritogen are activated.</p><p>Primate primary sensory afferents responsive to pruritogens are also activated by mechanical, thermal, and chemical nociceptive stimuli, and activity in these afferents is thought to elicit the sensation of pain from such stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ringkamp et al., 2013</xref>). This would rule out the possibility that these primary sensory neurons are specifically activated only by pruritic stimuli. Furthermore, a labeled line for itch has not been identified in human and nonhuman primate. Consequently, several different models explaining how pruritic stimuli may be encoded have been proposed (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carstens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">LaMotte et al., 2014</xref>). Among these, the itch model of âspatial contrastâ posits that a pruritic stimulus is signaled by activity in a few nociceptive afferents among other non-active fibers innervating a given skin region (i.e., spatially sparse), whereas nociceptive stimuli are encoded in the activity of many afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Namer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Namer and Reeh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmelz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinhoff et al., 2019</xref>). This model predicts that the sensation of itch will decrease and the sensation of pain will increase when a larger number of nociceptive afferents is activated from a given site. Our finding of a preferential activation of distinct types of C-fiber nociceptors by ALA, BAM8-22, and HIS in monkey and reports that HIS-induced itch occurs through activation of C-MIAs in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmelz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>), permitting us to test a key prediction of the spatial contrast model using these itch-inducing agents in psychophysical experiments. In these experiments, we used BAM8-22, ALA, and HIS, each of which, when injected singly into the skin of subjects, induced itch and to a lower extent pain-like sensations of pricking/stinging and burning. Spatial contrast was then varied by co-injecting combinations of the three pruritogens, each activating different classes of primary afferents in a given skin site. We found that neither the magnitudes of itch nor nociceptive sensations changed between application of a single pruritogen and mixtures, a finding that is incongruous with the âspatial contrastâ model. This finding is also consistent with prior evidence for a lack of spatial summation or enhancement of itch when multiple cowhage spicules applied to a local area of skin did not evoke more itch than a single spicule despite presumably activating more cowhage-sensitive CMHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LaMotte et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, we now found that increasing the number of activated nerve fibers of one type (CMHs with injection of ALA + BAM8-22) by adding those of another type (MIAs with HIS) also did not enhance the magnitude of itch.</p><p>Since the âspatial contrastâ model does not explain the results from our psychophysical experiment, what other mechanisms might be responsible for the coding of pruritic stimuli? One previously suggested solution that might explain these results is that itch- and pain-related information is separately encoded at the level of the spinal cord where pruriceptive and nociceptive STT neurons have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LaMotte et al., 2009</xref>). Input from nociceptive or pruriceptive afferents may be routed to the pruriceptive and nociceptive STT pathways through dedicated spinal interneuronal circuits. This possibility is supported by the observation that itch-like scratching behavior can be selectively blocked without reducing nociceptive behavior by <italic>Nppb</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>), by the application of antagonists of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun and Chen, 2007</xref>), or by eliminating GRPR-neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). However, pruriceptive STT neurons are also responsive to noxious heat, capsaicin, and mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, there must still exist a mechanism by which nociceptive afferents are able to differentially activate nociceptive and pruriceptive STT pathways. Differential activation may be achieved by the level of activity and/or the pattern of discharge that is induced by nociceptive and pruritic stimuli in nociceptive afferents. In support of this view, we have previously shown that capsaicin produced a significantly higher median discharge frequency in C-MIAs than HIS, whereas the total number of induced APs did not differ between the two stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, capsaicin produced a higher intraburst frequency discharge in HIS-sensitive STT neurons than HIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davidson et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, activating a combination of different afferent fibers having varying tuning capabilities for particular chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli (e.g., QCs and SCs) and different firing patterns together may play a role in the transmission of information needed to discriminate pain from itch. Thus, while we were unable to absolutely identify the mechanism by which itch is distinguished from pain in primates, our studies suggest that the âspatial contrastâ model does not account for this process under normal conditions.</p><p>The results of this and previous studies indicate that in normal skin different classes of primary afferents are tuned to preferentially respond to different pruritogens. It is currently unclear whether in chronic itch primary afferents become responsive to a broad range of pruritogens or whether a preferential but increased responsiveness is maintained. Future studies may investigate this question and whether peripherally applied MRGPR-antagonists can provide relief from chronic itch in human. Considering that a large majority of nociceptive afferents responded to ALA and BAM8-22, which produced itch and nociceptive sensations in human, anti-pruritic effects of such compounds appear likely. It will also be interesting to investigate whether MRGPR-antagonists have peripheral anti-nociceptive effects.</p><p>In conclusion, our study defines the expression of MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD in human DRG neurons and the electrophysiological responses of their agonists in primate cutaneous primary afferents. In human psychophysical studies, we observed that co-administration of different MRGPR agonists and HIS did not change overall reports of itch and nociceptive sensations. Taken together, the neuronal processing of itch differs between rodent and primate, and additional studies are needed to determine the coding mechanisms of itch and pain in human.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>)</td><td><italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic></td><td>Johns Hopkins, NIH-supported pigtailed macaque breeding colony</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>DRG tissue</td><td>Tissue For Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biobankonline.com">http://www.biobankonline.com</ext-link>) and the NIH NeuroBioBank</td><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (pigtailed monkey)</td><td>DRG Tissue <break/>(<italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>)</td><td>Johns Hopkins, NIH-supported pigtailed macaque breeding colony</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8â22 (BAM8-22)</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat no. 1763</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Bovine adrenal medulla peptide 8â18 (BAM8-18)</td><td>Keck Lab, Yale University, New Haven <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sikand et al., 2011b</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>hTRPV1 in situ hybridization probe</td><td>Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td>Cat no. 415381</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>hMRGPRX1 in situ hybridization probe</td><td>Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td>Cat no. 517011</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>hMRGPRD in situ hybridization probe</td><td>Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td>Cat no. 524871</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNAscope multiplex fluorescent development kit</td><td>Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td>Cat no. 320850</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>BaseScope Probe -

A saline drip containing 5% d-glucose was continually infused to maintain hydration, and Cefazolin (West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp, Eatontown, NJ; 20 mg/kg) was administered every 2 hr for antibiotic prophylaxis. Body temperature was maintained by feedback-controlled heating pads (~38Â°C), and heart rate was monitored by an electrocardiogram. If heart rate increased more than 10% upon noxious stimulation, a bolus of pentobarbital was administered. Animals were intubated, paralyzed with pancuronium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and ventilated at a rate to maintain an expiratory pCO<sub>2</sub> near 40 mmHg. At the end of the experiments, animals received buprenorphine SR (0.2 mg/kg sc, ZooPharm, Laramie, WY) as prophylactic analgesic treatment before being returned to their home cage.</p><p>Radial, medial cutaneous, sural, peroneal, and saphenous nerves were used for teased-fiber recordings as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Campbell and Meyer, 1983</xref>). Briefly, a given nerve was aseptically dissected under a microscope, and skin edges of the incision were sutured to a metal ring to form a pool that was filled with paraffin oil. To record neuronal activity from single nociceptive afferents, small nerve bundles were cut from the nerve proximally, teased into smaller filaments on a dissecting platform, and wrapped around a silver-wire recording electrode placed above the splitting platform. Teasing of a filament continued until neuronal activity could be recorded from single nociceptive A- and C fibers. A stimulating electrode locatedÂ ~4 cm distally at the nerve trunk was used to electrically stimulate the nerve to reveal fibers on the recording electrode and to determine the conduction velocity at the nerve trunk of the afferent under study. RFs were located by applying gentle squeeze stimuli to the skin innervated by the nerve under study. RFs of nerve fibers unresponsive to such stimuli were located by electrical stimuli applied transcutaneously via a pair of ball electrodes using a search paradigm described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meyer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ringkamp et al., 2001</xref>). In fibers responsive to gentle squeezing, the mechanosensitive RF was mapped with a 8.9 bar von Frey hair (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA), and boundaries were marked on the skin with a felt tip permanent marker. Using a slightly suprathreshold von Frey hair, the most sensitive, mechanoresponsive spot was identified within the RF and marked as the hot spot. von Frey hairs of increasing stiffness were applied to this spot to determine the mechanical threshold of the nerve fiber. The smallest von Frey hair producing a neuronal response in two out of four applications was regarded as threshold. Units were classified as mechano-sensitive afferents (MSAs) if they were responsive to von Frey hair stimuliÂ &lt;6 bar, and mechano-insensitive afferents (MIAs) if the threshold wasÂ &gt;6 bar. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation at the proximal edge of the RF was used to measure conduction latencies from the skin. Stimuli up to 100 mA were used, and the latency at this intensity was regarded as the conduction latency of the peripheral parent axon. Conduction distance was measured from the RF to the recording electrode using suture material placed along the presumed path of the nerve, and conduction velocities were calculated by dividing this distance by the conduction latency recorded from electrical stimulation. Fibers with a conduction velocityÂ &lt;2 m/s were classified as C- and those between 2Â andÂ 20 m/s as AÎ´-fibers. The responsiveness to heat was tested by applying a heat stimulus (49Â°C, 3 s from a base temperature of 38Â°C for 3 s) to the middle of the RF using a feedback-controlled carbon dioxide laser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meyer et al., 1976</xref>). Instantaneous frequencies of responses to this stimulus were three point median smoothed and then used to classify C fibers as quickly (QC) or slowly (SC) responding afferents as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wooten et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, QCs responded with a burst of discharge at the onset of the heat stimulus, and the response then quickly adapted during the temperature plateau. In contrast, SCs responded slowly, lacked a burst discharge at the response onset, and the discharge peaked during the plateau phase of the heat stimulus. Ten minutes after this stepped heat stimulus, a heat staircase was applied (baseline of 38Â°C for 15 s, followed by 1Â°C, 1 s increments up to 49Â°C) to measure heat threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Primate electrophysiology: chemical stimulation</title><p>Ten minutes after applying the heat staircase, two blocks of intradermal injections (each 10 Î¼l) were administered at the RF. One block consisted of extracellular fluid (ECF, the vehicle) followed by ALA (90 Î¼g in ECF, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and another block of BAM8-18, the control peptide (1 Î¼g in saline, synthesized in the Keck Lab, Yale University, New Haven, CT), followed by BAM8-22 (1 Î¼g in saline, Tocris Bioscience). Each injection (volume 10 Âµl) was administered with a 28 G1/2 Lo-Dose syringe (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The order of the blocks was randomized. Following each injection, neuronal activity was recorded for at least 5 min or until no neuronal activity was recorded for three consecutive minutes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Primate electrophysiology: data recording</title><p>APs were filtered, amplified, and digitized and stored for offline data analysis using a Digital Acquisition Processor board (Microstar Laboratories Inc Bellevue, WA) and DAPSYS software (Brian Turnquist, Bethel University, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dapsys.net/">http://www.dapsys.net/</ext-link>, version 8.78). DAPSYS software was also used to control the CO<sub>2</sub> laser stimulator, record the skin temperature, trigger electrical stimuli, and time intradermal injections. APs, trigger pulses, commands for the laser, and injection profiles were âtime-stampedâ in DAPSYS and therefore allowed to relate neuronal events and stimuli applied to the RF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Human psychophysics: subjects and pruritogens</title><p>32 healthy volunteers, 15 females and 17 males, were enrolled after providing written informed consent to protocols approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee and that met the Declaration of Helsinki Principles for human subjects. The mean age was 32.8Â +Â 14.9, the median 28 years. Among these 19 were Caucasian, 8 Asian, 2 Hispanic, and 3 were more than one race. Initially, 33 subjects were recruited, 1 did not qualify for participation due to not feeling itch during tests with a single pruritogen and data from 3 subjects were not included in the analysis because all stimuli could not be tested due to scheduling issues.</p><p>Potential subjects were excluded from participation in the study if they reported a medical history of cardiac, immunological, dermatological, or neurological disorders or reported taking antihistamine or analgesic medication recently.</p><p>The pruritogens, ALA (Sigma-Aldrich; 90 Âµg/10 Âµl; 100 mM; 1.01 Âµmol), BAM8-22 (Tocris Bioscience; 1 Âµg/10 Âµl; 51 ÂµM; 0.51 nmol), and HIS dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich; 10 Âµg/10 Âµl; 5.4 mM; 54 nmol), as well as a combination of two substances (ALA 90 Âµg with BAM8-22 1 Âµg in 10 Âµl) and combination of all three substances (ALA 90 Âµg with BAM8-22 1 Âµg and HIS 10 Âµg in 10 Âµl) were each prepared under sterile conditions in saline 0.9%. Effects of vehicle solutions (saline, ECF) were not tested as in a previous study normal saline elicited a transient itch of low magnitude in a small proportion of subjects tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simone et al., 1987</xref>). Similarly, in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sikand et al., 2011b</xref>) ECF-induced sensations were minimal with an average peak magnitude itch that did not differ from itch induced by 10<sup>â3</sup> Âµg of HIS and nociceptive sensations less than those produced by HIS dosesÂ â¥Â 10<sup>â2</sup> Âµg. In the present experiments, we did not measure the pH of each solution. But in a previous study no difference was found in the itch evoked by HIS in a vehicle of normal saline alone (with pH of 5.0) versus a vehicle of phosphate buffered saline that had a pH of 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simone et al., 1987</xref>). The testing procedure was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LaMotte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sikand et al., 2009</xref>),Â and concentrations for injections were based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sikand et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simone et al., 1991</xref>).

Each arm was tested maximally up to two times per session with subsequent injections made well outside the area of dysesthesias produced by a prior injection and after the sensation of the previous injection was not present anymore. The order of administration for trials was random and blinded for each subject. Control peptides, amino acids, and vehicles (BAM8-18, L-alanine, and saline) were not administered as their evoked responses were either minimal or absent in previous human psychophysics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sikand et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simone et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>Subjects were instructed not to scratch or move the arm following the injection.

Prior to testing, in an independent training session, subjects were familiarized with and instructed to rate the magnitude of sensory quality by moving a cursor to a desired position along the Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Green et al., 1996</xref>) displayed on a computer screen. The display and recording of ratings were controlled by DAPSYS 6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dapsys.net">http://www.dapsys.net</ext-link>; Brian Turnquist, Bethel University, St. Paul, Minnesota). The computer converted the chosen position to a numerical score (not visible to the subject) between â0â at the bottom of the line to â100â at the top. The scale was labeled with a quasi-logarithmical distribution of descriptive labels:Â âno sensationâ (located at a numerical position of 0),Â âbarely detectableâ (1),Â âweakâ (6),Â âmoderateâ (17),Â âstrongâ (35),Â âvery strongâ (53),Â andÂ âstrongest imaginable sensation of any kindâ (100). Each rating value on the gLMS corresponded with the maximum sensation felt by the individual within the last 30 s interval for each of three distinct sensation categories: âitching,â âpricking/stinging,â and âburningâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LaMotte et al., 2009</xref>). Itch was defined as a sensation that evokes a desire to scratch. Pricking/stinging was defined as a nociceptive sensation that was sharp and well-localized, either intermittent like a needle prick, or continuous like an insect sting. Burning was defined as a nociceptive sensation most often associated with sunburns or thermal burns, but also with skin abrasions, strong cold, and/or chemical irritants. Instructions also distinguished the above sensations from others, and subjects were specifically asked to rate the magnitude of nociceptive (âpain-likeâ) sensations regardless of whether or not overt pain occurred. Subjects were asked to ignore the initial prick of the needle entering the skin immediately after the injection. Subjects were prompted to rate levels of sensations experienced only in and surrounding the area of the application of the pruritogen every 30 s for a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20 min or until each sensory quality received three successive ratings of zero magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Human psychophysics: skin reactions and areas of dysesthesias</title><p>After the conclusion of the sensory ratings, the visual barrier was removed and superficial changes to the skinâs appearance were marked on the skin.

Mechanical testing proceeded in a radial manner beginning on the outer edge of the arm and moving inward nearing the center of the injection. Alloknesis was denoted as an area within which itch was evoked by light stroking with a cotton swab. Hyperalgesia and hyperknesis were defined as enhanced pricking pain and itch evoked by von Frey-type filaments with tip diameters (and exerting bending forces) of 200 Âµm (80 mN) and 50 Âµm (20 mN), respectively, each applied for 1 s.

encoding of itch in human and non-human primate. In addition to demonstrating important differences in the mouse and human expression pattern of pruritogen receptor genes, their findings do not support the spatial contrast theory of itch vs pain generation, a theory that postulates that there is considerable overlap in the primary afferents that signal itch and pain.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pruriception and neuronal coding in nociceptor subtypes in human and nonhuman primates&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mahsa Sadeghi (Reviewer #1); H Richard Koerber (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>This manuscript describes a series of studies designed to investigate the coding of itch in primates. The authors combine findings from electrophysiological recordings from individual cutaneous fibers in non-human primates and the expression of pruriceptive receptors in human sensory neurons. The authors' findings challenge the spatial contrast theory for the coding of itch and pain.</p><p>Major concerns required additional experimental results for the revision: Two of the reviewers note that you did not examine the expression pattern of MrgprC and MrgprD in non-human primate DRG neurons. This is relevant as the expression pattern of mMrgA and mMrgC subfamilies differs considerably, even between different species of rodent. For example, colocalization of mMrgA and mMrgC subfamilies has been reported in mice, but not in rat.</p><p>Figure 6. You conclude that &quot;the co-activation of different classes of CMHs or co-activation of CMHs and C-MIAs does not increase areas of dysesthesias, flare and/or wheal in comparison to the activation of distinct classes of nociceptors alone&quot;. Did you try lower doses of His alone, or in combination with AlA and BAM8-22? There is a possibility that the concentration of His or other pruritogen used reached the saturation level for inducing itch and pain. That would explain why there was no further increase in pain and itch sensation following administration of the three pruritogens together. If lower doses were indeed tested, then those data should be included in a revision. Otherwise, such experiments are critical to a correct interpretation of your results.</p><p>One reviewer suggests that calcium imaging of primate DRG neurons might address your concern regarding expression and functional data discrepancy, and certainly would help to address the functional activation of these receptors in the DRG. Although this would certainly be an excellent addition to the revision, at this time we do not consider this an essential experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64506.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] Major concerns required additional experimental results for the revision: Two of the reviewers note that you did not examine the expression pattern of MrgprC and MrgprD in non-human primate DRG neurons.

For example, colocalization of mMrgA and mMrgC subfamilies has been reported in mice, but not in rat.</p></disp-quote><p>The nomenclature and differences in genomic representation of the Mrgpr receptors in different species can be confusing and a little complicated. To be clear, the genomes of humans and non-human primates do not contain genes for any <italic>Mrgpra</italic> or <italic>Mrgprc</italic> receptor. Therefore, we interpret the Reviewersâ question as, âDid we examine the expression of MRGPRX1 and MRGPRD in non-human primates?â We answer this query by performing the later comparison in tissue from Macaca <italic>nemestrina</italic> DRG, because we could not examine the expression of Mrgpra and Mrgprc in monkey DRG. The new results from nonhuman primate DRG are illustrated in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, summarized in Supplementary File 1 and stated in lines 130-138, (pg. 67) as follows:</p><p>âIn parallel with these studies, we characterized the expression of MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 in DRG of macaques. [â¦] Together our results point to profound species-dependent differences of MRGPR expression patterns between rodents and primates with additional slight differences inside the primate lineage.â</p><p>Further, in the section (lines 108-111, pg 6) of our manuscript where we introduce the species difference in Mrgpr, we amended the description and added a dendrogram (see Figure 1A), that schematically explains the species differences to help clarify the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6.

The goal is to test whether a combination of pruritogens that activates more types of primary afferents and decreases the spatial contrast between activated and silent fibers, would increase pain and diminish itch. This point is now strengthened in the introduction (see lines 83-88, pg 4-5) and stated as follows:</p><p>âHowever, it has not been tested in humans whether a combination of pruritogens that activates a greater number and variety of primary afferents and thereby decreases the spatial contrast between activated and silent fibers could lead to reduced itch and/or increased nociceptive sensation.â</p><p>As for testing lower doses of histamine, in a previous study (Simone at al., 1987), histamine was applied in human subjects over a range of 10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>+2</sup> Âµg. While the flare area saturated at 10 Âµg, the sensation of itch increased throughout the dose range with the highest magnitude of itch being reported at 100 Âµg. Therefore, the histamine dose administered in the present study (10 Âµg) is not at the saturation dose for the sensation of itch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer suggests that calcium imaging of primate DRG neurons might address your concern regarding expression and functional data discrepancy, and certainly would help to address the functional activation of these receptors in the DRG.

The responses to the different pruritogens may depend on where these are administered (peripheral cutaneous terminal vs soma). Therefore, calcium imaging experiments on neuronal DRG soma would not be able to resolve the discrepancy between RNA expression and the functional data observed after peripheral, cutaneous injection of the pruritogens. We agree with the reviewers that such experiments are not essential at this time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
