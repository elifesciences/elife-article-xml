These myriad effects are thought to be produced by parallel ascending circuits working in combination. Here, we describe a pathway from spinal cord to brain for ongoing pain. Activation of a subset of spinal neurons expressing Tacr1 evokes a full repertoire of somatotopically directed pain-related behaviors in the absence of noxious input. Tacr1 projection neurons (expressing NKR1) target a tiny cluster of neurons in the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN-SL). We show that these neurons, which also express Tacr1 (PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup>), are responsive to sustained but not acute noxious stimuli. Activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons alone did not trigger pain responses but instead served to dramatically heighten nocifensive behaviors and suppress itch. Remarkably, mice with silenced PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons ignored long-lasting noxious stimuli. Together, these data reveal new details about this spinoparabrachial pathway and its key role in the sensation of ongoing pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>parabrachial nucleus</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chesler</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Ariel</given-names></name><name><surname>Chesler</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A circuit involving Tacr1-expressing neurons in the spinal cord and the parabrachial nucleus controls how mice respond to a wide range of persistently painful stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Somatosensory input to the spinal cord provides information about both the external environment and internal state, driving reflex responses and complex perceptual experiences including the sensation of pain. Nociception provides animals with crucial protection from mechanical, thermal, and chemical threats, but many other types of sensory input can become painful after injury, during inflammation, or in disease. An extensive body of work has explored how networks of cells in the dorsal spinal cord process noxious versus innocuous sensory input and the context-dependent plasticity in these circuits that results in pain. Many different classes of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons have been shown to be required for processing nociceptive input and the transformation of normally innocuous signals into pain. These include cells expressing select combinations of neuropeptides and their receptors, including Substance P (encoded by <italic>Tac1</italic>) and its receptor NKR1 (encoded by <italic>Tacr1</italic>). Ultimately, these spinal circuits activate projection neurons that transmit the highly processed input to the brain.</p><p>Spinal projection neurons are sparse and heterogenous in their gene expression and their anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peirs and Seal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Todd, 2010</xref>) but again include cells expressing both Substance P and NKR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiang et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). For example, one group resides in the most superficial part of the dorsal horn (Lamina I) and is thought to receive input from peripheral nociceptors, itch neurons, and thermoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bester et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wercberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wercberger and Basbaum, 2019</xref>). A second set of projection neurons is located in the deep dorsal horn (Laminae II-VI) where they integrate noxious and low-threshold sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wall, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wercberger and Basbaum, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willis, 1983</xref>). Both groups of spinal projection neurons target multiple sites in the brainstem and thalamus, with each site proposed to have unique roles in driving different aspects of sensation, learning and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rpc, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Todd, 2010</xref>). The prevailing view is that these parallel outputs combine to elicit the full pain experience. If true, then direct activation of the correct ensemble of projection neurons should produce behaviors indistinguishable from those evoked by actual noxious stimuli. By contrast, activating or silencing individual central targets might be expected to selectively affect particular aspects of pain and potentially reveal substrates that encode specific attributes of this complex state.</p><p>The lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a brainstem nucleus of a few thousand neurons in mice, receives nociceptive inputs from the projection neurons in the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Todd, 2010</xref>) and plays a central role in pain. Two subregions of the lPBN have been defined by their distinctive gene expression patterns as well as their forebrain projections. Neurons in the dorsal PBN (dPBN) expressing dynorphin (PDyn) project predominantly to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), while external lateral parabrachial neurons (elPBN) expressing the neuropeptides CGRP or Substance P project to the central amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST), insular cortex (INS), and the medullary formation (MdD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palmiter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that these different output pathways have differing functional specifications. For example, CGRP projections to the amygdala appear particularly important for somatic and visceral distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>) and also play a role in affective touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, Tac1-positive neurons projecting to the MdD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>) participate in nocifensive responses, whereas the Pdyn neurons in the dPBN are important for sensing gut stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2020</xref>) and forming aversive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we studied projections from the spinal cord to the PBN and discovered a population of lPBN neurons expressing Tacr1 that receive input from Tacr1-expressing spinal projection neurons. We demonstrate that this circuit is both necessary and sufficient for the heightened behavioral responses observed during ongoing noxious stimulation. Direct activation of the spinal Tacr1 neurons causes striking behaviors that closely match pain responses. Interestingly, activation of their parabrachial Tacr1 targets demonstrates that this branch of the ascending pathway is responsible for controlling the magnitude of the behavioral response and appears to be required for affective aspects of pain sensation. Our data complement and extend recent reports highlighting the roles of both spinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) and parabrachial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2020</xref>) Tacr1 neurons as important drivers of pain behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Tacr1 has been widely used as a marker for projection neurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Todd, 2010</xref>); however, not all projection neurons are marked by Tacr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) and interneurons also express this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>) Nonetheless, the spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are well known to play a crucial role in normal nociceptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mantyh et al., 1997</xref>). We initially characterized mice where <italic>Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> was used to drive GFP-expression to assess the proportions of projection neurons and interneurons targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Our results confirmed that <italic>Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mediates recombination both in the superficial and deep dorsal horn with about 40% of targeted neurons having soma diameters of projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Ghamdi et al., 2009</xref>). Next, we examined how activation of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons contributes to pain sensation by directly stimulating a small circumscribed group of these cells using chemogenetics. <italic>Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice were transduced with an AAV encoding the excitatory DREADD receptor hM3Dq fused to an mCherry reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>) on the right side of superficial lumbar dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed expression by neurons in Lamina I and Laminae III-V on the side ipsilateral to the injection location (L4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, administration of the hM3Dq ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) resulted in widespread Fos expression on the injected side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), validating this stimulation paradigm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> for quantitation). Our results showed that both hM3Dq-mCherry positive and negative neurons express Fos after CNO delivery. A likely explanation is that CNO activates Tacr1+ neurons, and that Tacr1+ neurons in turn activate other non-Tacr1 neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of Tacr1+ projection neurons causes fictive pain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon depicting the strategy to stimulate Tacr1-positive spinal neurons.

Within minutes of CNO application, animals with spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons expressing hM3Dq began spontaneously lifting, shaking and licking the hindlimb ipsilateral to the AAV injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). These responses were highly reminiscent of those caused by extremely noxious and persistent stimuli such as chemical irritants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>), lasted for over an hour and suppressed normal homecage behaviors (e.g. grooming; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Remarkably, animals on CNO became so focused on the DREADD-induced ‘fictive’ pain associated with the ipsilateral hindlimb that they ignored other highly salient stimuli. In particular, they were completely unresponsive to chloroquine, a potent puritogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>) that normally causes robust and long-lasting scratching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, chloroquine was applied to the nape of the neck, a completely different body area, and still induced Fos expression in the cervical spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, in addition to directing nocifensive behavior to a somatotopically conscribed area, the activation of a small group of lumbar spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons produced the well-known phenomenon of itch suppression by pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikoma et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, our data strongly suggest that itch suppression by pain must involve a central mechanism since peripheral signaling persists.

To answer these questions, we sought molecular markers that could be used to genetically manipulate PBN-SL neurons so we could study their anatomy and function. Since both the neuropeptide (Tac1) and one of its receptors (Tacr1) were expressed by the spinal projection neurons, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) we predicted that tachykinin signaling molecules might mark this sensory circuit. Indeed, multiplex fluorescent in-situ hybridization revealed Tacr1 to be highly expressed in a tight cluster of excitatory cells in the PBN-SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The expression of Tacr1 in both the spinal and PBN-SL neurons meant their anatomical connectivity could be probed by differentially transducing each region with AAVs in the same Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup> animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We labeled the presynaptic specializations of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> axons with Synaptophysin-GFP and the postsynaptic specializations of the PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> dendrites and soma using PSD95-tagRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Therefore, we next used anterograde tracing to determine the projections of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons by targeting the PBN of Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup> animals with an AAV-DIO-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Two forebrain regions were prominently innervated by PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>): (1) the midline thalamus (MTh) and (2) the lateral hypothalamus/ parasubthalamic nucleus (LH/PSTN).

Moreover, expression of synaptophysin-GFP in PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons provided evidence for presynaptic terminal specializations in both areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Do the same neurons target both MTh and LH/PSTN? Or are there two distinct types of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons with different higher brain targets and potential roles? To answer these questions, we adopted an intersectional strategy where we labeled PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons projecting to the LH/PSTh. Our approach used a Cre-dependent mCherry to label the cell bodies of Tacr1-expressing neurons in the PBN. We also injected the PSTN with retroAAV-FlpO and used a PBN injected Flp-dependent synaptophysin-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</xref>) to label the synaptic termini of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). We confirmed that the PBN-SL neurons expressed both labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) meaning that PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons project to the LH/PSTN, validating our approach. Importantly, Synaptophysin-GFP puncta were also abundant in the MTh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) demonstrating collateralization of PBN cells that we presume express <italic>Tacr1</italic>. Together, these anatomical experiments reveal two previously unappreciated targets of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons in the forebrain. Therefore, we anticipated that these neurons may play a specialized role related to pain and next set out to record their responses as well as determine their function.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons collateralize and project to both MTh and LH/PSTN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A complex intersectional genetic strategy was devised to label PBN-SL neurons that project to LH/PSTN and examine if they project to other brain areas (cartoon left side). The terminals of PBN neurons in the LH/PSTN were transduced with retrograde viral vector encoding Flp recombinase in a Tacr1<sup>cre</sup> mouse. In the same animal, two viral additional vectors were co-injected into the PBN. The first encoded a Flp-dependent presynaptic marker (SypGFP) and the second encoded a Cre-dependent cellular marker (mCherry). Under these conditions, the cells bodies and axons of PBN neurons that project to LH/PSTN (and were transduced by the retrograde Flp-virus) are labeled in green and PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are labeled in red.

Therefore, to study how PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are tuned to respond to sensory stimuli, we engineered mice expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in these neurons and implanted optical fibers to record population-level activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Consistent with our anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), fiber-photometry recordings demonstrated that many types of noxious stimulus strongly activate PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons. An example recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) highlights the typical type of long-lasting calcium transient that was elicited by a single pinch of the hindpaw of a lightly anesthetized mouse. Activation of these neurons was observed irrespective of the pinch location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Again, PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons exhibited robust population calcium responses to this type of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). By contrast, punctate mechanical stimuli did not evoke calcium responses in PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

We next asked whether these pathways converged on PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons by recording evoked activity in this population to high temperatures and chemical irritants.

Like pinch, both of these are long-lasting painful stimuli that activate distinct sets of peripheral nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>). However, PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons were not activated by short-term noxious heat (Hargreaves test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Interestingly, although AITC is known to cause allodynia and hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albin et al., 2008</xref>), this type of skin irritation did not sensitize PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> responses to acute touch or heat stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-F</xref>). In combination, the photometry data strongly support PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons as playing a major role in an ascending pathway from spinal dorsal horn that is activated by sustained noxious inputs.</p><p>We next set out to determine how this circuit influences pain behaviors by generating mice where PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons could be chemogenetically activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Although activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons did not induce spontaneous directed pain responses, CNO delivery transformed behavior: mice became skittish, avoided handling and repeatedly attempted to escape from the test chambers (possibly a general pain state). This heightened arousal and anxiety were quantified using an open-field arena as increased movement and avoidance of the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mice now withdrew from the slightest touch with thin von Frey filaments (0.07 g; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), something not seen in saline controls. Moreover, in a sustained pinch assay using a clip applied to the paw, activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons increased nocifensive behavior and almost doubled the time a mouse spent shaking the clipped paw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Even more strikingly, behavioral changes persisted after the clip was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although saline -treated mice quickly returned to normal resting behaviors, after CNO the same animals continued to lick and investigate the hindpaw for many minutes after the pinch was terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Equally robust effects of stimulating PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons were observed in responses to AITC, a chemical irritant which normally causes licking and attending to the affected area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The time a CNO-treated mouse spent licking the injected site more than doubled. CNO-injected mice also exhibited heightened escape responses when exposed to heat in a hotplate assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Therefore, this circuit plays a role in controlling the magnitude of behavioral responses to a range of noxious stimuli that activate different peripheral sensory neurons. Interestingly, the latency in a mouse’s response to heat, thought to involve simple spinal reflexes, was not influenced indicating that peripheral sensitization is not involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons induces a ‘hyper-vigilant’ state resembling the effects of long-term noxious stimulation (e.g. inflammation) as seen in assays like the formalin test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, activating the PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons using CNO did not enhance responses to formalin, presumably reflecting the potency of this inflammatory stimulus.

Mice treated with CNO spend significantly more time shaking (C; p=0.0003) and as a result exhibited less licking events (D; p=0.0044) directed to the hindpaw during the Clip assay. Notably, CNO-treated mice continued to lick the hindpaw for several minutes after the clip was removed (E; p=&lt;0.0001). CNO treatment also increased the number of times mice licked their paws after topical AITC treatment (F; p=0.0009) and jumped to escape from a 55°C hotplate (G; p=&lt;0.0001).

Therefore, we next investigated how activation of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons affected behavioral responses to pruritogens. To induce itch, we injected chloroquine, a potent non-histaminergic puritogen that activates a select type of peripheral itch neuron and evokes vigorous scratching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Injecting this compound into the nape of the neck of control mice reliably induced localized bouts of scratching starting a few minutes after injection and lasting for about 30 min. Remarkably, chemogenetic stimulation of the small group of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons completely suppressed scratching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), mimicking the effects both of painful stimuli and the fictive pain induced by activating Tacr1-expressing spinal projection neurons. Therefore, the PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons serve as a central substrate that is sufficient to suppress itch.</p><p>Chemogenetic activation and functional recordings demonstrate that PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons respond to painful stimuli and can induce hypervigilance and increased behavioral responses to sustained types of pain. However, it is well known that the central pathways controlling pain sensation and responses involve many regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bushnell et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we next used directed expression of tetanus toxin (TeNT-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>) to silence synaptic output and determine the role of this PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> circuit in pain behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). We again examined responses to different types of sustained stimuli that in control animals induce robust behaviors: the clip assay of extended pinch, and topical application of AITC. Remarkably, in both cases, silencing PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons almost completely eliminated shaking and licking normally induced by these stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–O</xref>). Moreover, at a qualitative level, mice with silenced PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons effectively ignored these normally painful stimuli. Thus, this small and localized cluster of PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons appears to play a profound role in pain and is necessary for normal behavioral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Together our results identify a circuit involving Tacr1-expressing neurons in the spinal cord and the PBN-SL that controls how mice respond to a wide range of persistently painful stimuli. Interestingly, more than 30 years ago McMahon and Wall described a loop from lamina I dorsal horn to the parabrachial nucleus that influences the activity of lamina I cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMahon and Wall, 1988</xref>). Our results here show that PBN-SL neurons expressing Tacr1 are important for responses to persistent noxious stimuli, exactly as predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wall et al., 1988</xref>). Importantly, activating the lumbar spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons closely mimics persistent pain by inducing pronounced, somatotopically directed behaviors. Very recently and in keeping with our data, other groups have demonstrated that spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are quite diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheahan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) and include a population of neurons that selectively innervate the PBN-SL to cause strong nocifensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons using a different genetic strategy induced itch-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheahan et al., 2020</xref>). In combination, these data highlight the role of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons in nociception but suggest that the different mouse lines and approaches likely targeted slightly different subsets or numbers of neurons to elicit distinct sensations. Nonetheless our results are entirely concordant with results from the Ginty lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) that implicate projections of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons to a small subnucleus of the PBN as crucial for affective aspects of pain.</p><p>We show that a primary target of spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> projection neurons are PBN-SL neurons that also express the NKR1-receptor. These PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are both necessary and sufficient to drive a subset of pain-related behaviors. PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are tuned to long-lasting noxious input regardless of location and are selectively important for behaviors that only occur when pain is persistent. When activated, PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons dramatically potentiate complex behavioral responses but not simple reflexes. Interestingly, when this group of neurons is stimulated in the absence of noxious peripheral input, mice become ‘jumpy’ and hypervigilant, now recoiling vigorously from the gentlest of touches that normally would be ignored in the absence of stimulation. For example, response to a first von Frey filament often evoked locomotion and escape from further attempts at stimulation even prior to touch. Comorbidities such as anhedonia and suppression of feeding have been reported to occur during ongoing pain and involve other nuclei in the PBN and their connections with the central amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, in the future it will be interesting to determine if PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons are also crucial for these types of behavioral changes since PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons do not directly target the amygdala but project to distinct regions of the forebrain.</p><p>The stimuli that we showed PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons respond to are all persistent types of pain. Since both substance P (<italic>Tac1</italic>) and its receptor NKR1 (<italic>Tacr1</italic>) are present both in the spinal projection neurons and in the PBN, it seems likely that neuropeptide signaling may modulate aspects of pain through this pathway. However, given that NKR1-antagonists have limited efficacy in human subjects, we suspect that painful stimulation must normally activate additional pathways that elicit negative valence. Finally, unlike spinal projection neurons, PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons do not themselves evoke pain responses or provide positional information but instead appear to drive affective aspects of pain. This is particularly apparent in the clip assay where mice with silenced PBN-SL<sup>Tacr1</sup> neurons almost completely ignore this type of sustained, and normally painful, pinch. In the future, determining how other central targets of the spinal<sup>Tacr1</sup> projection neurons control behavior should help reveal if pain responses are simply the sum of distinct parallel circuits or require interactions between distributed regions of the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6;129S-Tac1tm1.1(cre)Hze/J</td><td valign="top">Jax Mice</td><td valign="top">Stock number 021877</td><td valign="top">Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tacr1-T2A-Cre-Neo</td><td valign="top">Allen Brain Institute</td><td valign="top">Donated by Dr. Hongkui Zheng</td><td valign="top">Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato</td><td valign="top">UPenn; donated by Allen Institute</td><td valign="top">Addgene 28306-AAV9</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GFP</td><td valign="top">UPenn; donated by Allen Institute</td><td valign="top">Addgene 51502-AAV9</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min DRSC.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV5-hSyn-FLEX-GCaMP6f</td><td valign="top">Addgene; donated by Allen Institute</td><td valign="top">Addgene 100837-AAV5</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV5-hSyn-DIO-mCherry</td><td valign="top">UNC</td><td valign="top">Addgene 50459-AAV9</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq</td><td valign="top">UNC; donated by Bryan Roth</td><td valign="top">Addgene 50474-AAV9</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV8-Flex-hSyn-Synaptophysin-YFP</td><td valign="top">MGH GDT Core</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-Flex-hSyn-PSD95-TagRFP</td><td valign="top">Chesler Lab, NCCIH</td><td valign="top">Construct donated by Mark Hoon</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAVDJ-CMV-eGFP-2A-TeNT</td><td valign="top">Stanford Viral Core GVVCAAV-71e</td><td valign="top">GVVCAAV-71e</td><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAVRetro-hSyn-FLPo</td><td valign="top">Levine Lab, NINDS <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV1-hSyn-FSF-Syp-EGFP</td><td valign="top">Levine Lab, NINDS <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">200 nl of viral particles (1:1 in saline) at 100 nl/min</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>Animal care and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Tac1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (Tac1-IRES2-Cre-D or B6;129S-Tac1tm1.1(cre)Hze/J; Stock number 021877) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2014</xref>) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. <italic>Tacr1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (Tacr1-T2A-Cre-Neo) was kindly donated by Dr Hongkui Zheng, Allen Brain Institute.

Experiments throughout all the intraplantar and intraperitoneal administrations were performed by one experimenter (A.B.). All experiments were done in the same room, which was specifically designated for behavior and under red light. Mice were habituated in their home-cages for at least 30 min in the behavior room before experiments. For the Hargreaves test, mice were habituated in transparent plexiglass chambers for 30 min. Clozapine-N-Oxide (1 mg/kg) dissolved in DMSO and diluted in saline was injected i.p. 60–90 min before behavioral experiments or histochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>). In the assays where spontaneous behaviors were scored, the behaviors were recorded with a digital camera and scored with a stopwatch and a hand-held cell-counter or using the CleverSys software. In the itch assay an individual scratching bout was calculated as a single event. Similarly, for calculating the no. of licks and no. of grooming bouts, each bout was counted as an event. This is because each lick or each scratch by itself is too fast to be reliably scored. Rather, the bout lasting from the start to stop of the behavior was counted as a single event. The shaking behavior did not occur in bouts and thus individual shakes were accounted for during scoring. Hot-plate and Hargreaves tests were scored as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>.</p><p>The clip assay was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2019</xref>.

The mice were restrained on a foam-filter paper bed in a way the hind paw stuck out to enable clip application. While one experimenter restrained the animal, another experimenter applied the clip and took it off. The clip was never kept on the experimental animals for more than 60–70 s. For the AITC test, 10% AITC (Sigma) in saline was injected intradermally in the paw as described in, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNamara et al., 2007</xref>). For the formalin test, 2% formalin in saline was injected under the dorsal skin of the right hindpaw with an insulin syringe until a swelling was observed (20ul) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>). All the experiments were videotaped with an over-head video camera or a panasonic digital camera and scored offline post-hoc using TopScan by CleverSys. The Hargreaves apparatus, and the programmable hotplate were purchased from IITC and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Von Frey test was done by manually applying the following filaments: 0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1, 1.4 g. Animals received 10 stimulations on the left paw.

Fluorescence emission was collected through the same patch cord and filtered on a CMOS sensor. Data was acquired through Bonsai. Photometry data was analyzed using a MATLAB code provided by Neurophotometrics. To correct for photobleaching and heat mediated LED decay, the isosbestic signal was fit with a biexponential that was then linearly-scaled to the calcium-dependent fluorescence signal F.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard D Palmiter (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a concise paper describing a projection from spinal cord to Tacr1-expressing neurons in the PBN. The authors conclude that activation of this spinal cord &gt; PBN Tacr1 circuit &quot;does not trigger pain responses but instead serves to dramatically heighten nocifensive behaviors and suppress itch&quot; and that mice with &quot;silenced Tacr1 neurons ignore long-lasting noxious stimuli”. These are interesting and important findings that complement a recent paper (Deng et al., 2020). The conclusions reached by the authors are generally substantiated, but considerable revision is required, but some additional experiments are essential. These experiments will not only strengthen the authors' conclusions, but may provide some insight as to underlying mechanism as to the very interesting finding relating pain to itch inhibition.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns several requiring additional experimental information:</p><p>1) This paper appears to have been written for a different journal. As the authors have more space in <italic>eLife</italic> they should move some of the more interesting supplementary figures to main figures. They should also expand on the Discussion and take advantage of the Deng/Sun paper to compare results of the two studies to create an integrated picture.</p><p>2) The Fos induction after activating Tacr1 neurons in spinal cord is not impressive and does not appear to be colocalized with red cells expressing the DREADD (Figure 1—figure supplement 4C). Quantification Fos overlap with Tacr1 and Fos in non-Tacr1 cells is needed. Likewise, quantification of overlap of Tacr1 and Tac1 in lamina 1 of spinal cord is needed.</p><p>3) A poke (von Frey) and a pinch (squeeze) are different, so the conclusion that the PBN Tacr1 neurons only respond to sustained stimuli needs better validation. A revision should definitely include a different painful stimulus; foot shocks that may be easier to precisely time. Alternatively a dry ice application test could be used.</p><p>4) The authors say that &quot;PBN-Tacr1 neurons induces a &quot;hyper-vigilant&quot; state resembling the effects of long-term noxious stimulation (e.g. inflammation).&quot; Which raises the question of how the mice respond to an inflammatory stimulus (e.g. carrageenan or formalin)?</p><p>5) Most importantly, what percentage of spinal Tacr1-expressing neurons are projection neurons? The authors gave the impression that Tacr1-expressing cells in spinal cord are all projection neurons, but as Todd has reported some are undoubtedly interneurons. This should be quantified.</p><p>6) The question of the nature of the NK1R neurons is particularly relevant given the recent contribution of the NK1R neurons from the Sarah Ross lab, which has a Biorxiv paper indicating NK1R(Tacr1)-expressing spinal interneurons are involved in itch (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.199471v1.full). Of course, this paper indicated that activating Tacr1-neurons suppresses itch. This should be discussed.</p><p>7) Here also is where an additional experiment could not only focus on the difference in the results from the Ross lab, but also provide some insight into mechanism:</p><p>8) The inhibition of nape of the neck chloroquine-induced scratching is perhaps the most remarkable and exciting finding. Does the mechanism involve inhibition at the level of the spinal cord (via an ascending-descending loop), or is it an effect that occurs supraspinally? If the latter, then one would predict that nape of the neck chloroquine-evoked cervical cord Fos expression would persist after lumbar cord DREADD stimulation. This is an easy experiment, somewhat complicated perhaps by the fact that the loss of scratching would inevitably reduce Fos in the cervical cord. But any Fos attributed to the chloroquine activation of pruritoceptors should either persist, if the inhibition occurs supraspinally, or disappear, if the inhibition occurs at the level of the cord. This is an experiment that should absolutely be included in a revision.</p><p>9) Lastly, it would great if the authors could provide videos of activating Tacr1 neurons showing pain like behaviors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61135.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns several requiring additional experimental information:</p><p>1) This paper appears to have been written for a different journal.
