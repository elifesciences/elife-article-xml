In 1992, it was shown that the cause of the disease is an autosomal-dominant mutation at codon 178 of the PrP<sup>C</sup> encoding gene (<italic>PRNP</italic>), resulting in aspartic acid (D) to asparagine (N) substitution (D178N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Medori et al., 1992</xref>). Since a main clinical feature of the disease was the presence of a severe and untreatable insomnia, it was named FFI. The pathology primarily affects the thalamus that shows neuronal loss, spongiform changes, astrogliosis, and moderate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montagna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Macchi et al., 1997</xref>). In cases of long disease duration, such alterations involve also the cerebral cortex. The polymorphism at codon 129 of the <italic>PRNP</italic> (methionine [M] or valine [V]) plays a significant role in disease heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monari et al., 1994</xref>). For instance, the presence of MM (FFI<sup>D178N-129MM</sup>) causes FFI with rapid progression (7–18 months), sleep disturbances, and dysautonomia. The presence of MV (FFI<sup>D178N-129MV</sup>) is associated with longer disease duration (20–35 months) with equilibrium and gait dysfunctions, while the presence of VV causes a distinct genetic disease, referred to as familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD<sup>D178N-129VV</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gambetti et al., 1995</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that codon 129 polymorphism in <italic>PRNP</italic> does not influence the age at disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montagna et al., 2006</xref>). PrP<sup>C</sup> is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it undergoes several post-translation modifications, including the addition of a GPI anchor to its C-terminal part, the formation of a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues (Cys179-Cys214), and the N-linked glycosylation at two asparagine residues (Asn181 and Asn197) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Turk et al., 1988</xref>). Finally, in the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharides are modified to produce complex-type chains rich in sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caughey et al., 1989</xref>), which have an important role in targeting PrP<sup>C</sup> to neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bate et al., 2016</xref>). The pattern of glycosylation gives rise to different PrP<sup>C</sup> forms: the di-glycosylated (70%), the mono-glycosylated (25%), and the un-glycosylated (5%) species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caughey et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rudd et al., 1999</xref>). All PrP<sup>C</sup> species are soluble in detergent and sensitive to proteinase K (PK) digestion. The D178N mutation reduces the structural stability of the PrP<sup>C</sup>, which is more prone to convert into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liemann and Glockshuber, 1999</xref>). This latter is less soluble in detergent and is partially resistant to PK digestion. After PK treatment, the resistant un-glycosylated band of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> associated with FFI<sup>D178N-129MM</sup> or FFI<sup>D178N-129MV</sup> shows a molecular weight of 19 kDa, while that associated with fCJD<sup>D178N-129VV</sup> has a molecular weight of 21 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monari et al., 1994</xref>). These differences suggest that the mutation at position 178 and the polymorphism at 129 of the <italic>PRNP</italic> affect the tertiary structure of the protein, thus influencing the cleavage of PK at the N-terminal region. Such alterations in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> structure might be the factor responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity of FFI. The ability of the D178N mutation to promote conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that results in the generation of spontaneous prion pathology was shown in mice genetically modified to express murine PrP with the D177N mutation (the equivalent to human D178N) where PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is barely detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouybayoune et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2009</xref>). The infectious properties of FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> were extensively investigated by transmission studies in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tateishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sasaki et al., 2005</xref>) and in several lines of mice genetically modified to express human PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Telling et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Telling et al., 1995</xref>) as well as primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tateishi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collinge et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Telling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeuchi et al., 2019</xref>). Results of these studies showed that several factors, including the polymorphisms at codon 129 of the incoming FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> inoculum, the prion titer of the FFI brain areas used to challenge the animals, and the PrP<sup>C</sup> amino acid sequence of the recipient animals, could significantly influence the transmission efficiency. Notably, when inoculated in mice expressing a chimeric human-mouse PrP, FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is able to promote the generation of prions characterized by similar biochemical features of the original inoculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Telling et al., 1996</xref>). In a recent report, FFI was efficiently transmitted to knock-in mice expressing the bank vole PrP (BvPrP) with methionine at codon 109 of the PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeuchi et al., 2019</xref>). Also in this case, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generated in mice showed the typical biochemical features of FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (predominance of the di-glycosylated band and migration of the un-glycosylated PrP species at 19 kDa). By exploiting the recently developed Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saborio et al., 2001</xref>) and Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atarashi et al., 2011</xref>), it was shown that FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can promote PrP<sup>C</sup> misfolding and aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orrú et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, we have previously shown that the PMCA is able to detect traces of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in the olfactory mucosa (OM) of a patient with FFI (at a late stage of the disease) using the brain of bank voles (Bv109M) as a reaction substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Redaelli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we verified whether PMCA-generated products possess infectious properties when challenged in mice genetically modified to express the BvPrP with methionine at codon 109 (BvPrP-Tg407) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, animals were inoculated with (1) raw FFI or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain homogenates (FFI-BH or AD-BH), (2) their PMCA products (FFI-BH_PMCA or AD-BH_PMCA), and (3) PMCA products obtained from OM of FFI or AD patients (FFI-OM_PMCA or AD-OM_PMCA). Our results indicate that BvPrP-Tg407 mice are highly susceptible to infection by FFI-BH but also by the PMCA products (FFI-BH_PMCA and FFI-OM_PMCA). Particularly, animals inoculated with PMCA products developed prion isolates and neuropathological changes significantly different from those observed in mice challenged with FFI-BH. It is likely that, through PMCA, we have generated bank vole-adapted FFI prion isolates that acquired infectious properties distinct from that of the original FFI, and this resulted in the appearance of different pathological phenotypes of the disease. As expected, none of the animals inoculated with AD-related samples developed prion pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">BvPrP-Tg407 mice</td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01592-16">10.1128/JVI.01592-16</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">recBvPrP<sub>90-231</sub></td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46269">10.1038/srep46269</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">6D11</td><td valign="top">Covance</td><td valign="top">Catalog # SIG-399810 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2564735">AB_2564735</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB: 0.2 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Sha31</td><td valign="top">SPI Bio</td><td valign="top">Catalog # A03213</td><td valign="top">WB: 0.4 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse IgG HRP Linked F(ab’)2 Fragment</td><td valign="top">GE</td><td valign="top">Catalog # NA9310V</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Saf34</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gently provided by Prof. Jacques Grassi <break/>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02356.x">10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02356.x</ext-link> <break/>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1006/bbrc.1999.1730">10.1006/bbrc.1999.1730</ext-link> <break/>IHC: 1.25 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">GFAP antibody</td><td valign="top">DAKO</td><td valign="top">Catalog # Z0334 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10013382">AB_10013382</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC: 0.5 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PBS</td><td valign="top">Gibco</td><td valign="top">Catalog # 14200-067</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Isofluorane</td><td valign="top">Isoba vet Schering-Plough S.A.

Unexpectedly, in one of these animals (the number #5), we have detected a PrP<sup>res</sup> characterized by a predominance of the mono-glycosylated band with the un-glycosylated one migrating at 19 kDa. These findings were confirmed using either the 6D11 antibody or the Sha31 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that a different prion might have emerged in this mouse. Therefore, we have decided to remove this animal from the group and analyze it separately. Moreover, the last mouse of this group (the number #6) that was sacrificed at 605 dpi showed lower PrP<sup>res</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) compared to all the other animals sacrificed at earlier time points.

Similar findings were observed in the brains of animals inoculated with FFI-OM_PMCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These results were confirmed using both the 6D11 and the Sha31 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, animal number #1 of the FFI-OM_PMCA group was characterized by the presence of two faint un-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> fragments detectable only with the use of the N-terminal 6D11 antibody. This difference could not be appreciated with the use of the C-terminal Sha31 antibody where a single un-glycosylated band migrating at 19 kDa was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, almost all PMCA-inoculated mice developed a PrP<sup>res</sup> with the typical glycoform profile of the FFI prion. However, it should be kept in mind that, at different levels, the human FFI prions present in BH and OM have been subjected to several analyses performed using the bank vole PrP<sup>C</sup> (either as PMCA reaction substrate or as transgenic mice). In particular, the original FFI strains have been subjected to PMCA analyses with bank vole brain (Bv109M) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Redaelli et al., 2017</xref>) and these reaction products as well as the raw FFI-BH were inoculated in animals that express the BvPrP (BvPrP-Tg407). Therefore, even if some biochemical features of the human FFI have been retained by the prions generated in these mice, they represent a bank vole-adapted version of the original FFI strain. To better analyze the migration profile of the un-glycosylated PrP bands, we have performed PNGase F experiments and observed that all prions generated in the brain of BvPrP-Tg407 mice migrated at 19 kDa, regardless of the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Also in the case of animal number #1 of the FFI-OM_PMCA group, the PNGase F treatment of the sample resulted in the appearance of a single un-glycosylated band migrating at 19 kDa.

As already mentioned, we decided to separate animal number #5 from the FFI-BH group because of the divergent glycoform profile of its PrP<sup>res</sup>. Moreover, this prion was less resistant to PK digestion and more stable towards Gdn-HCl treatment compared to all the others of the same group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, the PK-resistance profile of the PrP<sup>res</sup> found in animals inoculated with FFI-BH_PMCA and FFI-OM_PMCA was comparable. This suggests that the PMCA might have favored the <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification/selection of a similar prion isolate from brain and OM of FFI patients, which then resulted in a homogeneous pathological picture of the disease in both animals’ groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The same brain homogenates were then treated with increasing concentrations of Gdn-HCl. Results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and confirmed that prions found in the brains of FFI-BH_PMCA and FFI-OM_PMCA-inoculated animals were more stable than those found in the brain of FFI-BH-challenged mice. Notably, this difference was statistically significant, thus supporting the hypothesis that PMCA could have amplified a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with distinctive biochemical and pathological features than that typically present in the FFI brain homogenate, finally leading to the development of different pathological changes in FFI-BH_PMCA and FFI-OM_PMCA groups of mice (also in this case, animal number #5 was excluded from the analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). To deepen this aspect, we decided to investigate whether the PMCA itself might have modified the biochemical properties of the FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after amplification, prior to injection in BvPrP-Tg407 mice. To this aim, we have subjected FFI-BH and its product of amplification (FFI-BH_PMCA) to PK digestion and Gdn-HCl treatments.

In particular, our findings show that the PMCA-amplified products either generated from the brain or the OM of FFI patients are infectious when inoculated in transgenic mice expressing the BvPrP (BvPrP-Tg407). Remarkably, BvPrP-Tg407 mice do not develop spontaneous pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless of the inoculum, all mice injected with PMCA products developed very similar neuropathological alterations characterized by focal and plaque-like deposits of PrP<sup>res</sup> mainly affecting the thalamus and the striatum. In contrast, animals inoculated with FFI brain homogenate (not subjected to PMCA) showed different histopathological features, for example, a stronger synaptic and diffuse PrP<sup>res</sup> immunoreactivity with focal and plaque-like deposits consistently affecting the thalamus, the striatum, and the deep layer of the cerebral cortex. Notably, the intensity of prion deposition observed in all mice was paralleled by a proportional glial activation. Unfortunately, we did not have the possibility to inject the raw FFI-OM because the original sample underwent several analyses (including extensive PMCA and RT-QuIC investigations, as reported in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Redaelli et al., 2017</xref>) and we did not have enough material for the inoculation. An additional OM sampling (finalized to animals’ injection) was not possible because the patient died soon after the first OM collection. However, a very recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raymond et al., 2020</xref>) showed that OM of patients with sporadic CJD are able to induce prion disease when challenged in transgenic mice overexpressing the human PrP with methionine at codon 129 (Tg66). In this study, only a small percentage of animals developed the disease, thus suggesting that the infectivity in OM is very low.</p><p>The use of BvPrP-Tg407 mice was dictated by the fact that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in OM of the FFI patient was efficiently amplified by using the brain of bank vole (Bv109M) as a PMCA reaction substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Redaelli et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, to avoid additional passages of species, we decided to inject BvPrP-Tg407 mice while being conscious that the original properties of the FFI prions could have been altered. However, after injection, this model has generated a bank vole-adapted FFI prion isolate that, to some extent, retained few features of the original human FFI strain.</p><p>We have attempted to amplify the FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from OM by using the brain of mice expressing the human PrP with methionine at codon 129 of <italic>PRNP</italic> (HuPrP129MM) as a PMCA substrate, but we were not successful. Using this model, we have shown that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplified from the urine of patients with the new variant CJD (vCJD) was able to maintain the same biochemical and neuropathological features of the vCJD-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cali et al., 2019</xref>). However, in the present work, we were required to use the bank vole PrP<sup>C</sup> as an efficient acceptor of the FFI prions and our results need to take into consideration these experimental constraints.</p><p>The first important finding of this study was that BvPrP-Tg407 mice were highly susceptible to human FFI prions (100% attack rate). It is known that the transmission of prions between species is an inefficient process because of the species barrier that is mainly dictated by the amino acid differences between the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> of the donor and the PrP<sup>C</sup> of the acceptor species, and the conformational properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagiwara et al., 2013</xref>). It is known that the BvPrP can be converted into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by a number of human and animal prion strains with high efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nonno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrimi et al., 2008</xref>).

Our work confirmed that also our model is susceptible to FFI. In particular, animals inoculated with FFI-BH showed mild spongiform changes and glial activation mainly localized in the thalamus, striatum, and deep layer of the frontal cortex. They accumulated PrP<sup>res</sup> that was characterized by the typical FFI glycoform profile: predominance of the di-glycosylated PrP band and migration of the un-glycosylated band at 19 kDa. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the BvPrP is prone to convert into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> while retaining these biochemical features, regardless of the inocula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, upon inoculation with different human and animal prion strains, transgenic mice expressing the BvPrP with methionine or isoleucine at codon 109 (TgM109 or TgI109, respectively) developed prion pathology and all generated PrP<sup>res</sup> were characterized by a predominance of the di-glycosylated band, even in those challenged with human or animal prion strains with the mono-glycosylated predominant PrP band (e.g., sporadic CJD or Rocky Mountain Laboratory prion strain (RML)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watts et al., 2014</xref>). This has been observed also in transgenic mice expressing BvPrP with isoleucine at codon 109 and the D178 mutation that spontaneously developed prion diseases with the presence of a PrP<sup>res</sup> with a predominant di-glycosylated band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watts et al., 2016</xref>). Many other studies showed that this phenomenon occurred also in other transgenic mouse models inoculated with FFI, thus suggesting that, regardless of the recipient mice, some biochemical features typical of the FFI are reproduced after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Telling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeuchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For this reason, although the FFI glycoform profile was maintained upon transmission in BvPrP-Tg407 mice, we need to consider that this finding might be related to some intrinsically features of the animal model used. Another alteration that we have noticed in the brain of many FFI-BH-inoculated mice, as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2009</xref>), was a significant enlargement of the ventricular spaces. This change was not found in the brain of mice inoculated with FFI-BH_PMCA and FFI-OM_PMCA. Surprisingly, in one animal of the FFI-BH-inoculated group we have identified a PrP<sup>res</sup> form characterized by the predominance of the mono-glycosylated band with the un-glycosylated one always migrating at 19 kDa. In addition, compared to all the other prions of this group, it differentially behaved to PK and Gdn-HCl treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was not detectable by immunohistochemistry, even by treating the samples with lower concentrations of PK. Finally, this animal did not show the typical ventricles enlargement observed in the brains of the other mice of this group. Therefore, we decided to exclude this animal from the rest of the group in consideration of the fact that it might have generated a distinct prion isolate. There is a compelling evidence that some human prion strains originally believed to be ‘pure’ are instead composed by a mixture of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morales et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a very recent publication of the group of Kitamoto Tetsuyuki showed that even the FFI<sup>D178N-129MM</sup> strain might not be pure and that at least two distinct prion strains can be responsible for the disease, one associated with the typical clinical presentation of the disease and the other associated with an atypical phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeuchi et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the mono-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> observed in one of the animals inoculated with FFI-BH might have emerged either because the FFI propagates as a mixture of prions (as also shown for other sporadic forms of prion diseases) or as a random event due to specific limitations imposed by the animal model used. Indeed, these mice have never been challenged with FFI before and seem to be potentially permissive to underrepresented prion strains eventually coexisting in the same isolate.</p><p>Prior to injection in BvPrP-Tg407 mice, we wanted to assess whether and to what extent the PMCA analysis could have modified the original features of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in FFI-BH, eventually generating a different infectious prion isolate. To this aim, we have performed PK and Gdn-HCl characterization of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in FFI-BH and FFI-BH_PMCA and found that after PMCA the biochemical properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> have slightly changed. Unfortunately, due to lack (raw OM) or insufficient material (FFI-OM_PMCA that was thoroughly inoculated in mice), we could not evaluate whether the amplification of FFI-OM might have generated a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with different biochemical properties. We have then evaluated the biochemical and neuropathological alterations developed in the brain of all injected mice, with a special focus on those challenged with FFI-BH, FFI-BH_PMCA, and FFI-OM_PMCA. Notably, mice inoculated with FFI-BH and FFI-BH_PMCA developed distinct pathologies, while those inoculated with FFI-OM_PMCA showed alterations analogous to those found in FFI-BH_PMCA-challenged animals, although less pronounced. For this reason, the PMCA might have produced prion isolates with similar infectious properties, regardless of the tissue used for the amplification (BH vs. OM). This evidence prompted us to speculate that prions present in the brain and OM could be similar, thus explaining the pathological analogies observed in mice challenged with PMCA-generated products. However, it should be considered that other factors (e.g., genetic or environmental) of the BvPrP-Tg407 recipient mice might have further controlled the formation of these prions. What is certain, in any case, is that these PMCA-produced prions are not the results of a <italic>de novo</italic> generation since we did not observe any PrP<sup>res</sup> in amplified brain or OM samples collected from the AD patient that were subjected to the same amplification procedures. Overall, these products did not induce pathology when challenged in BvPrP-Tg407 mice. To confirm the absence of prions (even trace amounts) in the brain of these animals, we have performed RT-QuIC experiments that showed the lack of seeding activity in all AD-related samples. As expected, strong RT-QuIC responses were obtained from the analyses of mice inoculated with FFI-related material.</p><p>Taken together these results showed that the FFI brain homogenate was able to induce pathology in BvPrP-Tg407 mouse model and promoted the generation of two distinct prion isolates, one more represented that was characterized by the prevalence of the di-glycosylated band (83%) and another less represented characterized by the prevalence of the mono-glycosylated band (17%). Both isolates showed distinct features and support the fact that FFI might not be a pure strain, even among FFI<sup>D178N-129MM</sup> subjects. As previously mentioned, all PMCA products were infectious and elicited analogous biochemical and neuropathological changes when challenged in BvPrP-Tg407 mice, probably due to prior selective effects of the PMCA on prions present in the brain or OM of the FFI patient. To better investigate this aspect, we have compared the biochemical properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in FFI-BH_PMCA (prior to passaging in mice) with those of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generated in the brain of FFI-BH_PMCA-injected mice. We have observed that the inoculation generated a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> significantly more resistant to PK digestion and less stable against Gdn-HCl compared to that of the inoculum. Thus, it might be hypothesized that other than a possible PMCA selection of prions present in the brain or OM of the FFI patients, additional processes of adaptation might have occurred in the brain of inoculated mice.</p><p>In contrast, animals inoculated with AD-BH, AD-BH_PMCA, and AD-OM_PMCA did not show any prion-related pathology.</p><p>From this study, we can conclude that BvPrP-Tg407 mice are susceptible to both the FFI prions and their bank vole-adapted PMCA-generated products. We were intrigued by the fact that mice inoculated with FFI-OM_PMCA developed less PrP<sup>res</sup> deposits compared to those inoculated with FFI-BH_PMCA. However, by using the methods generally employed to study prion strains (e.g., PK, Gdn-HCl, PNGase F assays), we did not detect other differences supporting that this group of mice might have developed a distinct prion isolate from that observed in FFI-BH_PMCA-inoculated animals. Additional and more advanced studies are needed to further investigate this aspect. Moreover, we have noticed that animal number #1 of the FFI-OM_PMCA group showed two distinct un-glycosylated PrP<sup>res</sup> fragments, thus further supporting the possibility that PMCA might have generated a multitude of unstable prion isolates capable of inducing slightly distinct alterations even within the same group of animals. This finding was detectable only with the use of the N-terminal 6D11 antibody and was not observed with the use of the C-terminal Sha31 antibody.</p><p>In summary, our injected mice developed prion pathologies that recapitulate some of the key clinical hallmarks of FFI (e.g., vacuolation, glial activation, and PrP<sup>res</sup> deposition mainly affecting the thalamus) and, although with some limitations, this model can be used to (1) deepen some of the pathological events associated with FFI, (2) uncover new factors eventually involved in its phenotypic heterogeneity, and (3) evaluate the effects of therapeutic compounds to interfere with the progression of the disease in a more phenotypic-specific way. The recent discovery that FFI patients with the same genotype might have distinct clinic-pathological presentations of the disease suggests that still unidentified factors (including the presence of distinct PrP<sup>Sc</sup> strains), other than the genetic background, may be responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. This evidence clearly indicates that the mutation can trigger the onset of the disease but many other factors modulate the pathological process, which results in a heterogeneous presentation of the disease. The possibility of detecting PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the OM can be exploited for basic research experiments, for therapeutic studies but also for monitoring disease progression, especially in patients eventually enrolled in clinical trials. This study shows that OM contains traces of FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that can be efficiently amplified by PMCA using the brain of bank vole as substrate and that the amplified products are infectious when challenged in mice that express the bank vole PrP<sup>C</sup> (BvPrP-Tg407).</p><p>The fact that the PMCA products are as infectious as the FFI brain homogenate raises major biosafety concerns that require the adoption of specific precautions when manipulating amplified material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bistaffa et al., 2017</xref>). For diagnostic purpose, a safer alternative is represented by the RT-QuIC assay that, according to the latest evidence, was found not to replicate biohazardous prions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raymond et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although with some experimental constraints, we showed that the OM of FFI patients contains potentially infectious prions. All inoculated animals developed pathology in the thalamus, which is also the area typically affected in the brain of patients with FFI. Moreover, the glycoform ratio of the PrP<sup>res</sup> was similar to that found in the brain of diseased patients. Therefore, some of the typical features of the FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> have been carefully reproduced in this animal model, even in samples that underwent PMCA treatment before the injection. We are aware of the fact that the experiments have been performed using the bank vole PrP<sup>C</sup> as acceptor of FFI prions, either <italic>in vitro</italic> (PMCA with Bv109M substrate) or <italic>in vivo</italic> (BvPrP-Tg407). Hence, some important FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> features might have been lost due to the passage of the species barrier, as already shown by several experimental transmission studies described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peretz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce et al., 1994</xref>). Additional studies with more suitable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models are still needed to investigate whether the properties of the FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in the OM and brain are similar or whether they are influenced by the environment of the tissues. Having the possibility to collect (with non-invasive procedures) and amplify PrP<sup>Sc</sup> from the OM of FFI patients and test its infectious properties in mice will consent to deepen the pathological mechanisms associated with individual disease phenotype, identify the factors (other than the mutation and the polymorphism at codon 129) eventually involved in the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease, and uncover new potential targets for the development of individual therapies capable of blocking the progression of this devastating condition. An increasing number of studies are being published to support the important role that the OM might have for research and diagnosis purposes in the field of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Redaelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raymond et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orrú et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Luca et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Associazione Italiana Encefalopatie da Prioni (AIEnP). <italic>Funding</italic>: This work was supported in part by the Italian Ministry of Health (GR-2013-02355724 and Ricerca Corrente), MJFF, ALZ, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the Weston Brain Institute (BAND2015), and Euronanomed III (SPEEDY) to FM; by the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (grant AGL2016-78054-R [AEI/FEDER, UE]) to JMT and JCE; AM-M was supported by a fellowship from the INIA (FPI-SGIT-2015-02).

olfactory mucosa of fatal familial insomnia (FFI) patients, successful transmission, and strain adaptation when passaging into a new host. This work demonstrates the infectivity and adaptability of PMCA-amplified PrPSc from FFI patients. The finding that olfactory mucosa of FFI carrying infectious risk is novel and important, with implications for nasal swabs taken from large populations of patients (for example, in a coronavirus pandemic). The work also raises new questions about how infectious particles reach reach the olfactory mucosa in FFI, which tends to be more anatomically restricted than other prion diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PMCA generated prions from the olfactory mucosa of patients with Fatal Familial Insomnia cause prion disease in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shu Chen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Based on the different sensitivities to proteolysis and guanidine denaturation among the brains of those mice inoculated with PMCA generated PrPSc versus those inoculated with FFI brain homogenates, the authors conclude that a bank vole adapted strain of FFI may have been generated. This conclusion could be strengthened by performing these same assays on the PMCA generated PrPSc prior to inoculation. This would demonstrate whether these biochemical differences existed prior to passaging in the BvPrP mice. In addition, it would be beneficial to assess the properties of the original FFI brain homogenate and how it may have changed when performing PMCA or passaging experiments.</p><p>2. The PrPSc deposition and glial pathology in Figures 6 and 7, respectively, are very difficult to see and compare among cohorts. Images with higher magnification or insets would be helpful.</p><p>3. The authors include an observation in the discussion highlighting that one of the FFI-OM_PMCA animals had 2 distinct un-glycosylate PrP bands. This was not mentioned in anywhere in the Results section. Please discuss this observation in the appropriate Results section.</p><p>4. Some experimental details should be better described. These include the genotypes of PRNP of the two FFI patients, and whether PMCA products used for inoculation were derived from one or both patients, and which rounds of the PMCA cycles were used in this study. Also needed are the stains and antibodies used in the legends of relevant figures.</p><p>5. The discussion may also include the biosafety precautions for PMCA products, as well as recent studies of RT-QuIC products which appears to be a safer alternative for diagnostic purpose in light of a recent negative finding in OM of CJD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work provides a novel insight into risk of prion transmission associated with olfactory mucosa (nasal brushings) from patients with an inherited prion disease called fatal familial insomnia (FFI). The culprit of prion disease and its transmission is a misfolded form prion protein called PrPSc. Because OM, and likely other peripheral tissues, presumably contain only traces amounts of PrPSc and cannot be detected by conventional methods, new technology for amplified production and detection of PrPSc has emerged recently including PMCA (Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification) or RT-QuIC (real-time quaking induced conversion) assays. The authors previously succeeded in detecting traces of PrPSc in OM of FFI patients using PMCA that converts normal cellular PrP (PrPC) into PrPSc-like aggregates, allowing for a diagnostic assay. In this study, the authors attempt to assess whether the in vitro generated PMCA products, the surrogate of PrPSc in original OM, are infectious and able to transmit prion disease in an animal model. Their findings may have important implications regarding the potential risk of prion transmission through iatrogenic exposures of patient's peripheral specimens. Overall, the conclusion of this paper that OM of FFI patients is potentially infectious are mostly supported by data as presented.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The study design contained test groups and controls appropriate for hypothesis testing. The test groups included brain homogenate of FFI (FFI_BH), its PMCA products (FFI_BH_PMCA) and PMCA products from OM of FFI (FFI_OM_PMCA). The control group included corresponding materials from Alzheimer's disease (AD), a non-prion neurodegenerative disease. Thus, a total of six groups were tested by inoculation of these specimens into brains of an animal model susceptible to human prions, a transgenic mice expressing bank vole PrP (BvPrP-Tg407). As their data shown, inoculation of FFI-BH, FFI_BH_PMCA, and FFI_OM_PMCA all caused prion pathology in brains of BvPrP-Tg407 mice, while no prion transmission occurred by inoculation of AD brain homogenate (AD_BH) or PMCA products from BH and OM of AD (AD_BH_PMCA and AD_OM_PMCA). This set of experiments allowed the authors to conclude that a) PMCA products of OM from FFI were infectious; the inoculated animals all succumbed to prion disease (100% attack rate), similar to those inoculated with FFI_BH_PMCA or FFI_BH; b) No prion transmission occurred following inoculation of PMCA products from AD, excluding the possibility that PMCA generated de novo prion from unaffected brains.</p><p>2. The use of BvPrP-Tg407 mice as a highly susceptible recipient for prion transmission from FFI allowed robust analysis of distinct prion pathology and prion strain diversity. For example, inoculation of FFI_BH caused spongiform degeneration, enlarged ventricles, and synaptic deposition of PrPSc mainly in thalamus in BvPrP-Tg407 mice, thus recapitulating neuropathological features of human FFI. The PMCA products (FFI_BH_PMCA and FFI_OM_PMCA) seemed to cause a slightly different pathological features with less spongiform formation and only focal PrPSc deposition, also in thalamus. The authors attributed such difference to the possibility that PMCA products may represent bank vole adapted prions. This is reasonable in view of the previous transmission studies. Interestingly, one out of six animals inoculated with FFI_BH produced PrPSc that had different biochemically properties from the reset of the inoculated animals, as well as a different neuropathological profile. This raised the possibility that some FFI patients may harbor more than one prion strains, again consistent with the findings from other studies.</p><p>3. The paper utilized many different experimental approaches in characterizing PrPSc-containing materials. These included Western blot analysis of protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) before and after inoculation, detailed neuropathological proofing of inoculated animal brains, and secondary measures by RT-QuIC assay.</p><p>4. In the context of the literature, this study represent the first study of prion transmissibility of PMCA products from FFI, a human prion disease that is known to have lower levels of PrPSc in select regions of brains such as thalamus. In CJD that contains high levels and more broad distribution of PrPSc in affected brains, PMCA products amplified from urine of variant CJD was shown to be infectious. The raw OM of sporadic CJD was also recently reported to be transmissible albeit with low rate of infectivity using a different animal recipient. Therefore, the present study strengthens the evidence that despite likely low infectivity in peripheral tissues such as OM, the potential risk of prion transmission should not be ignored especially during tissue transplantation and surgical interventions.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that provides a novel insight into the transmissibility of peripheral tissues from a routinely accessible tissue including olfactory mucosa from patients with FFI.</p><p>Several points of clarification may strengthen the science of this paper.</p><p>1. Some experimental details should be better described. These include the genotypes of PRNP of the two FFI patients, and whether PMCA products used for inoculation were derived from one or both patients, and which rounds of the PMCA cycles were used in this study. Also needed are the stains and antibodies used in the legends of relevant figures.</p><p>2. The discussion may also include the biosafety precautions for PMCA products, as well as recent studies of RT-QuIC products which appears to be a safer alternative for diagnostic purpose in light of a recent negative finding in OM of CJD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Bistaffa et al. investigate the transmissibility of PMCA generated PrPSc from the olfactory mucosa of Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) patients. This is an extension of the author's previous work demonstrating the amplification of PrPSc from the olfactory mucosa (OM) of FFI patients through the use of PMCA. In this manuscript, they inoculate the PMCA generated PrPSc derived from the OM into the brains of knock-in mice expressing the bank vole PrP (BvPrP). They test this preparation against several controls including PMCA generated material from the brains of FFI patients, PMCA generated material from the OM and brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, or brain homogenate from FFI and AD patients. The authors demonstrate that the PMCA amplified PrPSc from both the brains and OM of FFI patients was capable of inducing disease in the BvPrP expressing mouse at a similar time as those mice injected with FFI brain homogenate. Homogenates of AD derived tissue did not cause disease. The brains of the diseased mice, independent of the inocula, only showed mild spongiform pathology.

As indicated, we have performed additional proteolysis and guanidine denaturation analyses of the FFI brain homogenate (FFI-BH) and its product of amplification (FFI-BH_PMCA) prior to inoculation in BvPrP-Tg407 mice. Each sample has been analyzed in triplicate and the most representative Western blot images obtained from the analyses are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

This might have also altered the infectious properties of the newly generated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that elicited neuropathological changes in BvPrP-Tg407 injected mice significantly different from those observed in FFI-BH challenged animals. Comparing the biochemical properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in FFI-BH with those of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generated in FFI-BH injected mice (especially in terms of PK resistance), we observed statistically significant differences which suggest that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> properties were not retained upon inoculation in mice. Similarly, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in FFI-BH_PMCA samples changed its biochemical properties upon inoculation in mice, in terms of both PK resistance and conformational stability. Thus, while some features of FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> changed either when amplified in vitro by PMCA or when challenged in vivo, other properties typically associated with this prion strain (e.g. the prevalence of the di-glycosylated PrP bands, its tropism for the thalamus and the presence of the un-glycosylated band migrating at 19kDa) were retained. As also mentioned in the manuscript, the same PK and Gdn-HCl analyses done for BH-FFI and BH-FFI_PMCA could not be performed for FFI-OM and FFI-OM_PMCA. This was due to the fact that the raw OM was already subjected to several analyses whose results have been published in a previous manuscript [see ref. 26 in the manuscript] and this sample was no longer available. An additional OM collection was not possible because the patient died after the first OM sampling. The amplified products were thoroughly used to perform BvPrP-Tg407 injection and the small amount left was not sufficient to perform neither PK (in triplicate) nor Gdn-HCl (always in triplicate) analysis. Unfortunately, the lack of raw OM did not allow us to perform additional PMCA analyses to generate new material useful for the analysis.Nevertheless, we believe that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in the olfactory mucosa might have been undergone the same selection/adaptation events observed for the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present in the brain when challenged in vitro or in vitro.</p><p>The new findings obtained after the analyses suggested by the reviewer were included and discussed in several sections of the manuscript, including results (lines 407-426), discussion (lines 617-625 and lines 659-665) and material and methods (lines 221-223 and lines 231-233).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Although the FFI infectivity in mice expressing the bank vole PrP<sup>C</sup> has already been shown, in our manuscript we have used a new transgenic model that generated two different PrP<sup>res</sup> once infected with brain-derived FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (one prion isolate that was more represented than the other). FFI prion might not be a pure strain and the possibility to study FFI with new in vitro or in vivo models will allow to investigate whether this strain is composed of a mixture of prion isolates, that can even undergo selection and adaptation phenomena according to the environment of replication (PMCA <italic>vs</italic> bioassay). This will have a significant impact especially in terms of disease treatment. Indeed, the use of therapeutic compounds, especially if administered in the preclinical stage of the disease and for long periods of time, might favor the generation of drug-resistant prion strains that can be responsible for the failure of the therapy.</p><p>We acknowledge that FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> has been previously amplified by PMCA. However, in our work, we were aimed at investigating whether and to what extend the OM amplified products could have retained (or modified) disease-specific biochemical or neuropathological features typically associated with the brain FFI-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> potentially exploitable to perform an in vitro screening of compounds to identify their efficacy for each patient. Finally, we have highlighted that the PMCA generates infectious products and their manipulation/analysis require specific biosafety precautions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
