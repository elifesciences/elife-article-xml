Amongst the complications for the offspring is increased susceptibility and severity of neonatal infections necessitating admission to the intensive care unit, notably bacterial sepsis and enterocolitis. Previous studies have reported aberrant responses to LPS and polyclonal stimulation by umbilical cord blood monocytes that were mediated by alterations in the epigenome. In this study, we show that pregravid obesity dysregulates umbilical cord blood monocyte responses to bacterial and viral pathogens. Specifically, interferon-stimulated gene expression and inflammatory responses to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and <italic>E. coli</italic> were significantly dampened, respectively . Although upstream signaling events were comparable, translocation of the key transcription factor NF-κB and chromatin accessibility at pro-inflammatory gene promoters following TLR stimulation was significantly attenuated. Using a rhesus macaque model of western style diet-induced obesity, we further demonstrate that this defect is detected in fetal peripheral monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages during gestation. Collectively, these data indicate that maternal obesity alters metabolic, signaling, and epigenetic profiles of fetal monocytes leading to a state of immune paralysis during late gestation and at birth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>monocytes/macrophrages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>epigenome</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03AI112808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Messaoudi</surname><given-names>Ilhem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI142841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Messaoudi</surname><given-names>Ilhem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI145910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Messaoudi</surname><given-names>Ilhem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K23HD06952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Nicole E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternal obesity and high-fat diet present metabolic, signaling, and epigenetic impediments to pathogen recognition in fetal innate immune cells that result in a state of immune paralysis during gestation and at birth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly 40% of women of childbearing age (18–44 years old) in the United States met body mass index (BMI) obesity criteria in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and the rate of obesity amongst women of childbearing age continues to rise with ~11% increase in prevalence from 2016 to 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Driscoll and Gregory, 2020</xref>). Consequently, pre-pregnancy (pregravid) obesity has emerged as one of the leading co-morbidities that impact maternal and fetal health. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barker et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barker et al., 1989a</xref>) proposes that both maternal overnutrition and undernutrition during fetal development can have significant consequences on the offspring’s health during childhood and adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bansal and Simmons, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman, 2018</xref>). Indeed, it is now well established that pregravid obesity is associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lashen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stothard et al., 2009</xref>). Compared to lean mothers, mothers with obesity have a substantially increased risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and hypertension all associated with small for gestational age neonates and increased risk of stillbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howell and Powell, 2017</xref>). Pregravid obesity is linked to an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during the neonatal period necessitating admission to the intensive care unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rastogi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suk et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, maternal obesity is associated with a higher incidence of long-term consequences for the offspring including increased incidence of allergies, asthma, and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catalano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaillard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ardura-Garcia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godfrey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briese et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro and Avina, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danieli-Gruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Practice Bulletins–Obstetrics, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, studies using animal models where maternal obesity is induced via the administration of high fat or western style diets (HFD, WSD) showed that pups born to obese dams fed a HFD during gestation generated lower ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgG, but higher OVA-specific IgE responses, after immunization with OVA compared to pups born to dams fed a control diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odaka et al., 2010</xref>). These data potentially explain the increased incidence of asthma/wheezing in children born to mothers with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaillard et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies show that pups born to obese dams fed a HFD are more susceptible to bacterial challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myles et al., 2013</xref>), develop more severe bronchiolitis following RSV challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>), and are more likely to develop autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myles et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, ex vivo LPS stimulation of colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) isolated from pups born to dams fed a HFD resulted in greater levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17, whereas LPS stimulation of splenocytes from the same animals generated decreased levels of TNFα and IL-6 compared to control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myles et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These observations suggest that pregravid obesity disrupts the development and maturation of the offspring’s immune system in utero. Indeed, clinical studies showed that high pregravid BMI is associated with reduced frequency of umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and dampened CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to polyclonal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sureshchandra et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez-Espinosa et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, pregravid obesity was associated with a reduced ability of human UCB CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to respond to ex vivo stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, monocytes from offspring of mothers with obesity showed a decrease in transcripts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-12ß (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cifuentes-Zúñiga et al., 2017</xref>). These dampened CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and monocyte responses are mediated by epigenetic changes at key loci that regulate inflammatory responses and cellular differentiation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sureshchandra et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>). Other studies have reported an increased expression of PPAR-γ, which can attenuate macrophage inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chawla, 2010</xref>) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from children born to mothers with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaytán-Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, we reported hypomethylation of the PPAR-γ gene in UCB monocytes obtained from mothers with obesity, thus indicating sustained reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>). Alterations in the DNA methylation patterns of the promoter regions in monocytes of the obese group suggest dysregulated responses to M1 and M2 macrophage polarization stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we extended these earlier clinical studies and interrogated the impact of pregravid obesity on the response to bacterial and viral pathogens. Our data showed dysregulated response by UCB monocytes from babies born to mothers with obesity. Additional analyses showed that upstream signaling events were comparable between UCB from lean and obese mothers; however, reduced chromatin accessibility and lack of chromatin remodeling in response to stimulation resulted in a dampened transcriptional response. This dampened response was also detected in peripheral blood monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages obtained from neonatal rhesus macaque born to obese dams fed a high-fat diet indicating that these observations are not limited to UCB monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects and experimental design</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Oregon Health and Science University and the University of California, Irvine.

Loss of the repressive of histone H3K9 trimethylation following LPS stimulation was reduced in UCB monocytes from the obese group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Since metabolic changes precede epigenetic changes, we next measured the overall increase in ECAR (a readout for glycolysis) following 1 hr LPS stimulation using a glycolytic stress assay. Following glucose injection, levels of ECAR increased significantly less in the obese group compared to the lean group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

First, we compared chromatin accessibility via bulk ATAC-Seq on purified UCB monocytes following 4 hr LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As observed in the resting state, fewer open regions were detected in the obese group following LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), primarily surrounding the transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Motif analysis of these differential peaks revealed enrichment of AP-1 and NF-kB binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) including promoters of LPS-induced inflammatory molecules such as <italic>CXCL8, IL6ST, TNFAIP3</italic>, and transcription factor <italic>IRF7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We integrated these differential chromatin signatures with transcriptional signals detected exclusively in the lean groups following LPS, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and RSV stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). As expected, LPS-associated changes in chromatin accessibility showed the most overlap with LPS stimulated genes (46 genes) including signaling molecules such as <italic>SOCS1</italic>, <italic>MAP3K13</italic>, cytokine <italic>IL23A</italic> and chemokine <italic>CXCL8</italic> and to a lesser degree with <italic>E. coli</italic> responsive genes (14 genes).

We identified four major clusters including a cluster of activated monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, cluster 1) at baseline, as observed in scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We observed a twofold increase in the frequencies of this activated monocytes cluster in the lean group but no change in the obese group following LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Moreover, as seen with bulk ATAC-seq, overall changes in chromatin accessibility profiles in response to LPS were more robust in the lean group within all monocyte clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Recent studies have reported dampened responses by human UCB monocytes of babies born to mothers with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Goede et al., 2017</xref>) as well as by splenocytes from pups born to obese dams to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sureshchandra, 2021a</xref>). Additional studies indicate increased airway reactivity and aberrant responses to RSV in pups born to dams fed a HFD during gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>). These observations align with clinical reports of increased admissions to neonatal intensive care units due to increased incidence of bacterial sepsis and enterocolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godfrey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blomberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myles, 2014</xref>). Mechanisms underlying this dysregulated response are emerging and highlight the role of epigenetic rewiring in line with the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sureshchandra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Opsahl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakandakare et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arima and Fukuoka, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sureshchandra et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sureshchandra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we confirm and extend these earlier observations using an independent cohort of cord blood samples. We used a combination of functional and genomic assays to demonstrate that defective responses to LPS extend to bacterial and viral pathogens and are regulated both at metabolic and epigenetic levels.</p><p>We leveraged scRNA-seq to capture the transcriptional heterogeneity of cord blood monocytes and the impact of maternal obesity on UCB monocyte cell states. We identified a subset of UCB monocytes that express high levels of transcript associated with inflammatory processes suggesting that these cells are poised to respond to stimulation. This subset was nearly absent in the obese group. Furthermore, several pathogen-sensing pathways were downregulated in resting UCB monocytes with maternal obesity, suggesting a general state of immune tolerance. This conclusion is congruent with the dampened transcriptional response to LPS reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sureshchandra et al., 2019</xref>) and the reduced migratory capacity of UCB monocytes from babies born to mothers with obesity. Importantly, these data indicate that UCB monocytes from babies born to mothers with obesity are predisposed toward a refractory/immune-tolerant state.</p><p>To extend the previous studies carried out with LPS, here, we measured ex vivo responses to bacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and viral (RSV) pathogens since high maternal BMI was linked to increased risks of severe bacterial and respiratory tract viral infection in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajappan et al., 2017</xref>). Following <italic>E. coli</italic> infection, we report dampening of transcriptional and cytokine responses while expression of negative regulators was increased in UCB monocytes with maternal pregravid obesity. A similar phenotype was recorded in a previous study where UCB monocyte-derived macrophages from mothers with obesity displayed an unbalanced response to M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli mediated by alteration in methylation patterns at key promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cifuentes-Zúñiga et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, in our study, we observed that ex vivo phagocytic ability was enhanced with obesity. Higher phagocytic affinity is a salient feature of regulatory monocytes/macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schulz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaggi et al., 2020</xref>); hence this observation supports our proposed argument of regulatory skewing with maternal obesity. Collectively, these findings provide a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to bacterial infections with maternal obesity in both mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myles et al., 2013</xref>) and neonates in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castaneda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). In line with earlier data from animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>), we report a poor induction of key genes such as interferon response factors (IRF), co-stimulation molecules, chemokine receptors, and numerous ISG following ex vivo RSV infection.</p><p>Intriguingly, poor induction of ISG occurred despite comparable secretion of IFNβ by RSV stimulated UCB monocytes. It is possible that lower transcript levels of <italic>IFNA</italic> could contribute to this outcome. However, other factors such as epigenetic or signaling defects are likely to contribute given the dampened ability of the cells to respond to IFNɑ/IFNβ when supplied in vitro despite the comparable surface protein expression of IFNAR1. Similarly, surface protein expression of TLR key signal transduction proteins downstream of TLR4 was comparable between the two groups despite lower inflammatory responses by the obese group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>). Here we show that nuclear translocation of the key transcription factor NF-kB was reduced with maternal obesity. While chromatin accessibility regulates NF-kB binding and subsequent induction of gene expression, NF-kB binding also influences the chromatin state by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes and evicting negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhatt and Ghosh, 2014</xref>). Indeed, our data suggest an increased abundance of a repressive histone mark (H3K9me3) that persisted upon LPS stimulation in the obese group. Furthermore, this repressive mark preferentially overlapped promoters of genes involved in immune signaling, suggesting compaction of coding regions in the obese group relative to the leans. Unbiased genome accessibility analyses supported this hypothesis, with regions closed in the obese group, primarily overlapping promoters of key cytokine and inflammatory genes.</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to reduced translocation of NF-kB in the obese group, we observed poor induction of epigenetic responses to LPS. Compared to the lean group, cells from the obese group had limited reduction in global levels of the repressive H3K9 trimethyl mark and modest changes in chromatin accessibility following LPS stimulation. Interestingly, the regions more closed in the obese group harbored binding sites for AP-1 and NF-kB, which cooperatively work downstream of TLR4 and regulate the expression of several effector molecules. Single-cell RNA and ATAC-Seq highlighted that these defective responses might be restricted to the small subset of activated UCB monocytes, expressing high levels of proinflammatory molecules such as <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic> identified by our scRNA-Seq analysis and confirmed by scATAC-Seq, which fail to expand with LPS stimulation in the obese group. Collectively, these findings suggest that UCB monocytes from obese group are unable to effectively integrate signals downstream of PRR, which culminate into dysregulated opening of chromatin, nuclear translocation of transcription factors, and their binding to specific genomic loci. Closed chromatin profiles at baseline suggest that these cells are epigenetically poised to respond poorly to subsequent stimulation. Thus, the lack of robust metabolic, epigenetic, and transcriptional response to stimulation provides further evidence for mechanistic constraints contributing to innate immune tolerance.</p><p>The transgenerational impact of maternal obesity on the epigenome of offspring’s immune system has been long appreciated but is hard to model in humans. Several studies have highlighted alterations in methylome and chromatin accessibility landscape of the offspring’s circulating immune cells that are evident as early as at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sureshchandra et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sureshchandra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sureshchandra et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keleher et al., 2018</xref>). We previously reported that maternal obesity is associated with differentially methylated regions that regulate metabolism, cell migration and adhesion of myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sureshchandra et al., 2017</xref>). Some of these epigenetic modifications may be inherited through alterations in gametes, but others may be in response to maternal inflammatory and nutritional cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li, 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, among several circulating factors tested, we only observed elevated levels of leptin in UCB plasma of mothers with obesity. Altered leptin signaling in utero may predispose the fetus to leptin resistance and possibly be the link to the high rates of fetal overgrowth, childhood obesity, and the risk of developing asthma later in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stefaniak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castro-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, leptin has been shown to stimulate monocyte activation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Santos-Alvarez et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>A major limitation of studies in humans is our inability to interrogate the burden of maternal obesity on peripheral blood monocytes and tissue resident macrophages. In this study, we addressed this limitation by analyzing circulating monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages obtained from third-trimester rhesus macaque fetuses fed either control or WSD. As observed in human umbilical cord blood samples, we report dampened responses to LPS and <italic>E. coli</italic>. This observation provides evidence that maternal diet playing a central role in utero re-programming of the developing immune system. More importantly, the fact that both circulating monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages generated a dampened response strongly suggests that this programming occurs early during gestation. Indeed, monocytes and macrophages are some of the earliest immune cells to develop with the first wave originating from late yolk-sac-derived erythromyeloid progenitors and fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study demonstrated a proinflammatory phenotype within bone marrow macrophages of GD130 fetuses born to dams on WSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sureshchandra et al., 2022</xref>). The heightened maternal inflammatory milieu associated with obesity/WSD during critical windows of fetal immune ontogeny may skew the maturation of immune cells toward a regulatory state, perhaps a protective adaptation to limit fetal inflammation. However, this regulatory skewing also contributes to less-than-ideal responses against pathogens, as observed in both animal models and human studies. Future studies will address outstanding critical questions regarding the persistence of this phenotype during childhood and the impact of reversal of maternal diet on the restoration of immune function in the offspring.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Oregon Health and Science University (STUDY00020735 &quot;Perinatant Early Determinants of Immune Development&quot;) and the University of California, Irvine (protocol number 2017-3397 &quot;Impact of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on the offspring immune system&quot;).

The comprehensive studies using RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq and CUT&amp; Tag represent an important resource for understanding the transcriptomic and epigenetic shifts in the monocytes of newborns. The experiments involving stimulation of monocytes with pathogens offer convincing evidence for the dysfunction of monocytes in the newborn.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jalees Rehman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Siroon Bekkering (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers and editors agree that your research question is of significant interest to the field</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify and discuss how the mode of delivery could impact epigenetic + transcriptomic shifts; a sensitivity analysis of the mode of delivery and potential differences as its consequence would be important</p><p>2) Was the viability of the cord blood samples assessed after thawing cells? Differences in sample processing and thawing can profoundly affect transcriptomic data.</p><p>3) The analysis of monocyte subsets does not follow monocyte classifications that have been used by other groups in the field. Re-analysis of monocyte subsets according to recommendations made by reviewers in order to contextualize the monocyte subset findings with the existing literature</p><p>4) The chromatin accessibility data (ATAC) need to be integrated with the mRNA data. An in-depth bioinformatic analysis is required to assess whether there is concordance or difference between the genes that are differentially accessible via ATAC-seq and those that are differentially expressed via RNA-seq. Studies on differences in histone methylation need to integrated with differences in chromatin accessibility and mRNA levels. Global changes in histone methylation are difficult to interpret. ChIP-qPCR at defined sites would be more relevant.</p><p>5) There is a need for re-analysis of the scRNA-seq data with the addition of information on population frequencies, patient-specific differences/similarities, clear identification of cell types that are affected. The reviewer comments provide guidelines for how to strengthen the bioinformatic analysis.</p><p>6) The increase in <italic>E. coli</italic> uptake of obesity-associated monocytes is counterintuitive and sufficient interpretation has to be provided.</p><p>7) The macaque model is very powerful but is presented in such a sparse manner that its relevance and impact are not fully clear. It is among the most innovative features of this manuscript but the data need to be presented more comprehensively to justify the conclusions. The PCA analysis is not interpretable. Instead, it is important to compare the gene expression changes between the macaque model and the cord blood gene expression data from humans.</p><p>8) The macaque study and the ethical rationale + approval for conducting the macaque study need to be described in more detail.</p><p>9) The Discussion section has to highlight the significance of the paper better by outlining how it is different from the published literature. Epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in offsprings of obese mothers have been previously described, but an in-depth analysis of the scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data would also form the basis of a stronger Discussion. Integrating the expanded analysis of the non human primate model into the Discussion will further strengthen the conclusions and help clarify how this work will advance the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following revisions could strengthen the paper:</p><p>1. Clearly delineate where ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data are concordant versus non-concordant. What is the overlap between the accessible genome regions which can be assigned to specific genes (promoters, coding regions) and the RNA-seq during baseline and with stimulation?</p><p>2. The same should also be shown for the scRNA-seq and the scATAC-seq data. Where are the overlaps, where are the differences? In its current presentation, readers are shown a large number of graphs, often selected genes, but it is difficult for the readers to form cohesive assessments of the transcriptomic and epigenetic states.</p><p>3. It would be helpful to explain the increased <italic>E. coli</italic> uptake by obesity-associated monocytes. Based on the idea of the impaired immune responses in the offspring of obese mothers, one would expect the opposite. Is this perhaps a function of uptake without bacterial killing? Are the lean offspring better at elimination? A time assay could help address this. Another key point is that much of the bacterial uptake would be by monocyte derived macrophages and not necessarily the monocytes themselves. Repeating these studies with monocyte-derived macrophages, and performing a time course to distinguish uptake and bacterial killing may resolve this.</p><p>4. The PCA in the NHP study (Figure 6C and D) is not very helpful. Instead, it would be much more important to show additional phenotype differences between the fetal macrophage groups, such as flow cytometry markers and bacterial uptake.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Sureshchandra et al. investigates the aberrant molecular characteristics of cord blood monocytes from offsprings of obese mothers, following bacterial and viral challenges. By combining transcriptomic, epigenetic and cytokine profiling the authors identify gene expression and epigenetic changes in cord blood monocytes that correlate with putative defects in immune responses.</p><p>Orthogonal approaches to identify effects of obesity on mononuclear cells biology. These include single cell transcriptomics to identify and classify cell subpopulations between lean and obese conditions, epigenomic assays including ATAC-seq to identify epigenetic changes and their associated loci, and cytokine measurements as a readout of monocyte functional output.</p><p>Macaque model to measure relative early gestation changes that could under further investigation provide valuable insights on how western-diet induced obesity in the mother can mediate changes in the immune responses of early embryos.</p><p>Main Critiques</p><p>While the authors use several assays to identify monocyte changes that are associated to maternal obesity, extensive further data analysis is required to improve this manuscript.</p><p>1. The scRNA datasets are superficially analyzed and key questions regarding the exact cell types that are affected as a result of maternal obesity remain unaddressed. Specifically:</p><p>a. Figure 1B indicates the cell types identified by scRNA-seq and 4 patients per group are indicated. A table describing the frequencies of each cell type identified in B is completely missing. The scRNA profiles of the independent patients should be shown in a supplementary figure. Are the results obtained by scRNA-seq in line with the FACS analysis? Figure S1A indicates no significant differences are observed by FACS in monocytes but figure 1D indicates statistically significant changes but it is not clear what these represent.</p><p>b.

Clearly delineate where ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data are concordant versus non-concordant. What is the overlap between the accessible genome regions which can be assigned to specific genes (promoters, coding regions) and the RNA-seq during baseline and with stimulation?</p><p>2. The same should also be shown for the scRNA-seq and the scATAC-seq data. Where are the overlaps, where are the differences? In its current presentation, readers are shown a large number of graphs, often selected genes, but it is difficult for the readers to form cohesive assessments of the transcriptomic and epigenetic states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an new integration section – with overlap of baseline ATAC-Seq (data from this study) with gene expression responses (from a previous study) following LPS stimulation in lean and obese groups – Figure 4E. Additionally, we report overlap of LPS induced chromatin changes with gene expression changes following LPS, <italic>E. coli</italic> and RSV stimulation in Figure 5I. Collectively, these changes provide the reader with a better link between chromatin accessibility and gene expression differences and their discordance with maternal obesity. With single cell assays, unfortunately, integration with unimodal samples (ATAC and RNA from different donors/cells) is technically challenging. However, we’ve addressed these concerns in both the results and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be helpful to explain the increased <italic>E. coli</italic> uptake by obesity-associated monocytes. Based on the idea of the impaired immune responses in the offspring of obese mothers, one would expect the opposite. Is this perhaps a function of uptake without bacterial killing? Are the lean offspring better at elimination? A time assay could help address this. Another key point is that much of the bacterial uptake would be by monocyte derived macrophages and not necessarily the monocytes themselves. Repeating these studies with monocyte-derived macrophages, and performing a time course to distinguish uptake and bacterial killing may resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>E. coli</italic> uptake assay is a standard way of measuring cellular phagocytosis by flow cytometry. We would like to clarify that despite impaired ex vivo cytokine responses and poor migration, UCB monocytes demonstrate higher ability to phagocytize pathogens. This is counterintuitive but not surprising, given that enhanced phagocytosis is a hallmark of regulatory monocytes/macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The PCA in the NHP study (Figure 6C and D) is not very helpful. Instead, it would be much more important to show additional phenotype differences between the fetal macrophage groups, such as flow cytometry markers and bacterial uptake.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by all reviewers, we have removed PCA from Figure 6.

These data are now presented in Figure 4H-4J. We recognize that H3K9me3 marks heterochromatin in resting cells, but this modification also marks developmental genes poised to respond to subsequent cues from the environment. More importantly, following LPS stimulation and downstream TLR signaling, we expect a global loss of this mark especially within enhancer regions resulting in enhanced accessibility of a subset of NF-κB genes (Zhu, van Essen, and Saccani 2012).
