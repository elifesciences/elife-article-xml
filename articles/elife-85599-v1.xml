Previous work implies a distinction between positional inputs to the hippocampus from upstream brain regions that provide information about an animal’s location and nonpositional inputs which provide information about the content of experience, both sensory and navigational. Here, we leverage the phenomenon of ‘place field repetition’ to better understand the functional dissociation between positional and nonpositional information encoded in CA1. Rats navigated freely on a novel maze consisting of linear segments arranged in a rectilinear, city-block configuration, which combined elements of open-field foraging and linear-track tasks. Unlike typical results in open-field foraging, place fields were directionally tuned on the maze, even though the animal’s behavior was not constrained to extended, one-dimensional (1D) trajectories. Repeating fields from the same cell tended to have the same directional preference when the fields were aligned along a linear corridor of the maze, but they showed uncorrelated directional preferences when they were unaligned across different corridors. Lastly, individual fields displayed complex time dynamics which resulted in the population activity changing gradually over the course of minutes. These temporal dynamics were evident across repeating fields of the same cell. These results demonstrate that the positional inputs that drive a cell to fire in similar locations across the maze can be behaviorally and temporally dissociated from the nonpositional inputs that alter the firing rates of the cell within its place fields, offering a potential mechanism to increase the flexibility of the system to encode episodic variables within a spatiotemporal framework provided by place cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>place cells</kwd><kwd>episodic-like memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007197</institution-id><institution>U.S. Public Health Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS039456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knierim</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007197</institution-id><institution>U.S. Public Health Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 EY017203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockeimer</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1746891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockeimer</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Place cells that show repeating place fields in geometrically similar locations of an environment modulate their firing rates differently in each field based on movement direction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All behavior is embedded within a subjective spatial and temporal framework. In the mammalian brain, allocentric space is represented within a distributed, interconnected network of regions that specialize in different aspects of spatial experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O’Keefe, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taube, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharp, 1999</xref>). This navigation system is critically dependent on the hippocampus, whose pyramidal cells have spatial firing fields that are distributed throughout the environment to provide a continuous representation of position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O’Keefe, 1976</xref>). The hippocampus both receives and generates spatial signals as part of an entorhinal-hippocampal-subicular processing loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Witter and Amaral, 2004</xref>). The CA1 region receives spatially tuned inputs from regions such as CA3 (other place cells) and the entorhinal cortex (grid cells, spatial non-grid cells, landmark-vector cells) that influence where a CA1 place field is located. These place cells are thought to form the basis of a cognitive map within which the ‘items and events of an organism’s experience are located and interrelated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>, p. 1) in support of episodic memory.</p><p>The hippocampus also receives direct and indirect inputs from regions not involved in position signaling, such as high-level association areas, head direction cells in the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and the amygdala, which provide information about the local or internal environment. Neurons within the hippocampus respond to a wide array of sensory and otherwise nonspatial cues, with CA1 being the most studied region. CA1 neurons respond to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiener et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wiebe and Stäubli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Komorowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2016</xref>), tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aronov et al., 2017</xref>), textures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itskov et al., 2011</xref>), and tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herzog et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2020</xref>), and they can be influenced by internal variables such as subjective frames of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton et al., 2010</xref>). According to the cognitive map theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>), these variables are represented in the spatial place map to incorporate details about the individual components of an experience and bind them together to form episodic memory traces. Hippocampal neurons also respond to variables that are navigational but nonpositional. For example, neurons have been recorded that respond to travel direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiener et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markus et al., 1995</xref>), prospective and retrospective turns or positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wood et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Mizumori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ji and Wilson, 2008</xref>), entire trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grieves et al., 2016a</xref>), and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czurkó et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huxter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiener et al., 1989</xref>). These variables relate to navigation, but do not explicitly encode the current position.</p><p>In many of the examples above, and related studies, the firing rates of the neurons changed while the locations of the firing field stayed stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herzog et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). It should be noted that in at least one study some place fields shifted their center of mass in response to combinatorial cue changes, although this study also reported in-field firing rate changes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Jeffery, 2003</xref>). These findings, termed ‘rate remapping’, inspired the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>) of a functional dissociation between where the neuron fires and the quantitative rate of firing within the field (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shapiro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manns and Eichenbaum, 2009</xref>). According to this hypothesis, the location of the field is used to encode position while the exact firing rate varies as a function of nonpositional cues (so long as the firing rate is maintained above some threshold to indicate the field is active), thereby allowing the formation of distinct episodic memories within a stable spatial framework. The common representation, via rate remapping, of both sensory cues and navigational cues unrelated to position suggests that they are both categorized together as nonpositional variables distinct from the positional signal that is the primary behavioral correlate of hippocampal firing in rodents.</p><p>It is poorly understood how positional and nonpositional signals are integrated within individual place cells. Place cells with multiple fields in an environment provide an opportunity to infer the functional difference between these signals by allowing a within-cell comparison of multiple nonpositional inputs across multiple place field locations. CA1 neurons have multiple fields under different circumstances, for instance in large environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harland et al., 2021</xref>) or environments with repeated structural elements. The latter, termed ‘place field repetition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spiers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieves et al., 2017</xref>), is defined as a neuron with multiple spatial firing fields at instances of a repeated structural element or behavioral motif, such as a repeated trajectory, in an environment. For CA1, many different types of repeating track structure can elicit place field repetition, e.g., multiple boxes arranged in a row (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spiers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieves et al., 2016b</xref>), a spiral track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowen and Nitz, 2014</xref>), a spiral staircase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayman et al., 2011</xref>), or an M-maze or hairpin maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derdikman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer et al., 2010</xref>). Repetition has also been observed outside of the hippocampus, in the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>), subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>), and retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>). Here, we show that repeating fields of the same neuron do not always display the same nonpositional rate modulation, demonstrating that nonpositional cues are dissociable from the positional inputs onto place cells in a given environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Hippocampal CA1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were recorded as rats navigated a novel city-block maze for pseudorandomly delivered reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the task shares similarities to open-field foraging tasks in that the animal freely navigated for pseudorandom reward, the behavior was not random, as the animals displayed variable degrees of stereotypy in their trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The track consisted of 17 interlocking alleys and 12 intersections between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This design allowed us to test whether individual place fields would show repeating firing fields at geometrically similar locations and, if so, whether the repeating place fields would show identical directionality properties (a well-studied example of a nonpositional firing correlate of place fields in one-dimensional [1D] tasks). Each recording day consisted of a single behavioral session, typically 1 hr in duration. A baseline period, in which the rat was confined to a small holding dish next to the maze, was recorded immediately before and after the experimental session for at least 15 min each. On average, 14.7 cells per session (5–35 cells) were recorded that met the inclusion criteria for detailed analysis (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Apparatus and examples of place field repetition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, top-down view of city-block maze.

Fields repeated at alleys and intersections within the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A repeating place cell was defined operationally as any neuron with two or more place fields in a common type of location: vertical alley, horizontal alley, or intersection. This criterion did not penalize cells with violations of a repeating pattern, for instance two fields in vertical alleys and one in a horizontal alley. This was justified by the complex nature of the repeating phenomenon observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>). Repeating fields were equally likely to be in vertical or horizontal alleys (167 horizontal versus 146 vertical fields, chi-square goodness of fit, compared to a null distribution of equal numbers of horizontal and vertical fields, χ<sup>2</sup>(1)=1.41, p=0.235). Each repeating cell had up to seven fields, suggesting that repetition was spatially modulated at the level of the apparatus, as no cell had fields at each alley (mean number of repeating fields = 3.55 ± 1.46 fields; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Many cells had fields that overlapped multiple regions, e.g., fields which curled around the corner of a block (71.89% of fields in one alley; 22.7% of fields in two alleys; 5.1% of fields in three alleys; 0.4% of fields in four alleys). These cases were assigned to the more general three categories (vertical alley, horizontal alley, and intersection) by splitting fields based on the alleys they overlapped and recombining based on orientation (see Materials and methods). Traditional, single-field place cells were also observed in these data as expected (60/179 units). Place field repetition was not driven by the presence of poorly isolated units that combined multiple fields into one ‘cell’, as there was no significant difference in cell quality between repeating and non-repeating neurons included in the analysis (Mann-Whitney U=3214, p=0.1).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of repetition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The frequency of place field repetition across days and rats as defined operationally (two or more fields in a common location).

The metric first defines the degree of alignment of the fields of a cell, and then expresses that as a percent along the range of possible alignments for that given the number of fields the cell had (see Materials and methods).

The rationale for this approach was that given the effect of head direction on repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grieves et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harland et al., 2017</xref>), cells repeating in response to a preferred local pattern of borders (or the paths available around such borders) would manifest as cells with fields aligned in alleys of a common orientation. First, the distribution of field alignment scores was calculated for each multi-fielded neuron as the sum of fields aligned in a common orientation divided by the total number of fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This distribution was skewed toward 1.0, suggesting that fields tended to share an orientation. An orientation alignment score (OAS) was defined as the percentage of maximal field alignment given the number of fields the cell had (see Materials and methods). The mean OAS of multi-fielded cells was significantly greater than expected by chance (mean = 0.71, 95th percentile shuffle = 0.64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result demonstrates that multiple fields of a neuron tend to share a positional input that instructs them where to fire. If they did not share such a positional input, their spatial distribution would be random across the track. The fact that the distribution of multiple fields instead respects the orientation of the alleys suggests that there is a common signal that influences their position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Directionality of CA1 place fields</title><p>An example of a nonpositional influence on place cell firing is directionality. Place fields are known to be directional when rats run on linear tracks or display other types of 1D, stereotyped behavior, but they are much less directional when rats perform more unstructured, 2D behavior in open-field foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Navratilova et al., 2012</xref>). Because our city-block maze was a hybrid of these types of tasks (i.e. rats ran in 2D searching for pseudorandom reward like open-field foraging, but their trajectories were constrained to orthogonal directions by the city-maze architecture), we first needed to determine whether place fields were directional in the maze. Continuous, 2D travel through the maze was parameterized according to which alley the rat currently occupied. The current direction was defined based on the overall direction of travel through the alley, as opposed to the instantaneous head direction. For example, if the animal entered a horizontal alley from the west entrance and exited from the east entrance, then the activity during the time spent in that alley would be classified as ‘east’ regardless of the moment-by-moment head direction (the cardinal directions are defined relative to the camera image, not relative to a compass). First, ratemaps were created and filtered by travel direction to yield four ratemaps based on each cardinal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These ratemaps revealed place fields with firing rates that qualitatively varied as a function of direction. For example, for neuron 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, fields 2 and 3 fired more strongly when the animal traveled from east to west, whereas field 1 shifted toward the direction of travel (i.e. it shifted ‘west’). Further, field 2 not only fired more strongly but shifted its center of mass when the animal traveled west. Neuron 2 had multiple firing fields in vertical alleys or intersections. Field 1 fired when the animal was traveling south but was virtually silent when traveling north; field 2 fired more strongly when the animal traveled north than south; and field 3 appeared untuned to travel direction. Neurons 3 and 4 provide similar examples.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Directionality of place fields in the city-block maze.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of directional place fields.

Fields were filtered such that (a) there were at least two passes in each direction and (b) passes in which the rat was rewarded or did not fully traverse the alley (i.e. the rat turned around) were excluded. The firing rate assigned to each pass for a neuron was computed as the mean of the firing rate over the length of the pass, normalized by the session-averaged ratemap for that alley (i.e. the pass was normalized by its location within the field). This normalization was done to correct for passes that might have elicited different firing rates simply because the rat may have traversed different portions of the field during different passes. This is a particular concern when analyzing directional variables, because the rat may be biased to run a certain way through the alley when performing a specific behavior (e.g. it may run closer to the east wall before making a right turn and closer to the west wall before making a left turn).</p><p>Across the population, a significant subset of fields was directionally tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; 93/310 fields passed a Mann-Whitney test per field; binomial test, p=3.6 × 10<sup>–45</sup>). The mean difference in normalized directional firing was 1.67±2.20 for fields that passed the Mann-Whitney test and 0.69±0.72 for those that did not. In other words, directional fields had a difference in normalized firing that was two-thirds more than their mean firing. The directionality of individual fields was corroborated by a generalized linear model (GLM) analysis. A field may appear directional due to nonspecific changes over time that happen to correlate with biases in behavioral sampling. To account for this, the GLM was first fit with a term for time (base GLM) and then a term for direction was added (alternative GLM). These two models were compared via a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to determine whether the addition of current direction in the model resulted in a significant improvement in the model fit over and above the explanatory power of time. This analysis identified a subset of fields with a significant effect of current direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, 103/297 fields, binomial test p=4.53 × 10<sup>–57</sup>; note that the total number of fields, i.e., the denominator, is different here than for the Mann-Whitney test due to the sampling requirements of the two tests [see Materials and methods]). The GLM results were corroborated with a randomization test which shuffled directional labels before repeating the model comparison process; this procedure resulted in an average of 14.8% fields with a fictive effect of direction, well below the experimental value of 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, the CA1 ensemble was tested for directionality at the population level. A random forest classifier was used to decode the current direction from the population vector of average firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The average firing rate for each neuron was computed for each pass through an alley and labeled with the direction of travel for that pass. Data from vertical and horizontal alleys were classified separately and the out-of-bag (OOB) score (mean = 0.68 ± 0.13) was used as the performance metric. Two controls were used to judge the statistical significance of the performance of the classifier. The first method shuffled the trial labels with respect to the population vectors and the classification was repeated using the (shuffled) OOB score as the performance metric. The second method was a naïve classifier that made a class label prediction in proportion to the behavioral sampling bias in favor of that directional label. The rationale for the naïve classifier test is that a real classifier could potentially utilize class imbalances (e.g. bias to travel north through a given alley) and consistently guess the majority class to achieve above-chance performance. The naïve classifier mimics this strategy by guessing, for each alley traversal, direction labels in proportion to their behavioral sampling frequency over the entire session. The real performance of the classifier was judged significant for each session if it exceeded the 95th percentile of each test. The random forest classifier successfully decoded direction from the population activity in 10/20 orientation-filtered datasets (binomial test p=1.13 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, FWER-corrected alpha = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). On a day-by-day basis, the classifier performance was variable. This may have been caused by differences in cell yield – some days only contained a few cells, which would lead to poorer spatial coverage of the maze. Relatedly, it is possible that days with poorer behavioral sampling (though still good enough to pass the sampling thresholds) led to poorer decoding as there were fewer samples to decode at undersampled locations.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that CA1 fields respond to future or previous directions along the present trajectory (i.e. noncurrent directions) as well as the current direction, which has been interpreted as encoding the spatial decisions along a learned trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Mizumori, 2006</xref>). The presence of retrospective or prospective coding was tested for each field. A GLM was used with regressors for current direction, previous direction, next direction, and, for the reasons mentioned above, time. The number of orientation-filtered fields with a significant effect of prospective or retrospective direction was not more than expected by chance by shuffling directional labels 1000 times and re-running the GLM analysis. However, the effect of retrospective direction trended toward significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that there may be a possible weak effect of retrospective direction in the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Repeating versus non-repeating fields</title><p>It has been hypothesized that repeating neurons have multiple fields because they are tuned to similar paths that are performed at each field location (‘path equivalence’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer et al., 2010</xref>).

Because repeating fields share a common positional signal, they can serve as an internal control to test independently the contributions of the nonpositional signals. One possibility is that repeating fields share their directional tuning, i.e., both the positional and nonpositional properties of a place field are repeated across the environment. Indeed, as stated above, it has been hypothesized that repetition reflects a common tuning among the fields to some path-related parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that at least some repeating neurons receive spatially modulated directional inputs, and thus repeating fields from the same neuron may not always share a common directional tuning.

Fields within each repeating neuron were separated by orientation to equate the directions being compared. Directional tuning was not always conserved across repeating fields. For instance, neuron 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> had four fields in horizontal alleys, three of which had sufficient sampling for analysis. Fields 0 and 2 fired more strongly for east over west while field 1 was untuned (two-way ANOVA interaction field x direction F(2) = 5.32, p=0.006). Neuron 2 had two fields in vertical alleys with opposite tuning. Field 0 fired more strongly for south while field 1 did so for north (two-way ANOVA interaction field x direction F(1) = 9.79, p=0.0025). To understand the distribution of directionality across repeating fields, a pairwise comparison was made between the directionality index of a given field and all other fields with the same orientation from the same cell and these comparisons were pooled across the population. The directionality index was calculated as the difference in the average firing rates between travel in either direction, normalized by both the mean firing of the field and location of each pass in the field. This distribution was centered at zero with density extending into all four quadrants, with a slight bias for fields to share the same tuning (113 pairs sharing, 81 not sharing directional tuning; chi-square goodness of fit test χ<sup>2</sup>(1)=5.28, p=0.022; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The polarity explained very little of the variance in the data (ordinary least squares [OLS] r<sup>2</sup>=0.045, p=0.007). Thus, although there was a tendency for repeating fields to share the same directional bias, the size of the effect was small, demonstrating that repeating fields overall are weakly correlated in their directional tuning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Nonconservation of repeating field directionality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of repeating neurons with directional tuning that was not conserved across fields.

Field pairs were divided into whether the fields comprising the pair were on the same corridor or different corridors of the maze. Corridors were defined as the linearly concatenated alleys running the length or width of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, bottom schematics). Field pairs from the same corridor had a significant positive correlation in their directional tuning (OLS r<sup>2</sup>=0.237, p=0.00012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, pairs on different corridors were not correlated with one another (OLS r<sup>2</sup>=0.017, p=0.125, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These correlations were significantly different from one another (Z=2.49, p=0.0063, one-sided independent sample Fisher’s Z-transformation test). These data suggest that the weak positive correlation in the total population of pairs is explained by a stronger correlation among the same corridor field pairs alone. This effect was corroborated by a shuffling approach. Labels of each field pair were shuffled while preserving the sample size of the two groups (same corridor, different corridor). The difference in r<sup>2</sup> was computed on each iteration between the two groups and the distribution of such values was compared to the real difference in r<sup>2</sup> values.

For each field, the directional sampling bias was computed as the ratio of the number of passes in the direction sampled more frequently to the total number of passes. The unsigned difference in the sampling biases of the fields was compared to the unsigned difference in the field’s respective directionality tuning. Very little variance in the pairwise directionality comparison was attributable to the differences in sampling bias (same corridor r<sup>2</sup>=0.031, p=0.23; different corridor r<sup>2</sup>=0.052, p=0.016), suggesting that the observed results were not driven primarily by imbalanced sampling of preferred and anti-preferred directions of directionally tuned fields.</p><p>The distances between fields forming a pair on the same corridor (17.55±7.56 bins) were similar to fields on different corridors (20.1±8.27 bins), although the small difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U=2097, p=0.031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result suggests that a widely tuned spatial input is not the primary driver of the dissociation in directional correlations. The path taken to reach each field of a pair on the same corridor was shorter (4.17±2.54 alleys) than between fields on a different corridor (8.01±3.47 alleys) (Mann-Whitney U=607, p=8.04 × 10<sup>–11</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), raising the possibility that the trajectories between the fields systematically differed and this difference affected the shared directional tuning.</p><p>Last, we investigated whether a more specific analysis of trajectories would show a tendency for repeating cells to show trajectory coding. Trajectories were defined as sequences of directions (previous, current, and next) through the fields (e.g. east-north-east, south-west-north, etc.) and each trajectory through a field was assigned to such a trajectory. For each pair of commonly oriented fields, the correlation coefficient was calculated between the average responses to each type of trajectory sampled through both fields. This analysis revealed a non-unimodal distribution (Hartigan’s dip test statistic = 0.122, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, corridor conditions pooled together; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), with over half of all field pairs having a positive correlation (56% pairs correlation&gt;0.5). Therefore, although a majority of field pairs tended to share a pattern of trajectory responses, a substantial fraction did not. Among the latter pairs, the responses were mostly anticorrelated (i.e. the correlations were close to –1). These data suggest that field pairs are affected by the trajectory through the field, since they tended to respond to the same trajectory – either by sharing their firing or having opposite responses. By contrast, very few field pairs were uncorrelated in their response to the same trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Time dynamics of CA1 firing rates</title><p>CA1 activity patterns change across disparate timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manns et al., 2007</xref>) in ways that may support the encoding of temporal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mankin et al., 2012</xref>).

First, the presence of directional firing on a maze that had properties of both open-field foraging and directed navigation tasks suggested that the low degrees of freedom for path choices resulted in the system distinguishing between the paths, possibly because they differed from one another in limited ways constrained by the geometry of the apparatus rather than continuously, as they would on an open platform. Second, comparing directional tuning across repeating fields revealed a distinction between positional inputs (i.e. inputs that tell a place cell <italic>where</italic> to fire) and nonpositional inputs (i.e. inputs, including spatial inputs, that tell a place cell <italic>how strongly</italic> to fire in its place field).

The city-block maze of the present study had aspects of both types of behavior, as the rats could move in 2D, but their trajectories were constrained to a rectilinear grid. Nonetheless, many place cells showed strong directionality and, furthermore, showed large numbers of repeating fields. This combination of place field repetition and directionality has been interpreted as evidence for trajectory encoding, or ‘path equivalence’, in which spatially selective neurons in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex fire in similar locations along a trajectory that is repeated at different locations in an environment. The data presented here suggest that trajectory encoding by repeating fields is likely to be more complex than previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer et al., 2010</xref>). In the previous work, trajectory coding was explored on apparatuses with a constrained set of choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieves et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Mizumori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). These studies found neurons tuned to different types of turns and they suggested that more complex trajectories might be encoded on apparatuses where such trajectories could be sampled. The present work utilized such an apparatus and provided qualified support for this suggestion. Due to the unstructured nature of the task, the data lacked the power to test whether any particular complex trajectory (defined as a sequence of travel directions into, through, and out of an alley) was encoded by individual neurons. Thus, current direction alone was used as a simple proxy for the potentially complex path through the field. If place field repetition reflected the hippocampus encoding equivalent paths in an environment, then the different fields of a repeating cell should show the same current direction preference. Although previous work has demonstrated a role for direction in gating the presence of repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grieves et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowen and Nitz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derdikman et al., 2009</xref>), it remained unclear if a common representation of direction was required for repeating fields. In the present work, many repeating fields were uncorrelated in their responses to direction (at least when the repeating fields were on different corridors), showing that directional preference per se was not the driving force underlying repetition under the conditions of the present study.</p><p>Although the lack of shared directional preference in many neurons suggested that these neurons were not encoding trajectories in a simple manner, we nonetheless observed that the repeating fields of many cells showed strong correlations in their firing rates across the different types of complex trajectories through the fields (i.e. previous, current, and next alleys) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This result suggested that a subset of repeating fields may indeed encode trajectory. However, many repeating fields in different corridors were anticorrelated in their trajectory responses. Thus, place field repetition may result from multiple mechanisms that give rise to similar phenomena: a subset of repeating fields may encode trajectory while another subset encodes a different dimension, such as local border geometry.</p><p>The potential contribution of local border geometry to place field repetition is supported by multiple studies and was specifically proposed as a mechanism in one modeling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieves et al., 2017</xref>). In the present work, as well as others recording from multiple compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spiers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieves et al., 2016b</xref>), the local border geometry was shared across fields of multi-fielded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Cells in the present work were disproportionately likely to have fields with borders on the same sides of the field, i.e., to be aligned along an axis of the maze (vertical or horizontal) (this is similar to axis-tuned cells reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olson et al., 2017</xref>). In previous work, fields occurred in the same relative position in multiple adjacent boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Skaggs and McNaughton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spiers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grieves et al., 2016a</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with the inputs that CA1 receives. Boundary vector cells (BVCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lever et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>) and border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Savelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Solstad et al., 2008</xref>) exist within the circuitry of the hippocampal formation and it is known that CA1 neurons are modulated by changes to the local border configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Keefe and Burgess, 1996</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that repetition may be caused by stronger border-related input to these neurons. The paths available at a location are partially determined by the configuration of borders, therefore, the hypotheses discussed above are related. Future work would require the dissociation of the pattern of borders and the types of paths available to the animal at each location to disentangle the effect of these variables.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Leveraging repetition to understand positional versus nonpositional inputs</title><p>Place field repetition offers a unique opportunity to explore how inputs are functionally organized in CA1. According to the cognitive map theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>), the hippocampus leverages the spatial framework of the place map to bind together different aspects of an experience into a coherent representation in support of episodic memory storage and retrieval. The present data provide evidence that this process is assisted by individual field ‘addressability’, wherein different nonpositional inputs (i.e. experiential inputs) affect a neuron’s response differently at different fields. Our population decoding analyses demonstrated that both the positional signal and the nonpositional signal could be retrieved from such a multiplexed coding scheme.</p><p>The rate remapping hypothesis stipulates a mechanism utilizing the rate remapping phenomenon to encode nonpositional inputs – such as changes to the sensory features of an environment or differences in how the animal navigates through the environment – through changes to the pattern of firing rates across spatially stable place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shapiro et al., 1997</xref>). This rate remapping allows for flexible encoding of the episodic content of experience while maintaining a stable map. Such episodic content may include nonspatial variables, such as alterations in objects or the wall colors of an environment, or spatial variables that are related to navigation but do not define specific positions. For example, direction and speed can alter the firing rates of place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czurkó et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huxter et al., 2003</xref>), and fields of ‘splitter cells’ can alter their firing rates depending on the upcoming (or previous) spatial choice, while the field locations remain mostly stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</xref>). These results suggest that inputs that are spatial but do not explicitly encode position may be encoded similarly as purely nonspatial inputs such as odors or sounds. Thus, we have used the term nonpositional (as opposed to nonspatial) to denote how various cues can alter the firing rates of place cells while maintaining the positional specificity of the place field intact.</p><p>Repeating place fields provided a within-cell control to demonstrate that positional inputs (e.g. functional influences that tell a place field where to fire) and nonpositional inputs (i.e. functional influences that tell the neuron how strongly to fire in its field) are organized differently in CA1. The simplest model would suggest that both sets of inputs are fixed for each place cell. Thus, the positional inputs would cause a cell to fire at similar locations in the environment (e.g. locations that share common elements of a trajectory or that share common geometric borders) and share the same nonpositional coding (e.g. similar direction preferences). However, such inflexibility would not be ideal for the hypothesized role of firing rate as encoding the episodic inputs onto a place field, which would require flexibility in encoding unpredictable experiential inputs at different locations. The present data utilize repeating fields to suggest that different repeating fields can show different directional preferences. In other words, fields do not inherit their nonpositional tuning as a global property of the cell.</p><p>In different environments, the firing locations of place fields change when the system undergoes global remapping. This well-studied property suggests that the positional inputs can also be dynamically gated and flexible between environments. On the other hand, it is possible that the positional inputs are also rigid between environments, even as the place fields express different firing fields. For example, the BVC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Keefe and Burgess, 1996</xref>) postulates that each place cell receives input from a fixed set of BVCs that determine whether and where a cell will fire in an environment. In this model, a place field will be active if there is a location in the environment that drives each of its BVCs. Thus, it is the environmental geometry that determines whether a cell will show global remapping between environments, not flexible changes to its positional inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartley et al., 2000</xref>). Regardless of whether the positional inputs are rigid or flexible across environments, the present data suggest that the nonpositional inputs are always flexible, as expected if they encode the episodic content of an experience on a stable spatial framework.</p><p>The corridor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>) revealed that under certain conditions the nonpositional input tended to be shared across repeating fields, suggesting that experience may shape directional tuning. The difference in pairwise directional tuning between fields on the same and different corridors further emphasizes that fields were separately addressable in how they were tuned for direction. The difference in corridor was also correlated with behavioral biases in how animals sampled fields. Fields on the same corridor were usually sampled by shorter paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) that did not necessarily involve a change in direction of travel. However, traveling between fields on different corridors necessarily involved a change in direction and these paths were usually longer as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). One explanation for these data is that fields sampled along contiguous trajectories, without interruptions from direction change or reward delivery, are more likely to share their directionality. Directionality is affected by an animal’s experience through the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Navratilova et al., 2012</xref>), so it is possible the difference in experience between sampling fields on the same versus different corridors affects the directional tuning properties between them. Another possibility is a shift in reference frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton et al., 2010</xref>). In this scenario, place cells respond differently depending on which of multiple reference frames the ensemble (or subset thereof) is locked to. The transitions between alleys along different corridors may induce or somehow be associated with such a reference frame shift. Sequence learning mechanisms, such as theta phase precession or theta-gamma coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gothard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lisman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Terada et al., 2017</xref>) may also play a role. It is known that theta look-ahead sequences, in which non-local place field activity sweeps ahead of the animal, segment behavior by preferentially occurring at landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, turns at the ends of corridors, along with reward deliveries, may be salient task boundaries at which point theta sequences are terminated, although we lacked a sufficient number of simultaneously recorded repeating neurons to test this directly (cf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>). Fields active within the same theta sequence (typically same corridor fields) may be functionally coupled, while fields active on opposite sides of a theta sequence termination (different corridor fields) may be uncoupled and their tuning uncorrelated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Temporal dynamics and map stability</title><p>The present data demonstrate a constant, gradual drift in the population activity pattern as the animal forages without a task. This affects the stability of the map over time; although the map maintains spatial informativeness at each point in time, the activity of the neurons comprising the map exhibits strong temporal non-stationarities. The time dynamics within individual repeating fields were heterogeneous and uncorrelated. These time dynamics do not necessarily correspond to the encoding of time <italic>per se</italic>, and further experiments would be needed to make that claim. For example, unknown variables that change over time may be altering the firing of these cells. However, the relevance of time dynamics for the present study is that the fluctuations over time were not always synchronized across repeating fields. This provides evidence for another nonpositional signal, time, or some temporally varying signal, that is not conserved across fields. However, it is also important to note that for most repeating cells the positional input was stable in that it provided a consistent instruction for where to fire as the field drifted; fields tended to drift between analogous locations. Previous studies have shown temporal drift hypothesized to serve as a temporal context signal to distinguish similar, repeated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mankin et al., 2012</xref>). However, these studies did not show a constantly drifting signal in the absence of an explicit task, which would be predicted if these dynamics served as a temporal context signal. One study did measure representational correlation in the absence of a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kentros et al., 2004</xref>), but analyzed similarity across sessions separated by at least 30 min. Here, we observed slow drift during continuous recordings on the scale of minutes to tens of minutes. In one study examining temporal drift during a foraging task, only two short-term timepoints were used which made it difficult to determine whether there was a continuous signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mankin et al., 2012</xref>). In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manns et al., 2007</xref>), drift was analyzed over shorter periods, but during an odor discrimination task which may recruit additional circuits than what would be used during free navigation. Therefore, the present data show that CA1 activity patterns are constantly drifting even in the absence of a task (as demonstrated previously in LEC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>) but in a way that preserves the spatial informativeness of the map.</p><p>The uncorrelated time dynamics within repeating fields provides further evidence that place cells do not receive a global gain signal that affects all fields equally. Fields changed at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and at the population level this resulted in decorrelated repeating field time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). It is important to note that because a Pearson’s correlation was used, it is possible the fields are related in time with a phase shift, e.g., the middle row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows repeating fields that appear to be in antiphase with each other for approximately 40 min while the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows repeating fields that suddenly increase their firing at a 5–6 min delay with a subsequent slow decay of each field. However, because the heterogeneity of temporal responses among fields was so large, it was difficult to develop a quantitative measure that captured this diversity in a way that would allow statistical evaluation. Thus, although it is clear that the place fields of repeating cells do not change their firing rates in synchrony, as if the cell had a global excitability change that made all its fields wax and wane together (e.g. from some neuromodulatory input or network effect on the scale of seconds to minutes), it nonetheless remains an open question as to whether the subfields of repeating cells engage in certain types of competitive interactions or other network dynamics that couple changes in their firing rates in more complex ways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Open-field foraging versus directed navigation</title><p>The behavioral sampling of an environment may affect how the CA1 place map represents it. CA1 place cells distinguish between different behaviors as the animal traverses a field if those behaviors are relevant for goal-directed navigation. When rats were trained to run down the stem of a T-maze before making a choice, some neurons on the center stem common to both choices distinguished between the behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). These cells, termed ‘splitter cells’, have been recorded under a variety of circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith and Mizumori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bower et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieves et al., 2016b</xref>, though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenck‐Santini et al., 2001</xref>). Common to these directed navigation experiments were stereotyped behaviors the animal learned, typically trajectories from a starting position to a goal. Place fields can also be directional, with their firing rates changing as a function of the direction of travel through the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiener et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markus et al., 1995</xref>). Although it is possible directionality is caused by other correlates of direction change, e.g., changes in spatial view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McNaughton et al., 1991</xref>), another interpretation is that directionality and splitting both reflect common, or at least similar, mechanisms that cause place fields to fire differentially depending on the path through the field. For example, place fields became directional when animals were trained to run on an open platform in a stereotyped manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Markus et al., 1995</xref>), conditions that are similar to those that elicit splitting and result in a qualitatively similar phenomenon. The conditions under which splitting/directionality are observed are not well understood and the presence of directionality shown here suggests that the pattern of behavioral sampling per se might be sufficient to cause splitting/directionality. The present design is a hybrid between the open foraging-like conditions, in which little directionality/splitting are seen, and the directed navigation tasks, in which splitting is observed. It is important to note that the rats did not explore the maze randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the design has elements of a directed search task as well given that rats had to shuttle between known, fixed sites to find reward. In the present design, there were no specific paths for the animal to learn; it could freely navigate throughout the city-block maze. However, its behavior was constrained by the linear nature of each alley and the right-angle choice points. This resulted in a low choice degree of freedom on the maze. The fact that a substantial number of place fields distinguished between the directions of travel through their firing rates suggests that even without learned trajectories to perform, CA1 represented attributes of the path through the field. It is possible that the rat performed internally generated trajectories, and these were represented by CA1. Alternatively, the low choice degrees of freedom itself could have promoted the representation of trajectory-related variables, possibly because of the discrete nature of travel through the maze. Regardless, these data demonstrate that explicit learning itself is not necessary for the hippocampus to represent how the animal moves through a maze.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and pretraining</title><p>Five Long-Evans rats (3 males, 2 females, 3–6 months of age, 325–350 g males, 215–250 g females) were used in the study.

Animals were maintained at 80% of their ad libitum weight to provide motivation during the task. Pretraining began once the animal’s weight was near the target weight and its behavior was calm in response to handling. Animals were trained once a day for approximately 1 hr to run clockwise laps around the perimeter of the track for a separate experiment, receiving liquid reward (~50 µL 1:1 water:Ensure, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Two rewards were given pseudorandomly per lap. Over the course of pretraining the number of laps and time spent in a start box were increased.

Each tetrode was composed of four 0.0017’’ diameter nichrome wires coated with VG and HML bonding agents (California Fine Wire Co, CA, USA), twisted together, and heated with a heat gun to bond the insulation. Each tetrode was electroplated to a target impedance of 130 kOhm from a typical starting impedance of 2–3 MOhm using a NanoZ plating system (NanoZ System, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).

Electrophysiological signals were filtered using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter from 600 to 6000 Hz for tetrodes and 1–300 Hz for the EEG. The low-cut taps for the FIR filter were 32 and 0 and the high-cut taps were 64 and 128, for the tetrodes and EEG, respectively. Thresholds for spike detection were set to a minimum of 50 μV.

These clusters were manually circumscribed on multiple parameter projections and the intersection of these bounds formed the inclusion criteria for each unit. Each cluster was then subjectively ranked on a five-point scale according to how well it was isolated from both the background noise and other, neighboring clusters.

The track consisted of a 0.9×0.6 m<sup>2</sup> walled platform with six blocks (18.4×18.4×15.2 cm<sup>3</sup>) arranged in a 2×3 grid. The gaps between the blocks and either the other blocks or the perimeter wall created 17 alleys (14×8.25 cm<sup>2</sup>). An IR emitter/detector (emitter: Honeywell, Charlotte, NC, USA; detector: Lite-On, Taipei City, Taiwan) pair was affixed to both entrances to each alleyway. A lickport connected to a peristaltic pump (Adafruit, New York, NY, USA) was mounted to the wall of each alley with a visible light LED mounted above and a buzzer below the surface of each alley. The hardware and software for each alley were controlled by a separate Arduino Uno (Arduino, Somerville, MA, USA), while the task was controlled by a custom Python program connected to the track via an Arduino Mega and communicating with each alley via the I2C protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moelands and Schutte, 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral paradigm</title><p>Animals navigated freely within the city-block maze for roughly 1 hr each day, with 15–20 min of baseline recording in a small holding dish before and after recording.

When infrared beams detected that the animal crossed the threshold of an alley primed for reward, a light flashed and a tone played while reward was dispensed. Two rewards were available on the apparatus at any one time, with a new reward site selected pseudorandomly once a primed reward site had been visited. The reward selection was performed such that a new reward site must be at least two alleys distant from the site it was replacing, to encourage sampling of the entire apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Place field detection</title><p>2D ratemaps were created with a bin size of 10 pixels (2.1 cm) and a Gaussian smoothing kernel of 1.5 pixels. To identify place fields, local firing rate maxima were found with a minimum distance of 40 pixels between them and the borders around each were expanded until the firing rate decreased below 20% of the peak rate for each bin of the expanding border. These regions were then passed through two thresholding steps. First, the area of the field had to be ≥1% of the walkable track area. Second, the peak firing rate had to be ≥1 Hz. Regions around a peak that did not pass these thresholds were not included for analysis; this was done to filter small, weakly active regions. Each field was then iteratively split into smaller fields using a watershed algorithm using skimage.morphology.watershed (subsequently moved to skimage.segmentation.watershed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). This splitting process identified all local maxima within the field. For each pair of in-field local maxima, the watershed algorithm expanded the regions around each peak until they collided, resulting in two potential place fields and the boundary between them. These smaller fields were considered valid if they passed the size and activity thresholds described above and if the firing rate of the boundary between them was not more than 75% of the firing rate of the larger peak. If the smaller fields did not pass these thresholds, they were kept as a single, larger field comprising them both. Each detected field of each neuron was assigned to three possible types of regions: a vertical alley, a horizontal alley, or an intersection. Assignment was determined based on overlap between the area of the field and the area of the track region. If the field overlapped at least 30% of the area of the track region (intuitively, it encroached into an alley at least 30% of the alley’s length), then the field was defined as being located in that region. If the field overlapped multiple locations, each overlap location was tested to see if the section of field in that location contained at least 25% of the field’s overall firing rate. This was computed by summing all the firing rate values in the bins of the ratemap in the region and dividing by the summed rate for the whole field. The field was labeled as being present in any and all locations that passed this measure. A manual curation step was also performed (see ‘Data filtering and preprocessing’ below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data filtering and preprocessing</title><p>The ratemaps described in the ‘Place field detection’ section were created with data that were filtered by running speed with a threshold of 1.5 cm/s. This threshold was chosen based on the structure of the environment, which forced the animal to make frequent turns and therefore had little opportunity to reach high speeds. Because the watershed algorithm may produce split fields that do not satisfy a firing rate criteria, a post-watershed firing rate threshold was applied to all fields. To be included in the dataset, the 95th percentile of the firing rate distribution of 2D ratemap bins must be ≥1 Hz. To exclude putative interneurons, any cell with a log mean rate &gt;0.6 was excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). The place field detection algorithm required manual curation. Field boundaries that did not correspond to a clear, on-track location of spatially tuned firing were excluded. In particular, periods of off-track exploratory head movements were removed at this step. Fields with boundaries that appeared poorly drawn, typically being overly large, were manually restricted. Importantly, this manual curation only removed poor quality fields, consolidated multiple detected ‘fields’ that were subjectively better explained by being peaks of the same field, or improved their boundaries; new fields were not created. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref> for details.</p><p>Passes through the field were defined as consecutive camera frames within the boundary of the field. Samples that exited the field and re-entered within 2 s were grouped together as part of the same pass through that field. Further, the pass was required to visit at least two points inside the field and at least two of these inside points must have been far enough inside the field that the distance from the closest point of the field border to the visit sample was at least 5% of the distance along the shorter of the length or width of the field. The length was taken as the extension of the field along the y-axis and the width was the extension along the x-axis. Additionally, passes the animal made through each alley were filtered to exclude occasions when the animal turned around without fully traversing the alley. This occurred frequently when the animal appeared to check an alley for reward and leave the way it came if no reward was given. Passes on which a reward was delivered were also removed, in order to remove potential firing rate confounds due to reward. Major analyses were re-analyzed with all trials, rewarded and non-rewarded, to confirm that this did not affect the conclusions of those analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Lastly, fields were excluded if there were fewer than two passes each in both directions through the alley. These preprocessing steps were not applied to the analysis of the number of track regions each field overlapped (see first paragraph of <italic>Place field repetition</italic> in Results) because this analysis pertained to the overall size and shape of the field and not the sampling through it.</p><p>Each pass was normalized by the mean activity at that location throughout the duration of the session. To do this, the spatial bins visited during the pass were identified and the occupancy-normalized firing rate in each spatial bin was computed using the data from a single pass. This single-pass ratemap was normalized by the session-averaged ratemap. The normalized pass firing rate was then defined as the mean of all spatial bins of the normalized single-pass ratemap. The rationale for this normalization was to control for passes which impinged on different parts of the spatial firing field. For instance, the animal may tend to sample the edge of the field when performing one type of trajectory (e.g. making a right turn from one alley to the next) and the center of the field when performing a different type of trajectory (e.g. moving straight ahead from one alley to the next). This would result in lower firing rates for the former behavior, even if the neuron did not in reality distinguish the two conditions.</p><p>As mentioned above, neurons could be classified as present at multiple alleys or intersections if their field overlapped a significant proportion (30%) of that region. For most of the analyses here, fields present at multiple locations were filtered by orientation (vertical or horizontal alleys). All analyses where such orientation filtering was performed were adjusted for this multiple comparison via a Bonferroni correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantifying place field repetition</title><p>Place field repetition was defined in two ways, operationally and statistically. Operationally, place field repetition was defined as any neuron with two or more fields in a common type of location. The common locations were vertical alleys, horizontal alleys, and intersections. Only alley data were analyzed here, except for the time dynamics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) which included alleys and intersections. This definition implies that any neuron with three or more fields in alleys was defined as repeating. Therefore, operationally, repetition was multi-fieldedness with the additional criterion that only cells with two fields in differently oriented alleys would not be included. This permissiveness was justified by the wide diversity of multi-field patterns seen in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3–7</xref>). Because it is not clear what drives repetition, and therefore what should count as repetition, a broad definition was employed to study the widest range of phenomena.</p><p>A metric termed the OAS was defined to test whether the apparent repeating patterns present within multi-fielded neurons were more common than the chance placement of fields would suggest. The OAS was a normalized measure that defined for each neuron how aligned the fields were compared to how aligned they possibly could be. First, the number of fields in vertical and horizontal alleys was defined. Next, the number of fields in the majority class was normalized by the total number of fields, yielding an alignment ratio. Next, this was compared to an a priori list of the possible alignment ratios for a cell with a given number of fields. Lastly, the ordinal position of the obtained alignment ratio was normalized by the number of possible alignment ratios for that number of fields.</p><p>As an example, consider a neuron with 6 fields, 4 of which are in vertical alleys. This is normalized to yield an alignment ratio of 4/6=0.67. Next, this ratio is compared to the list of possible alignment ratios for a neuron with 6 fields, which is [3/6=0.5, 4/6=0.67, 5/6=0.83, 6/6=1.0]. For an even number of fields the alignment ratio is minimal at 0.5 and maximal at 1.0. For an odd number of fields it is minimal at ((n+1)/2)/n and maximal at 1.0. The alignment scores cannot be lower than these bounds. In this example the alignment ratio of 0.67 is the second value in the list, out of four possibilities, so the final OAS value is 2/4=0.5. The OAS is minimal at 1/(number of alignment values) (here, 0.25) and maximal at 1.0.</p><p>To test for significance, the average OAS was computed across all multi-fielded neurons. Then, fields were randomly reassigned to neurons while maintaining the true total number of fields and a null OAS computed for each neuron. The average null OAS across multi-fielded neurons was computed and contributed one point to a null distribution. This was repeated 1000 times and the distribution of averaged OAS values was compared to the empirical average OAS with a one-sided statistical test at alpha = 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generalized linear model</title><p>To test whether individual fields encoded direction or time, GLMs were fit to the data. As mentioned elsewhere, if a field spanned multiple regions it was split into the portions on vertical or horizontal alleys separately. All GLM analysis was done in R (R version 4.0.3) using RStudio. GLMs were fit using the <italic>glm</italic> function from the <italic>stats</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">R Core Team, 2020</xref>). The normalized firing rate was used as the dependent variable, with an offset of 1 added to make all values nonzero. Based on the observed skewness in the distribution of firing rates, the Gamma family was used with an inverse link function (this choice of family necessitated the +1 offset mentioned above). Current direction was represented as a binary variable. Models incorporating a time regressor represented time as the timestamp of the beginning of the field traversal. The resulting time series was fit with a natural spline with three knots using the splines package from R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates and Venables, 2011</xref>).</p><p>LRTs were used to test the significance of the model fits. This was done using the <italic>lmtest</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hothorn, 2021</xref>). This test compares a base model to a more complex model containing a variable of interest. More complex models virtually always improve the model fit and the LRT tests whether this improvement is significant. The two variables tested here, in separate analyses, were current direction and time. It was suspected that in at least some cases the variables were correlated such that apparent effects of directional sampling could be due to time dynamics or, conversely, that apparent temporal dynamics were in fact due to changing biases in directional sampling over time. Therefore, when computing the LRT for the effect of current direction, the base model included a term for time. Conversely, when computing the LRT for the effect of time, the base model included a term for current direction.</p><p>The GLM had different sample size requirements than the Mann-Whitney test and therefore some neurons had sufficient sampling for the latter test but not the former. This is because while the Mann-Whitney test estimates one value for the whole population, the GLM includes two terms whose regression weights are calculated along the length of the natural spline with three degrees of freedom. The GLM, therefore, has more parameters to estimate and this requires more data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Random forest classifier</title><p>A random forest classifier was used to decode direction from the ensemble firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breiman, 2001</xref>) using the scikit-learn package in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>). For this analysis, place field boundaries were not used, as the activity of the entire recording ensemble was used regardless of where the cell fired. Behaviors when the animal turned around or was rewarded were removed as in other analyses. For each pass through each alley, a population vector was created. The ith entry of the vector was the normalized firing rate of the ith neuron. The normalized firing rate was computed as discussed above with the change that the session-wide activity in the alley was used. Each vector was associated with a directional label. The classifier used the population vector of firing rates as the input. Data were filtered by orientation such that direction was decoded from all horizontal alleys separately from the vertical alleys. The OOB score was used, as is standard for random forest classifiers. The OOB score is a measure of prediction accuracy based on testing trees on samples which they were not trained on (which occurs due to the bootstrap nature of the training procedure for each tree).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Time series interpolation</title><p>The time series of each field’s activity over time were correlated with one another. Because, in general, each time series had a different length, the vectors were interpolated to equate their sampling. The variability in time series length was a consequence of unequal sampling of each field due to the free foraging nature of the task. 1D piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP) interpolation was used because the fit was monotonic and would not overshoot the underlying signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritsch and Butland, 1984</xref>). The implementation used scipy.interpolate.pchipinterpolator in Python (scipy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Linear decoder methods</title><p>A linear regression decoder was used to decode position from the ensemble firing rates. Spikes from each neuron were convolved with a Gaussian kernel (sigma = 25 camera frames) to create an instantaneous firing probability distribution. Data were also analyzed using a shorter convolution window (sigma = 8 frames) to test the effect of window size on the results; the pattern of results was not affected by convolution window size. Data were mean centered and normalized using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScalar. X and Y positions were predicted from the population activity vector at each timepoint using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression. The r<sup>2</sup>_score function from scipy.metrics was used to estimate model performance as the amount of variance of the dependent variable (position) explained by the independent variable (population activity vector). Time epochs of alternating training (8000 points) and test (1000 points) windows were created. These windows were interspaced with buffers (500 points) so that the convolution process mentioned above did not cause data leakage. The decoder was trained on all training windows pooled together and tested on all testing windows pooled together. To estimate the variance in the decoder performance, the window boundaries were circularly rotated 1000 times, with shifts drawn from a uniform distribution. For the temporal decoding analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>), the training windows were used to separately test on the rest of the windows. For the temporal decoding analysis the training windows were 10,000 points, the testing windows were 1000 points, and the buffers were 1000 points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Frequentist statistical tests</title><p>Mann-Whitney U tests were used as one method to test the directional firing of place fields. The mannwhitneyu function was used from the scipy.stats Python package. t-Tests were performed using scipy.stats.ttest_1samp. OLS regression was used to test the correlation within pairs of fields from the same corridor or different corridors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The statsmodels package in Python was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). A Fisher Z-test was used as an additional method to test the difference in correlations between the same corridor and different corridor field pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher, 1925</xref>, pp. 161–168). The cocor package in R was used for this using the cocor.indep.groups function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015</xref>). A binomial test was used to compare different observed frequencies to those expected by chance. The function used was scipy.stats.binom_test with a one-sided (greater) test unless otherwise indicated. Chi-square goodness of fit tests were used to test the relative frequencies of vertical versus horizontal repeating fields as well as repeating fields sharing or not sharing directional tuning. The scipy.stats.chisquare function was used. Pearson’s chi-square test was used to test group differences between repeating and non-repeating fields for directional tuning and temporal dynamics (in separate tests). The scipy.stats.chi2_contingency function was used for this. Hartigan’s dip test was used to test whether the trajectory response correlation distribution was not unimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The ‘diptest’ package in R was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maechler, 2021</xref>). Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Shuffling tests</title><p>For the same corridor/different corridor analysis, the labels of each pairwise comparison were pooled across the dataset. On each iteration, the labels were reassigned to the groups while preserving the sample sizes (same corridors = 54 pairs, different corridors = 155 pairs). Next, OLS regression was performed and the difference in r<sup>2</sup> values for OLS<sub>same</sub> and OLS<sub>different</sub> was stored as one entry in the null distribution. The 95th percentile of this distribution was compared to the real difference in r<sup>2</sup> values between the groups.</p> </sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Johns Hopkins University (Protocol number RA20A318) and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Alley traversals on which the animal was rewarded were excluded from all main text analyses as any CA1 response to the reward itself was an undesirable source of variability.</title><p>However, major analyses were re-run with rewards included (i.e. all passes through the alley) to test whether this changed the results.

The fact that including rewards did not result in many more fields being included can be explained by the fact that rewards were uniformly distributed across the track so their removal decreased the samples from all fields evenly, resulting in little change to the number of fields included for analysis. The fact that the numerator (i.e. directional fields) decreased could be explained by the fact that rewarded trials introduced variability; indeed this was the justification for their removal, and this variability might have reduced the statistical power of the Mann-Whitney test from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85599-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85599-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data used in this manuscript are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7281/T15HMQD4">https://doi.org/10.7281/T15HMQD4</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: André A Fenton (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Consider improving the clarity of the manuscript (R1 comments 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22), provide better justification for the use of the hybrid track (R1 comment 1) and include alternative interpretations of your results (R1 comments, 7, 12, 15, 19, 20).</p><p>2) Both reviewers noted that additional visualization and quantification of behavior would improve the manuscript. This could include examples of raw trajectories the animals took through the maze, controlling for head direction sampling to ensure that low levels of directional sampling are not influencing the results (R2 comment 3), and better quantification of whether or not the behavior was random foraging or more stereotyped.</p><p>3) R1 raised a point regarding theta cells or neurons that fired over larger portions of the box that should be addressed. Were these cells analyzed? Do they show repeating spatial firing? Could their concurrent activity be predicted or predict the activity of the place cells that were studied? Such analyses would go some ways to asking whether there is a global positional or non-positional signal.</p><p>4) Please clarify the process used to include/exclude cells. Why would cells like R886D2 TT5\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.1 be excluded from analysis and cells like R859D2 TT6\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.4 be included? They look to have similar features. There are many other examples like this.</p><p>5) Consider R2's suggestion to remove analyses of time, as it would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>6) The GLM modeling results would be well served by comparison to some form of randomization. Random rotation of the time series for spiking relative to location and direction mapping data could be a useful approach. Here, the issue is to give some level of comparison for the likelihood ratio tests.</p><p>7) Do the authors have any data to address the question of whether repeating fields reflect similarity in view from each such location? Perhaps sessions where a full set of visual cues distinguishing walls of the environment were used? R2 has the concern that some will view the repeating fields as reflecting confusion despite the evidence for rate remapping across repeats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>What did the firing rate maps of theta cells look like? The examples in Figure S3 could be described and analyzed. Do they show repeating spatial firing? Could their concurrent activity be predicted or predict the activity of the place cells that were studied? Such analyses would go some way to asking whether there is a global positional or non-positional signal.</p><p>Why would cells like R886D2 TT5\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.1 be excluded from analysis and cells like R859D2 TT6\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.4 be included? They look to have similar features. There are many other examples like this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some suggestions for improvements are below:</p><p>1) The manuscript would be well served by removing the analyses and considerations of time in the episode. Representational drift cannot be dissociated from noise in the representation, from uncharted differences in the animal's experience of the environment across time (e.g., no. of visits to a location or differences in angles of approach), nor from developing satiation. The lack of demonstrated reproducibility in the time-based drift makes the finding and its interpretation highly questionable even taking into account prior work with similar claims and interpretations.</p><p>2) While the task is described as free-foraging, the authors should demonstrate that free or random-like foraging behavior was actually accomplished. It seems quite possible that a spontaneous regularity in search behavior could have emerged. It might also be interesting to compare volatility in speed and turning with open-field environments. Is there open-field data for these animals?</p><p>3) To what extent might the results concerning the directionality of in-field firing be influenced by an uneven sampling of directions across locations? Can the authors show directional tuning across more restricted (not 360-degree) ranges of directions for which robust sampling was available? Uneven sampling might even form a theoretical explanation for the emergence of the repeating fields in environments where path-running behavior repeats (e.g., Nitz 2011)</p><p>4) The GLM modeling results would be well served by comparison to some form of randomization. Random rotation of the time series for spiking relative to location and direction mapping data could be a useful approach.

We reply to the points in the order listed by the editor above:</p><p>R1 Comment 2: We use the terms ‘positional’ and ‘nonpositional’ to reflect functional inputs to CA1 that we identify through statistical analysis of CA1 place field firing rates. We fully agree that the larger hippocampal system, including the entorhinal cortex, may generate positional information rather than receiving it. This process clearly occurs in afferents to the hippocampus proper, in the form of grid cell and other spatial tuning properties of the MEC, so we can accurately refer to neural inputs to CA1 as carrying positional information. The main conclusion of the manuscript is that these inputs can be inferred due to the unique firing properties of repeating CA1 neurons. We show in Figure 2 that the fields of these neurons preferentially align to a common orientation which demonstrates, in our view, a positional input instructing the neuron at which type of alley to fire (horizontal vs. vertical). We show in Figure 5 that the directional tuning of these fields is not shared – neurons do not tend to prefer a given direction across all of their fields. To us, this demonstrates a non-positional (i.e., direction does not specify location) input that, further, is a field-level property, not a cell-level property. To make this point more clear we have added language on page 25 of the manuscript. We also replaced the word “study” with “infer” to address the reviewer’s concern that we are not actively manipulating these cues, but rather the design of the apparatus and the animal’s behavior allow us to infer these properties.</p><p>R1 Comment 4: We have changed the wording in the abstract to read: “thereby <italic>offering a potential mechanism to</italic> increase the flexibility…”</p><p>R1 Comment 5: The framework we refer to is one created by the brain which is taken to be subjective. We have added the word “subjective” as requested by the reviewer. The rest of the reviewer’s comment is addressed below, where we explain that by “inputs” we are talking about <italic>neural</italic> inputs to CA1, not inputs about putative objective space that are external to the organism. To avoid confusion, we have replaced phrasing related to “inputs to CA1” to phrasing describing “information represented in CA1” in various places throughout the manuscript.</p><p>R1 Comment 6: We do not believe that the studies cited by the reviewer are in any way inconsistent with the present results or can undermine the analyses we present. This comment appears to derive from the reviewer’s misinterpretation that our phrasing “inputs to the hippocampus” referred to inputs from outside the animal reflecting an objective space, rather than our intention to refer to neural inputs immediately afferent to the hippocampus (e.g., MEC, LEC, perirhinal, postrhinal, etc.). We agree that neural correlates of subjective spatial frames can be one of these neural inputs, perhaps generated in an upstream region of the hippocampus and relayed to CA1, but our experiment does not address this question. We hope that the changes we made to the manuscript to clarify our meaning alleviate this concern. We have added some reference citations on p. 26.</p><p>R1 Comment 11: The term “spatially-gated” means the variable response of the CA1 cell is dependent (“gated”) by spatial location. We have changed the wording to “spatially modulated” to avoid confusion.</p><p>R1 Comment 13: The term “slight trend” was intended to refer to the small magnitude of the effect, not whether the result was statistically significant. However, we acknowledge that this was ambiguous, as the term “trend” is often used to refer to a result that approaches the α level of the statistical test. We have changed the wording from “slight trend” to “small tendency” to avoid this confusion.</p><p>R1 Comment 14: We have changed the wording to “geometry”.</p><p>R1 Comment 16: We completely agree with the reviewer’s statement that conjoint activity of population activity is necessary to decode these signals. Indeed, we already demonstrated in the original manuscript that both positional (Figure 4C) and nonpositional information (Figure 3D,E) can be decoded at the population level, as the reviewer stated we need to do. Nowhere do we state that the system works only at the level of single cells or single place fields. Nonetheless, we believe strongly that it is imperative to understand how the system works at BOTH the single cell/single field level and the population level, and our analyses incorporate both levels of analysis.</p><p>R1 Comment 17: We do not fully understand the reviewer’s comment, especially why the reviewer brings in “future traversals” in this comment. The paper cited (Navratilova et al., 2012) shows precisely that directionality emerges over time with experience (Figures5, 6 of that paper). All we mean to suggest is that other forms of differential experience based on differences in the types of trajectories made as an animal moves within or between corridors may have some effect on the development of common directionality.</p><p>R1 Comment 18: We have changed the wording to use <italic>trajectory</italic> and <italic>direction</italic> throughout.</p><p>R1 Comment 21: There was a great deal of heterogeneity in the temporal responses of repeating fields of a single neuron (see Figure 6A and page 27). A cross-correlation between repeating fields could potentially identify a time offset with which to maximize field correlation, but it would not give further insight into how those fields change over time (see page 27 for further discussion). We do not believe we had the statistical power to rigorously characterize the diversity of time responses we saw in the data given our sample sizes.</p><p>R1 Comment 22: The time scale relevant to the analysis of Figure 6 is on the order of many seconds to minutes, and there are a number of possible mechanisms that might promote the firing rates of all of the firing fields of a repeating cell to wax and wane together at this time scale. For example, changing levels of neuromodulators or hormones might cause a cell’s activity to be generally higher or lower regardless of where in the apparatus the rat was located. One might imagine that other effects, such as changes in levels of global inhibition or changes in synaptic efficacy that last for minutes, might cause a cell’s activity to be generally higher or lower regardless of where in the apparatus the rat was located. However, our results suggest that such mechanisms are not in play, and that instead each firing field’s activity rate can be modulated independently, suggesting a more complex interaction between the positional inputs that determine where the cell should fire and other inputs that determine the magnitude of the firing rate at any moment. We have clarified this on page 27.</p><p>R1 Comment 1: We have added wording on page 10 to better explain the relevance of our track design. In brief, the design contains elements that, in previous studies, have been associated with directional tuning (linear or circular track segments in which the animal makes 2 oppositely oriented directional trajectories that may promote the formation of (quasi-)independent maps for each direction) along with elements that have been associated with a lack of directional firing (2-dimensional trajectories with no enforced, extended linear trajectories of opposite directions to associate with distinct maps). We hypothesized that combining these design elements would better explain what causes CA1 neurons to be directional – the existence of a goal-directed path to follow, or the physical geometry that perhaps leads to traversals being more easily distinguishable (through, e.g. different spatial views).</p><p>R1 Comment 7: We refer to the ‘rate remapping hypothesis’ as a specific hypothesis offered by Leutgeb et al. (2005) that addresses the function of rate remapping. The rate remapping <italic>phenomenon</italic> is that under some conditions, place cells maintain a similar firing location across different conditions but change their average firing rates in that location. The rate remapping <italic>hypothesis,</italic> according to Leutgeb et al. (2005), is that such a phenomenon might be a coding mechanism for episodic memory, as different episodes in the same location may be encoded by these differential firing rates. We have clarified this on page 3. We agree that this is speculative, but we believe that this is a useful way to consider these data, as rate remapping has become an important and well-studied phenomenon in the place cell literature.</p><p>R1 Comment 15: Figure 6A shows representative firing rate time series from neurons with non-stationary fields. It can be seen from this plot that even on the order of 10-15 minutes there is temporal variability. It is possible that the time constant of variability is somehow learned by the system based on the animal’s learning of the length of the experiment, and had we only recorded 10-15 minutes (instead of looking at a 10-15 minute block of a 60 min session) the dynamics would be different. This is speculative and our design does not allow us to probe this question. Absent such potential scaling, it stands to reason that a longer time course of the experiment would show more evidence of representational drift, if the rate of such drift is constant, and longer sessions are useful to detect the prevalence of this drift.</p><p>R1 Comment 19: A shift in reference frames is another plausible explanation for those data (although we do not see how it is more parsimonious), and we have added wording to include that possibility on page 26.</p><p>R1 Comment 20: We agree this would be an interesting and informative analysis to do. However, we are unable to address this question with our current data because we lack enough simultaneously recorded neurons to test this with sufficient power. For example, Wikenheiser and Redish (2015) required a minimum of 25 simultaneously recorded neurons for their analyses. In Figure 2A, we show that we did not have that many simultaneously recorded repeating neurons in our data set, since they were a subset of all recorded place cells. However, we believe that the discussion point is still an interesting speculation, and we have decided to keep it in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Both reviewers noted that additional visualization and quantification of behavior would improve the manuscript. This could include examples of raw trajectories the animals took through the maze, controlling for head direction sampling to ensure that low levels of directional sampling are not influencing the results (R2 comment 3), and better quantification of whether or not the behavior was random foraging or more stereotyped.</p></disp-quote><p>We include a new supplementary figure (Supplemental Figure 3) that details the behavioral processing steps using an example day from the dataset. The major processing steps are shown, showing for the full session what data is kept and removed at each step, as well as a 50 second example window of behavior showing what a snippet of behavior looks like at each step.</p><p>The directional sampling was set such that only alleys with at least two passes in both directions (e.g. at least two passes North and two passes South through a vertical alley) were included in the analysis.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 2 shows occupancy histograms of each alley as well as ethograms of the trajectories (defined as the previous, current, and next direction through each alley pass). These data show that the rats on average displayed some stereotypy in their travel through the maze (which is also true of ‘random foraging” tasks in an open field, in that rats display stereotyped movement such as thigmotaxis and other nonrandom trajectories). We believe our thresholds ensure we are only including alleys with enough sampling for statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) R1 raised a point regarding theta cells or neurons that fired over larger portions of the box that should be addressed. Were these cells analyzed? Do they show repeating spatial firing? Could their concurrent activity be predicted or predict the activity of the place cells that were studied? Such analyses would go some ways to asking whether there is a global positional or non-positional signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new supplementary figure (Supplemental Figure 5) showing the rate maps of all putative interneurons (mean rate &gt;= 10<sup>0.6</sup> spikes/s). Some of these neurons did show firing patterns that appeared to be repeating (e.g., R859 D1 TT11 cell 2 and R859 D2 TT14 cell 4). However, we lack the statistical power to test whether their joint activity is predictive of or predicted by place field activity as we have an average of 2 interneurons simultaneously recorded per day, and some days had no interneurons at all.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please clarify the process used to include/exclude cells. Why would cells like R886D2 TT5\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.1 be excluded from analysis and cells like R859D2 TT6\Cl<sup>-</sup>maze1.4 be included? They look to have similar features. There are many other examples like this.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells were initially excluded from analysis based on the absence of firing as the rat was engaged in forward motion on the track. Cell R886 D2 TT5 cell 1 was excluded because its firing field occurred mostly off-track during exploratory ‘scanning’ behavior as the rat reared along the wall of the maze. By contrast, the firing of cell R859 D2 TT6 cell 4 occurs within the bounds of an alley.</p><p>We have updated supplementary figure 4 such that each excluded neuron labeled in red now has a numeric code next to it detailing why it was excluded.</p><p>1. Place field detection algorithm did not detect any fields (i.e. firing hotspots too small and/or low rate), N = 2 neurons</p><p>2. Manual exclusion: Most firing rate off-track, often ‘scanning’ firing, N = 11 neurons</p><p>3. Manual exclusion: Firing mostly occurred as a burst when animal was placed on or taken off the track, N = 1</p><p>4. Manual exclusion: Algorithm’s field identification and partition did not match experimenter’s visual inspection, N = 1</p><p>5. Manual exclusion: Algorithm detected fields but there was excessive out-of-field firing, N = 5</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Consider R2's suggestion to remove analyses of time, as it would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the time analysis is important for two reasons. First, it addresses Reviewer 1’s concern that we are treating place fields as static entities. Instead, this figure demonstrates that, at least on the time scale of minutes, place fields are demonstrably not static, and it is important to analyze this.</p><p>Second, the question of temporal drift is an important one in the study of the hippocampus (and the brain in general), and as R1 pointed out most hippocampal studies do not record single experimental sets for this long. Further, no study to our knowledge has addressed temporal drift in the context of multi-stable fields. Therefore, we believe these data in Figure 6, though observational, are still important to include in the manuscript to provide readers an accurate depiction of the data analyzed in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The GLM modeling results would be well served by comparison to some form of randomization. Random rotation of the time series for spiking relative to location and direction mapping data could be a useful approach. Here, the issue is to give some level of comparison for the likelihood ratio tests.</p></disp-quote><p>A randomization test was done to corroborate the GLM likelihood ratio test results of direction (Supplementary Figure 10). First, category labels (e.g., direction “N” or “S” for a vertically oriented field, “E” or “W” for a horizontally oriented field) were shuffled within each field 1000 times, maintaining the same number of each type of label but dissociating their relationship to firing rate. Then, the GLM likelihood ratio testing was done as for the real data and a proportion of fields that passed (spuriously) the test was computed. The proportion of fields that (spuriously) pass this test constituted one data point out of 1000 in the null distribution. We compare the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the shuffle distribution to the real data and for direction and find the real proportion was well outside the shuffle distribution.</p><p>An analogous randomization test was done to corroborate the GLM likelihood ratio test results of time (Supplementary Figure 11). Time labels (“first”, “second”, “third” of the 3 thirds of the session) were shuffled within each field 1000 times, maintaining the true number of each label. In each iteration, the GLM likelihood ratio was performed as for the real data. The proportion of fields that (spuriously) passed the test was recorded. The shuffle distribution was therefore made up of the proportion of fields with a fictive response within each iteration. We compare the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the shuffle to the real data and find the real value exceeds it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do the authors have any data to address the question of whether repeating fields reflect similarity in view from each such location? Perhaps sessions where a full set of visual cues distinguishing walls of the environment were used? R2 has the concern that some will view the repeating fields as reflecting confusion despite the evidence for rate remapping across repeats.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not explicitly control for the spatial view at each location. However, we did provide a black curtain next to the eastern wall of the maze as a polarizing cue and, because the recording system was also present next to the north wall of the maze, we believe there were sufficient external landmarks to resolve confusion. It’s important to note that while the maze had 6’’ high walls, these cues were visible above the walls and, further, the animals often reared up along the wall to peer outside which would allow them to orient themselves (note the presence of extra-maze sampling along the walls in many rate maps – this reflects the exploratory ‘scanning’ phenomenon).</p><p>Additionally, previous work has addressed whether repetition reflects confusion about current location. Singer et al., 2010 trained rats on an M-maze to perform an odor-guided memory task along the arms of the M-maze. They found that the animals could learn the task – indicating they could differentiate between these arms – yet repetition persisted. We have also added an additional reference to this paper on page 18.</p></body></sub-article></article>
