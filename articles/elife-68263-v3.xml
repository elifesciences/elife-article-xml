HCC is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Villanueva, 2019</xref>). The molecular landscape of HCC is very complex and includes multiple genetic and epigenetic modifications that could represent new diagnosis and therapeutic targets. In this sense, multiple studies have established molecular classifications of HCC subtypes that could be related to clinical management and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhanasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llovet et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, Hoshida et al. classified HCC into S1, S2, and S3 subtypes by means of their histological, pathological, and molecular signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoshida et al., 2009</xref>). S1 tumors exhibit high TGF-β and Wnt signaling activity but do not harbor mutations or genomic changes. The tumors are relatively large, poorly differentiated, and associated with poor survival. S2 tumors have increased levels of Myc and phospho-Akt and overexpress α-fetoprotein, an HCC serum biomarker. S3 tumors harbor mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (β-catenin) but tend to be well-differentiated and are associated with good overall survival.</p><p>The standard of care for advanced HCC is treatment with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets Raf, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Sorafenib extends the median survival time from 7.9 months to 10.7 months, and lenvatinib, a multiple VEGFR kinase inhibitor, has been reported to extend survival to 13.6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llovet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Philip et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rimassa and Santoro, 2009</xref>). Combination therapies of VEGF antagonists together with sorafenib or erlontinib are currently being tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhanasekaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greten et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quintela-Fandino et al., 2010</xref>). However, even with the most advanced forms of treatment, the global death toll per year reaches 700,000, creating a mortality ratio of 1.07 with a 5-year survival rate of 18% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferlay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siegel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Villanueva, 2019</xref>). Not only is it difficult to diagnose HCC in the early stages, but there is also a poor response to the currently available treatments. Thus, novel therapeutic targets and treatments for HCC are urgently needed.</p><p>The ENCODE consortium revealed that as much as 80% of the human genome can be transcribed, while only 2% of the genome encodes for proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>). Thousands of transcripts from 200 nucleotides (nt) to over 100 kilobases (kb) in length, called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are the largest and most diverse class of non-protein-coding transcripts. They commonly originate from intergenic regions or introns and can be transcribed in the sense or antisense direction. Most are produced by RNA polymerase II and can be capped, spliced, and poly-adenylated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>). Strikingly, many are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner and undergo changes in expression level during cellular differentiation and in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinger et al., 2008</xref>). These lncRNAs present as an exciting class of regulatory molecules to pursue as some are dysregulated in HCC and have the potential to be specific to a subtype of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the few examples of a lncRNA that has been studied in the context of HCC is the homeobox (HOX) antisense intergenic RNA (<italic>HOTAIR</italic>). This transcript acts in trans by recruiting the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the lysine-specific histone demethylase (LSD1), and the CoREST/REST H3K4 demethylase complex to their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezponda and Licht, 2014</xref>). <italic>HOTAIR</italic> promotes HCC cell migration and invasion by repressing RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38), which is otherwise targeted by p53 to induce cell cycle arrest in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Another mechanism through which lncRNAs function involves inhibitory sequestration of miRNAs and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cesana et al., 2011</xref>). In HCC, the lncRNA <italic>HULC</italic> (highly upregulated in liver cancer) sequesters <italic>miR-372</italic>, which represses the protein kinase PRKACB, and downregulates the tumor suppressor gene <italic>CDKN2C</italic> (p18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the highly conserved <italic>MALAT1</italic> lncRNA controls expression of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and migration and is upregulated in many solid carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amodio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2007</xref>); siRNA knockdown of <italic>MALAT1</italic> in HCC cell lines decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Only a small number of the thousands of lncRNAs have been characterized in regard to HCC. Therefore, whether and how additional lncRNAs contribute to HCC remains unknown, and it is not fully understood how lncRNAs acquire specificity in their mode of action at individual gene loci. A lack of targetable molecules limits the effectiveness of treatments for HCC, and this class of regulatory RNAs has great potential to provide novel therapeutic targets.</p><p>Here, we reanalyzed naïve and differentiated transcriptomes of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the context of the GENCODE M20 annotation. We aimed to identify lncRNAs that are required for the pluripotency gene expression program, and dysregulated in cancer, with a specific focus on HCC. Since normal development and differentiation are tightly regulated, dysfunction of potential regulatory RNAs may lead to various disease phenotypes including cancer. One lncRNA that is highly upregulated in HCC is of special interest, and we show that it interacts with and sequesters the translation repressor nucleolysin TIAR, resulting in an increase of Myc translation. Together, our findings identified a mechanism by which a lncRNA regulates translation of MYC in HCC by sequestering a translation inhibitor and as such has potential as a therapeutic target in HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deep sequencing identifies 40 lncRNAs dysregulated in ESCs and cancer</title><p>Since normal development and differentiation are tightly regulated processes, we reasoned that lncRNAs whose expressions are ESC specific and can be found to also exhibit altered expression in cancer may have important potential roles in regulating critical cellular processes.</p><p>We reanalyzed the raw data from our published differential RNA-seq screen comparing lncRNA expression in mouse ESCs vs. neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>), using updated bioinformatic tools and the recently released GENCODE M20 annotation (January 2019), which has nearly 2.5 times more annotated lncRNAs than the previously used GENCODE M3. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the processed data showed that ESCs and NPCs independently cluster, and the difference between ESC cell lines (AB2.2) and mouse-derived ESCs only accounted for 4% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, we prioritized transcripts with an FPKM value &gt;1, and those that were more than twofold upregulated in ESCs compared to NPCs. This left us with 147 ESC-specific transcripts. Since our goal is to discover novel transcripts that may play a role in the progression of human cancer, we first needed to identify the human homologues of the 147 mouse ESC transcripts. In addition to sequence conservation, we also evaluated syntenic conservation of the mouse lncRNAs to the human genome due to the fact that many lncRNAs are not conserved on the sequence level. Finally, we queried TCGA databases via cBioportal to find lncRNAs that were altered in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A final candidate list of 40 lncRNAs that are enriched in ESCs, and dysregulated in cancer, was identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Our candidate list contains lncRNAs that have a wide range of expression and also contains several previously identified lncRNAs that have been found to be dysregulated in cancer (<italic>NEAT1</italic>, <italic>FIRRE</italic>, <italic>XIST</italic>, <italic>DANCR</italic>, and <italic>GAS5</italic>), verifying the validity of the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soudyab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) screen to identify transcripts enriched in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and dysregulated in cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot of 10 RNA-seq libraries from mouse-derived ESCs, and two from cell lines.

datasets of adult mouse tissue to compare the expression levels of the candidates across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). lncRNAs are known to have distinct expression patterns across different tissues, and our results support the notion that lncRNAs are generally not pan-expressed. Interestingly, many of the identified lncRNAs are enriched in embryonic liver, which is the organ with the most regenerative capacity, yet never grows past its original size.</p><p>From here, we decided to focus on liver-enriched candidate mouse lncRNAs, especially those that were primarily dysregulated in liver cancers. Because HCC is one of the deadliest cancers and has inadequate treatment options, we focused on lncRNAs that were dysregulated in HCC, <italic>LINC00862</italic>, <italic>TSPOAP-AS1</italic>, <italic>MIR17HG</italic>, and <italic>SNHG5</italic>, with their mouse counterparts being <italic>Gm19705</italic>, <italic>Mir142hg</italic>, <italic>Mir17hg</italic>, and <italic>Snhg5</italic>, respectively. Out of these four lncRNAs that were detected to be amplified in HCC, <italic>LINC00862</italic> was the highest at 13% of all liver cancer cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We assayed <italic>LINC00862</italic> expression in human samples obtained from healthy and cirrhotic livers and HCC nodules. Indeed, we found that levels of <italic>LINC00862</italic> were elevated in HCC tumor nodules, but also in cirrhotic liver, suggesting that it may play a role in HCC progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, we also assayed <italic>LINC00862</italic> expression in human HCC cell lines and found it to be upregulated in numerous HCC cell lines compared to the normal human liver cell line, THLE-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In order to use a more tractable model system, we assessed the conservation of <italic>LINC00862</italic> and its potential mouse counterpart, <italic>GM19705</italic>, which was internally designated as <italic>lnc05</italic> in previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>). While much shorter, <italic>GM19705</italic> has 51% sequence identity and the gene order is syntenically conserved, although a reversal event most likely occurred within the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Weighted gene correlation network analysis of <italic>GM19705</italic> identified that its expression is highly correlated with those of cell cycle genes, such as <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). GO term analysis of the cluster identified cell cycle processes as highly enriched, indicating that <italic>GM19705</italic> may play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Reanalysis of previously published single-cell analysis of normal adult mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>) identified <italic>GM19705</italic> expression to be low overall, as expected, but highly expressed exclusively in a subset of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis identified <italic>GM19705</italic>/<italic>LINC00862</italic> as a lncRNA that is expressed in ESCs and dysregulated in HCC. We found that <italic>GM19705</italic> is also highly expressed in developing liver and exclusively in adult hepatocytes, and it may have a potential function to regulate the cell cycle.

As such, lncRNAs can serve as biomarkers, tumor suppressors, or oncogenes, and have great potential as therapeutic targets (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arun et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we identified a lncRNA, <italic>PHAROH</italic>, that is upregulated in mouse ESCs, embryonic and regenerating adult liver, and in HCC. It also has a conserved human ortholog, which is upregulated in human patient samples from cirrhotic liver and HCC. Genetic knockout or ASO knockdown of <italic>PHAROH</italic> results in a reduction of cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation.</p><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism through which <italic>PHAROH</italic> acts in proliferation, we used RNA-seq and mass spectrometry to provide evidence that <italic>PHAROH</italic> regulates MYC translation via sequestering the translational repressor TIAR in trans. Modulation of <italic>PHAROH</italic> levels reveals that it is positively correlated with MYC protein level, which is well known to be associated with HCC and is amplified in nearly 50% of HCC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 1993</xref>). In addition, MYC has been characterized as a critical player in liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). We identified TIAR as an intermediate player in the <italic>PHAROH</italic>-MYC axis, which has been reported to bind to the 3′ UTR of MYC mRNA and suppress its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazan-Mamczarz et al., 2006</xref>). While TIAR is an RNA-binding protein that is known for its role in stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>), we do not detect stress granule formation in our HCC cell lines as assayed by immunofluorescence for TIAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As such, the role of <italic>PHAROH</italic>-TIAR lies outside the context of stress granule function. Interestingly, overexpression of TIAR is a negative prognostic marker for HCC survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uhlen et al., 2017</xref>). As the primary mutation of HCC is commonly amplification of MYC, it is possible that TIAR is upregulated in an attempt to curb MYC expression.</p><p>Our analysis maps the <italic>PHAROH</italic>-TIAR interaction to predominantly occur at a 71-nt hairpin at the 5′ end of <italic>PHAROH</italic>. While <italic>PHAROH</italic> has two main isoforms that are selectively expressed in ESCs and HCC, the hairpin is commonly expressed in both isoforms. TIAR has been classified as an ARE-binding protein that recognizes U-rich and AU-rich sequences. Kinetic and affinity studies have found that TIAR has a dissociation constant of ~1 nM for U-rich sequences and ~14 µM for AU-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). One question that is apparent in the RNA-binding protein field is how RBPs acquire their specificity. While there have been studies that analyze target RNA structure or RRM structure, why RBPs bind one transcript over another with a similar sequence is still an open question. For example, the 3′ UTR of Myc contains multiple U-rich stretches, ranging from 3 to 9 resides. It has been reported that TIAR binds efficiently to uridylate residues of 3–11 length, yet PAR-CLIP data only reveals two binding events in the human <italic>MYC</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the 53-nt fragment that was assayed in this study contained potentially six TIAR binding sites, yet RNA EMSA analysis revealed a preference for a single binding event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). One explanation is that <italic>PHAROH</italic>’s hairpin has uniquely spaced TIAR binding sites. Because the absolute affinity of TIAR to U-rich sequences is relatively high, one molecule may sterically block additional binding events. However, if the binding sites are properly spaced, binding events will be ordered and perhaps even cooperative. The average gap between binding sites in the <italic>Myc</italic> fragment is 2 nt, while it is 10 nt in the <italic>PHAROH</italic> hairpin, which allows more flexibility in spacing between each bound protein.</p><p>In addition, one aspect that was not explored was the requirement for the formation of the hairpin for TIAR binding. Previous studies used synthesized linear oligos as substrates to test the kinetics of these RBPs, and we also mutated the hairpin in a way such that structure is preserved. TIAR contains three RRMs, which typically recognizes single-stranded RNA. Therefore, binding of TIAR to the 71-nt sequence of <italic>PHAROH</italic> would require unwinding of the potential hairpin, which is energetically unfavorable. It is also known that TIAR’s RRM2 mainly mediates ssRNA polyU-binding, but its dsRNA binding capabilities have not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). There are examples where multiple RRMs in tandem can allow for higher RNA binding affinity and possibly sandwiching dsRNA, and thus it would be possible that TIAR binding to the multiple sites on the <italic>PHAROH</italic> hairpin is cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allain et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>While TIAR may be <italic>PHAROH</italic>’s top interacting protein, it is unknown whether <italic>PHAROH</italic> is TIAR’s highest interacting RNA. This would depend on the relative abundances of each RNA species that has the potential to bind TIAR, and TIAR’s expression level. This seems to be cell type specific as TIAR was initially studied in immune cells and was shown to predominantly translationally repress <italic>Tnf-α</italic> through binding of the AU-rich sequence in the 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piecyk et al., 2000</xref>). In our cell lines, <italic>Tnf-α</italic> is not expressed. Conversely, a screen for proteins that bind to the <italic>Tnf-α</italic> 3′ UTR may not necessarily indicate TIAR as a binder, as evidenced by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>). Another recent study had shown that lncRNA <italic>MT1JP</italic> functions as a tumor suppressor and had the capability to bind to TIAR, which suppresses the translation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>MT1JP</italic> is largely cytoplasmic, while TIAR in our context is mainly nuclear. Thus, while TIAR may bind additional mRNAs or lncRNAs, it seems that one of the main targets in HCC cell lines is <italic>Myc</italic>, as supported by statistically significant promoter enrichment of the downstream targets.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a lncRNA, <italic>PHAROH</italic>, that is enriched in ESCs and dysregulated in HCC, and found that it acts to sequester TIAR through a hairpin structure in order to regulate <italic>MYC</italic> translation. Additionally, based on synteny and upregulation in human HCC samples, we identified <italic>LINC00862</italic> as the possible human ortholog of PHAROH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Future studies will reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting <italic>PHAROH</italic> to impact liver development/regeneration and HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and genomic PCR</title><p>All cell culture reagents were obtained from Gibco (Life Technologies), unless stated otherwise.

The biobank obtained an informed consent and consent to publish from each patient and codified samples were provided to the researchers. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Samples were processed following standard operating procedures approved by the Ethical and Scientific Committees. Liver samples from healthy patients were collected from individuals with normal or minimal changes in the liver at surgery of digestive tumors or from percutaneous liver biopsy performed because of mild alterations of liver function. Samples for cirrhotic liver and HCC were obtained from patients undergoing partial hepatectomy and/or liver transplantation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Animal experimental

embryonic stem cells as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Depletion of PHAROH reduced cell proliferation, which was rescued by exogenous expression of PHAROH. Genes that exhibited altered expression in PHAROH depleted cells harbored consensus upstream sequences, which matches the MYC-binding motifs. The protein expression of MYC was downregulated in PHAROH depleted cells without changes in its mRNA expression, suggesting that PHAROH regulates MYC translation. TIAR, a translation inhibitor was identified as a binding partner of PHAROH which indicates PHAROH may sequester TIAR to keep the expression of MYC at a high levels during proliferation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;PHAROH lncRNA regulates c-Myc translation in hepatocellular carcinoma via sequestering TIAR&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending minor changes to the manuscript as suggested by reviewers that do not require rereview. Your article has been reviewed by 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors attempt to determine how LNC RNAs may be involved in oncogenic progression, in this particular case, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p><p>They find, using several databases, that several LNC RNAs are dysregulated and choose the highest one, in 13% of the cases to investigate in detail for mechanistic correlation with the pathology. In a straightforward analysis, they determine that this particular LNC, which they term PHAROH plays a role in cell proliferation, as its knockout and knockdown leads to a decrease in cell proliferation in culture, which is restored by transfection into the cells. Comparing transcriptomics of control and knockout cells, a large number of mRNAs are affected, but they determine that c-Myc promoter elements are enriched in the genes identified, although c-Myc is not among them. RNA pull-down followed by mass spec identifies a protein, TIAR, a known translational repressor that binds to several short sequences in the LNC RNA. The authors postulate that the role of PHAROH is to efficiently compete for binding of the translational repressor with Myc so that c-Myc translation is enhanced without affecting the mRNA levels. Mutation of these binding sites results in decreased proliferation, and importantly oncogenesis. The data supports this model as far as it goes in the cultured cells but whether it plays a role in HCC is yet to be determined. The correlations with cirrhotic human liver seems more compelling in Figure 1D. The focus on PHAROH and TIAR, while revealing may represent only a small part of the total picture and c-Myc one of many possible targets that influence cell proliferation. Nonetheless, this work provides convincing evidence for the model where a LNC RNA can serve as a competitor for a translation regulator and a starting point for disease relevance.</p><p>The work is convincing within the context of the experimental design involving these particular players selected from a large number of possibilities. While it would not have been possible to investigate many of the other LNCs, proteins, targets, promoter elements etc., the manuscript needs to have the usual caveats in the text concerning the limitations on interpreting its relevance for a complex process such as cancer progression into HCC. The authors have not overextended their claims but they do suggest that PHAROH might be a therapeutic target. Hopefully they're right, but many of these approaches have not played out as expected, due to the large heterogeneity of tumor cells, herein supported by the fact that PHAROH is not overexpressed in the majority of the samples. Whether it is a small pathway in a random subset of cells, or an important one remains to be determined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Yu et al. use a combination of complementary methodologies including transcriptomics, biochemistry and imaging to identify and characterize the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), named PHAROH, in hepatocellular carcinoma. The authors show that PHAROH lncRNA is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and that by binding and sequestering the translational inhibitor TIAR -via a hairpin structure- enhances c-MYC mRNA translation. This regulation mechanism has an impact in cell proliferation and, thus, it has potential high clinical relevance. Overall, the biological insights into the molecular mechanism by this study are significant and potentially interesting to liver researchers and others in the scientific community.</p><p>The conclusions of this work are mostly well supported by data. The data is clear and well presented.</p><p>– Statistical analysis and P-values. The authors should add p-values to Figures: 2C, 2G, 4B and 5A.</p><p>– It is confusing how the p-values are indicated in Figure Legends for all the panels at once. Would the authors consider to add the p-values to each individual panel?</p><p>– Figure 2B. Would the authors explain how the qPCR are normalized?</p><p>– Fig2E. FISH image: What is the isoform detected by the probes?</p><p>The Scale bar in Hepa1-6 panel is missing, please, add this info accordingly. Also, Ppib housekeeping gene should be mentioned in the figure legend.</p><p>– Gels/Western Blots: the authors should consider adding molecular-weight size marker to PCR gels and Western Blots panels in Figure 3A, 4C, 5D, 5E, 5F, 7B and 7E. Also, adding numbers to the lanes will help the reader</p><p>– Page 9. Would the authors consider to change &quot;…where the expression was correlated with time points of concerted cell division, but did not fluctuate across the cell cycle&quot; to &quot;…where the expression was correlated with time points of concerted DNA synthesis, but did not fluctuate across the cell cycle&quot;.</p><p>– The authors claim to visualize single molecule RNA by FISH and quantitate foci per cell. Could the authors explain how they confirm single molecule detection resolution?</p><p>– Figure 2E and 2G. How the authors reconcile the differences in PHAROH intracellular distribution by using FISH (2E right panel) and cellular fractionation (2G PHAROH panel)?</p><p>– Figure 3. To evaluate the functional role of PHAROH the authors generate targeted knockouts using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, however, they get clones where the expression level is reduced up to 80-90%. Can the authors speculate on why they were not able to get a complete KO? Would the authors consider changing the word &quot;knockout&quot; to &quot;knockdown&quot; in the text, accordingly?</p><p>– The authors express PHAROH ectopically in order to rescue cell proliferation and migration defects in PHAROH knockdown cells. How are the levels of this expression controlled? Is this an overexpression of PHAROH in comparison to endogenous levels? Could the authors elaborate more in the interpretation of this data and in the possibility of having other secondary effects due to overexpression. What is the phenotype if the mutant m4 PHAROH is used instead of the wildtype form of PHAROH?</p><p>– Figure 4C. Would the authors consider to include a quantification of the western blot lanes?</p><p>– Figure 5B and 5E. It would be nice if the authors could indicate in Figure 5B what are the TIAR binding sites used in the EMSA (Figure 5E).</p><p>– Figure 7D and 7E. The authors overexpress PHAROH and m4 PHAROH to study translation using c-MYC 3'UTR reporter RNA. Could the authors comment what is the interpretation of the results given the presence of endogenous levels of PHAROH in the cells? It would be more appropriated if the authors could use PHAROH knockdown cells (or antisense) for this study. They should consider studying the effect of PHAROH on c-MYC translation without the contribution of endogenous levels that would compete for TIAR binding.</p><p>– Due to the clinical relevance of this study, would the authors consider visualizing LINC00862 lncRNA in resection samples from HCC patients by FISH?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors identified a novel lncRNA, named PHAROH, which is expressed in ESC as well as HCCs. Depletion of PHAROH either by genome editing or ASO reduced cell proliferation, which was rescued by exogenous expression of PHAROH. Genes that exhibited altered expression in PHAROH depleted cells harbored consensus upstream sequences, which matches the MYC-binding motifs. The protein expression of MYC was downregulated in PHAROH depleted cells without changes of the mRNA expression of MYX, suggesting that PHAROH regulates MYC expression at the post-transcriptional levels. The authors performed RAP-MS and identified TIAR as a binding partner of PHAROH, and confirmed the interaction by a series of in vitro binding assays. Considering TIAR has been shown to inhibit translation of target mRNAs, the authors proposed that PHAROH normally sequester TIAR to keep the expression of MYC at a high levels in ESC or HCC.</p><p>Overall the experiments are well designed and results are clear and convincing. I only have a few minor comments regarding the identities of PHAROH and insights into the molecular mechanisms.</p><p>1. While the authors described that there are two isoforms of PHAROH, the statement is not well supported by experimental data. Considering that this is the first paper that characterized the function of PHAROH, more detailed descriptions how they determined the two transcriptional units are required. Northern blot analyses will be the best, but it will be also be helpful to show the mapping patterns of deep sequencing reads together with RACE clones they identified. The annotations shown in Figure S2F is somewhat confusing, which is inconsistent with the annotation shown in Figure 2A. In addition, there are no explanation for the label A, B, C… in Figure S2F.</p><p>2. Given that TIAR is a general translational regulators, it is interesting to know how PHAROH specifically regulate the expression of MYC (may not be specific, but the enrichment of MYC binding sequences in the upstream regions of affected genes are extraordinary). I think the clarification of this mechanism may be beyond the scope of this study, but short discussion by these authors will be helpful.</p><p>3. Similarly, there is no discussion from the viewpoint of stoichiometry. Because the authors performed PHAROH FISH (Fig2E) and immunostaining of TIAR (FigS7F), I am curious to know if these signals overlap either in the cytoplasm of nucleus. Additional discussion based on the subcellular localization of PHAROH and TIAR will be required.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this work, the authors attempt to determine how LNC RNAs may be involved in oncogenic progression, in this particular case, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p><p>They find, using several databases, that several LNC RNAs are dysregulated and choose the highest one, in 13% of the cases to investigate in detail for mechanistic correlation with the pathology.

Our qRT-PCR primers are located at the 3’ end of the transcript, and thus it is possible that an aberrant transcription state site is activated in some cells. This seems to be a rather general feature of many different lncRNA knockouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors express PHAROH ectopically in order to rescue cell proliferation and migration defects in PHAROH knockdown cells. How are the levels of this expression controlled? Is this an overexpression of PHAROH in comparison to endogenous levels? Could the authors elaborate more in the interpretation of this data and in the possibility of having other secondary effects due to overexpression. What is the phenotype if the mutant m4 PHAROH is used instead of the wildtype form of PHAROH?</p></disp-quote><p>The rescue is via transient transfection and as such the rescue expression level is higher than the endogenous level of the RNA. We used the m4 mutant in a luciferase assay and Myc blot (Figure 7D, E), however, we did not use it in the rescue assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4C.

The authors overexpress PHAROH and m4 PHAROH to study translation using c-MYC 3'UTR reporter RNA. Could the authors comment what is the interpretation of the results given the presence of endogenous levels of PHAROH in the cells? It would be more appropriated if the authors could use PHAROH knockdown cells (or antisense) for this study. They should consider studying the effect of PHAROH on c-MYC translation without the contribution of endogenous levels that would compete for TIAR binding.</p></disp-quote><p>As compared to the transiently expressed level of <italic>PHAROH</italic>, the endogenous level is low and as such, we expect minimal impact on the assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Due to the clinical relevance of this study, would the authors consider visualizing LINC00862 lncRNA in resection samples from HCC patients by FISH?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point but is currently beyond the scope of this study. However, we have assayed a number of human HCC cell lines for LINC00862 and have included it in Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall the experiments are well designed and results are clear and convincing. I only have a few minor comments regarding the identities of PHAROH and insights into the molecular mechanisms.</p><p>1. While the authors described that there are two isoforms of PHAROH, the statement is not well supported by experimental data. Considering that this is the first paper that characterized the function of PHAROH, more detailed descriptions how they determined the two transcriptional units are required. Northern blot analyses will be the best, but it will be also be helpful to show the mapping patterns of deep sequencing reads together with RACE clones they identified. The annotations shown in Figure S2F is somewhat confusing, which is inconsistent with the annotation shown in Figure 2A. In addition, there are no explanation for the label A, B, C… in Figure S2F.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-seq mapping patterns have been overlaid onto Figure 2A. Explanation for label A, B, C has been added in the Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given that TIAR is a general translational regulators, it is interesting to know how PHAROH specifically regulate the expression of MYC (may not be specific, but the enrichment of MYC binding sequences in the upstream regions of affected genes are extraordinary). I think the clarification of this mechanism may be beyond the scope of this study, but short discussion by these authors will be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>There was a short discussion of how PHAROH can regulate the expression of MYC in the second to last paragraph of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, there is no discussion from the viewpoint of stoichiometry. Because the authors performed PHAROH FISH (Fig2E) and immunostaining of TIAR (FigS7F), I am curious to know if these signals overlap either in the cytoplasm of nucleus. Additional discussion based on the subcellular localization of PHAROH and TIAR will be required.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a brief discussion in the Results section regarding the relative abundances of PHAROH and c-MYC mRNA and the feasibility of a competition model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
