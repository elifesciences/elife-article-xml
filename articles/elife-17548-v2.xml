E2 also has links to genomic instability, and elevated E2 levels are tied to breast cancer. Here, we show that E2 stimulation causes a rapid, global increase in the formation of R-loops, co-transcriptional RNA-DNA products, which in some instances have been linked to DNA damage. We show that E2-dependent R-loop formation and breast cancer rearrangements are highly enriched at E2-responsive genomic loci and that E2 induces DNA replication-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). Strikingly, many DSBs that accumulate in response to E2 are R-loop dependent. Thus, R-loops resulting from the E2 transcriptional response are a significant source of DNA damage. This work reveals a novel mechanism by which E2 stimulation leads to genomic instability and highlights how transcriptional programs play an important role in shaping the genomic landscape of DNA damage susceptibility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17548.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17548.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17548.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The hormone estrogen controls the development of breast tissue. However too much estrogen can damage the DNA in human cells and may be linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. In breast cells, estrogen activates many genes via a process called transcription. The transcription process results in the production of an RNA molecule that contains a copy of the instructions encoded within the gene.</p><p>Previous studies have found that, in certain cases, a new RNA molecule can stick to the matching DNA from which it was made. This creates a structure known as an R-loop, which can lead the DNA to break. DNA breaks are particularly harmful because they can dramatically alter the cell’s genome in ways that allow it to become cancerous. However, it was not clear if the large increase in transcription triggered by estrogen causes an increase in R-loops, which could help to explain the DNA damage that has been reported to occur when cells are treated with estrogen.</p><p>Now, Stork et al. show that treating human breast cancer cells with estrogen causes an increase in R-loops and DNA breaks. The R-loops occurred particularly in regions of the genome that contain estrogen-activated genes. Stork et al. also found that regions of estrogen-activated transcription were more frequently mutated in breast cancers, and further experiments confirmed that the R-loops were responsible for many of the DNA breaks that occurred following estrogen treatment. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the changes in transcription due to estrogen lead to increased R-loops and DNA breaks, which may make the cells vulnerable to becoming cancerous.</p><p>The next challenge is to determine precisely where these DNA breaks that result from estrogen occur on the DNA. Knowing the location of the DNA breaks will be useful in determining what additional factors or genomic features make an R-loop more prone to being broken. This in turn might help explain how the R-loops lead to DNA damage. In addition, further studies are also needed to determine if tumor samples from breast cancer patients also contain increased levels of R-loops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17548.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17548.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>estrogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009634</institution-id><institution>Susan G.

Paradoxically, E2 exposure is also associated with an elevated risk of breast carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yager and Davidson, 2006</xref>). Specifically, higher E2 serum concentrations and longer lifetime E2 exposure are both positively correlated with an increased incidence of sporadic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemons and Goss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colditz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilakivi-Clarke et al., 2002</xref>). Breast cancers exhibit a large number of chromosomal abnormalities, including mutations and copy number alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, E2 leads to DNA damage in breast epithelial cells that express the estrogen receptor (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williamson and Lees-Miller, 2011</xref>), and in rat models, E2 stimulation is causally linked to chromosome instability and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Despite strong links between estrogen and genomic instability, the molecular mechanism by which E2 causes this instability in breast cancer is unclear.</p><p>Functionally, E2 is a key transcriptional regulator that governs the expression of thousands of genes in breast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung and Kraus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hah et al., 2011</xref>) through its association with the nuclear hormone receptors ER-α and ER-β. Upon translocation into the nucleus, the E2-ER complex binds to estrogen-response elements or to other transcription factors, thus altering gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marino et al., 2006</xref>). Among the genes induced by E2 are a number that are important for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, one proposed model to explain E2-induced genome instability is that the uncontrolled proliferation driven by deregulation of genes such as Cyclin D1 causes replication stress and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>). However, another relatively unexplored hypothesis is that the dramatic increase in transcription itself contributes to E2-induced DNA damage.</p><p>Co-transcriptional structures known as R-loops form upon hybridization of nascent RNA with the template DNA strand and are prevalent in mammalian genomes. These structures are proposed to serve regulatory roles in the cell including the patterning of promoter chromatin and the facilitation of transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</xref>). In certain contexts, however, R-loops may serve as precursors for DSBs. The coordinated cleavage of an R-loop at the switch region in B-cells facilitates recombination and generates antibody diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Changes in R-loop levels, moreover, are clearly associated with increased DNA damage and genomic instability. For example, the loss of RNA processing and R-loop regulatory factors results in an increase in R-loops and R-loop-dependent DNA damage in both yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Rubio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huertas and Aguilera, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paulsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tuduri et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, highly transcribed loci may be more prone to R-loop formation. This is evidenced by the enrichment of R-loops at rDNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>) and the binding of the R-loop suppressing factor Npl3 preferentially at the most highly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santos-Pereira et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While many studies have shown that the absence of RNA processing factors can lead to R-loop-dependent DNA damage, little is known about how more physiological changes, such as those induced by hormones or environmental stimuli, may influence R-loop formation and DNA damage in human cells. Dramatic and rapid changes in gene expression could challenge co-transcriptional processing pathways resulting in R-loop formation. Here, we tested whether the formation of R-loops following increased gene expression is a source of E2-induced DNA damage in ER-positive breast epithelial cells. We report that E2 treatment leads to a dramatic increase in R-loops, most strongly at E2-responsive genes. E2-responsive genes, moreover, are enriched in breast cancer rearrangements. We find that E2 treatment also leads to a significant increase in DNA replication- and transcription-dependent DNA damage signaling and DSBs through an R-loop dependent process. Collectively, our data indicate that physiological changes in transcription can drive R-loop formation to promote genomic instability in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>E2 induces transcription and replication-dependent DSBs</title><p>We first sought to characterize the DNA damage that arises in response to E2 stimulation in ER-positive breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williamson and Lees-Miller, 2011</xref>). To do so, we examined phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (P-H2AX), a marker of DNA damage, after treatment of hormone-starved MCF7 cells with different doses of E2. We observed a clear, dose-dependent increase in P-H2AX intensity 24 hr after E2 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). E2 treatment also resulted in an increase in 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), another marker of damaged DNA. Hormone-free culture conditions cause ER-positive cells to withdraw from the cell cycle, and low P-H2AX levels arise during normal DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mirzoeva and Petrini, 2003</xref>). Thus, we asked whether an increase in the percentage of cells in S phase following E2 stimulation could account for the increased P-H2AX signal. Notably, cells treated with 1 or 100 nM E2 had similar cell cycle profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), despite significantly different P-H2AX levels, suggesting that the increase in DNA damage was not due to differences in the S phase population. Importantly, ER-negative MCF10A breast epithelial cells showed no significant change in P-H2AX signal when treated with 100 nM E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3A,B</xref>), consistent with the previous finding that E2-induced DNA damage depends on the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williamson and Lees-Miller, 2011</xref>). We also asked if E2 treatment leads to an increase in DSBs or if the observed changes in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling are induced by some alternative mechanism. The neutral comet assay provided direct evidence that E2 leads to DSB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17548.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Estrogen induces DNA damage and DSBs in a replication-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining for P-H2AX in MCF7 cells treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 nM E2 for 24 hr.

When we examined this early response to E2, we found that the P-H2AX signal resulting from 24 hr of E2 stimulation was significantly greater than the signal resulting from very short (10–40 min) treatments, raising the possibility that the later DNA breaks arise through a different mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Given that a significant portion of cells would have entered S-phase by the 24-hr time point, we asked whether DNA replication was associated with E2-induced damage by pulsing cells with EdU at various times after E2 addition and monitoring H2AX phosphorylation. The percentage of P-H2AX positive cells increased dramatically after 16 and 24 hr, and the majority of these cells were EdU positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 F,G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This finding strongly suggests that E2-induced DNA damage may require DNA replication. Indeed, when we treated E2-stimulated cells with a Cdc7 inhibitor (PHA 767491) that largely blocks S phase entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>), we found that the DNA damage was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). At the 1 μM dose of PHA 767491 used, phosphorylation of RNA Pol II at Ser2 by Cdk9 was not inhibited, indicating the effect on P-H2AX is not a result of inhibiting RNA Pol II elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). We also asked if the late phase of E2-induced DNA damage is affected by blocking transcription coincident with S-phase entry. Treatment with the transcription inhibitor flavopiridol abolished the late E2-induced increase in P-H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) but did not significantly affect the percentage of cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).

These times were chosen to assess R-loop formation prior to and/or concurrent with E2-transcriptional induction and DNA damage. In mock-treated MCF7 cells, we observed 17,445 DRIP peaks across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), a number in line with the previous DRIP-seq experiments performed in human Ntera2 cells and primary human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, however, in cells treated with E2 we observed a dramatic increase in DRIP peaks, with 33,458 or 24,781 peaks at 2 or 24 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">3</xref>). DRIP peaks from mock-treated cells covered 49.0 Mb of genome space, while those from E2-treated cells for 2 hr or 24 hr covered 81.9 MB and 63.2 Mb of genome space, respectively. Importantly, the vast majority of peaks were abolished by RNase H treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the RNA-DNA hybrids identified exhibit known R-loop features. Indeed, DRIP peaks were enriched at promoters, 5’ gene regions and sites of transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with their published distribution and roles at these regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014</xref>).

Taken together, these observations suggest that E2 treatment is associated with a dramatic induction of R-loops at new genomic sites.</p><p>To further explore the effects of E2 on R-loop formation, we sought to identify the genomic regions in which DRIP signal was induced at 2 and 24 hr by differential peak calling. Using triplicate data for each condition, we combined all DRIP-positive regions in at least one sample with a set of similarly-sized intervals with no significant enrichment and performed the differential analysis. Differential peaks were only identified if they showed a significant change upon E2 induction in each biological replicate. Analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids induced after E2 treatment revealed a dramatic increase throughout the genome, with 8,023 and 3,263 peaks significantly induced at 2 hr or 24 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2C — source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). Of those hybrids induced at 24 hr, ~60% were also significantly induced at 2 hr, suggesting that the E2 treatment can result in a sustained increase in R-loop formation at many loci. Loci that showed a robust increase following E2 addition include XBP1, CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and SLC7A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), all targets of E2-transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honkela et al., 2015</xref>). We validated our DRIP-seq data at several loci using DRIP-qPCR. A dose-dependent increase in DRIP signal was observed upon both 10 nM and 100 nM E2 treatment at several E2-transcription targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), while two genomic regions (MLKL and 83/84) devoid of DRIP peaks showed no change.</p><p>Using GREAT, a bioinformatic tool that annotates ontologies for cis-regulatory regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLean et al., 2010</xref>), we next asked whether there was a common signature among these E2-induced RNA-DNA hybrids. We found a dramatic enrichment of R-loops in E2-transcriptionally responsive genes at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, red highlighting). These data clearly demonstrate that the induction of R-loops by E2 is a robust response that occurs quickly at E2-responsive genes, and persists at a subset of these genes. Taken together with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, these data also demonstrate that R-loop formation occurs prior to the onset of DNA damage, and in cells that have not yet entered S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To systematically investigate the relationship between E2-responsiveness and R-loop induction, we also correlated DRIP signal enrichment with changes in expression level upon E2 stimulation. We focused on transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase by using publically available global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) data from samples prepared under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hah et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). A modest correlation between the induction of DRIP signal and the induction of expression was observed, consistent with the requirement for transcription in R-loop formation. Although the majority of induced DRIP peaks were found in E2-responsive genes (red highlighting), some were also induced at sites that were not E2-responsive or that were negatively regulated by E2 (blue highlighting). Both sets of hybrid-forming sequences exhibit GC skew and enhanced G-quadruplex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2A,B</xref>). We also found no meaningful correlation between DRIP signal enrichment and overall expression level as measured by publically available RNA-seq data from similarly paired conditions. This finding indicates that DRIP peaks do not form only on highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We conclude that R-loop induction by E2 is correlated with E2-induced transcription, but that expression level is not the sole determinant of R-loop formation and other secondary structures or sequence elements may contribute.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Breast cancer rearrangements are enriched in E2-responsive genes</title><p>Because E2-induced R-loops are strongly enriched in E2-transcriptionally responsive genes, we wondered if estrogen-responsive loci are also more prone to mutation in breast cancer.

To address this, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) using the S9.6 and P-H2AX antibodies to visualize interactions between RNA-DNA hybrids and phosphorylated H2AX. Notably, the percentage of cells that contain at least one PLA focus in the nucleus increased approximately 2-fold following E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The relatively small number of detectable interactions between the RNA-DNA hybrid and P-H2AX antibodies upon E2 addition may indicate that the majority of DNA damage occurs at a distance from the R-loop that is outside the limits of PLA detection (&lt;30–40 nM). In order to confirm the interaction between R-loops and P-H2AX, we used the S9.6 antibody to precipitate RNA-DNA hybrids from cross-linked E2-treated cells. We found that that both P-H2AX and another DDR target, P-KAP1, interacted with RNA-DNA hybrid containing chromatin fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

If R-loops cause E2-induced DNA damage, expression of RNase H should abrogate DSB formation. We tested this idea by monitoring P-H2AX levels in an MCF7 cell line stably expressing a doxycycline-inducible, Flag-tagged RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Strikingly, we observed a dramatic and dose-dependent reduction in P-H2AX intensity and foci formation upon increasing RNase H expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar results were observed in two additional independent stable cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2A,B</xref>). Importantly, expression of RNase H did not alter E2-driven cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), nor did it reduce global levels of transcription, as measured by EU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4A,B</xref>). Thus, the decreased P-H2AX signal is not a result of reduced transcription or a defect in cell cycle progression. Finally, we found that RNase H expression resulted in a significant decrease in DSBs upon E2 stimulation, as measured by the neutral comet assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). These findings clearly demonstrate that RNA-DNA hybrids are needed to form E2-induced DSBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NER factors are required for E2-induced DSB formation</title><p>We recently showed that R-loop-mediated DSB formation depends on factors specifically involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), but not factors specifically involved in global genome NER (GG-NER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>). In these studies, R-loops were induced by the knockdown of RNA processing genes and/or splicing factors. To ask if the DNA damage resulting from E2-induced co-transcriptional R-loop formation arises by a similar mechanism, we assessed whether knockdown of NER factors altered the DDR following E2. Strikingly, we found that P-H2AX levels were significantly reduced following knockdown of XPG, an endonuclease involved in both forms NER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). XPG knockdown also dramatically reduced the comet tail moment that forms in response to E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), signifying a significant reduction in E2-mediated DSBs. Importantly, we also found that knockdown of the TC-NER specific factor Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) significantly reduced P-H2AX levels induced by E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of XPC, a lesion-recognition factor specifically involved in GG-NER, caused little change in P-H2AX levels after E2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These findings suggest that R-loops induced by E2 are processed by TC-NER factors.

Accordingly, several mechanisms for E2-induced DNA damage have been elucidated. For example, TopoIIβ and APOBEC3B cause the rapid and transient formation of DNA damage in a process necessary for E2-induced transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Periyasamy et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, E2 metabolites can cause oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavigne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yager, 2014</xref>). Here, we report the first R-loop-dependent mechanism of E2-induced DNA damage. Specifically, we show that R-loops induced by E2 treatment in ER-positive breast cancer cells lead to DSB formation in the vicinity of the R-loop. Our findings suggest that increased transcription due to a physiologically relevant stimulus may result in R-loop-mediated genomic instability.</p><p>Intriguingly, the R-loop-dependent DNA damage we observe requires the initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>). Although E2 causes a dramatic increase in R-loops after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), no significant change in DNA damage is observed at that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, although R-loops are present, they do not cause DNA damage until S phase entry. Consistent with this finding, R-loop-dependent DNA damage has been previously associated with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Houlard et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a few common fragile sites correspond to late-replicating, long genes where R-loops form, and early-replicating fragile sites are associated with highly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helmrich et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that genes that are highly transcribed or R-loop prone may pose the greatest challenge to genome integrity when they meet the replication fork. Interestingly, we find that TC-NER factors are also involved in generating the replication-associated DNA damage observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This raises the possibility that these factors may be acting in a non-canonical manner in S phase, and there are several possible mechanisms by which their activity may be coordinated with replication activities that have been previously discussed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we find that R-loops are induced predominantly at E2-responsive genes (p&lt;10<sup>−233</sup>). In agreement with this, we see a correlation between the induction of expression by E2, as measured by GRO-seq, and the induction of R-loops by E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The modest strength of the correlation likely indicates that factors distinct from the transcription status play an important role in dictating R-loop formation. Interestingly, a small subset of genomic regions exist that show a significant increase in R-loops despite no increase in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, blue highlighting). Similarly, RPL13A, the expression of which is unaffected by E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah and Faridi, 2011</xref>), showed a significant increase in R-loops upon E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). One possibility is that upon a burst in transcription, the cell’s normal splicing and R-loop modulating factors initially become saturated. Thus, some loci that are prone to form R-loops may accumulate these structures and become vulnerable to DNA damage, regardless of their response to the transcription stimulus.</p><p>We also observe that breast cancer rearrangements, but not simple somatic mutations, are significantly enriched in E2-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Both structural variants and translocations have been suggested to occur due to erroneous repair of a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasparek and Humphrey, 2011</xref>) and these mutation types have been shown to be more prevalent in breast tumors relative to other tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, some cancer-associated genes are found among genes forming E2-induced R-loops. For example, we observed a dramatic increase in R-loops at Cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is amplified in up to 20% of breast cancers, the majority of which are ER-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Papanikolaou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osborne et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, E2 induces robust R-loop formation at ZNF703. This locus has been implicated in driving oncogenesis in luminal B breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sircoulomb et al., 2011</xref>). Both Cyclin D1 and ZNF703 were among the genes identified as breast cancer drivers, as were an additional 27 genes with E2-induced R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nik-Zainal et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that E2-induced R-loop formation could lead to DNA damage and genome instability at some of these and other R-loop prone loci. Intriguingly, testosterone (DHT) stimulation in prostate cells has been shown to lead to DSBs and recurrent translocations at androgen-receptor (AR) target loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haffner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). While these breaks are TOP2B-dependent and necessary for the induction of transcription, DHT may also induce DNA damage in an R-loop and replication dependent manner. Notably, in prostate cancer, recurrent rearrangements are frequently observed at androgen-receptor (AR) target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings have uncovered a role for R-loops in E2-induced DNA damage and reveal a new mechanism by which genome instability may arise in ER-responsive breast cancer cells. Notably, transcription factor responses vary between cell types and following different physiological and environment stimuli. Thus, the induction of potentially toxic R-loops at sites of induced transcription may offer insight into the tissue-specific DNA damage and mutation patterns observed in some cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF7 cells were obtained from ATCC (HTB-22, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0031">CVCL_0031</ext-link>), where they were authenticated by STR profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma.

An interval file of restriction fragments for the enzyme cocktail used in DRIP was obtained by verbose search of restriction site sequences with bowtie. Aligned reads with Q score over 10 were counted over the intervals separated by restriction enzyme cut sites using bedtools. Intervals with lower coverage (less than 10 counts per interval in any sample) were removed from the data set. Regions enriched over background were discovered with DESeq2. To perform differential analysis using triplicate data, we combined the set of regions with positive DRIP signal in at least one condition, together with the matched set of negative intervals and performed differential analysis with DESeq2. Read counts were normalized to the total number of mapped reads. To perform analysis of functional term enrichment, we ran GREAT analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) on sets of differential DRIP regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Expression correlation analysis</title><p>RNA-seq data from GEO, accession number GSE62789, was obtained from MCF7 cells that were hormone starved and treated with 0 nM E2 or 10 nM E2 for 160 min (used to match 2 hr DRIP) or 1280 min (used to match 24 hr DRIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honkela et al., 2015</xref>).

Similarly, for the structural variant data, genes were included on the list if they had at least one structural variant in any patient sample. For each mutation data set, a background data set made up of genes with similar replication timing and expression was used. Expression was defined as the average expression from the mock, 160 min E2-treated and 1280 min E2-treated RNA-seq samples. Replication timing was determined from the mean wavelet smoothed RepliSeq signal across each gene body, using ENCODE MCF7 RepliSeq data (accession number wgEncodeEH002247).

The raw numbers of simple somatic mutation events were counted over each gene in the RNA-seq dataset, and the counts were normalized to the length of the gene in kilobases as defined by the UCSC gene associated with the gene symbol.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrés Aguilera as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andre Nussenzweig (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors observe that MCF-7 cells display increases in DNA damage after exposure to prolonged periods of estrogen. This DNA damage is demonstrated by the appearance of P-H2AX, 53BP1 foci, and increased tail moment by neutral comet assay, suggesting these are DNA DSBs. The DNA damage is dependent on both transcription and DNA replication. The significance of the manuscript centers around the idea that DNA DSBs are dependent on R-loops formed by estrogen receptor-mediated transcription, which may saturate co-transcriptional machinery. The work describes that R-loops are formed after estrogen induction, showing convincingly that TC-NER machinery is required for P-H2AX and DSB formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The demonstration that H2AX is phosphorylated near R-loops using a proximity-ligation assay (PLA) does not seem to be entirely convincing. The PLA signal is mostly restricted to one focus, which is quite reminiscent of the single DNA damage response focus that can be detected in these cells with 53BP1 or pH2AX antibodies. It would be important therefore to try to complement with new information probing the proximity of R loops to DNA breaks. Since it seems that using the PLA assay most of the time only one S9.6-P-H2AX foci is observed, this could mean that not all P-H2AX foci originate (directly) from a R-loop, or that H2AX is phosphorylated at different genomic loci than where R-loops are formed. This can be tested by P-H2AX ChIP-qPCR after E2 induction on the E2 responsive genes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> upon E2 induction. Alternatively, or additionally, you could explore whether genomic rearrangements occurring in ER positive tumors are enriched at ER target sites. The recent Nature paper (Nik-Zainal S et al. 2016) cataloging all genomic rearrangements in more than 500 breast cancers allows this analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17548.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The demonstration that H2AX is phosphorylated near R-loops using a proximity-ligation assay (PLA) does not seem to be entirely convincing.

Although this could indicate that the DNA damage and R-loops do not coincide and breaks arise indirectly from R-loops, there are other interpretations as well. For example, one possibility, as the reviewers suggest, is that the H2AX is phosphorylated at loci far enough downstream of where the R-loop forms such that the distance falls outside of a detectable interaction for the PLA assay. As RNA-DNA hybrids are not expected to bind nucleosomes (Dunn and Griffith, 1980), this is quite feasible and may limit the sensitivity of this assay. We have included a sentence in the main text of the Results where we address this possibility: “The relatively small number of detectable interactions between the RNA-DNA hybrid and P-H2AX antibodies upon E2 addition may indicate that the majority of DNA damage occurs at a distance from the R-loop that is outside the limits of PLA detection (&lt;30-40 nM)” Nevertheless, we do recognize that this leads to questions about the proximity of DNA damage and R-loops, and we try to address this issue as explained below.</p><p><italic>This can be tested by P-H2AX ChIP-qPCR after E2 induction on the E2 responsive genes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> upon E2 induction.

For this analysis, we defined ER target sites as regions of the genome that are transcriptionally responsive to estrogen (E2) as measured by RNA-seq, since ER binding can occur at sites distant from the transcriptional response. As suggested, we utilized the rearrangement data from the whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers from Nik-Zainal et al., 2016. We took into account mutations from both ER-positive and ER-negative breast tumors because precursor cells can express high levels of the ER at some point during development (Allred et al., 2004) and therefore could be affected by E2 signaling. Notably, we see that E2-responsive regions are significantly enriched among both breast cancer structural variants and translocations (p&lt;1.0 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). Interestingly, not all mutation types are enriched in E2-responsive genes, as we do not see an enrichment of the simple somatic mutations such as substitutions and indels in E2-responsive genes. We have now included these data as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and describe the results in the subsection “Breast cancer rearrangements are enriched in E2-responsive genes”. To ensure that the enrichment we observe is not biased by the gene expression level or replication timing, the latter of which significantly affects mutation frequency (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009), we used background models that match the expression level and replication timing of the genes within each mutation dataset, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>. We believe that this data strongly supports the notion that E2-responsive regions of the genome are more frequently rearranged in breast cancer.</p><p>We have also expended considerable effort to map P-H2AX in response to E2 by ChIP. However, we have not been able to detect a clear, reproducible increase in ChIP signal upon E2 treatment relative to signal from regions of the genome that do not contain R-loops. Given the potential for megabase-scale spreading of P-H2AX, it is challenging to determine if the increase in signal in non-R-loop regions is due to P-H2AX spreading or poor signal-to-noise. It is also possible we have not chosen the appropriate sites, since we do not expect that double-strand breaks will form at each R-loop in each cell. We have tried performing genome-wide P-H2AX ChIP-seq to help differentiate between these possibilities, but did not detect significant enrichment. We believe that a more sensitive method of double-strand break mapping may be required to definitely map site-specific damage, as the lack of enrichment is an issue with the P-H2AX ChIP approach. Even under ideal conditions when a double-strand break is induced in all cells with the restriction endonuclease AsiSI (Aymard et al., 2014; Iacovoni et al., 2010), we observe enrichment for P-H2AX is 1.8 fold at best.</p><p>References</p><p>Allred, D.C., Brown, P., and Medina, D.
