Those effectors direct the biogenesis of the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) that permits its intracellular survival and replication. It has long been documented that the LCV is associated with mitochondria and a number of Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to target to this organelle. Yet, the biochemical function and host cell target of most of these effectors remain unknown. Here, we found that the Dot/Icm substrate Ceg3 (Lpg0080) is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that localizes to the mitochondria in host cells where it attacks ADP/ATP translocases by ADP-ribosylation, and blunts their ADP/ATP exchange activity. The modification occurs on the second arginine residue in the -RRRMMM- element, which is conserved among all known ADP/ATP carriers from different organisms.

This bacterium exists ubiquitously in the environment as a parasite of freshwater amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richards et al., 2013</xref>). Infection of humans occurs when susceptible individuals inhale aerosol contaminated by bacteria and introduce the pathogen to the lungs where it is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Instead of being digested, engulfed bacteria survive and replicate in macrophages, leading to tissue damage and strong inflammatory responses, and the development of disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newton et al., 2010</xref>). The cell biological characteristics of infected amoebae and mammalian cells are highly similar, both are featured by the formation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like phagosome called the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV), which in the initial phase of infection, bypasses the endocytic pathways of the phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Isberg et al., 2009</xref>). The biogenesis of the LCV requires the Dot/Icm system, which is arguably the most important pathogenic factor of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hubber and Roy, 2010</xref>). Mutations in any component gene essential for the function of the Dot/Icm transporter result in a complete loss of virulence on all hosts. This multicomponent machine injects more than 330 virulence factors known as effectors into host cells to construct the LCV by manipulating diverse cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, autophagy, lipid metabolism, and cytoskeleton structure via distinct biochemical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qiu and Luo, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A common mechanism utilized by bacterial effectors is to function as enzymes that attack specific host proteins involved in important cellular processes by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salomon and Orth, 2013</xref>), including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Machner, 2018</xref>), AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2010</xref>), phosphorylcholination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), and ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2021</xref>). Among these, ADP-ribosylation is one of the first identified PTMs utilized by toxins from bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind et al., 2015</xref>); this modification is catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) that transfer the ADP-ribose moiety from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to target substrates via an <italic>N</italic>-, <italic>O</italic>-, or <italic>S</italic>-glycosidic linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Chang, 2018</xref>). Depending on the property of the enzymes, the modification can be the addition of either one (mono) or more (poly) ADP-ribosyl moieties onto the recipient site of the target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hottiger et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to virulence factors from bacterial pathogens, ARTs have been identified in eukaryotic proteins, which regulate such important cellular processes as DNA damage repair, gene expression, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palazzo et al., 2017</xref>). Differing from ARTs of bacterial origins, which often are mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (mARTs), many mammalian enzymes are poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that induce the formation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR) chains on substrate molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hottiger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial toxin-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation attacks a wide spectrum of host functions to benefit the pathogens. Some of the best studied examples include the inhibition of host protein synthesis by the diphtheria toxin that modifies elongation factor 2 (EF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honjo et al., 1968</xref>) and the interference of the host second messenger cAMP production by the cholera toxin, which ADP-ribosylates the Gαs subunit of the adenylate cyclase and locks the enzyme in an active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassel and Pfeuffer, 1978</xref>). A number of virulence factors injected into host cells by specialized protein secretion systems also use ADP-ribosylation to modulate host functions. For example, the type III effector ExoS of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> targets multiple cellular proteins, including Ras, the modification of which leads to the inhibition of ROS production by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vareechon et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2019</xref> found that the T3SS effector SopF from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium attacks the ATP6V0C subunit of v-ATPase by ADP-ribosylation, thus blocking the recruitment of ATG16L1 to suppress autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). ADP-ribosylation of important signaling molecules such as ubiquitin has also been documented. One such example is CteC from <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic>, which specifically modifies ubiquitin on Thr66 with a cryptic mART motif to disrupt host ubiquitin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Modification by mono-ADP-ribosylation has recently emerged as an important arsenal for <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> virulence. The effector Lpg0181 was found to inactivate the glutamate dehydrogenase in host cells using an mART activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2021</xref>). Members of the SidE effector family catalyze ubiquitination of multiple host proteins by first activating ubiquitin via ADP-ribosylation on Arg42 with an mART activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). The activated ubiquitin (ADPR-Ub) is then utilized by a phosphodiesterase activity embedded in the same proteins to catalyze the transfer of phosphoribosyl ubiquitin to serine residues of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we show that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector Ceg3 (Lpg0080) localizes to the mitochondrion where it targets carrier proteins of the ADP/ATP translocase family by ADP-ribosylation, leading to the inhibition of the ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria. Our results add further weight to the modulation of energy metabolism as a virulence mechanism for a bacterial pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector Ceg3 is a putative mART that localizes to the mitochondrion</title><p>A number of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors have been found to use mART activity to modulate host functions ranging from metabolism to ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2021</xref>). To identify additional effectors with potential mART activity, we used the HHpred algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Söding et al., 2005</xref>) to analyze established Dot/Icm substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>). These efforts identified Ceg3 (Lpg0080), a 255-residue protein as a putative mART. The key residues in the predicted mART of Ceg3 are identical to those of bacterial toxins or effector proteins, including ExoS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vareechon et al., 2017</xref>), CtxA of <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassel and Pfeuffer, 1978</xref>), and members of the SidE family of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). The sequence of the predicted mART in Ceg3 is R<sub>44</sub>-S<sub>94</sub>-E<sub>141</sub>KE<sub>143,</sub> which resides in its central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ceg3 is a mitochondria-associated effector that inhibits yeast growth by a putative mART activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the central region of Ceg3 with three bacterial proteins of mART activity.

(<bold>B</bold>) The predicted mART motif is critical for Ceg3-mediated yeast toxicity. Serially diluted yeast cells expressing Ceg3 or Ceg3<sub>E/A</sub> from a galactose-inducible promotor were spotted on the indicated media for 3 days before image acquisition. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. (<bold>C</bold>) Ceg3 co-localizes with a mitochondrial marker. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids that direct the expression of Flag-Ceg3 for 18 hr and then incubated with fresh cell medium containing Mitotracker Red for 30 min. Cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies specific for Flag (green). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 μm. The colocalization of Ceg3 with mitochondria was quantitated by Pearson correlation coefficient with ImageJ. (<bold>D</bold>) Flag-Ceg3 localized to the mitochondria detected by Immunogold labeling.

(<bold>F</bold>) Ceg3 translocated into host cells by the Dot/Icm system is targeted to mitochondria in cells infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. HEK293T cells expressing the FcγII receptor were infected with opsonized bacteria expressing 5xFlag-Ceg3 at an MOI of 100 for 2 hr. Lysates of isolated mitochondria were subjected to immunoprecipitation with beads coated with the Flag antibody, precipitates resolved by SDS-PAGE were detected by the Flag-specific antibody (top). The quality of cell fractionation was evaluated by detecting PDHA1 and tubulin. A cytosolic fraction sample was included as an additional control (middle). The expression of Ceg3 in bacteria was detected with the Flag antibody, and ICDH was probed as a loading control (bottom). (<bold>G</bold>) Ceg3 is an integral mitochondrial membrane protein. Mitochondria isolated from HEK293T cells expressing HA-Ceg3 were subjected to extraction with 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (pH 11) for 30 min. Relevant proteins in soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions separated by centrifugation were probed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. MOI, multiplicity of infection.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73611-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Ceg3 was first identified as a Dot/Icm substrate by virtue of being coregulated with known effector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zusman et al., 2007</xref>) and was later shown to kill the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> upon ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urbanus et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether the putative mART motif plays a role in its yeast toxicity, we constructed the Ceg3<sub>E/A</sub> mutant in which both of the predicted catalytic sites E141 and E143 were replaced with alanine. Compared to wild-type protein that severely inhibited yeast growth, Ceg3<sub>E/A</sub> has completely lost the toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggest that the putative mART motif is critical for the activity of Ceg3.</p><p>To understand the function of Ceg3, we first determined its cellular localization. Results from pilot experiments indicated that the distribution of Flag-Ceg3 is not cytosolic. Further experiments using a mitotracker reagent revealed that Ceg3 colocalizes extensively with this mitochondrial marker with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient value of 0.87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that Ceg3 localizes to the mitochondria. Similarly, immunogold labeling results using transmission electron microscopy showed that Flag-Ceg3 was associated with the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, Ceg3 likely is targeted to the mitochondria.</p><p>We further analyzed the subcellular localization of Ceg3 by cell fractionation. Cells transfected to express Flag-Ceg3 or Flag-MavC were mechanically lysed and the mitochondrial fractions were obtained by centrifugation as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Samples from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Flag and resident proteins of the relevant organelles, respectively. Flag-Ceg3 co-fractionated with the subunit α1 of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 (PDHA1), which is an established mitochondrial protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Børglum et al., 1997</xref>). In agreement with results from immunostaining experiments, Flag-Ceg3 did not co-fractionate with Calnexin or GM130, markers for the ER and the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, Flag-MavC co-fractionated with the cytosolic protein tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results corroborate well with the immunostaining data, further indicating mitochondrial localization of Ceg3. Finally, we detected Ceg3 in mitochondrial fractions of cells infected with a wild-type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain overexpressing Flag-tagged Ceg3 but not with a mutant defective in the Dot/Icm transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that Ceg3 is targeted to mitochondria once being injected into host cells.</p><p>The association of Ceg3 with mitochondria can be mediated either by binding to mitochondrial proteins or by integrating into its membranes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we treated mitochondria isolated from cell expressing HA-Ceg3 with a high pH buffer (0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 11) and separated integral and peripheral membrane proteins by centrifugation. Two peripheral membrane proteins, cytochrome c (Cyto-C) and the beta subunit of ATP synthase (ATPB) that are associated with inner mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walker and Dickson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garrido et al., 2006</xref>), can be stripped from the mitochondria effectively by the high pH buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, HA-Ceg3 was only detected in the pellet fraction together with the mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20 homolog (Tom20) and the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1), two integral mitochondrial membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiller et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Ceg3 is not peripherally associated with mitochondrial membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ADP/ATP translocases (ANTs) are the cellular targets of Ceg3</title><p>To identify the cellular targets of Ceg3, we first determined its ability to induce ADP-ribosylation of host proteins upon transfection. To this end, we used a pan-ADP-ribose antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2020</xref>) to detect ADP-ribosylated proteins in cell transfected to express Ceg3 or the Ceg3<sub>E/A</sub> mutant. Signals representing proteins of slightly larger than 25 kDa were detected in lysates of cells expressing Ceg3 but not in samples expressing Ceg3<sub>E/A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left and middle panels). Probing these samples with antibodies specific for Flag and ADP-ribose simultaneously detected two proteins of distinct sizes in samples expressing Flag-Ceg3, indicating that the protein detected by the ADP-ribose antibody was not self-modified Flag-Ceg3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel).

We thus replaced Val227 and Arg237 with Lys in order to generate peptides of sizes more suitable for detection upon Lys-C digestion.

Thus, Ceg3 does not suppress or augment CCCP-induced mitophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In addition to powering most cellular activities by ATP production, mitochondria are involved in diverse functions such as cell death, immunity, and metabolism regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McBride et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, this organelle is a common target for infectious agents that actively manipulate host cellular processes for their survival and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lobet et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the <italic>V. cholera</italic> T3SS effector VopE inhibits the activity of Miro1 and Miro2, two mitochondrial GTPases, by functioning as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), thus suppressing host innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). The effector ECH0825 from <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> upregulates the mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase to prevent ROS-induced cellular damage and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Earlier cell biological studies suggest that mitochondrion plays important roles in the intracellular life cycle of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. The association of the LCV with mitochondria was documented in morphological analysis of its infection cycle within several years after the bacterium was recognized as a pathogen. At least 30% of LCVs were surrounded by mitochondria within 15 min of phagocytosis, which increases to approximately 65% when the infection proceeds to 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horwitz, 1983</xref>). This observation was validated by more recent studies, which reveal that such association requires the Dot/Icm transporter essential for <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tilney et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>A number of Dot/Icm effectors have been demonstrated to modulate the function of mitochondria. Among these, LegS2, a homolog of the eukaryotic enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate lyse, contributes to autophagy inhibition by disrupting lipid metabolism in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Degtyar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). MitF appears to modulate mitochondrial dynamics by provoking a Warburg-like effect to benefit intracellular bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escoll et al., 2017</xref>). Our results here demonstrate that Ceg3 specifically localizes to mitochondria where it modifies members of the ADP/ATP translocase by mono-ADP-ribosylation, leading to inhibition of ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria.</p><p>ADP-ribosylation of ANTs induced by Ceg3 is readily detectable in yeast and mammalian cells that are ectopically expressing the effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). Due to technical barriers to obtain soluble recombinant Ceg3, we were unable to establish a reaction with purified proteins to show Ceg3-induced ADP-ribosylation of ANTs. The fact that such modification occurs when Ceg3 and ANT1 were co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> indicates that no host cell co-factor is required for its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The detection of ANT modification in cells infected with wild-type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> further validates these translocases as its bona fide substrates.</p><p>The ADP-ribosylation site on ANT1 induced by Ceg3 is Arg236, which is the second Arg residue in the -RRRMMM- element conserved in not only all four ADP/ATP translocases of mammalian origin, but also all known ADP/ATP carriers from different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Körver-Keularts et al., 2015</xref>). The three arginine residues in the -RRRMMM- motif are essential for the transport function of the yeast ADP/ATP carrier Aac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 1993</xref>). Mutations in each of these three arginine residues in the bovine ADP/ATP carrier abolish its transport activity, so does a mutation in Arg246 (equivalent to Arg236 in mammalian ANT1) of the mitochondrial carrier from <italic>Thermothelomyces thermophile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruprecht et al., 2019</xref>). These observations are consistent with our results that ADP-ribosylation of one of these three sites ablates its ADP/ATP transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Moreover, our finding that Ceg3 does not interfere with mitophagy is in line with a previous study showing that the ADP/ATP translocase-associated mitophagy is independent of its nucleotide translocase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoshino et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Structure of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier shows that Arg236 of ANT1 is localized in the end of the fifth transmembrane helix, which is in close proximity to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>). In the Aac2 carrier from yeast, the -RRRMMM- element appears to be in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruprecht et al., 2014</xref>). Although the positioning of the -RRRMMM- element revealed by these two structural analyses slightly differs, both studies conclude that the second arginine is implicated in ADP binding via its positively charged side chain that mediates electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate moieties in ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruprecht et al., 2014</xref>). At neutral pH, ADP-ribose harbors two negatively charged phosphate moieties, which can cause a notable change in the charge property of the side chain of this arginine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laing et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, Ceg3-mediated ADP-ribosylation on ANTs likely affects the electrostatic interactions with ADP. In addition, the bulky ADPR moiety on ANTs may cause steric interference for the interaction, both of which can contribute to the inhibition of their ADP/ATP exchange ability.</p><p>The Dot/Icm effector LncP, which is homologous to mitochondrial carrier proteins, has been suggested to carry out unidirectional ATP transport across membranes reconstituted in liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolezal et al., 2012</xref>). Although the possibility that Ceg3 coordinates its activity with LncP in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infected cells needs further investigation, it is conceivable that the bacterium can gain better control of ATP transport in the mitochondria if it uses one set of effectors to inhibit the endogenous carriers and another set to substitute this function. The number of Dot/Icm effectors that function to modulate mitochondrial activity seems large. An earlier study found that Lpg1625 and Lpg0898 are targeting to this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Lpg2444 was recently shown to protect the integrity of mitochondria by making it resistant to MMP damage caused by protonophores such as CCCP. This protein also interacts with ADP/ATP translocase 2, but the biological significance of such interactions remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noack et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, although these effectors clearly are targeted to the mitochondria, none of them harbors a discernable canonical mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) or mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) found in eukaryotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Habib et al., 2007</xref>). Future study aiming at biochemical analysis of these proteins, their cellular substrates, and mechanism of organelle targeting will shed light on the roles of mitochondria in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> virulence as well as the mechanism of how the diverse activities of this organelle are regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media, bacteria strains, plasmid construction, and cell lines</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown on LB agar plates or in LB broth.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hayley Newton (Reviewer #1); Elizabeth Hartland (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Improve the localization of Ceg3 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Co-localisation experiments with mitochondrial markers in Figure 1C and 2E should include imaging quantification e.g. Pearson's coefficient. It is also important to validate the mitochondrial localisation of Ceg3 that is secreted through the T4SS, can the authors detect FLAG-Ceg3 at mitochondria during infection (with L. pneumophila pCeg3 that was used in Figure 4)?</p><p>2. Figure 4C is missing a dceg3 control and immunoblotting for the total amount of ANT.</p><p>3. The timing of the detected modification of ANT should be discussed considering the divergence between Figure 4 and Figure 5: the infection data presented in 5D is done at 2h post-infection where ANT modification is not detected during WT infection (Figure 4A). Adding a sample of uninfected cells in 5D is needed to interpret the results better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Fu et al., demonstrates that the Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm effector protein Ceg3 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that appears to be recruited to host cell mitochondria. Here Ceg3 is able to specifically ADP-ribosylate ADP/ATP translocases on the second arginine of the -RRRMMM- motif. This modification appears to render ADP/ATP translocases unable to exchange ADP/ATP across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The implications of this disruption to normal mitochondria function is not explored.</p><p>The biochemical characterisation of Ceg3 activity is a strength of this manuscript. In particularly the use of mass spectrometry to identify the site of ANT modification, demonstration that all four human ANT isoforms are modified by Ceg3 and the ability to link this Ceg3 function with previous observations about the impact Ceg3 has on Saccharamyces cerevisiae growth. The study also has enticing data regarding the temporal dynamics of ANT modification which may aid in clarifying both the role and impact this modification has during the context of infection. Further investigation into this aspect of this research will be of significant value to researchers in the host-pathogen interaction field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript identifies the Dot/Icm effector, Ceg3, from Legionella pneumophila as an ADP-ribosyltransferase that traffics to mitochondria in infected cells. The authors convincingly show that Ceg3 modifies the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers, which are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and interferes with ADP/ATP exchange.</p><p>The manuscript presents strong biochemistry supporting the authors' claims but improved microscopy is needed to support the mitochondrial location of Ceg3, and preferably its trafficking to the mitochondrial inner membrane. I think this work will be of interest to the broader research field studying mitochondrial biology and intracellular infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73611.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The modification of ANTs is undetectable at 2h psi in samples using the wild-type Lp02 infection (Figure 4A and 4C), which is consistent with the results that WT infection doesn’t detectably affect the ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria (Figure 5D). The strain that could detectably inhibit the ADP/ATP exchange activity of mitochondria is strain ∆<italic>ceg3</italic>(pCeg3), which overexpresses Ceg3 from a multicopy plasmid (Figure 5D). Infection by this strain allowed us to detect ADP-ribosylation of ANTs at the 2h infection time point (Figure 4A). Taken together, these results indicate that ANTs modification and ADP/ATP exchange inhibition occur concurrently, which suggests that the results in Figure 4 and Figure 5 are consistent.</p><p>References:</p><p>Rolando, M., Escoll, P., Nora, T., Botti, J., Boitez, V., Bedia, C., Daniels, C., Abraham, G., Stogios, P.J., Skarina, T., et al.
