Its clinical management remains a challenge as the underlying mechanisms leading to it are still unclear. Here, we report that significantly increased numbers of senescent osteoclasts (SnOCs) are observed in mouse models of spinal hypersensitivity, like lumbar spine instability (LSI) or aging, compared to controls. The larger population of SnOCs is associated with induced sensory nerve innervation, as well as the growth of H-type vessels, in the porous endplate. We show that deletion of senescent cells by administration of the senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT263) results in significantly less spinal hypersensitivity, spinal degeneration, porosity of the endplate, sensory nerve innervation, and H-type vessel growth in the endplate. We also show that there is significantly increased SnOC-mediated secretion of Netrin-1 and NGF, two well-established sensory nerve growth factors, compared to non-senescent OCs. These findings suggest that pharmacological elimination of SnOCs may be a potent therapy to treat spinal pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>low back pain</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>sensory nerve</kwd><kwd>endplate</kwd><kwd>H-type vessle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG068997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AG066603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG076783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depleting senescent osteoclasts using the senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT263) can reduce sensory innervation in the endplate and attenuate low back pain, thus representing a potent therapy for treating spinal pain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal problem globally, affecting at least 80% of all individuals at some point in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deyo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maher et al., 2017</xref>). It has also become the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, with almost 65 million cases involved per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">James et al., 2018</xref>), which consequently results in a tremendous medical burden and economic cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deyo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartvigsen et al., 2018</xref>). Current pharmacological treatment options for LBP include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, opioids, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qaseem et al., 2017</xref>). However, the clinical use of these medications is limited due to potential severe adverse effects and modest therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roelofs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deyo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldberg et al., 2015</xref>). Some biological agents aiming for LBP management are under investigation as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). For example, parathyroid hormone has shown a superior antinociceptive effect on LBP in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nevitt et al., 2006</xref>), whereas its risk of causing osteosarcoma and Paget’s disease is not negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 1976</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for effective nonsurgical therapeutic interventions for LBP.</p><p>Cellular senescence is a stable and terminal state of growth arrest in which cells are unable to proliferate despite optimal growth conditions and mitogenic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Micco et al., 2021</xref>). It can be induced by various triggers, including DNA damage, telomere dysfunction, and organelle stress, and it has been linked to host physiological processes and age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Childs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnamurthy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, the clearance of senescent cells has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy in several areas of pathology. For instance, glomerulosclerosis and decline in renal function in aged mice are rescued by clearance of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-expressing senescent tubular brush-border epithelial cells, while clearance of senescent cells reduces age-related cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and improves cardiac stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, it has been shown that cellular senescence is an essential factor in the promotion of age-related musculoskeletal diseases, such as osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farr et al., 2017</xref>), osteoarthritis (OA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>), and intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherif et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The effectiveness of senolytic drugs towards bone-related diseases via elimination of senescent cells is also well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farr et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, for the treatment of IVD degeneration, which is strongly associated with LBP, it was demonstrated that the senescent cells of degenerative discs were removed, and the IVD structure was restored by treatment with ABT263, a potent senolytic agent, in an injury-induced IVD degeneration rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, recent research shows a direct link between telomere shortening-induced cellular senescence and chronic pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muralidharan et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies conducted by our laboratory have elucidated the significant role of osteoclasts in initiating the porosity of endplates with sensory innervation into porous areas and triggering LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xue et al., 2021</xref>). Attenuating sensory innervation by inhibiting osteoclast activity could reduce spinal pain sensitivity. Importantly, it has been observed that some osteoclasts exhibit characteristics of senescence during osteoclastogeneses, such as the expression of p16 and p21, appearing to obtain a heterogeneous senescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorissen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizoguchi et al., 2009</xref>). Based on all these findings, we speculated there might be a subgroup of osteoclasts that are senescent (which we refer to as SnOCs), and they might promote the induction of sensory nerve innervation in porous endplates and spinal hypersensitivity.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate the presence of SnOCs in the porous endplates in two different spinal hypersensitivity mouse models induced by aging and LSI, respectively. We then deleted SnOCs in these models with ABT263, which resulted in a decreased number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP<sup>+</sup>) OCs in the endplates along with decreased endplate porosity, reduced sensory innervation, and attenuated spinal pain behaviors. Together, these findings suggest the potential of utilizing senolytic drugs for the treatment of LBP and its associated pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A significantly increased number of SnOCs are associated with endplate degeneration and spinal hypersensitivity in the LSI and aged mouse models</title><p>In this study, we used two different LBP mouse models created by LSI and aging.

Despite advancements in its assessment and treatment, the management of LBP remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. Defects in a number of anatomical structures within the back may be responsible for back pain, including the intervertebral discs, facet joints, muscles, ligaments, and nerve root sheaths. Of these, the intervertebral discs, facet joints, and sacroiliac joints are implicated in the majority of the cases of LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kallewaard et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, more than one structure may be contributing to the pain at any one time. During healing, neovascularization occurs and minute sensory nerves can penetrate the disrupted annulus and nucleus pulposus, leading to mechanical and chemical sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>During LSI or aging, endplates undergo ossification, leading to elevated osteoclast activity and increased porosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papadakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>). The progressive porous transformation of endplates, accompanied by a narrowed IVD space, is a hallmark of spinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taher et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that pain arises from nociceptors, it is plausible that LBP may be attributed to sensory innervation within endplates. Additionally, porous endplates exhibit higher nerve density compared to normal endplates or degenerative nucleus pulposus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields et al., 2014</xref>). Netrin-1, a crucial axon guidance factor facilitating nerve protrusion, has been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hand and Kolodkin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>). The receptor mediating Netrin-1-induced neuronal sprouting, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), was found to co-localize with CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory nerve fibers in endplates after LSI surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forcet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shu et al., 2000</xref>). In summary, during LSI or aging, osteoclastic lineage cells secrete Netrin-1, inducing extrusion and innervation of CGRP<sup>+</sup> sensory nerve fibers within the spaces created by osteoclast resorption. This Netrin-1/DCC-mediated pain signal is subsequently transmitted to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or higher brain levels. In our previous study, we found that osteoclasts induce sensory innervation of the porous areas of sclerotic endplates, which induced spinal hypersensitivity in LSI-injured mice and in aging. Inhibition of osteoclast formation by knockout of <italic>Rankl</italic> in the osteocytes significantly inhibits LSI-induced porosity of endplates, sensory innervation, and spinal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, knockout of <italic>Ntn1</italic> in osteoclasts abrogates sensory innervation into porous endplates and spinal hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). In an OA mouse model, we found a role for osteoclast-secreted netrin-1 in the induction of sensory nerve axonal growth in the subchondral bone. Reduction of osteoclast formation by knockout of <italic>Rankl</italic> in osteocytes inhibited the growth of sensory nerves into subchondral bone, DRG neuron hyperexcitability, and behavioral measures of pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous study revealed that osteoclast-lineage cells may promote both nerve and vessel growth in osteoarthritic subchondral bone, leading to disease progression and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that SnOCs are mainly responsible for modulating the secretion of netrin-1 and NGF, which mediate sensory innervation and induce hypersensitivity of spine.</p><p>Osteoclasts are the principal bone-resorbing cells essential for bone remodeling and skeletal development. Here, we report that osteoclasts in the endplate of the vertebral column undergo cellular senescence during injury and aging. The senescence process is programmed by a conserved mechanism because it is restricted to a specific region and follows a specific time course. Cellular senescence was defined by the presence of a senescence marker, SA-βGal, and a key senescence mediator, p16INK4a, detected in the bone tissue sections. In the present study, we found that the number of TRAP<sup>+</sup> and SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> or p16<sup>+</sup> senescent osteoclasts in endplates was significantly increased in LSI-injured mice and aged mice compared to sham-injured mice with PBS treatment. These findings support our hypothesis that increased numbers of SnOCs in LSI or aging conditions contribute to nerve innervation factors secretion, which leads to spine pain.</p><p>Current LBP management strategies have limited therapeutic effects, and progressive pathological spinal changes are observed frequently with these treatments. According to the American College of Physicians guidelines, pharmacological recommendations for acute or subacute LBP should begin with NSAIDs or muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). There is no consensus on the duration of NSAID use, and caution is advised with persistent use due to concerns for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events. Guidelines by the American College of Physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qaseem et al., 2017</xref>) recommend tramadol or duloxetine as a second-line treatment and opioids as the last-line treatment for chronic LBP. A meta-analysis showed that opioids offer only modest, short-term pain relief in patients with chronic LBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel Shaheed et al., 2016</xref>). The addictive potential of opioids coupled with several side effects limits their use in the management of such pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qaseem et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, these drugs provide insufficient and unsustained pain relief with considerable adverse effects.</p><p>A clinical study demonstrated that nerve density is higher in porous endplates than in normal endplates and is associated with pain. Radiofrequency denervation treatment can be used for pain relief originating from the lumbar facet joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maas et al., 2015</xref>). However, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines from the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2017</xref>) recommend considering radiofrequency denervation only when the main source of pain originates from the facet joints, when pain is moderate to severe, and only when evidence-based multidisciplinary treatment has failed. During LBP progression, sensory nerves and blood vessels are aberrantly innervated in the endplate, which leads to pain. In this study, we aimed to reduce pain by decreasing nerve innervation. We found that SnOCs mediate nerve fiber innervation by elevated secretion of netrin-1 and NGF. Moreover, our previous study reported that osteoclasts can secret netrin-1 to attract sensory nerve growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>). NGF can be produced by osteoblasts in response to mechanical load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamei et al., 2022</xref>) or by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and Sema3A is secreted by osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomlinson et al., 2017</xref>). We believe a cross-talk exists between osteoclasts and osteoblasts or BMSCs after LSI or aging to modulate the secretion of nerve fiber innervation mediators.</p><p>The recent discovery that senescent cells play a causative role in aging and in many age-related diseases suggests that cellular senescence is a fundamental mechanism of aging. In aging, as well as in metabolic disorders, the immune response is affected by senescent cells that no longer replicate, but have a senescence-associated secretory phenotype that produces high levels of proinflammatory molecules. Certain chemotherapy drugs, known as senolytics, however, kill senescent cells and other drugs, called anti-SASP drugs, block their proinflammatory cell signaling. ABT263 is a selective BCL-2 and BCL-xL inhibitor and is one of the most potent and broad-spectrum senolytic drugs. In the current study, we explored the role of ABT263 to manage spinal pain, and we found to it could effectively clear SnOCs cells in two mouse models. A decreased number of SnOCs will relieve pain by decreasing sensory neuron innervation in the endplate. However, ABT263 does not specifically eliminate SnOCs and thus further studies are required to prove the role of SnOCs in spinal hypersensitivity. Furthermore, ABT263 usually possesses various on-target and/or off-target toxicities, which could preclude its clinical use. Even so, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we show evidence that SnOCs promote LBP by neurotrophic-mediated pathways. Our findings suggest that depletion of SnOCs, perhaps by use of a senolytic, can reduce sensory innervation and attenuate LBP, thus representing a new avenue in the management of this widespread condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of senescent osteoclasts (SnOCs) in porous endplate-induced spinal pain.</title><p>In lumbar spine instability (LSI) or aging mouse models there is an induction of spinal hypersensitivity due to increased numbers of SnOCs in the endplate, leading to excessive secretion of sensory nerve mediators, such as Netrin-1, to attract calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP<sup>+</sup>) sensory nerve innervation. Additionally, aberrant microarchitecture and spinal degeneration are associated with increased wiring of sensory nerve fibers and H-type vessels in the endplate, all further contributing to lower back pain.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92889-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Three- and 24-month-old C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.

Mechanical withdrawal frequency was calculated as the number of withdrawal times in response to 10 applications after three replicates.</p><p>The Hargreaves test of nociception threshold was evaluated by the Model Heated 400 Base. The animals were transferred from the holding room to the enclosure and acclimatization of the animals in the enclosure was for 30 min. The duration of exposure before the hind paw withdrawn with three replicates is recorded after focusing the mouse’s mid-plantar surface of the hind paw with the light.</p><p>Spontaneous wheel-running activity was recorded using activity wheels designed for mice (model BIO-ACTIVW-M, Bioseb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobos et al., 2012</xref>). The software enabled recording of activity in a cage similar to the mice’s home cage, with the wheel spun in both directions. The device was connected to an analyzer that automatically recorded the spontaneous activity. We evaluated the distance traveled, maximum speed, and total active time during 2 days for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>Mice were euthanized with an overdose of isoflurane inhalation. Total RNA was then extracted from the L4–L5 lumbar spine endplate tissue samples. Briefly, spine endplate tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and isolated from Buffer RLT Plus using RNeasy Plus Mini Kits (QIAGEN, Germany) and homogenized directly with ultrasound (probe sonication at 50 Hz for three times, 10 s per cycle). The purity of RNA was measured by the absorbance at 260/280 nm. Then, the RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA by PrimeScript RT (reverse transcriptase) using a primeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara), and qPCR was performed with SYBR Green-Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on a QuantStudio 3 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Relative expression was calculated for each gene by the 2-△△CT method, with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) used for normalization.

Then, the whole lumbar spine was dissected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 48 hr, transferred into PBS, and examined by high-resolution μCT (Skyscan1172). The scanner was set at a voltage of 55 kV, a current of 181 μA, and a resolution of 9.0 μm per pixel to measure the endplates and vertebrae. The ribs on the lower thoracic spine were included for identification of L4–L5 unit localization. Images were reconstructed and analyzed using NRecon v1.6 and CTAn v1.9 (Skyscan US, San Jose, CA, USA), respectively. Coronal images of the L4–L5 unit were used to perform three-dimensional histomorphometric analyses of the caudal endplate. The three-dimensional structural parameters analyzed were total porosity and trabecular bone separation distribution (Tb.Sp) for the endplates. Six consecutive coronal-oriented images were used for showing three-dimensional reconstruction of the endplates and the vertebrae using three-dimensional model visualization software, CTVol v2.0 (Skyscan US).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and histomorphometry</title><p>After μCT scanning, the spine samples were decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (pH 7.4) for 30 days and embedded in paraffin or optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA).</p><p>Four-μm-thick coronal-oriented sections of the L4–L5 lumbar spine were processed for Safranin O (Sigma-Aldrich, S2255) and fast green (Sigma-Aldrich, F7252) staining, TRAP (Sigma-Aldrich, 387A-1KT) staining, and immunohistochemistry staining with an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2019</xref>).

We have thoroughly addressed the entire narrative in the revised manuscript, as outlined below:</p><p>During lumbar spine instability (LSI) or aging, endplates undergo ossification, leading to elevated osteoclast activity and increased porosity1-4. The progressive porous transformation of endplates, accompanied by a narrowed intervertebral disc (IVD) space, is a hallmark of spinal degeneration4,5. Considering that pain arises from nociceptors, it is plausible that low back pain (LBP) may be attributed to sensory innervation within endplates. Additionally, porous endplates exhibit higher nerve density compared to normal endplates or degenerative nucleus pulposus6. Netrin-1, a crucial axon guidance factor facilitating nerve protrusion, has been implicated in this process7-9. The receptor mediating Netrin-1-induced neuronal sprouting, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), was found to co-localize with CGRP+ sensory nerve fibers in endplates after LSI surgery10,11. In summary, during LSI or aging, osteoclastic lineage cells secrete Netrin-1, inducing extrusion and innervation of CGRP+ sensory nerve fibers within the spaces created by osteoclast resorption. This Netrin-1/DCC-mediated pain signal is subsequently transmitted to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or higher brain levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It appears that the quantitative data for TRAP staining in Figure 1j is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments.
