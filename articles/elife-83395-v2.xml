mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) has long been proposed as a possible mechanism of mitochondrial and tissue dysfunction that occurs during aging. A thorough characterization of age-associated mtDNA somatic mutations has been hampered by the limited ability to detect low-frequency mutations. Here, we used Duplex Sequencing on eight tissues of an aged mouse cohort to detect &gt;89,000 independent somatic mtDNA mutations and show significant tissue-specific increases during aging across all tissues examined which did not correlate with mitochondrial content and tissue function. G→A/C→T substitutions, indicative of replication errors and/or cytidine deamination, were the predominant mutation type across all tissues and increased with age, whereas G→T/C→A substitutions, indicative of oxidative damage, were the second most common mutation type, but did not increase with age regardless of tissue. We also show that clonal expansions of mtDNA mutations with age is tissue- and mutation type-dependent. Unexpectedly, mutations associated with oxidative damage rarely formed clones in any tissue and were significantly reduced in the hearts and kidneys of aged mice treated at late age with elamipretide or nicotinamide mononucleotide. Thus, the lack of accumulation of oxidative damage-linked mutations with age suggests a life-long dynamic clearance of either the oxidative lesions or mtDNA genomes harboring oxidative damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial DNA</kwd><kwd>somatic mutations</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>duplex sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AG001751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcinek</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rabinovitch</surname><given-names>Peter S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DK128540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Contreras</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HG011229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019346</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA259780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01AG062757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweetwyne</surname><given-names>Mariya T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG000057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsantilas</surname><given-names>Kristine A</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitson</surname><given-names>Jeremy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG066574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsantilas</surname><given-names>Kristine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The accumulation of somatic mutations during aging is not uniform across tissue types and, in addition, shows significant variability in the source of mutation that can be modified by small molecule interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic instability is a hallmark of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). A mechanistic link between somatic mutations and age-related diseases such as cancer is clear, but their importance in other aging phenotypes, long hypothesized, is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang and Vijg, 2018</xref>). Recent surveys of non-diseased somatic tissues have shown that mutations are pervasive in the nuclear genome (nDNA), increase with age, and vary considerably between tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, these nDNA mutations commonly occur in cancer-associated genes, show evidence of selection and clonal expansion, and may play important roles in tissue regeneration and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martincorena et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martincorena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies indicate a growing realization that somatic mutagenesis and clonal dynamics are likely an important determinant of human health during aging. While the accumulation of somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) with age has long been documented, the specific nature of their occurrence, and the consequences for aging, have remained unclear (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez-Contreras and Kennedy, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, mtDNA is a maternally inherited ~16–17 kb circular DNA molecule encoding 37 genes: 13 essential polypeptides of the electron transport chain (ETC), two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 tRNAs. Mitochondria are involved in a broad range of crucial processes, including ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), calcium homeostasis, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, regulation of apoptosis, and the biosynthesis of a wide variety of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kowaltowski, 2000</xref>). These processes rely on mitochondria such that disruption of the genetic information encoded in mtDNA by mutation leads to dysfunction of these important processes and subsequently induces disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallace, 1999</xref>). Unlike nDNA, mtDNA replication is largely independent of the cell cycle. The higher level of mtDNA replication, the absence of several cellular DNA repair pathways, and the lack of protection from histones results in mtDNA mutation rates ~100–1000× higher than that of nDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khrapko et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marcelino and Thilly, 1999</xref>). Moreover, due to the coding density of mtDNA being higher than nDNA (~91% vs. ~1%), the probability that a mutation disrupts protein function is greater.</p><p>Observational studies have shown that the genetic instability of mtDNA in somatic cells is a fundamental phenotype of aging and may be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larsson, 2010</xref>). Collectively, studies examining endogenous mtDNA mutations have shown low levels of G→T/C→A mutations and a preponderance of G→A/C→T and T→C/A→G transitions. This has been interpreted as being contrary to free radical theories of aging by suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not the primary driver of mutagenesis in mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). Other notable patterns include an over-abundance of mutations in the mitochondrial Control Region (mCR), an unusual strand bias, a mutational gradient in transition mutations, and a unique trinucleotide mutational signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ju et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). However, while the presence of somatic mtDNA mutations is well documented, a clear causative role in aging remains controversial (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez-Contreras and Kennedy, 2022</xref>).</p><p>One reason for this controversy stems from a poor understanding of when, where, and how somatic mtDNA mutations arise during the normal aging process. Most conclusions regarding the accumulation of mtDNA mutations during aging are based on a limited number of experimental models and tissue types, with data largely focused on brain and muscle due to their perceived sensitivity to mitochondrial dysfunction. Only a small number of pan-tissue surveys have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Samuels et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, most of these prior studies made use of either ‘clone and sequence’ or conventional next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect mutations. These approaches are technically limited in their ability to detect heteroplasmy below a variant allele fraction (VAF) of 1–2% (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salk et al., 2018</xref>). The advent of ultrahigh-accuracy sequencing methods has shown that most heteroplasmies are present far below this analytical threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>). As such, determining the burden of somatic mtDNA mutations in the context of normal aging lags well behind the efforts focused on nDNA. This is especially pertinent given the heterogeneous nature of tissue decline during aging.</p><p>Like the nDNA, somatic mutations in mtDNA have been proposed to be under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suen et al., 2010</xref>). Cells have evolved several mitochondrial quality control pathways such as removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy and fusion/fission to maintain a healthy mitochondrial pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). The formation and expression of deleterious mtDNA mutations is hypothesized to lead to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induction of mitophagy. This is a potential mechanism by which cells prevent mtDNA mutations from reaching a phenotypic threshold capable of altering cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rossignol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rossignol et al., 1999</xref>). Evidence for involvement of quality control machinery in removing somatic mtDNA mutations has been contradictory, with some indicating a clear role for mitophagy and fission/fusion, while other evidence indicates no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pickrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suen et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the role, if any, of the mitochondrial quality control pathways in targeting mtDNA mutations for removal remains unclear.</p><p>We and others have previously identified a mitochondrially targeted synthetic peptide, elamipretide (Elam; previously referred to as SS-31 and Bendavia), and the NADH precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) as interventions that restore mitochondrial function and tissue homeostasis late in life (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshino et al., 2018</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Obi et al., 2022</xref>). The specific mechanism(s) by which these two compounds ameliorate age-related mitochondrial dysfunction differ. Elam interacts directly with the inner mitochondrial membrane and membrane-associated proteins, stabilizing the mitochondrial ultrastructure and influencing cardiolipin-dependent protein interactions to improve ETC function leading to reduced oxidant production, preservation of membrane potential, and enhanced ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, NMN is an NAD+ precursor molecule and acts by elevating NAD+ levels and providing additional substrate for mitochondrial ATP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshino et al., 2011</xref>). Neither intervention is expected to directly alter mtDNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, we sought to test whether these interventions would reduce the prevalence of mtDNA mutations in aged tissues because of their demonstrated ability to improve mitochondrial structure and/or function.</p><p>We first addressed the relative dearth of high-accuracy data regarding age-related accumulation of mtDNA in mice across multiple tissue types. To that end, we used ultraaccurate Duplex Sequencing (Duplex-Seq) to identify organ-specific mtDNA mutation burden in heart, skeletal muscle, eye, kidney, liver, and brain in naturally aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmitt et al., 2012</xref>). Intra-animal comparison allowed us to determine whether mtDNA mutation rates differ between organs while still accounting for inter-animal variation. Our findings point to the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations being a dynamic and highly tissue-specific process that can be modulated by one or more cellular pathways amenable to small molecule intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study the effects of aging on the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations across tissues, we used Duplex-Seq to obtain high-accuracy variant information across the entire mtDNA. We examined six different organ systems (heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and eye) at two different ages (young = 4.5 months; N=5 and old = 26 months; N=6). These two age groups were chosen for their representation of the two extremes of the adult mouse lifespan while mitigating potential confounders related to development, sexual maturation, and survival selection at more advanced ages.

To minimize variation of cell type substructure within tissues between animals, care was taken to isolate similar regions of each organ, as described in the Materials and methods section. In total, we sequenced over 27.9 billion high-accuracy bases, corresponding to a grand mean post-consensus depth of 10,125× for all samples with reasonably uniform coverage among experimental groups and mice, with the exception of the Ori<sub>L</sub> (5160–5191) and several masked regions with high G/C content and/or repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 5).

In young mice, an initial comparison of the frequency of mtDNA SNVs revealed a mutation frequency on the order of ~1 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, with low variability between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Kidney and liver were notable exceptions, exhibiting significantly higher SNV frequencies compared to the other tissues in the young cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Moreover, due to their low prevalence, transversions associated with oxidative lesions (i.e. G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G) have been largely discounted as contributing to age-associated mtDNA mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itsara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kauppila et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). However, these findings are based on a limited number of tissue types, specifically muscle and brain. Given the wide range of SNV frequencies and known metabolic activities of the tissues we assayed, we examined the mutational spectra for each tissue. Our data show that the overall bias toward G→A/C→T transitions remains broadly true for most tissues, but the extent of this bias varies considerably, with kidney and heart being the notable extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with prior studies, a single mutation class, G→A/C→T, is the most abundant mutation type and accounts for more than 50% all mutations in most young tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, ROS-linked G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations exhibited substantial variation in the level of mutations between tissues. In the central nervous system (CNS) tissues (hippocampus, cerebellum, retina), G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G, combined, accounted for an average of 23% of the total mutation burden (retina = 18%, hippocampus 18%, cerebellum 33%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In addition, manipulations and high temperatures during library construction can further increase DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Lee, 2019</xref>). It has been noted that DNA damage can, if present at sufficiently high levels, give rise to apparent G→T/C→A mutations in Duplex-Seq data, resulting from shearing induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). We typically control for this class of artifacts by clipping the post-consensus read. However, artifacts have been documented to occur up to 30 cycles into DNA that is highly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate the potential for DNA damage to explain the presence of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations, we performed two analyses. First, we examined the single-strand consensus sequence (SSCS) data that comprise the final high-accuracy duplex consensus sequence (DCS). Apparent variants in SSCS have sequencer-based errors removed and are comprised of both real DNA mutations and PCR-derived errors. Most of the PCR-derived errors are the result of base misincorporation across from DNA damage events, such as 8-oxo-dG and cytidine deamination to uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmitt et al., 2012</xref>). Our data show tissues significantly vary in the frequencies of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations. Therefore, if ROS-linked mutations were the result of fixation of DNA damage during PCR, then we would expect that the frequency of ROS-linked variants in the SSCS data should mirror the variability that is seen the final DCS data. Plotting the G→T and C→A SSCS frequency reveals that signal from ROS damage is uniform across all tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, in order for false variants in the SSCS data to result in false DCS variants, the rate at which this occurred would need to be tissue-specific. Importantly, we randomized the library preparation and sequencing steps across tissues and ages to avoid batch effects, making it difficult to explain how tissue-level effects would occur. Second, we treated total DNA purified from aged skeletal muscle with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) immediately after sonication. Fpg recognizes damaged purines, including 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and 8-oxo-dG, to generate an apurinic (AP) site that it then cleaves via its AP lyase activity, leaving a one nucleotide DNA gap. This effectively prevents the damaged DNA strand from PCR amplifying during library construction, thus preventing fragmented DNA from being able to form a final duplex consensus. Encouragingly, we observed no significant difference in our Fpg-treated and non-treated skeletal muscle samples, indicating that shearing-induced artifacts are unlikely to account for our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that ROS damage to the mtDNA is unlikely to explain our observations of tissue-related variability in G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Clonal expansion of somatic mtDNA mutations is tissue-specific</title><p>Mutagenesis has been described as an irreversible process that results in increasing levels of mutations in a population over time, termed ‘Muller’s ratchet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felsenstein, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller, 1964</xref>). Consequently, absent any compensatory mechanisms, mutations should increase during life. In the case of mtDNA, this should appear as an increase in the burden of apparent heteroplasmies (or clones) within a tissue over time. Importantly, because mtDNA replicates independently of nDNA, apparent heteroplasmies can increase during aging even in the absence of substantial cell proliferation. Moreover, mitochondria are subject to surveillance by mitophagy, which may affect the age-dependent mutational dynamics in tissue-specific ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pickles et al., 2018</xref>). Expansion of mtDNA mutations sufficient to warrant the term ‘clonal’ has been documented in human tissues, but the prevalence of this phenomenon remains poorly documented in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greaves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greaves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greaves et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nekhaeva et al., 2002</xref>).

In retina, the percentage of SNVs detected as clones increased from 3.6% in young to 5.6% in old mice. In kidney and liver, the expansion of mtDNA mutations was pervasive across the genome and suggestive of a relationship to the high proliferative and regenerative capacity of these tissues.

Collectively, these data suggest that the importance of mtDNA heteroplasmic clones in aging phenotypes is tissue-dependent. Very few studies have examined somatic mtDNA heteroplasmic clones in any tissue, and this remains an area for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spectral analysis of clonal somatic mtDNA mutations suggests removal of ROS-linked mutations</title><p>Having established the tissue-specific profile of heteroplasmic clones, we reasoned that we could distinguish between mutations arising from a transient process earlier in life and an active clearance of mtDNA and/or whole mitochondria containing mutation types by examining which mutation types became more heteroplasmic with age. Specifically, an ongoing or early transient mutational process would be expected to result in expansion of a subset of variants across all mutation types. In contrast, evidence of active clearance would appear as either a lack of heteroplasmic clone expansion or a bias in the specific variants that underwent expansion. Because five of the eight tissues showed no significant change in the proportion of clonal SNV with aging, we expected that clones would be distributed across the spectra in a pattern similar to non-clonal mutations. Instead, we observed that the spectrum of heteroplasmic clones demonstrates a nearly complete suppression of heteroplasmic clones derived from G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations in both young and old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Remarkably, suppression of ROS-linked heteroplasmic clones was true even in the heart, which carried the highest combined G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G SNV mutation burden of any tissue, with 65% of total SNV in young and 34% of SNV in old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we asked whether this lack of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G clones was a significant finding or merely a consequence of low sampling due to the relative paucity of heteroplasmic clones and the lower frequency of ROS-associated mutations. Under the assumption that heteroplasmic clones arise randomly, we tested whether our dataset of detected SNV clones differed from the expected number of clones based on the spectral distribution of non-clonal SNV mutations. To ensure that we had sufficient power, we combined SNV mutations and clones detected in all eight tissues of the six old mice for a total of 24,244 de novo SNVs and 1461 heteroplasmic clones. To account for differences in depth between samples, the spectral distribution of total SNV mutations was calculated for each tissue of each mouse. The expected contribution of clones in each tissue was then weighted based on the average percentage of ‘clonality’ measured in the aged dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For example, more clones were expected to form in kidney and liver (10.4% and 6% clonality, respectively) than would be expected in brain or muscle tissues (~3% clonality). Using this method, our model predicted the detection of 1341 heteroplasmic clones in total for combined aged tissues, which is within 10% of the detected total of 1461.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Spectral analysis of clonal somatic mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) mutations suggests removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-linked mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequency of heteroplasmic clones in young mice shown as clone frequency for each mutation class and tissue.

G→T/C→A and C→G/G→C mutations were predicted to form ~146 and ~69 clones respectively, however, only eight G→T/C→A clones and two C→G/G→C clones were detected in the entire aged mouse dataset, corresponding to an 18- and 34-fold under-representation, respectively. Conversely, G→A/C→T and T→C/A→G transitions only deviated from the expected values by less than twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although we used a combined aged tissue dataset to ensure that we were not under sampling, this under/over-representation by mutation spectra was detected in every tissue type as shown by their observed spectral distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that expansions of heteroplasmic clones in mtDNA unlikely arises as a random consequence of somatic mutation formation. The uneven distribution of clones relative to non-clonal SNVs suggests that the lack of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutation accumulation with age does not reflect differences in the formation of these mutations, but rather is consistent with a steady-state level of ROS-linked mutations that is susceptible to a constant generation and removal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Late-life treatment with mitochondrially targeted interventions reduces ROS-linked mutations</title><p>Like in the germline, mtDNA mutations have been hypothesized to be selectively removed in somatic tissue through a mechanism involving a still poorly understood interaction between the unfolded protein response, mitophagy, and mitochondrial fission/fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gitschlag et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suen et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that compounds known to improve function and/or ultrastructure in aged mitochondria would impact the burden of aging mtDNA mutations by shifting the steady state of ROS damage toward removal of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria and their accompanying mtDNA. To this end we sequenced tissues from mice treated systemically for 8 weeks with either Elam or NMN in old mice that had accumulated somatic mtDNA mutations throughout their lives. Functionally, both Elam and NMN improve mitochondrial energetics and the mitochondrial network in aged mice across multiple aged tissues within an 8-week time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweetwyne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whitson et al., 2020</xref>), albeit through different mechanisms.

This allowed us to examine mice within such a narrow window of time that it was more likely to detect changes in mutation turnover/removal, rather than significant prevention of mutation accumulation during aging.</p><p>All treated samples were sequenced to a similar mean ‘duplex’ depth and detected comparable numbers of mutations as the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 2). We did not observe a significant change in the overall mutation frequencies between aged mice and treated mice, regardless of tissue, indicating that these interventions are unlikely to indiscriminately affect mtDNA mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In support of this observation, the non-synonymous to synonymous ratio (dN/dS), which is a measure of positive or negative selection, shows no significant deviation from the expected ratio of one for any age, tissue, or intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, consistent with our hypothesis, mice treated with Elam or NMN showed a trend for reduction of ROS-associated G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations in heart, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. In heart, this reached significance for reduction of G→T/C→A mutations (control: 9.7±3.0 × 10<sup>–7</sup> vs. ELAM: 5.5±1.5 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.019; control: 9.7±3.0 × 10<sup>–7</sup> vs. NMN: 4.7±0.9 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.017; one-way ANOVA within each mutation class with Dunnett’s test against saline control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

No effect was seen in the remaining tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations do not significantly increase between young and old age control animals, but are reduced in aged animals with these interventions, thus indicating that these changes are not simply due to the prevention of these mutation types during the treatment window. We interpret these findings to mean that ROS-linked mutations do occur throughout life, but that either mitochondria or the mtDNA harboring these mutations are more likely than other mutation classes to be eliminated via mechanisms of cellular organelle maintenance. Although we cannot discount that the lack of efficacy in some tissues may be due to tissue-specific differences in biodistribution of the two compounds tested, the efficacy of Elam and NMN to reduce ROS-linked mutations in these organs is consistent with other reports demonstrating functional improvements to aged tissues specifically in skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney for Elam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweetwyne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whitson et al., 2020</xref>) and heart, liver, and skeletal muscle for NMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mills et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whitson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Late-life treatment with mitochondrially targeted interventions reduces somatic mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) mutation burden and is consistent with a mechanism of active reactive oxygen species (ROS)-linked mutation removal.</title><p>Mutation spectra show that aged mice treated for 8 weeks with either elamipretide (Elam, diagonal striped bars) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, horizontal striped bars) have decreased frequency of mutations compared to no-treated (NT) controls specifically in mutation types linked to oxidative damage, G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G, specifically for (<bold>A</bold>) kidney and (<bold>B</bold>) heart and trending for (<bold>C</bold>) liver.

Enhancement of accuracy by NGS and newer methods, such as Duplex-Seq, have begun to shed light on these processes. In this report, we took advantage of our continued improvement in the Duplex-Seq protocol to perform a multi-tissue survey of somatic mtDNA mutations in a naturally aging mouse cohort. The very high depths we achieved (depth grand mean: 10,125×) allowed us to detect hundreds to thousands of mutations per sample (variant count mean: 453, total: 77,017 SNVs and 12,031 In/Dels) across all mutation types, representing an ~8.3-fold increase in depth and a 38.5-fold increase in mean mutation count per sample compared to the next largest currently published Duplex-Seq dataset for mouse mtDNA (depth grand mean: 1231×; variant count mean: 12.7, total: 2488) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>). This substantially expanded dataset allowed us to examine the types and classes of de novo mtDNA mutations with unprecedented sensitivity and, as a result, we observed unexpected patterns that would have been missed with a lower coverage of mutations.</p><p>The findings reported here broadly recapitulate those from smaller studies reporting that somatic mtDNA point mutations occur at a frequency on the order of 10<sup>–6</sup>, increase with age, and are biased toward G→A/C→T transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ameur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreazza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samstag et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). However, our expanded dataset found an unexpected level of variation between tissues in both overall mutation frequency and spectrum, indicating tissue-specific effects of aging on mtDNA mutation burden. While in young mouse tissues, we observed minimal variation in mtDNA SNV frequency with only kidney, liver, and RPE/choroid showing significantly increased levels compared to other tissues, with advancing age were distinct differences between all tissues apparent. Our data indicate that the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutation is highly segmental in nature and therefore its impact on aging or disease risk may be tissue-dependent.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The relevance of ROS-linked mutations in mtDNA and aging</title><p>In contrast to mutations arising from DNA polymerase γ (Pol-γ) error, ROS-linked mutations are unlikely to be specifically generated by the process of DNA replication itself. The studies that have examined mtDNA mutagenesis have noted a distinct lack of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G transversions, suggesting that oxidative damage is not a major contributor to aging mtDNA mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ameur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andreazza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itsara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samstag et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). While those studies have increased our understanding of mtDNA mutagenesis, these conclusions are largely based on a small number of tissue types. In this more extensive dataset, we observed a mean of 50 G→T/C→A mutations per sample with no samples having zero instances. In contrast, Arbeithuber et al. reported a mean of three G→T/C→A mutations per sample with ~17% of samples failing to detect this mutation type at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbeithuber et al., 2020</xref>). Such low numbers can lead to significant biases in determining mutation frequencies and make it difficult to detect meaningful differences between sample types.</p><p>The age-related spectrum of mutations between tissues revealed considerable variation of the canonical ROS-associated G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G transversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It was unexpected to find that such a significant proportion of mutations in some young tissues were ROS-linked, including 65% of all SNV mutations in the heart and 43% in skeletal muscle. Despite this, there was no increase of these mutations with age such that the proportion of ROS-linked mutation burden relative to all SNV mutations dropped to 30% and 25% heart and skeletal muscle, respectively. This finding suggests the possibility that different tissues experience varying levels of ROS injury in early life, but that these differences are kept in check during the aging process. Alternatively, it could mean that there is tissue specificity in how cells repair and/or destroy oxidatively damaged mitochondria and mtDNA, resulting in a steady state of ROS-linked mutations.</p><p>Interestingly, and consistent with prior reports, mouse tissues that are part of the CNS exhibited distinctly reduced levels of ROS-associated transversions compared to the other tissues we surveyed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pickrell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that studies focused only on brain tissue may under-represent the prevalence of ROS-linked somatic mtDNA mutations. Neural tissues are widely considered to be exquisitely sensitive to ETC dysfunction and therefore may have evolved a more robust ability to defend against it. More active repair or quality control mechanisms may help eliminate damaged mtDNA before inducing mutagenesis. Consistent with this idea, we observed that both heart and skeletal muscle have a high relative burden of G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G transversions, especially in young tissues, suggesting that their high metabolic activity may confer transversion mutations in these tissue types relative to transitions. These observations suggest that the previously broad conclusions of ROS being irrelevant in mtDNA mutagenesis may be biased for having relied on CNS tissues.</p><p>Our results with Elam and NMN intervention demonstrate that maintenance of mutations may be influenced by the origin of the mtDNA lesion. These pharmacological interventions are known to reverse age-related decline in mitochondrial function by improving the function of the mitochondrial pool in some aged tissues, albeit through very different mechanisms. Because neither drug has been shown to interact directly with mtDNA, the reduction of ROS-linked mtDNA mutation frequency within such a short treatment window suggests a loss of mtDNA harboring ROS-linked mutations, rather than a reduced rate of accumulation due to reduced excess ROS. We propose that rather than the incidence and impact of ROS damage on mtDNA being minimal, the direct or indirect recognition and removal of ROS-linked damage/mutations results in a steady state during aging. We expect that in tissues with exacerbated levels of ROS, the extent of damage could be sufficient to simultaneously create multiple lesions along an individual genome. This could affect the formation of ROS-linked mutations if enough damage is accrued to a mitochondrion to target it for mitophagic removal, induce cellular apoptosis, or stall progression of the mtDNA replication fork. Any of these scenarios could effectively prevent ROS-induced mtDNA damage from being converted into a mutation or remove cells containing damaged mtDNA from the tissue, thereby shortening the detection window for mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Heteroplasmy vs. clonal expansion in aging</title><p>mtDNA mutations can be present as a fraction of mtDNA molecules within a cell (i.e. heteroplasmy) to all or nearly all molecules (i.e. homoplasmy). Our data demonstrate significant variability in mutational burden, as shown by the apparent heteroplasmic VAF, with kidney and liver exhibiting the highest loads (~10% and ~5%, respectively) in the tissues we sampled. However, despite an ever-increasing association with aging, disease, and injury, as well as being tractable with intervention, a common argument against the impact of mtDNA mutations in aging is that the observed heteroplasmy is well below the estimated at ∼60–90% threshold has prevailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rossignol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rossignol et al., 1999</xref>). However, this estimation is based on bulk level analysis of tissues. At the center of this issue is the inability of sequencing methods to distinguish between a low level of heteroplasmy arising from a number of mutations broadly distributed across a large area versus a high level of heteroplasmy found concentrated in a smaller population of cells. In the first case, the effect on cellular and tissue homeostasis would be minimal, but in the latter case, an effect on cellular function would be expected. For example, one could imagine a scenario where every cell contains a different homoplasmic pathogenic mutation which would negatively affect cellular function for every cell. In this case, mutations would be highly prevalent (100% of cells), yet individually rare. However, bulk sequencing would give the appearance that no mutation comes close to exceeding the phenotypic threshold. This issue is likely to be even more complicated in tissues that are highly heterogeneous in their cell-type composition, such as kidney and brain. Our data are silent as to the intra-cellular heteroplasmic level, cell distribution, and functional impact on tissues during aging. However, the broad variability in SNV mutation rates and detection of apparent heteroplasmic clones strongly suggests any impact is highly tissue-specific. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing will likely help tease out the tissue-specific impact of mtDNA mutations and are an important avenue to understand their role to the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lareau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanchez-Contreras and Kennedy, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The ‘clock-like’ accumulation of mutations as a possible biomarker of aging</title><p>While the relative mutation frequencies in our dataset differed widely between aged tissues, we observed a surprisingly consistent twofold increase from young to old mice, driven largely by the accumulation of G→A/C→T transitions. Moreover, by combining our Duplex-Seq data with those from Arbeitheruber et al. our data show a clear clock-like behavior of these mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), reminiscent of the Horvath epigenetic clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Such a clock-like accumulation holds promise as a biomarker for either biological or chronological age, depending on its modifiability. A key to the utility as a biomarker likely depends on the mechanistic driver(s) of this age-dependent accumulation. Specifically, mitochondrial G→A/C→T and, to a lesser extent, A→G/T→C transitions, are widely thought to arise either by deamination of cytidine or adenosine, respectively, or base misincorporations by Pol-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ameur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously used a subset of this dataset to demonstrate that a discontinuous strand-specific gradient of transitions exists across the mtDNA, consistent with deamination events arising from a long-lived single-stranded replication intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). The slope of this gradient increases with age, indicating that deamination is likely an active chemical process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mikhailova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying chemical mechanism behind these likely deaminations remains poorly understood and would impact its utility as a biomarker. For example, if deaminations are due to spontaneous hydrolysis, then transitions and/or the gradient is expected to be largely resistant to aging interventions and could serve as an indicator of chronological age. Alternatively, ROS and temperature, both affected by mitochondrial function, are known to induce deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frederico et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gates, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harman, 1972</xref>). Therefore, interventions that affect mitochondrial function and/or ROS production may be reflected in the rate of age-dependent accumulation of mtDNA transitions and thus act as an indicator of biological age.</p><p>In addition to the mechanism behind de novo mutations, cellular proliferation may play a role in the measured prevalence of age-dependent mutations. Our dataset indicates that of the tissues we examined, those with the highest proliferative index, namely kidney and liver, also exhibit the highest prevalence of mutations, as well as their higher percentage of clonal mtDNA heteroplasmy. This likely demonstrates the contribution of cellular proliferation to the presence of mtDNA mutation, regardless of their etiology. Specifically, as tissues proliferate, mutations that arise earlier will expand over time and have a higher chance of being detected. Therefore, interventions or environmental exposures that affect cellular proliferation would predict significant changes in age-dependent mutation prevalence. Clonal expansions of mtDNA mutations have been well documented in colonic tissues with age and are enhanced in dysplasia, indicating technical feasibility of using the clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations as a biomarker in at least some tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greaves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greaves et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Alternative explanations for the results</title><p>We note two potential confounders that could provide an explanation for our data: nuclear-encoded mtDNA sequences (NUMTS) and shearing-induced artifacts arising from library construction. Studies indicate that NUMTS are highly prevalent and polymorphic in humans and is likely to be true in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabrese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richly and Leister, 2004</xref>). Unknown and variations of NUMTS would be a potentially strong confounder in a study of outbred populations, but the use of one isogenic inbred line for this study likely eliminates this confounder. Specifically, this strong population bottleneck during colony formation would result in NUMTS-derived sequences that are shared across all the samples, especially between tissues from the same animal. However, we did take precautions to remove reads likely derived from NUMTS. First, we used the mm10 reference genome which is based on the C57BL/6J strain, so any NUMTS-derived variants present in our mtDNA data should preferentially align against any NUMTS. Second, we perform a BLAST on all reads containing at least one variant against the mm10 reference genome. We then reassigned the read based to whatever genomic location had the lower e-score. Lastly, we marked and remove variants shared between all individual samples. The result was an average of a dozen reads were removed, demonstrating that NUMTS are not likely a major source of false mutations.</p><p>The lack of age-associated increase in ROS-linked mutations makes it tempting to conclude that these mutations are either sequencing artifacts or at least inconsequential to the biology of aging. Countering these assumptions are two aspects of this study. First, treatment with FPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and the analysis of SSCS variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrate that detected G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutation burdens are unlikely to be induced by damage to shearing-induced single-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). Second, the results demonstrate that ROS-linked mtDNA mutations can be decreased pharmacologically at late age and within a short treatment period in some tissues. Such an effect is difficult to reconcile with a signal resulting from manipulation of the DNA during library construction, which should affect all experimental groups approximately equally. We note there remains the possibility that if ROS-linked mutations were artifactual, but arose from preexisting biologically induced DNA damage, then changes in ROS production across different tissues or with interventions could result in apparent decline in ROS-linked mutations. Importantly, such a scenario would suggest biological relevancy of preventing damage to the mtDNA that ultimately keeps G→T/C→A and G→C/C→G mutations extremely low.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our data indicate that the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutation is highly segmental in nature and that its impact on aging and/or disease risk may be tissue-dependent. Moreover, several of the tissues we examined, such as kidney, are very heterogeneous in their cell-type composition. By examining two compartments of brain (hippocampus and cerebellum), two compartments of the eye (retina and RPE/choroid), and two types of striated muscle tissue (skeletal and heart), we observe that not only are aging-related mtDNA mutation patterns tissue-specific, but they are also region- and cell type-specific. The different mutation spectra that we detected must be underlain by cell-specific regulation of mtDNA. Previous overarching assumptions of how mtDNA mutations do, or do not, contribute to aging may have been premature when based on limited information from few tissues and with previous technical hurdles of poor accuracy in detection of low-level mutation burdens. Left unexplored in this study is whether an earlier initiation, longer duration, or more optimal dose of intervention would more robustly alter the mutation spectra, especially in other tissues that do not show an effect in this study. Additionally, we cannot discount that the lack of efficacy in some tissues may be due to tissue-specific differences in biodistribution of the two compounds tested. Finally, we did not have the opportunity or sufficient sample size in this study to explore potential correlation between the heterogeneity in mitochondrial function of tissues vs. the degree of change in the oxidative mutations. To fully understand how somatic mutation of mtDNA contributes to common diseases of aging, future work must delve into cell-specific mechanisms of mitochondrial mutation accumulation and mtDNA regulation, combined with high-accuracy methods of mtDNA mutation detection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>C57BL/6J male mice from the National Institute of Aging Rodent Resource were handled according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care Committee at the University of Washington. Two age cohorts were used at 4.5 and 26 months of age, respectively. Tissues from the 26-month-old cohort, including aged mice treated with Elam or NMN, were obtained from the same previously reported study, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whitson et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, 24-month-old mice were randomly assigned to control, Elam, or NMN treatment groups. Elam was provided by Stealth BioTherapeutics (Newton, MA, USA) and administered at a 3 mg/kg body weight/day dosage for 8 weeks through subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps (ALZET, Cupertino, CA, USA). Control mice were simultaneously housed in cages with Elam pump mice. NMN was obtained from the Imai Laboratory (Washington University in St Louis, MO, USA) and administered through ad libitum drinking water with a concentration based on each cage’s measured water consumption and mean mouse body weight to approximate a 300 mg/kg/day dose. This method of drug delivery necessitated that NMN-treated mice were housed independently from control animals, however, treatments were run concurrently. Because we sequenced just a subset of the animals from the Whitson et al. study (N=3–5 vs. N=11–15 each group), we minimized study variation by excluding tissues from animals with clearly cancerous lesions by gross analysis (primarily seen in liver) and then sequenced a random cohort of age-matched groups from the three treatment cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whitson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Mouse tissue was collected immediately following euthanasia. Representative portions of six different organ systems were flash-frozen: (1) apex of the heart; (2) 2 mm section from the inferior pole of the left lateral liver lobe; (3) eyes were enucleated and cleared of muscle and adipose tissue before dissecting the retina from the RPE-choroid complex (also referred to as ‘eye cup’ or ‘EC’ in our raw data files) with both regions preserved separately; (4) 3 mm slice of the lower pole of the decapsulated left kidney; (5) proximal 3 mm of left gastrocnemius; (6) brain was dissected in ice-cold 1× PBS to obtain a 3-mm-thick coronal section from the most anterior/septal pole of the left hippocampus and a 3-mm-thick sagittal section from the medial side of the left cerebellar hemisphere. For every sample, dissecting tools were wiped in 70% ethanol, a new razor blades and cutting boards were used, and samples were rinsed in fresh 1× PBS to minimize the contribution of blood and avoid DNA cross-contamination. For perfused experiments, a separate cohort of NIA male mice matching the same age for the aged cohort above (26 months, N=3) was perfused transcardially with 1× PBS containing calcium and magnesium before tissue isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DNA processing and Duplex-Seq</title><p>DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at –80°C. Duplex-Seq was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>), but with several modifications also previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoekstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). Duplex-Seq adapters with defined unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were used and were constructed by separately annealing complementary oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA), each containing 1 of 96 UMIs of defined sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 1). The resulting adapters were diluted to 25 μM for ligation to sheared DNA. Targeted capture used the IDT xGen Lockdown protocol and probes specific for mouse mtDNA (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 2). The resulting libraries were indexed and then sequenced using ~150-cycle paired-end reads (300 cycles total) on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 with ~20 × 10<sup>6</sup> reads per sample.

Briefly, 200 ng of total genomic DNA from the same isolated DNA sample used for Duplex-Seq was mixed with ddPCR assay components including fluorogenic ‘TaqMan’ primer probe sets and the reactions were distributed across a chip with ~20,000 ~ 1 nL droplets to dilute the DNA template to either zero or one copy per well, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masser et al., 2016</xref>). Reactions were then cycled to end-point and fluorescence was read in each droplet. Based on the count of fluorescent positive and negative wells and using a Poisson distribution, the number of target copies was calculated per microliter. nDNA counting was performed in parallel and used as a surrogate for cell number which allows for normalization to cell number and results in an absolute quantitation of mtDNA.

A detailed description of the Duplex-Seq pipeline is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2021</xref>. Seven small polynucleotide repeats were masked to reduce errors associated with alignment artifacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>—Table 5). To reduce the potential impact of NUMTS, we subjected all reads containing non-homoplasmic variants to BLAST-based alignment against a database containing potential common contaminants (dog: canFam3; bovine: bosTau9; nematode: ce11; mouse: mm10; human: hg38; rat: Rnor 6.0). The inclusion of the mm10 genome in this database also allows for the identification of pseudogenes due to BLAST’s high sensitivity. Reads where the alignment with the lowest e-score is the same as the original alignment are kept and the remaining reads and associated variants are removed from further analysis. In addition, we removed variants found across all samples within an individual mouse, which would indicate an inherited, and not a somatic, process.</p><p>To quantify the frequency of de novo events, we used a clonality cutoff of &gt;1% or a depth of &lt;100, which excluded any positions with variants occurring at a high heteroplasmy level and scores each type of mutation only once at each genome position. Called variants were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v99 to obtain protein change. Mutation frequencies were calculated by dividing the number of reads for each allele by the total number of reads at the same mtDNA position. Correlation statistics were applied to determine intra- and inter-animal mutation frequency variation using GraphPad Prism, R, and Python software. Statistical significances between young and old mutation frequencies for SNVs and In/Dels were determined by Welch’s t-test for each mutation class between young vs. old. For comparisons within each age group and mutation type but between tissues (e.g. young kidney vs. young liver vs. young heart frequency, etc.), one-way repeated measures (i.e. each tissue) ANOVA were followed with Tukey’s HSD. For comparing more than one group to a control (e.g. frequency of mutation type for kidney in aged ELAM or aged NMN treated mice vs. untreated aged control) one-way ANOVA was followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The significance of the ratio of means between young and old mutation spectra was determined by t-test for the ratio of means of two independent samples from two Gaussian distributions with the 95% confidence interval estimated by Fieller’s theorem implemented in the <italic>mratios</italic> R-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fieller, 1954</xref>). p-Values or adjusted p-values (p<sub>adj</sub>) less than 0.05 were considered significant in all cases.</p><p>Somatic heteroplasmic clones were defined as variants called in &gt;2 supporting reads. Expected clone events were calculated as the percentage of clonal mutations (&gt;2 calls per sample) for each mutation type observed by age, either in total across all samples or by individual tissue types (as indicated). Significance between expected and observed clone events was calculated by Poisson distribution.</p><p>dN/dS analysis was carried out using the <italic>dNdScv</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martincorena et al., 2017</xref>).

over 89,000 independent somatic mtDNA mutations representing the largest catalog of somatic mtDNA point mutations during aging in a single study. The analysis of these mutations provides compelling evidence to dismiss the idea that reactive oxygen species are a driver of mtDNA mutagenesis, but suggests that ROS may be tissue dependent. These results should provide a fundamental understanding of mitochondrial DNA mutagenesis in aging that should appeal to a broad audience. The novel discovery is the significant presence of transversion mutations (C&gt;A/G&gt;T and C&gt;G/G&gt;C), which previously were assumed almost nonexistent. Moreover, the study finds that, unlike conventional mtDNA mutations, these transversions are not involved in clonal expansion and do not accumulate with age; their relative presence varies very significantly between tissues and can be affected by drug interventions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83395.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Copeland</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00j4k1h63</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Khrapko</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03awzbc87</institution-id><institution>Northeastern University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.30.505884">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505884v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Konstantin Khrapko (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please address these essential items in your revised manuscript.</p><p>1. Please clarify that your claim of the largest collection of mtDNA mutations in a single study is limited to 'point' mutations only. An early study of mtDNA deletions detected much more mtDNA alterations.</p><p>2. Please address reviewer 1's concerns about how DNA mutations in NUMTs are excluded from your study.</p><p>3. Reviewer 1 has a concern that the effect of the drug treatment is independent of point mutagenesis for ROS-derived mutations. Given that the low amount of ROS-linked mutations is already well below a physiological level that would cause loss of mitochondrial function, please explain how reducing these mutations improves mitochondrial function.</p><p>4. Both of the reviewers agree that your study finds that, unlike conventional mtDNA mutations, the transversions are not involved in clonal expansion and do not accumulate with age and their relative presence varies very significantly between tissues and is affected by drug interventions. This unusual behavior of transversions is difficult to explain and thus this study is thought-provoking and will likely lead to further developments in mtDNA field. However, Reviewer 2 is concerned that the detection of transversions, in particular, may be due to an artifact reported by Abascal 2021. Please address their comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>p.9.

What is the sensitivity of In/Del detection compared to pt mutations?</p></disp-quote><p>We can’t provide a specific ratio for this question, but Duplex-Seq is undoubtedly better at detecting point mutations. This is for several reasons. First, we perform targeted DNA capture using probes against the “wild-type” mtDNA sequence and the more sequence that is missing or added by an In/Del, the less efficient the capture will be. For small In/Dels, there is likely little loss, but for larger structural variations it’s likely to be a major source of loss. Second, the main aligner we use, <italic>bwa</italic>, is not very sensitive to larger In/Dels. An alternative aligner, of which there are many, would need to be used to get at this information. As the reviewer pointed out, Lujan et al. have developed a nice computational method to detect large structural variants from short read technologies. As we perform a reference free consensus calling algorithm any structural variations present in the samples will be found in the generated fastq files, provided that they were captured during target enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;255 determined the frequency of both SNVs and small InDels (≲15bp) in aged mice.&quot;</p><p>Please reiterate this indel size range in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 16:</p><p>&quot;414 Late-Life treatment with mitochondrially-targeted interventions eliminate ROS-linked mutations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>There doesn’t seem to be a specific comment here, but we have changed “eliminates” to “reduces” to better reflect the fact that ROS-linked mutations are still present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 17:</p><p>&quot;(Control: 9.7{plus minus}3.0x10-7 vs. ELAM: 5.5{plus minus}1.5x10-7, p=0.019; Control: 9.7{plus minus}3.0x10-7 vs. NMN: 440 4.7{plus minus}0.9x10-7, p=0.017)&quot;</p><p>Beware of multiple hypothesis testing.
