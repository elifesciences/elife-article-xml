science is becoming more international—through multi-national collaborations—and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scientific publishing</kwd><kwd>collaboration</kwd><kwd>scientific enterprise</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of ~50 million articles published in ~50 thousand journals demonstrates that journals have become more diverse in terms of both interdisciplinarity and internationalization but with some disciplinary differences.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peer-reviewed scientific journals are the backbone of scholarly communication for the worldwide community of scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russell, 2001</xref>). Remarkably, the volume of publications in scholarly journals has been growing exponentially for over a century (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Solla Price, 1986</xref>). The dominance of journal articles was not always the state of affairs in scientific communication. The longest-running scholarly journal was launched in 1665 (the French <italic>Le Journal des Sçavans</italic> [or <italic>Journal des savans</italic>] was published for the first time a few months earlier but its publication was interrupted twice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Partridge, 2015</xref>). — the Royal Society of London launched the <italic>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</italic> to collect and distribute important scientific findings and news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fyfe et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike nowadays, in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, monographs, literary essays, public and private presentations, personal letters, pamphlets, and full-length books were all significant channels for communicating research findings and established priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin, 2020</xref>). By the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, printed scientific journals emerged as the primary means of disseminating new scientific discoveries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedlander and Bessette, 2003</xref>). In this new millennium, digital publications, still within the framework of scholarly journals, have overtaken printed publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomlin, 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scholarly journal articles are the largest category of scholarly publications.</title><p>The number of journal publications increased steadily except during the two World Wars. Solid lines show the fits to the data which have, in some cases, been shifted vertically for clarity. (<bold>a</bold>) Scholarly works (with relevant metadata) indexed in the OpenAlex database are categorized into seven groups. Most publications are journal articles. (<bold>b</bold>) Number of journal articles has been doubling approximately every 10 years for over a century. While there were significant drops during World War I (1914 to 1918) and World War II (1939 to 1945), the growth of journal article publications quickly recovered. The solid line shows a linear fit to the logarithm of the dependent variable. (<bold>c</bold>) Number of actively publishing journals has been doubling approximately every 14 years for over a century, but the growth rate has not been constant. The two solid lines show the linear fits to the logarithm of the dependent variable to different time periods. (<bold>d</bold>) Number of countries represented in authors’ affiliations for journal articles published each year. The data is well described by a logistic curve centered at 1970. Most of the growth in the number of countries occurred between 1949 and 1991.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107765-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The scope of scientific enterprise has also evolved over time. In the 380 s B.C.E., Aristotle classified all human knowledge into two philosophical categories: speculative and practical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes, 2000</xref>). Practical philosophy encompassed topics, such as economics, ethics, and politics. Speculative philosophy encompassed aesthetics, mathematics, metaphysics, and physics (also called natural philosophy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant, 2007</xref>). Not until the 19<sup>th</sup> century did the current partitioning of scholarly endeavors start to take shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahan, 2003</xref>).</p><p>This re-arrangement of human knowledge was accompanied by its exponential growth, prompting increasing specialization of scholars and the emergence of ever more specialized venues for sharing discoveries. Perhaps as a result of this specialization trend, the number of scholarly journals has been doubling approximately every 14 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and Appendix 1). Much of this growth has occurred within the dominant natural sciences — biology, chemistry, and physics — each now encompassing a multitude of subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casadevall and Fang, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Raan, 1999</xref>). Counter-intuitively, increasing specialization has produced a drive for interdisciplinarity, with researchers increasingly collaborating to exchange knowledge and methods across domains and bridge disciplinary boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silva et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wray, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogan and Pahre, 1990</xref>). Due to this drive, there had been a second trend in opposition to ever more specialized journals: the increasing prominence of multidisciplinary journals (e.g. <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>Science</italic>, and <italic>PNAS</italic>), which feature research contributions from multiple disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silva et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Raan, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Another factor that has transformed the worldwide scientific enterprise is its increasing internationalization, with scientific collaborations now extending across national boundaries. Whereas France, Germany, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and the United States (U.S.) dominated knowledge production in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, in recent decades, we have witnessed the increasing importance to knowledge creation of Asian nations, such as China, India, and Japan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In fact, there has been a significant expansion in the number of countries where scientists are publishing in selective journals. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, this expansion is well described by a logistic model with a growth rate that peaked in 1970, but extends over the period 1949–1991. Plausibly, the widespread focus on increased scientific research was due to the importance of science and technology to the outcomes of the World Wars.</p><p>Recent literature has highlighted the importance of team science in the production of knowledge, especially impactful knowledge, in recent decades. A less well-understood aspect in the growth of team science is the impact of interdisciplinarity and internationalization. A driving thrust of this study is the assumption that perceived trends towards greater interdisciplinarity and internationalization will be visible and quantifiable using data-driven approaches. We further hypothesize that quantifying these processes will yield a deeper understanding of the observed changes. These insights will guide researchers and policy makers in promoting collaborations among different disciplines and countries, thus encouraging the type of innovative research necessary to address the complex challenges currently faced by humanity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Top multidisciplinary journals</title><p>To build confidence in our metrics, we start by investigating the interdisciplinarity and internationalization of three of the most highly regarded multidisciplinary journals — <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>Science</italic>, and <italic>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</italic> (<italic>PNAS</italic>). All three journals have a long history and publish a large number of articles annually, mostly original research.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the temporal evolution of the interdisciplinarity index for these three journals. It is visually apparent that <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>PNAS</italic>, in particular, have experienced significant shifts in the degree of interdisciplinarity of the articles they publish. To better understand the specifics of these changes, we next explore how different disciplines received evolving degrees of attention in each of these journals over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b-d</xref>). Because of their preponderance in the data, we split Biology, Chemistry, and Physics articles into separate groups and pooled all articles on other major fields of study into an ‘Other Fields’ group.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Long-standing, high-reputation multidisciplinary journals have shifted their disciplinary focus quite dramatically over the last 100 years.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time evolution of the interdisciplinarity indices, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$I_{d}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, of <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>Science</italic>, and <italic>PNAS</italic>, measured by the entropy of the annual distribution of disciplines in published articles.

For all three journals, there has been a shift from ‘Other Fields’ to Physics, Chemistry and Biology. In the 1920s, nearly 60% of articles in <italic>Nature</italic> or <italic>Science</italic> were in fields other than Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Interestingly, after following different paths, all three journals are now publishing nearly 40% of their articles in fields other than Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. In <italic>PNAS</italic>, there was a noticeable shift towards Biology from 1960 to 1990 and away from Physics and ‘Other Fields.’ After 1990, ‘Other Fields’ grew at the expense of Biology. In <italic>Nature</italic>, there has been a steady growth of Biology-focused articles. For both <italic>Nature</italic> or <italic>Science</italic>, the number of Chemistry publications began its ascent in 1940, reaching a pinnacle around 1970, and a slower decline after that.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107765-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Upon this breakdown, a clear trend emerges across all three journals. An initial period where a broad range of disciplines are published in those journals, followed by a transition to a greater emphasis on Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Specifically, in the 1920s, nearly 60% of articles in <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Science</italic> concerned disciplines other than Biology, Chemistry, or Physics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). By 1990, approximately 90% of articles in <italic>PNAS</italic> reported on studies in either Biology or Chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). For <italic>Nature</italic>, the peak concentration was reached in the 1970 s, when 60% of articles reported on studies in either Biology or Chemistry. Despite distinct historical trajectories, all three journals have evolved in recent years toward a situation where nearly 40% of the articles they publish fall outside of the dominant disciplines, but where Biology studies account for 20–30% of all publications.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows the time evolution of the internationalization index for <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>PNAS</italic>, and <italic>Science</italic>. It is visually apparent that <italic>PNAS</italic> and <italic>Science</italic>, in particular, have experienced an extraordinary growth in the diversity of countries from which authors of published articles originate. To better understand the specifics of these aggregate trends, we next explore how authors affiliated with institutions located in countries from different regions were increasingly able to publish in these leading multidisciplinary journals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b-d</xref>). Because of their preponderance in the data, we group countries into three main regions: Asia, Europe, and North America. We group all affiliations located outside of those regions into ‘Other Regions’.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Long-standing, high-reputation multidisciplinary journals have become more international.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time evolution of the internationalization indices, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$I_{n}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, of <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>Science</italic>, and <italic>PNAS</italic>, measured by the entropy of location of the affiliations associated with the authors of published articles.

For all three journals, the greatest growth has occurred for authors with affiliations in institutions located in Asia. Surprisingly, <italic>PNAS</italic> now has the largest fraction of authors from Asian institutions, even though <italic>Nature</italic> had a higher level in the 1940s. For both <italic>Science</italic> and <italic>PNAS</italic>, the fraction of authors from European institutions has increased dramatically since the 1960s. Around the same time, the fraction of authors from European institutions publishing in <italic>Nature</italic> decreased dramatically as the fraction of authors from North American institutions grew rapidly.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107765-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Upon this breakdown, a clear trend emerges for the two U.S.-based journals. Both <italic>PNAS</italic> and <italic>Science</italic> started as a publication outlet for only authors with affiliations in North American institutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). Starting in the 1980s, both experienced an increase in the fraction of papers authored by researchers affiliated with European institutions and, to a lesser extent, Asian institutions. Currently, about 60% of papers published in <italic>PNAS</italic> and <italic>Science</italic> are authored by researchers affiliated with North American institutions, but that percentage appears likely to continue to decline.</p><p>The story is more complex for <italic>Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Already over a century ago, authors from institutions in Europe and North America were publishing in this U.K.-based journal. Moreover, already by the 1940 s, authors affiliated with institutions in Asia started publishing in <italic>Nature</italic>. Despite this early internationalization effort, <italic>Nature</italic> now publishes about the same fractions of Asian, European and North American authors as <italic>Science</italic>, but a smaller fraction of authors affiliated with institutions from Asia than <italic>PNAS</italic>.</p><p>This internationalization shift may be partially attributed to external factors, such as the rise of electronic publishing which now offers researchers a multitude of platforms for communicating their research and an easier path to submitting manuscripts to — or reviewing manuscripts for — journals based in other continents. Electronic publishing also enabled a new model — open access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suiter and Sarli, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomlin, 2005</xref>). Initial studies suggested that open access publication produced greater research visibility and greater number of citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craig et al., 2007</xref>). Another important factor impacting journal internationalization is the growth of team sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guimerà et al., 2005</xref>) and of international collaborations as more diverse collaborating teams may prioritize different factors in the choice of publication venue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Disciplinary and multidisciplinary journals: Interdisciplinarity</title><p>Next, we compare the changes in interdisciplinarity and internationalization for disciplinary journals (see Materials and methods for details).

Physics and Chemistry journals display intriguing changes in interdisciplinarity. A majority of those journals has increased dramatically in interdisciplinarity over time, with Physics journals, in particular, reaching very high degrees of interdisciplinarity. In contrast, a smaller subset of journals have become very mono-disciplinary. Consistent with this finding, we categorize disciplinary journals into two groups according to their interdisciplinarity index: mono-disciplinary (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft14">\begin{document}$I_{d}\approx 0$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) and moderately interdisciplinary (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft15">\begin{document}$I_{d}\approx 1.5$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>).</p><p>A segregation between moderately interdisciplinary and monodisciplinary journals is not as apparent for Biology and Medicine journals. The small values of the 5 year trends show that the interdisciplinarity of Biology and Medicine journals is also more stable than that of Physics and Chemistry journals.</p><p>Economics journals show a trend similar to that of the journals in the natural and life sciences. That is, their interdisciplinarity has increased over time and there is a spread in the levels of interdisciplinarity around moderate interdisciplinarity. In contrast, Political Science journals have maintained high levels of interdisciplinarity for the entire period studied — a level that was achieved only recently by the most interdisciplinary Physics journals. Perhaps this is not surprisingly as political science is a multifaceted discipline that incorporates insights from fields as diverse as business, economics, law, psychology, and sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bakker et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Thus, despite there being an overall perception of a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary research, the reality is that some disciplinary journals have strengthened their mono-disciplinary focus. The reasons for this are likely complex and multifaceted but may be, at least in part, due to traditional academic structures and publishing norms that favored depth over breadth.

Remarkably, disciplinary journals in Chemistry have achieved a similarly high degree of internationalization without the benefit of large international collaborations.

Since most medicine journals maintain a modestly low internationalization index, we surmise that medical research adopts a predominantly regional focus and field-specific norms, such as localized health issues, regional regulatory standards, etc. Nonetheless, it is likely that global epidemics — Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) — will increase the pressure to internationalize medical research.</p><p>The need for an increase in the internationalization of social sciences research may be less obvious.

The reasons for this increased interconnectedness are multifaceted. Increased journal competition for the most exciting research, the need for access to scarce or unique resources, the desire to attract a talented workforce. Whatever the reasons, it is critical to recognize the need for such interconnectedness if one aims to tackle the enormous societal challenges that face us, from climate change to increased conflict.</p><p>While this shift may bring hope to some, it may be seen as threatening by others. Either because of a misguided focus on competition between nations and the need to retain claims of primacy, or because of wishes to preserve disciplinary purity. Indeed, some current efforts in some countries to ‘safeguard their national research enterprises’ may prove costly to the creation of new knowledge within their own nations. Whatever the underlying motivation, it would be wise for policymakers, research funding organizations, and research institutions to understand and adapt to this shifting landscape in order to effectively promote innovation.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations. Perhaps the greatest limitation is that we focus on disciplines where journal articles are the primary scholarly communication channel. This limitation prevents us from being able to generalize our findings to disciplines in the Humanities, which rely on books or book chapters, or in Computer Science and Engineering, which heavily rely on conference proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisée et al., 2008</xref>). A second limitation of our study is the fact that we only consider seven multidisciplinary journals and 16 journals for each discipline. The reason for the small number of multidisciplinary journals considered is that there are not that many highly respected journals thus classified.</p><p>Another limitation we must discuss relates to the completeness and representativeness of the data across disciplines. This concern was foremost in our minds when deciding on the time period for analysis. Indeed, the reason why we consider the period 1900–2020 for only the three major interdisciplinary journals — <italic>Nature, PNAS, Science</italic> — has to do precisely with the fact that those journals are the most likely to be accurately covered. When considering disciplinary journals, we restrict our attention to the period 1960–2020. Even then, for some journals and disciplines covered can be spotty prior to 2000. For this reason, we perform analyses that focus on manually selected journals and for specific time points (1970, 1990, 2010, 2020).</p><p>Moreover, the selected journals are among the most reputable in their fields and publish large volumes of articles (see Materials and methods for details). While the requirements we impose limit the number of disciplinary journals that we can consider, we believe that the selected journals provide an accurate reflection of the changes occurring within the disciplines we consider.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We focused our analysis on the March 2022 snapshot of OpenAlex, a large-scale and open scholarly metadata source. When Microsoft ceased updates of the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) at the end of 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Microsoft Research, 2023</xref>), the non-profit organization OurResearch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OurResearch, 2024</xref>) incorporated the entire MAG corpus — excluding patent data — into OpenAlex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Priem et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, the snapshot of OpenAlex we studied maintains all features and data schemas used by the MAG.</p><p>The March 2022 snapshot of OpenAlex contains information on 208,755,206 scholarly works. OpenAlex categorizes scholarly works into seven types: journal articles, conference proceedings, repositories, book chapters, books, theses, and datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We refined the downloaded data by filtering out entries lacking essential information for our analysis, such as publication year, document type, authorship, affiliation, and field of study information. We then restricted our attention further to scholarly works published after 1900 (due to poor coverage of earlier works) and before 2021 (due to incomplete inclusion of more recent works). This filtering procedure left us with a corpus comprising 56,697,402 publication records, 87% of which are journal articles.</p><p>These ∼50 million articles were published across 51,062 scholarly journals. Remarkably, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows that the number of journal articles published annually has been growing exponentially with an astonishing doubling period of a decade. Even the significant impacts on publication rates of the two World Wars were quickly overcome, and exponential growth resumed.</p><p>As journals comprise the largest share of scholarly publications, we choose to study how two characteristics of journal articles — such as diversity of topics and countries — evolved over the last century. A significant challenge with these records, however, is the frequent unavailability of authorship or affiliation metadata — a limitation that also affected the MAG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>) for a comparison to other databases. The reasons behind this missing metadata in OpenAlex remain unclear. Due to the difficulty of accurately imputing these missing affiliations, our analysis focuses exclusively on journal article publications that include both authorship and affiliation metadata. Approximately 54% of journal articles in the database have complete authorship and affiliation metadata.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Metadata</title><p>Every journal article recorded by OpenAlex is assigned to a unique identifier: ‘PaperId,’ and the journal where it was published is also assigned to a unique identifier: ‘JournalId’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Priem et al., 2022</xref>). These internal identifiers also connect to external identifiers, such as the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), the electronic ISSN (eISSN), and the Research Organization Registry Identifier (ROR ID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Research Organization Registry, 2024</xref>), enabling us to connect information across multiple external data sources. In particular, we can connect authors’ affiliations to institutions listed in the ROR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Research Organization Registry, 2024</xref>) and thus identify the country where the institution is located.</p><p>We then referred to the Clarivate Analytics’ Journal Citation Reports (Journal Citation Reports can be accessed through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jcr.clarivate.com/jcr/browse-categories">https://jcr.clarivate.com/jcr/browse-categories</ext-link>) to obtain the disciplinary classification of the journals in our corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krampl, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrizah et al., 2015</xref>). We selected seven multidisciplinary journals and 16 journals for each of six disciplines across the natural sciences (Chemistry and Physics); life sciences (Biology and Medicine); and social sciences (Economics and Political Science) for a detailed investigation. We selected journals with long publishing history, large number of articles published annually, high impact factors (based on the journal impact factor in 2022), and restricted our attention to journals primarily publishing original research, thus excluding journals focusing on reviews. We then obtained the full publication records of each journal from OpenAlex corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Priem et al., 2022</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quantification</title><p>The interdisciplinarity of a journal is measured by the extent to which its articles draw upon knowledge and methods from diverse disciplines.

Indeed, many researchers in scientometrics and science of science have focused on so-called Rao-Stirling indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leydesdorff et al., 2019</xref>), which can account for heterogeneous distances between disciplines and sub-disciplines. Because we are focusing on the highest level in the hierarchy for Field of Study, this is not as much a concern for us. Additionally, the raising of 2 to the index values provides an ‘effective’ number of different categories in the data, something that helps with gaining insight from the results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-107765-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The latest version of the OpenAlex data snapshot is freely available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/download-to-your-machine">https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/download-to-your-machine</ext-link>.

Thus, one may question how much results obtained using its data can be trusted. In order to answer this question, it is important to also acknowledge that these weaknesses are not unique to OpenAlex — they are shared by other bibliometric databases. For example, we observed that both the original Microsoft Academic Graph database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herrmannova and Knoth, 2016</xref>) and the subscription-based Dimensions database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orduña-Malea and López-Cózar, 2018</xref>) show similar patterns with respect to the fraction of records with missing information. Scopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baas et al., 2020</xref>), another popular database for bibliometric studies, does not have appropriate coverage for works published before 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Because all datasets have similar weaknesses, but not all are equally available to all researchers, we chose to conduct our study using OpenAlex because its openness increases the reproducibility of our study. In addition, we focused our attention on what we believed would be the highest quality records.

The FoS classification system is structured hierarchically across six levels (L0 up to L5). The snapshot adheres to the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) schema, wherein the classification process involves several stages: concept discovery (identifying relevant topics within the text), concept tagging (associating the identified topics with the corresponding papers), and hierarchy construction (organizing topics into a coherent structure). This process is largely automated, relying on web crawling, scraping, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms to assign topics efficiently. Following automation, the outcomes were rigorously evaluated by a panel of human experts to ensure accuracy and relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). The FoS classification has been widely applied in other research contexts to determine the disciplinary focus of journal articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>) and to build cumulative knowledge portfolio for scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Wouden and Youn, 2023</xref>).</p><p>We focus here on the top level (L0).

By constructing entropy-based indices from a large-scale bibliometric dataset (OpenAlex), they examine both long-term trends and recent dynamics in these two dimensions across a selection of leading disciplinary and multidisciplinary journals. Their goal is to identify field-specific patterns and structural shifts that can inform our understanding of how science has become more globally collaborative and intellectually integrated.</p><p>(2) Strengths</p><p>The primary strengths of the paper remain its comprehensive temporal scope and use of a rich, openly available dataset covering over 56 million articles. The interdisciplinary and internationalization indices are well-founded and allow meaningful comparisons across fields and time. The revised manuscript has substantially improved in several aspects. In particular, the authors have clarified the methodology of trend estimation with a concrete example and justification of the 5-year window, making their approach much more transparent. They have also expanded the discussion of potential disparities in data coverage across disciplines and time, acknowledging limitations and implementing safeguards in their analysis. Furthermore, the manuscript has been carefully revised for grammar, clarity, and style, which improves its overall polish. While a sensitivity analysis might still further strengthen the robustness of findings, the revisions satisfactorily address the main methodological concerns raised in the initial review.</p><p>(3) Evaluation of Findings</p><p>The findings, such as the sharp rise in internationalization in fields like Physics and Biology, and the divergence in interdisciplinarity trends across disciplines, are clearly presented and better substantiated in the revised version. The authors now provide more discipline-specific discussion (e.g., medicine, biology, social sciences), which adds valuable nuance to the interpretation of internationalization dynamics. The improved methodological clarity and acknowledgment of data limitations enhance the credibility of the results and their generalizability.</p><p>(4) Impact and Relevance</p><p>This study continues to make a timely and meaningful contribution to scientometrics, sociology of science, and science policy. Its combination of scale, historical depth, and field-level comparison offers a useful framework for understanding changes in scientific publishing practices. The entropy-based indicators remain a simple yet flexible tool, and the expanded discussion of their appropriateness strengthens the methodological foundation. The use of open bibliometric data enhances reproducibility and accessibility for future research. Policymakers, journal editors, and researchers interested in publication dynamics will likely find this work informative, and its methods could be applied or extended to other structural dimensions of scholarly communication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107765.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper uses large-scale publication data to examine the dynamics of interdisciplinarity and international collaborations in research journals.

The paper also does not fully address disparities in data coverage across disciplines and time, which may affect the reliability of historical comparisons. Finally, minor issues in grammar and clarity reduce the overall polish of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the weakness of the manuscript. We addressed these comments in our response to Recommendations A and B. Minor grammar and clarity issues have also been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The first thing that comes to mind is the epistemic mechanism of the study. Why should there be a joint discussion combining internationalism and interdisciplinarity? While internationalism is the tendency to form multinational research teams to work on research projects, interdisciplinarity refers to the scope and focus of papers that draw inspiration from multiple fields. These concepts may both fall into the realm of diversity, but it remains unclear if there is any conceptual interplay that underlies the dynamics of their increase in research journals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of clarity in our decision to conduct a joint discussion of interdisciplinarity and internationalization.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that team science has increased in importance over time. An important question then is whether teams have only grown in size and frequency or whether they have changed in other aspects. Interdisciplinarity and internationalization are two aspects in which teams could have changed.</p><p>We revised the Introduction (Lines 68–70 of the revised manuscript) to address this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear why internationalization is increasing. Although the authors have provided a few prominent examples in physics, such as CERN and LAGO, which are complex and expensive experimental facilities that demand collective efforts and investments from the global scientific community, whether some similar concerns or factors drive the growth of internationalism in other fields remains unknown. I can imagine that these concerns do not always apply in many fields, and the authors need to come up with some case studies in diverse fields with some sociological theory to support their empirical findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for requesting further evidence concerning why our findings may be correct. Physics is an area where the need for extraordinary resources has naturally led to large international collaborative efforts. As we discuss in line 255 of the revised manuscript, this is actually also the case for biology. The Human Genome Project and subsequent projects have also required massive investments, leading to further internationalization.</p><p>We believe that the drive toward internationalization for medicine has to do with the need for establishment of robust results that are not specific to a single country or medical system. Additionally, the impact of global epidemics — Acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) — has also increased the needs to involve researchers from around the world.</p><p>The case for increased internationalization in the social sciences is, we believe, related to the desire to identify phenomena that extend beyond the Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies.</p><p>We have expanded the discussion around these points in lines 274–283 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use Shannon entropy as a measure of diversity for both internationalism and interdisciplinarity. However, entropy may fail to account for the uneven correlations between fields, and the range of value chances when the number of categories changes. The science of science and scientometrics community has proposed a range of diversity indicators, such as the RaoStirling index and its derivatives. One obvious advantage of the RS index is that it explicitly accounts for the heterogeneous connections between fields, and the value ranges from 0 to 1. Using more state-of-the-art metrics to quantify interdisciplinarity may help strengthen the data analytics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing the need to provide a deeper discussion of the impact of different metrics on how disciplinary diversity is calculated. We chose Shannon’s entropy because it accounts for both richness (the number of distinct fields) and evenness (the balance of representation across fields). While measures such as the Rao-Stirling index can be very useful when considering disciplines at different levels of aggregation, since to consider only level 0 Field-of-Study (FoS) tags, that problem is not as much a concern for our analysis.</p><p>We have added a further clarification in lines 145–151 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors)</bold></p><p>Ambiguity in the Trend Calculation Methodology in Figure 4 and 5</p><p>The manuscript uses a 5-year sliding window to calculate recent trends in interdisciplinarity (I<sub>d</sub>) and internationalization (I<sub>n</sub>), but the method is not clearly described. Could the authors clarify whether the trend is calculated by (1) performing linear regression on the index values over the past 5 years, (2) using the regression slope as the trend value, and (3) interpreting the sign and magnitude of the slope to indicate increasing, decreasing, or stable trends? Additionally, the rationale for choosing a 5-year window over other durations (e.g., 10 or 15 years) is not discussed. Given that different time windows could yield different insights, a brief justification or sensitivity check would strengthen the methodological transparency.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing the lack of clarity in our description. In an attempt to increase clarity, we added a specific case study to illustrate the use of 5-year trend in the Supplementary Information: Estimation of tendency of the revised manuscript (Lines 691–704 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Specifically, imagine we want to calculate the trend of the Interdisciplinarity Index for 2010 for Annalen der Physik. We would perform an ordinary least squares linear fit to the 6 data points for the Index in years 2005–2010.</p><p>The reason to focus on a 5-year window is two-fold. First, a longer time period would — as suggested by the data on Figure S10 — likely aggregate over multiple trends. Second, a shorter time period would result in too great an uncertainty in the estimation of the trend.</p><p>This is the reason why we did not implement a sensitivity analysis. Reasonable time windows that consider the two reasons expressed above would be too narrow to provide a worthwhile analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lack of Discussion on Temporal Coverage Disparities Across Disciplines</p><p>The study spans publications from 1900 to 2021, but the completeness and representativeness of the data-especially in earlier decades-may differ significantly across disciplines. For instance, OpenAlex has limited coverage for publications before the mid-20th century, and disciplines such as Medicine and Political Science may have adopted journal-based publishing at different historical periods compared to Physics or Chemistry. These temporal disparities could bias cross-disciplinary comparisons of long-term trends in interdisciplinarity and internationalization. I recommend that the authors briefly discuss this limitation and, if possible, report when coverage becomes reliable for each discipline. A sensitivity analysis starting from a common baseline year (e.g., 1950 or 1970) could also help assess whether the observed disciplinary differences are driven in part by unequal temporal data availability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the requesting further clarification on this matter. We completely agree that “completeness and representativeness of the data – especially in earlier decades-may differ significantly across disciplines”. That is exactly the reason why we made the analyses choices described in the manuscript.</p><p>Indeed, we consider only three journals for the analysis of the entire 1900–2021 period. Those 3 journals, Nature, PNAS and Science are ones that we know to be well recorded.</p><p>When conducting the disciplinary analysis, we focus on the period 1960–2021. While we know that the coverage for the social sciences is less robust until the 1990s, we address this concern by implementing several safeguards:</p><p>Manual selection of representative journals in each discipline to ensured that their publications are well represented in OpenAlex.</p><p>Decade by decade analysis of interdisciplinarity and internationalization so that changes over time can be identified and potential issues with data coverage are restricted to only some aspects of the analysis.</p><p>We also acknowledge the potential coverage disparities in earlier years of the data source (Lines 319-326 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use both interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity. While these concepts offer similar definitions of diversity, it may help the reader if there is some explanation to clarify their subtle differences.

An important question then is whether teams have only grown in size and frequency or whether they have changed in other aspects.
