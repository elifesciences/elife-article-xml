A complex of NuMA and dynein/dynactin is required for robust spindle orientation in a number of cell types. Previous research proposed that cortical dynein/dynactin was sufficient to generate forces on astral microtubules (MTs) to orient the spindle, with NuMA acting as a passive tether. In this study, we demonstrate that dynein/dynactin is insufficient for spindle orientation establishment in keratinocytes and that NuMA’s MT-binding domain, which targets MT tips, is also required. Loss of NuMA-MT interactions in skin caused defects in spindle orientation and epidermal differentiation, leading to neonatal lethality. In addition, we show that NuMA-MT interactions are also required in adult mice for hair follicle morphogenesis and spindle orientation within the transit-amplifying cells of the matrix. Loss of spindle orientation in matrix cells results in defective differentiation of matrix-derived lineages. Our results reveal an additional and direct function of NuMA during mitotic spindle positioning, as well as a reiterative use of spindle orientation in the skin to build diverse structures.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12504.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12504.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12504.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, it must duplicate its DNA so that each new cell receives a complete set of genetic material. A structure called the mitotic spindle helps to ensure each new cell gets the correct amount of DNA. Cells often precisely position their mitotic spindle during division, and this spindle orientation is important for generating different types of cells and for establishing the three-dimensional structure of tissues. How cells rotate their spindles into the correct position is not well understood, but a protein called NuMA is important for this process.</p> <p>Seldin et al. developed genetic tools that could disrupt spindle orientation in specific types of cells to determine where this orientation is important for proper tissue development. This revealed that the correct placement of the mitotic spindle is important for the development of the skin of mouse embryos and the formation of the hair of adult mice. Seldin et al. also found that the NuMA protein binds to the tips of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle. This binding activity is important for NuMA to be able to position the mitotic spindle correctly in the cell. The findings suggest similarities between how cells orient mitotic spindles and how they segregate DNA during cell division.</p> <p>More work is now needed to better understand how NuMA collaborates with force-generating molecular motors to precisely orient the mitotic spindle in the cell. In addition, understanding how spindle orientation dictates the fate of cells in the skin is an important future goal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12504.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12504.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>NuMA</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR067203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechler</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechler</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muroyama</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly identified microtubule binding activity of NuMA is required for orienting the mitotic spindle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of complex tissues requires the coordination of cell fate decisions with the generation of correct tissue architecture. Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) serve to harmonize these two processes by both generating cellular diversity and dictating tissue structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Betschinger and Knoblich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Poulson and Lechler, 2012</xref>). ACDs are driven by robust positioning of the mitotic spindle, a tightly regulated process that is orchestrated by several conserved proteins. However, our incomplete understanding of the mechanism underlying spindle orientation, as well as the lack of genetic tools to specifically perturb this process in adult mammalian tissues have prevented us from appreciating its function in various organ systems.</p><p>An LGN/NuMA/dynein-dynactin complex is a conserved regulator of spindle orientation in a number of cell types, including epidermal and neural progenitors in mammals, neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zygotic divisions in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Loss-of-function studies on these proteins have revealed their essential roles in spindle orientation and force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Izumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Siller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Skop and White, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, targeting dynein/dynactin to the cell cortex was sufficient to induce spindle movements, consistent with it playing a direct role in force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>). These data have led to the proposition that LGN and NuMA form a passive tether, which provides a high level of regulatory control over dynein accumulation at the cell cortex, and that dynein-dependent forces position the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kotak and Gonczy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics is another important factor in driving proper spindle orientation. For example, local taxol treatment at the posterior end of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote prevented spindle movement toward that pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, in contrast to the current model in metazoans, the spindle orientation process in yeast requires not only dynein-dependent pulling forces, but also MT depolymerization at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>). Present models include a kinetochore-like mechanism of capturing the energy from MT depolymerization to power spindle movement. Therefore, there is precedence for MT dynamics playing an important role during spindle orientation.</p><p>In addition to its ability to recruit dynein/dynactin to the cell cortex, NuMA contains a domain that directly interacts with MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Du et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haren and Merdes, 2002</xref>). This MT-binding domain (MTBD) is conserved among flies, worms, and mammals and has been characterized to stabilize and bundle MTs. Whether the MT-binding activity of NuMA is important for mitotic spindle orientation has not been tested.</p><p>The epidermis has emerged an as ideal tissue to understand the mechanism and functions of spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). The tissue architecture allows for robust and reproducible determination of spindle angles while genetic and cell culture systems have allowed further exploration of the mechanisms. In embryonic development, spindle orientation is required for proper stratification and differentiation of the epidermis. The role of spindle orientation in epidermal appendages like hair follicles, which are highly organized structures, has not yet been reported. That said, stereotypical spindle orientations have been reported at several stages of hair follicle morphogenesis, suggesting that they may play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>). Direct testing of this will require development of genetic tools that specifically disrupt spindle orientation.</p><p>Here, we report that NuMA can specifically localize to the tips of MTs, consistent with a role in mediating cortex/astral MT interactions. Loss of NuMA’s MTBD resulted in spindle orientation defects both in intact epidermis and in the hair follicle, leading to perturbation of differentiation and loss of tissue function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NuMA localizes to microtubule tips</title><p>Previous studies have defined NuMA’s minimal MTBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Du et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haren and Merdes, 2002</xref>). When expressed in cultured mouse keratinocytes, however, we observed only weak co-localization between GFP-MTBD and MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This was true at both high and low levels of expression, and including or excluding the adjacent LGN-binding domain of NuMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, when constructs that encoded additional amino-terminal regions were transfected, we noted robust association with the MT lattice in cells that expressed high levels of the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was true in constructs containing the linker region between the 4.1 and LGN binding domains of NuMA, but not those that lacked this region. When highly overexpressed, the fusion proteins appeared to stabilize and bundle MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At lower levels of expression, however, we observed punctate MT localization of the fusion proteins that contained the linker region, LGN binding domain and the MTBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Zoomed-in views of these images show that these puncta localize along MTs and often accumulate at MT tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’,C’</xref>). The MT density is very high in many keratinocytes, which makes it challenging to see a precise co-localization. We therefore examined the localization of these fusion proteins in regions of the cell periphery where MTs were sparse. Co-staining with α-tubulin revealed discrete localization to MT plus tips near the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–G’’</xref>). Thus, a region of NuMA spanning the linker domain (which follows the 4.1-binding domain) to the MTBD localizes to MT tips. We refer to this entire region as 'NuMA-TIP' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12504.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NuMA localizes to microtubule tips.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of NuMA showing interaction domains for dynein/dynactin, 4.1 family proteins, LGN, and MTs as well as the nuclear localization sequence (NLS).

However, co-staining revealed that NuMA-TIP and Eb1 only very rarely colocalized on the same MT tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,K,K</xref>’ &lt;2% of MTs, n = 200). This could be due to their mutually exclusive steric interactions and/or association with distinct MT end structures.</p><p>To better characterize the properties of the NuMA-TIP protein fragment, we examined how alterations in MT dynamics affected its localization. Many +TIP tracking proteins bind exclusively to growing MT ends and are displaced under depolymerization conditions, which can be triggered using nocodazole treatment. In stark contrast, NuMA-TIP localized specifically to both MT plus and minus ends following treatment with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,K’,K’’</xref>). This was in contrast to Eb1, which was displaced from the tip and labeled the MT lattice upon nocodazole addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K’’</xref>). Since nocodazole significantly decreased the density of MTs and helped resolve MT ends, this treatment revealed that NuMA-TIP clearly favors binding to MT ends over MT sides. This same localization pattern was also observed in transfected HeLa cells, demonstrating that this MT tip-binding behavior of NuMA is not unique to keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>While MT plus and minus ends are structurally distinct, both undergo depolymerization that involves protofilaments curling off of the tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tran et al., 1997</xref>). NuMA-TIP localization to nocodazole-treated MT ends suggested that it might preferentially bind to depolymerizing MTs and/or to those exhibiting protofilament curling. To determine whether NuMA-TIP localization correlates with the status of MT tips, we treated cells with either low doses of vinblastine, which promotes protofilament curling, or taxol, which straightens MT ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elie-Caille et al., 2007</xref>). Under the vinblastine conditions used, this drug did not significantly alter MT density or organization. We found that a higher percentage of vinblastine-treated cells showed MT tip localization of NuMA-TIP when compared with DMSO-treated cells, while taxol treatment resulted in a significant loss of MT tip localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This suggests that NuMA preferentially recognizes flayed MT ends over straight ends and is consistent with a report that NuMA interacts preferentially with vinblastine-induced curled MTs over taxol-stabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Volkov et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, while NuMA-TIP co-localized well with MT tips in the presence of low-dose vinblastine, we did not observe association with the tubulin aggregates formed in cells treated with higher doses of vinblastine (data not shown).</p><p>Endogenous NuMA also exhibited MT tip localization. In early prometaphase, before NuMA had strongly accumulated at both the spindle poles and the cortex, we noted discrete puncta at MT tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Briefly treating cells with nocodazole resulted in enhanced tip localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We therefore examined which regions of NuMA were necessary for MT tip localization. Analysis of full-length NuMA localization requires the examination of mitotic cells, since NuMA is sequestered in the nucleus in interphase. To circumvent this issue, we examined the localization of NuMA fusion constructs lacking the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) alone, or in combination with the loss of the MTBD or the entire NuMA-TIP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed association of GFP-NuMAΔNLS with MT tips when the fusion protein was expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Conversely, cells expressing a NuMA construct that lacked both the NLS and TIP region did not exhibit any MT tip localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This region is therefore both necessary and sufficient for NuMA’s MT tip interactions. Importantly, deletion of the MTBD domain alone (which keeps the LGN-binding domain intact) compromises tip-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The LGN-binding domain is required for cortical targeting of NuMA, which is necessary for its role in spindle orientation. Therefore, a NuMA mutant harboring a MTBD domain deletion allows us to test the role of MT tip-binding activity during spindle orientation without disrupting other critical domains of NuMA that are known to be required for its cortical localization.</p><p>The association of NuMA with MT ends after nocodazole treatment suggested that it might associate with stalled or depolymerizing MTs. To address this, we performed time-lapse analysis of GFP-NuMA-TIP dynamics in cultured keratinocytes either alone or in combination with ensconsin’s MT-binding domain (EMTB) fused to tdTomato to label MTs. Live-imaging of cells expressing low levels of the construct revealed puncta that corresponded to MT tips. Many of the brighter puncta were stationary, consistent with NuMA-TIP’s role in stabilizing MTs. In addition, we observed motile GFP puncta tracking toward the cell periphery along MT plus tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, these puncta remained localized to the ends of depolymerizing MTs. This behavior was also evident at the centrosome (which displayed NuMA-TIP localization as well) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that NuMA can remain attached to both growing and shrinking MT ends and suggests that this may be functionally important for facilitating the interactions of astral MT tips with the cell cortex during spindle orientation.</p><p>To determine whether NuMA-TIP could directly interact with MTs and MT tips, we purified a GFP and 6XHis-tagged version of this protein from bacteria. We took advantage of the GFP tag to ask whether we could detect association of purified NuMA-TIP with MTs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, NuMA-TIP at high concentrations decorated the MT lattice, although we often observed enhanced accumulation at MT tips. At lower concentrations, however, we observed specific association with MT tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). On short MTs, we also observed localization of GFP-NuMA-TIP on both MT ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), consistent with our findings in cells. In all these experiments, MTs were treated briefly with nocodazole before fixation to promote their depolymerization. While these data cannot rule out roles for accessory proteins in modulating NuMA’s association with MTs, they do demonstrate that NuMA-TIP is sufficient for direct interaction with MT ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NuMA’s MTBD is required for spindle orientation in cultured keratinocytes</title><p>To directly test whether NuMA’s MTBD is required for spindle orientation, we took advantage of the robust ability of cultured keratinocytes to align their mitotic spindle with the cortical NuMA crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>). We used NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (which harbor a floxed allele of Numa1 Exon 22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Silk et al., 2009</xref>) to generate NuMAΔMTBD keratinocytes. Cre-induced recombination in these cells results in the in-frame deletion of NuMA’s MTBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>). As described above, this mutation causes loss of MT tip localization, but preserves the LGN-binding domain that is necessary for targeting NuMA to the cell cortex and promoting spindle orientation. To generate these cells, we treated primary keratinocytes isolated from NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with either adeno-GFP (control) or adeno-Cre virus (mutant), picked clones, and validated recombination by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Loss of the MTBD did not impair localization of NuMA to either the spindle poles or cell cortex; however, it did cause a defect in spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). More than 80% of control cells had spindles oriented within 30 degrees of the center of the cortical NuMA crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, NuMAΔMTBD cells showed a complete randomization of division orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results were found by overexpressing NuMAΔMTBD-GFP in wild-type keratinocytes, demonstrating that this acts as a dominant-negative allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We found that p150<sup>glued</sup> of the dynactin complex co-localized with the cortical crescents of both NuMA and NuMAΔMTBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). This was true in 100% of cells examined (n = 50 from two experiments). In contrast, we recently published that knockdown of NuMA resulted in an almost complete loss of cortical dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>). Similar results were found upon overexpression of NuMAΔMTBD-GFP in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). While the fusion protein localized normally and co-localized with dynein/dynactin, its overexpression resulted in spindle misorientation. These data demonstrate that cortical recruitment of dynein/dynactin is not sufficient for proper spindle orientation and that NuMA’s MTBD provides an essential additional function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NuMA’s MTBD is required for epidermal spindle orientation and differentiation</title><p>In contrast to cultured keratinocytes, mitotic spindles in situ align either parallel to the basement membrane to generate two basal progenitors, or perpendicular to it to generate one basal progenitor and one suprabasal cell that will differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smart, 1970</xref>). To determine whether NuMA-MT interactions were critical for spindle orientation in vivo, we crossed the NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse line described above with Keratin 14-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>), generating an in-frame deletion of the MTBD in epidermal progenitors. Due to the small change in protein size, we validated recombination by PCR analysis of isolated epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We analyzed NuMA localization in embryonic tissue sections and confirmed that the mutant form localized normally to spindle poles and the cortex of mitotic cells, consistent with our findings in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). We then scored spindle orientation using cryosections from e17.5 backskin by measuring the angle between the anaphase spindle and the basement membrane. In agreement with previous studies, controls showed a bimodal distribution of orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Quantitation of spindle angles in mutant epidermis showed a dramatic decrease in perpendicular spindles coupled with an increase in oblique and parallel spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). This defect was not an indirect effect of loss of polarity or cell death, as both the Golgi and centrosomes showed proper polarization and cleaved caspase 3-positive cells did not significantly increase in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). While previous work on spindle orientation in NuMA knockdown mice revealed a dramatic shift toward parallel spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Williams et al., 2011</xref>), it is important to note that the basal cells of those mice were largely devoid of NuMA, thus preventing cortical dynein recruitment. The randomized spindle angles observed in NuMAΔMTBD mice are likely due to the maintenance of cortical dynein, which cannot efficiently orient the spindle in the absence of NuMA-MT interactions.</p><p>Loss of NuMA does not cause mitotic spindle assembly defects in cultured keratinocytes, mammalian epidermis or fly neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Siller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). However, previous analysis of NuMAΔMTBD mice harboring a full body deletion suggested that this region was essential for development and that cultured mutant fibroblasts had mitotic spindle defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Silk et al., 2009</xref>). To reconcile these findings, we analyzed mitotic spindles in both NuMAΔMTBD cultured keratinocytes and mouse epidermis. We did not detect any defects in mitotic morphology, stage, or number in mutant keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–G</xref>). Metaphase and anaphase spindles exhibited normal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The localization of NuMA to the cell cortex, the incidence of abnormal spindles and the extent of mis-aligned DNA were all similar between control and NuMAΔMTBD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). This was true both in primary keratinocytes directly isolated from newborn backskin as well as the clonal lines described above. There were also no significant differences in the percentage of cells in different mitotic stages or their spindle lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of mutant epidermal cells revealed no evidence of aneuploidy or polyploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Finally, the phenotype that we observed is distinct from those caused by mutations in mitotic regulators, arguing against an underlying mitotic defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foijer et al., 2013</xref>). This stands in stark contrast to past findings in cultured fibroblasts and thus suggests the possibility of cell-type specific roles for NuMA.

Mice with epidermal loss of NuMA’s MTBD were neonatal lethal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This lethality was associated with a mild barrier defect, as observed by an X-gal penetration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These observations led us to investigate whether underlying differentiation defects contributed to lethality. In control mice, keratin 5/14 marked a monolayer of proliferative basal cells, while keratin 10 was present in their differentiated progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In mutant mice, we observed an expansion of K5/14- positive cells into suprabasal layers and their mixing with K10-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These defects were noticed as early as e16.5, before epidermal barrier activity is fully established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Later differentiation markers, such as loricrin and filaggrin, were present at much lower levels in mutant skin, explaining in part the compromised barrier and neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). There was also a dramatic upregulation of the stress marker keratin 6 in mutant skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). Consistent with a differentiation defect, we observed increased numbers of cycling cells in the mutant suprabasal epidermis by both BrdU and phospho-histone H3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–P</xref>). In addition, we noted an increase in basal cell proliferation, which is likely a consequence of barrier dysfunction. In support of this, analysis of e16.5 epidermis (a stage at which the barrier is just beginning to form) revealed an increase in suprabasal cell divisions, but not in basal divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>). These studies demonstrate that high levels of spindle misorientation are not tolerated and that the oblique divisions observed cannot promote proper differentiation of the epidermis. Previous data suggested that low levels of spindle misorientation were not detrimental to epidermal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, there appears to be a critical threshold at which a decrease in functionally asymmetric divisions impairs development.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12504.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Loss of NuMA’s MTBD in the embryonic epidermis results in differentiation defects and neonatal lethality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X-gal penetration assay of e18.5 NuMAΔMTBD and littermate control mice shows a mild barrier defect in the mutant.

The NuMAΔMTBD mouse line therefore serves as an invaluable tool that allows us to specifically address the role of spindle orientation in a tissue context. Previously, it has not been possible to specifically perturb spindle orientation during postnatal hair morphogenesis. The hair follicle is a highly organized epidermal appendage that undergoes cycles of growth, regression and rest throughout an animal’s lifetime. The growth phase, called anagen, is responsible for producing the fully differentiated hair shaft. Three proliferative compartments of the hair follicle, the bulge stem cells, the outer root sheath (ORS) and the transit-amplifying matrix cells, are responsible for generating the cell types that make up the mature hair follicle.</p><p>We generated inducible epidermal NuMAΔMTBD mice by crossing to a keratin 5-Cre<sup>ER</sup> mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>).

Matrix cells are rapidly dividing and give rise to several distinct lineages, making them ideal candidates for utilizing spindle orientation. While bulge and ORS cells are contiguous with the interfollicular basal layer and express keratin 14, matrix cells are keratin 14-negative. Using previously generated mice in which NuMA-GFP is expressed under the control of the keratin 14 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>), we could rescue NuMA expression in the bulge and ORS (in Krt14-Cre;NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice), resulting in mice with a matrix-specific MTBD deletion that we will refer to as 'matrixΔMTBD' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Krt14-NuMA-GFP expression was sufficient to fully rescue the neonatal lethality caused by embryonic loss of NuMA’s MTBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, these mice displayed severe hair growth defects, indicating a critical role for NuMA’s MTBD in matrix cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The small tufts of backskin hair present at early stages in matrixΔMTBD mice was lost during subsequent hair cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While these findings implicate spindle orientation in matrix function, they do not rule out the possibility that NuMA’s MTBD plays a critical role within other hair cell types as well.</p><p>To determine whether spindle orientation was disrupted in matrixΔMTBD mice, we analyzed cryosections from P2 control and mutant follicular epidermis before overt changes in follicle architecture became apparent. Spindle orientation was quantitated similar to that in the embryonic epidermis by measuring the angle formed by the anaphase spindle relative to the underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared with controls, the spindles of matrix cells lacking NuMA’s MTBD exhibited a randomization of orientations (similar to the orientation pattern seen in knockout interfollicular epidermis), demonstrating that the MTBD is critical for robust spindle positioning within this cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>).</p><p>To determine the impact of this defective spindle orientation, we examined markers of the distinct cell lineages of the hair follicle. Keratins 5 and 6 mark the ORS and companion layer of the hair follicle, respectively, and demonstrated similar staining patterns in control and mutant follicles. Additionally, the matrix marker P-cadherin showed normal staining in both control and mutants, indicating that the matrix population was properly specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–N</xref>). In contrast, AE13 and GATA3, which mark the hair shaft and inner root sheath (IRS) cells (all matrix descendants), respectively, were decreased and/or disorganized in the mutant follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O–R</xref>). Therefore, robust spindle orientation is necessary for the proper differentiation of matrix progeny.</p><p>Notably, the matrix-derived hair shaft and IRS cell lineages are also lost when BMP signaling is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kobielak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kulessa et al., 2000</xref>). In fact, BMP signaling is one of the earliest detectable steps in the differentiation of these lineages. We therefore analyzed BMP activation status to determine whether spindle orientation was required for BMP activity. Analysis of BMP activity using anti-pSMAD1/5 antibodies revealed a loss of signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S,T</xref>). These data are consistent with BMP signaling acting downstream of these asymmetric divisions. Examination of older mice revealed additional phenotypic similarities with mice in which BMP signaling was blocked, including cyst formation and aberrant spatial localization of follicular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice lacked markers for IRS and hair shaft, they appeared to be non-proliferative, as judged by lack of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). One of the simplest models suggests that BMP inhibitors in the dermal papilla locally impede BMP signaling in matrix cells, while more distant cells undergo active signaling. Our data demonstrate that a spindle orientation-dependent event is also required to activate BMP signaling, which is therefore not simply driven by compartmentalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While precise control of spindle orientation has been documented in an increasing number of developmental and physiological contexts, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we have documented a new role for NuMA, one of the core components of the spindle orientation machinery. In addition to being important for the recruitment of dynein/dynactin to the cortex, we have found that NuMA’s dynein-independent interactions with MTs are also essential for spindle orientation.</p><p>We report an unusual and previously unreported co-localization of NuMA with MT tips and define a region within NuMA that is both necessary and sufficient for this localization. While it is likely that the direct interactions provided by the NuMA-TIP region contribute to the specific binding of NuMA to MT tips, we cannot rule out that additional proteins are required to increase NuMA’s MT tip-binding affinity. The properties of NuMA-TIP are distinct from many tip-binding proteins. Most notably, NuMA-TIP remains associated with stalled and or depolymerizing MTs. To date, there are very few proteins known to exhibit MT depolymerization-tracking behavior (either directly or indirectly). The few known examples are kinetochore proteins of different species, including the Dam1 complex, CENP-E, CENP-F, and the Ndc-80 complex. Of these, only Dam1 has been shown to follow depolymerizing MTs in vivo, while the others can do this in vitro, yet remain at the kinetochore-MT interface in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Westermann et al., 2006</xref>). Depolymerizing kinesins have also been observed to localize to both plus and minus ends of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Desai et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>While a previous study demonstrated that artificially targeting dynein to the cortex was sufficient to induce spindle oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>), our data suggest that cortical dynein is not sufficient to robustly position the spindle and that NuMA-MT interactions are also required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A simple model in which all forces during spindle orientation are generated by dynein-dependent pulling on astral MTs is still formally possible, with NuMA acting simply to provide MT stabilization, thus making astral MTs better substrates for dynein-directed forces. While a viable possibility, this is not consistent with local stabilization of MTs inhibiting spindle movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, NuMA’s unique MT-binding qualities revealed in this study could allow it to interact with depolymerizing MTs and harness their energy to promote spindle rotation, thus collaborating with dynein pulling forces to robustly orient the spindle. This latter idea is similar to kinetochores harnessing MT depolymerization for chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McIntosh et al., 2010</xref>). Both the association of MT dynamics with force generation observed during spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Labbe et al., 2003</xref>), as well as work showing the ability of depolymerizing MTs to generate force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McIntosh et al., 2010</xref>) are consistent with this second possibility. This is not without precedent, as positioning of the budding yeast spindle relies on regulated depolymerization at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>). If and how depolymerization activity is coordinated with dynein/dynactin will require further investigation. It is also possible that both stabilization and tracking depolymerizing MTs are important activities of NuMA that are used at distinct sites/times. For example, NuMA has been shown to collect at the minus ends of severed MTs in the mitotic spindle where it may act to stabilize the free ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elting et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12504.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for NuMA and ACD functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of interactions required for spindle orientation. NuMA interacts with MTs via a carboxy-terminal domain, as well as with dynein/dynactin in its amino terminus. Both these interactions are likely required for robust spindle orientation. Only a single NuMA dimer is illustrated for simplicity, although it is also thought to multimerize. NuMA may act to stabilize the MT end or, alternatively, may couple its depolymerization to force generation for spindle positioning. (<bold>B</bold>) Comparison of the repetitive uses of spindle orientation in the embryonic epidermis and adult hair follicle. In both cases, spindles align perpendicular to the underlying basement membrane in a significant portion of cells in a NuMA-dependent manner. Whereas cell fate decisions in embryonic epidermis are Notch-dependent, cell fate choices in the hair follicle are BMP-dependent. In neither case do we understand the molecular connection between spindle orientation and the activation of these pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12504.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12504.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12504-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Our data further demonstrate the developmental roles for spindle orientation in two distinct cellular environments. Consistent with previous studies, loss of spindle orientation in the developing epidermis resulted in embryonic lethality that is likely due to epidermal differentiation defects. These data raise the question of whether the early embryonic lethality observed in the full mouse NuMA MTBD knockout was due to mitotic defects, defects in spindle positioning or a combination of these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Silk et al. 2009</xref>). While the phenotype that resulted from the epidermal-specific loss of NuMA’s MTBD in this study was less severe than that seen upon shRNA depletion of either LGN or NuMA, there are two plausible explanations to reconcile this discrepancy. First, the gene ablations in the previous study were initiated prior to epidermal stratification, whereas our knockout occured during the process of stratification. Second, loss of full-length NuMA or LGN resulted in a drastic conversion of ACDs (perpendicular spindles) to SCDs (parallel), while loss of NuMA’s MTBD resulted in a conversion of ACDs to randomized division orientations.</p><p>The finding that the NuMA MTBD deletion primarily affects spindle orientation without observable effects on either cell polarity or cell division establishes the NuMA-MTBD deletion mice as a valuable tool to study the in vivoroles of spindle orientation in intact tissues. We have taken advantage of this by being the first to demonstrate an essential requirement for spindle orientation in hair follicle morphogenesis. While prior reports have presented correlative data to suggest that spindle orientation contributes to hair follicle morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>), we have quantitated division orientations within the rapidly proliferating matrix compartment and demonstrated the importance of spindle orientation in these cells. Similar to the interfollicular epidermis in the embryo, divisions can be either parallel or perpendicular to the underlying basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The percentage of matrix cell perpendicular divisions decreased in the mutant and resulted in differentiation defects in matrix-derived lineages. One of the earliest known steps of differentiation along these pathways is BMP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kobielak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kulessa et al., 2000</xref>), and loss of BMP signaling resulted in phenotypes similar to loss of spindle orientation. In both cases, IRS and hair shaft markers are decreased or absent. The matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice described here as well as the BMPRIA mutant are non-proliferative, suggesting that they may be segregated from pro-proliferative signals from the basement membrane and/or dermal papilla. Surprisingly, in the absence of proper spindle orientation, the activation of BMP signaling does not occur. While the compartmentalized activation of BMP could have been due solely to the presence of BMP inhibitors in the DP preventing signaling in adjacent matrix cells, our data demonstrate that a spindle orientation-dependent step is required for cells to become responsive to BMP signaling. Whether this acts directly on the BMP signaling pathway or lies upstream of it is not currently known. Understanding the molecular basis of this requirement is a clear future goal to understand how differentiation and morphogenesis are controlled. In summary, we reveal that a reiterative use of spindle orientation machinery generates very distinct structures (stratified interfollicular epithelium versus hair follicles) within the same tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>NuMA-MTBD<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice, K14-Cre, K5-CreER and K14-NuMA-GFP mice were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Silk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This study examined the role of a previously identified microtubule-binding domain within NuMA in spindle orientation using a very nice mammalian experimental system. The authors shows the requirement of MT binding by NuMA in spindle orientation: NuMA's MT binding domain (NuMA-TIP) binds to &quot;curled MT end&quot; (characteristic to depolymerizing phase) as opposed to growing MT end. The authors convincingly show that recruitment of dynein to the cortex by NuMA is not sufficient for spindle orientation, and instead the correct spindle orientation requires NuMA's MT binding. NuMA mutant that specifically lacks MT binding domain results in spindle orientation defect without compromising any other aspects of spindle (morphology or assembly), providing a unique opportunity to study the role of spindle orientation during development. The authors examined the phenotype of such mutants in the context of epidermis and hair follicle development. Their results clearly demonstrate the critical importance of spindle orientation during development.</p> <p>Although the mechanism of spindle orientation in the context of development has been studied extensively, there are not many examples where spindle orientation defect solely led to this extent of dramatic phenotype.</p> <p>Overall, the experiments are executed and interpreted very carefully, meeting the highest standard of cell biology. Yet, the authors further go on to examine the implication of their finding in the context of development. This is a rare example to clearly demonstrate the role of spindle orientation in organogenesis, separating spindle orientation and assembly issues. This manuscript provides fundamental insight for both epithelial and cell biology fields.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>There are a few important points to be addressed in revision as summarized below.</p> <p>1) Because it is difficult to show NuMA's localization in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and later) at the resolution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> it remains somewhat unclear whether tissue phenotypes indeed stem from NuMA's MT binding domain characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> Therefore we recommend using more careful language in explaining the tissue data. Also, if possible, additional experiments can be added to strengthen the points.</p> <p>1i) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> show that cortical recruitment of both NuMA and dynactin(/dynein) is retained when NuMA-deltaMTBD is expressed. However, the authors show that this crescent localization no longer aligns with the mitotic spindle. This finding is in contrast with Kotek et al., 2012, which demonstrates that dynein targeted to the plasma membrane is sufficient to direct spindle positioning.</p> <p>1ii) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that K14Cre/NuMA-deltaMTBD mice have an epidermal differentiation defect caused by spindle randomization, which leads to an incomplete barrier. However from the data presented it remains unclear if these defects are direct effects from initial problems in epidermal stratification or if these are secondary/inflammatory effects from the barrier defect. To resolve these possibilities we suggest the authors perform an earlier time-course of epidermal stratification (e14,15,16) within this model to elucidate the primary defects that lead to the phenotype seen by e18.5.</p> <p>1iii) The authors demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that the MatrixdeltaMTBD hair follicles lack active BMP signaling in the inner root sheath (IRS). However the differentiation state of these cells remains unclear. If we are to take the authors assumption that these IRS cells from the matrix have not differentiated, then what state are they in? Are they undifferentiated? The authors show BrdU positive cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> but is not clear whether those follicles are equivalent in growth stage as the ones analysed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Performing a Brdu pulse at P2 to match the time-points used in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–S</xref> can help to understand whether these cells are in fact stacked into an undifferentiated state.</p> <p>1iv) Finally, it remains unclear how changes in spindle orientation directly lead to these phenotypes. If cells in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle matrix are skewed toward parallel and oblique divisions from the basement membrane, shouldn't the authors see an accumulation of cells in these basal compartments? This is not apparent in any of the data presented. Furthermore, if there is not an increase in basal cell density in these compartments then how do these cells become suprabasal? Additionally, if excess basal cells are able to become suprabasal, then how do they achieve this? Is this a cell autonomous process?</p> <p>2) Why the MT binding domain is required for spindle orientation is not addressed in this work except to postulate a model where the essential function takes place at the cortex. Thus, the new contributions are a more detailed characterization of NuMA's MT binding activity, the demonstration that this activity is not required for localization of NuMA or Dynein, and the demonstration that this activity is required for spindle orientation, both in vitro and in vivo. On the one hand, it could be argued that the lack of significant mechanistic insight reduces the appeal of the work to non-specialists, however it is also true that our understanding of NuMA's role in spindle orientation has been slow in coming. That said, I believe there are several experimental issues that should be addressed before publication.</p> <p>2i) A key mechanistic finding is that the microtubule binding activity is not required for localization of NuMA or Dynein to the cortex. This should be supported by quantification and by a negative control (that under the experimental conditions used by the authors, p150glued cortical localization requires NuMA).</p> <p>2ii) The authors’ model includes simultaneous engagement of both LGN and MTs by NuMA but previous work by Macara's group (Du et al. Current Biology 2002) showed that LGN inhibits NuMA's MT binding activity. The authors should verify that they do not see this competition, which would invalidate their model.</p></body> </sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12504.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>1) Because it is difficult to show NuMA's localization in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and later) at the resolution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> it remains somewhat unclear whether tissue phenotypes indeed stem from NuMA's MT binding domain characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.

This finding is in contrast with Kotek et al., 2012, which demonstrates that dynein targeted to the plasma membrane is sufficient to direct spindle positioning.</italic> </p> <p>Yes, we agree and this was a major point of our manuscript. Kotak et al. demonstrated that dynein was sufficient to induce spindle oscillations when targeted in an unpolarized manner to the cell cortex. However, assays for spindle orientation (relative to an internal or external landmark) were not performed. Their data, therefore, demonstrate that cortical dynein can induce forces on spindles, however, they do not show that this is sufficient for robust orientation of the mitotic spindle. Our data demonstrate that it is not. Additionally, it is important to point out that endogenous NuMA was present in these spindle oscillation assays that may have collaborated with dynein/dynactin.</p> <p>We added the following sentence in the Discussion to emphasize this point. “While a previous study demonstrated that artificially targeting dynein to the cortex was sufficient to induce spindle oscillations (Kotak et al., 2012), our data suggest that cortical dynein is not sufficient to robustly position the spindle and that NuMA-MT interactions are also required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).”</p> <p><italic>1ii) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggests that K14Cre/NuMA-deltaMTBD mice have an epidermal differentiation defect caused by spindle randomization, which leads to an incomplete barrier. However from the data presented it remains unclear if these defects are direct effects from initial problems in epidermal stratification or if these are secondary/inflammatory effects from the barrier defect. To resolve these possibilities we suggest the authors perform an earlier time-course of epidermal stratification (e14,15,16) within this model to elucidate the primary defects that lead to the phenotype seen by e18.5.</italic> </p> <p>We have included analysis of differentiation at e16.5 (both stratification and gene recombination begin at e14.5 so this is the earliest time point when we expected to see phenotypes). While not as dramatic as that seen at e18.5, we found many focal regions with disruptions in the transition to differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the phenotypes seen are unlikely to be secondary to inflammatory effects as these do not occur embryonically. As discussed in the initial manuscript, we find that the increase in basal cell proliferation (at e18.5) is likely due to secondary defects as it was not seen at e16.5. This is in contrast to suprabasal proliferation (another sign of defective differentiation), which was present at both e16.5 and e18.5.</p> <p><italic>1iii) The authors demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that the MatrixdeltaMTBD hair follicles lack active BMP signaling in the inner root sheath (IRS). However the differentiation state of these cells remains unclear. If we are to take the authors assumption that these IRS cells from the matrix have not differentiated, then what state are they in? Are they undifferentiated? The authors show BrdU positive cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> but is not clear whether those follicles are equivalent in growth stage as the ones analysed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Performing a Brdu pulse at P2 to match the time-points used in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–S</xref> can help to understand whether these cells are in fact stacked into an undifferentiated state.</italic> </p> <p>The fate of the matrix-derived cells is a very interesting point and one that we remain unclear about. We have looked at proliferation (both by BrdU and by Ki67 staining) and find that it remains restricted to the matrix, see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that matrix localization is sufficient in this case to restrict proliferative activity. This is likely due to either basement membrane attachment or pro-proliferative cues in the local environment. These data are similar to those seen upon disruption of BMPRIA – inner root sheath (IRS) markers were lost, yet proliferation remained restricted to the matrix. Positive markers for the differentiated cells remain unknown.</p> <p>We added to the following in the text:</p> <p>Results: “Although matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice lacked markers for IRS and hair shaft, they appeared to be non-proliferative, as judged by lack of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). “</p> <p>Discussion: “In both cases, IRS and hair shaft markers are decreased or absent. The matrix-derived cells in the mutant mice described here as well as the BMPRIA mutant are non-proliferative, suggesting that they may be segregated from pro-proliferative signals from the basement membrane and/or dermal papilla.”</p> <p><italic>1iv) Finally, it remains unclear how changes in spindle orientation directly lead to these phenotypes. If cells in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle matrix are skewed toward parallel and oblique divisions from the basement membrane, shouldn't the authors see an accumulation of cells in these basal compartments? This is not apparent in any of the data presented. Furthermore, if there is not an increase in basal cell density in these compartments then how do these cells become suprabasal? Additionally, if excess basal cells are able to become suprabasal, then how do they achieve this? Is this a cell autonomous process?</italic> </p> <p>This is a very interesting question and one that we have attempted to address by examining the density of basal cells in the mutant epidermis. We found that there was a 6% increase in density (102+/-2 cells/mm in the control and 108+/-3 cells/mm in the mutant). This result did not reach statistical significance and we have therefore not included it in the text. We should note that knockdown of LGN in vivo caused almost all spindles to be oriented parallel to the basement membrane resulting in symmetric divisions (Williams et al., Nature 2011) and this resulted in only a 17% increase in basal cell density. As that mutation was both more severe and was induced earlier than ours, it is not surprising that a more dramatic effect was not seen. While we do not have data to directly address this, we feel it is likely that cells are lost from the basal layer either through an active delamination or through extrusion. However, this appears insufficient for proper differentiation.</p> <p><italic>2) Why the MT binding domain is required for spindle orientation is not addressed in this work except to postulate a model where the essential function takes place at the cortex. Thus, the new contributions are a more detailed characterization of NuMA's MT binding activity, the demonstration that this activity is not required for localization of NuMA or Dynein, and the demonstration that this activity is required for spindle orientation, both</italic> in vitro <italic>and</italic> in vivo<italic>. On the one hand, it could be argued that the lack of significant mechanistic insight reduces the appeal of the work to non-specialists, however it is also true that our understanding of NuMA's role in spindle orientation has been slow in coming. That said, I believe there are several experimental issues that should be addressed before publication.</italic> </p> <p><italic>2i) A key mechanistic finding is that the microtubule binding activity is not required for localization of NuMA or Dynein to the cortex. This should be supported by quantification and by a negative control (that under the experimental conditions used by the authors, p150glued cortical localization requires NuMA).</italic> </p> <p>We have included a quantitation (subheading “NuMA’s MTBD is required for epidermal spindle orientation and differentiation.”). We find that 100% of cells with detectable cortical NuMA have p150-glued co-localized at this site. This is true for both the control cells and the NuMA-MTBD deleted cells. Although we do not include the negative control in this paper, we recently published that upon knockdown of NuMA, over 95% of cells lose detectable p150-glued cortical localization (consistent with findings from a number of other investigators).</p> <p>We add the following to the Results section:</p> <p>“This was true in 100% of cells examined (n=50 from two experiments). In contrast, we recently published that knockdown of NuMA resulted in an almost complete loss of cortical dynactin (Seldin et al., 2013).”</p> <p><italic>2ii) The authors’ model includes simultaneous engagement of both LGN and MTs by NuMA but previous work by Macara's group (Du</italic> et al. <italic>Current Biology 2002) showed that LGN inhibits NuMA's MT binding activity. The authors should verify that they do not see this competition, which would invalidate their model.</italic> </p> <p>We have no reason to doubt the mutual exclusivity of binding that was reported previously. In fact, the finding that the NuMA-TIP binding domain includes the LGN-binding site further suggests that these will compete.</p> <p>That said, it is important to note that those experiments were performed on monomeric fragments of NuMA. Full-length NuMA is an obligate dimer that also multimerizes (dodecamer when purified, Harborth et al. EMBO 1999). Therefore it is most likely that LGN and MTs can simultaneously interact with the complete complex, though not with isolated domains.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
