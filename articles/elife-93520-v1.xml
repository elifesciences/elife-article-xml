fitness. Whether and how the decreased growth fitness caused by genome reduction could be compensated by evolution was investigated here. Experimental evolution with an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain carrying a reduced genome was conducted in multiple lineages for approximately 1000 generations. The growth rate, which largely declined due to genome reduction, was considerably recovered, associated with the improved carrying capacity. Genome mutations accumulated during evolution were significantly varied across the evolutionary lineages and were randomly localized on the reduced genome. Transcriptome reorganization showed a common evolutionary direction and conserved the chromosomal periodicity, regardless of highly diversified gene categories, regulons, and pathways enriched in the differentially expressed genes. Genome mutations and transcriptome reorganization caused by evolution, which were found to be dissimilar to those caused by genome reduction, must have followed divergent mechanisms in individual evolutionary lineages. Gene network reconstruction successfully identified three gene modules functionally differentiated, which were responsible for the evolutionary changes of the reduced genome in growth fitness, genome mutation, and gene expression, respectively. The diversity in evolutionary approaches improved the growth fitness associated with the homeostatic transcriptome architecture as if the evolutionary compensation for genome reduction was like all roads leading to Rome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genome reduction</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>bacterial growth</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ying</surname><given-names>Bei-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K19815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ying</surname><given-names>Bei-Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diversified genetic and transcriptional changes in parallel evolved <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> populations for improved growth revealed that the evolution complementing genome reduction was like all roads leading to Rome.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genome encodes the information for cell growth, and its size is likely the evolutionary consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koonin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>). To determine the essential genomic sequence of modern cells, removing redundant DNA sequences from the wild-type genome in bacteria, so-called genome reduction, has been challenged to a large extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kotaka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato and Hashimoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pósfai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimoto et al., 2005</xref>). These efforts have been made to discover the minimal genetic requirement for a free-living organism growing under the defined conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aida and Ying, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breuer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutchison et al., 2016</xref>). It resulted in the finding of the coordination of genome with cell growth, that is, genome reduction significantly decreased the growth rate of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells independent of culture media or growth forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hitomi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xue et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2016</xref>). Slow growth or fitness decline was commonly observed in the genetically reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karcagi et al., 2016</xref>) and chemically synthesized genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutchison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The growth decrease could be recovered by experimental evolution. Growth fitness generally represents the adaptiveness of the living organism to the defined environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr, 2009</xref>). Although the reduced genomes somehow showed differentiated evolvability compared to the wild-type genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Csörgo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Umenhoffer et al., 2010</xref>), their evolutionary adaptation to the environmental changes has been successfully achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Experimental evolution under the defined culture condition successfully increased the decreased growth rates of the reduced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2019</xref>) and fastened the slow-growing synthetic genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moger-Reischer et al., 2023</xref>). The evolutionary rescue of the growth rate must be associated with the changes in genomic sequence and gene expression benefited for the growth fitness, as what happened in nature adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rozen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch, 2010</xref>). Our previous study showed that the decreased growth rate caused by the absence of a sizeable genomic sequence could be complemented by introducing the mutations elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the changes in growth rate caused by either genome reduction or experimental evolution were dependent on the genome size but not the specific gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A genome-wide understanding of the evolutionary compensated fitness increase of the reduced genome is required. The experimental evolution compensated for the genome reduction-mediated growth changes was considered stringently related to transcriptome reorganization. Previous studies have identified conserved features in transcriptome reorganization, despite significant disruption to gene expression patterns resulting from either genome reduction or experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsui et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ying and Yama, 2018</xref>). The findings indicated that experimental evolution might reinstate growth rates that have been disrupted by genome reduction to maintain homeostasis in growing cells. Although the reduced growth rate caused by genome reduction could be recovered by experimental evolution, it remains unclear whether such an evolutionary improvement in growth fitness was a general feature of the reduced genome and how the genome-wide changes occurred to match the growth fitness increase. In the present study, we performed the experimental evolution with a reduced genome in multiple lineages and analyzed the evolutionary changes of the genome and transcriptome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fitness recovery of the reduced genome by experimental evolution</title><p>Experimental evolution of the reduced genome was conducted to regain the growth fitness, which was decreased due to genome reduction. The <italic>E. coli</italic> strain carrying a reduced genome, derived from the wild-type genome W3110, showed a significant decline in its growth rate in the minimal medium compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2016</xref>). To improve the genome reduction-mediated decreased growth rate, the serial transfer of the genome-reduced strain was performed with multiple dilution rates to keep the bacterial growth within the exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>). Nine evolutionary lineages were conducted independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A gradual increase in growth rate was observed along with the generation passage, which was combined with a rapid increase in the early evolutionary phase and a slow increase in the later phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As the growth increases were calculated according to the initial and final records, the exponential growth rates of the ancestor and evolved populations were obtained according to the growth curves for a precise evaluation of the evolutionary changes in growth. The results demonstrated that most evolved populations (Evos) showed improved growth rates, in which eight out of nine Evos were highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). However, the magnitudes of growth improvement were considerably varied, and the evolutionary dynamics of the nine lineages were somehow divergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It indicated the diversity in the evolutionary approaches for improved fitness. Eight of nine Evos achieved faster growth than the genome-reduced ancestor (Anc), whereas all Evos decreased in their saturated population densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panel). In comparison to the wild-type strain carrying the full-length genome (WT), the primarily decreased growth rate caused by genome reduction was significantly improved by experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel), associated with the considerable reduction in saturated density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel). It demonstrated that the experimental evolution could compensate for the genome reduction with a trade-off in population size (carrying capacity), consistent with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fitness increase of the reduced genome mediated by experimental evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Temporal changes in growth rate.

It was consistent with the positive correlations between the colony growth rate and the colony size of a genome-reduced strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hitomi et al., 2022</xref>) and between the growth rates and the saturated population size of an assortment of genome-reduced strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the negative correlation between growth rate and carrying capacity, known as the <italic>r/K</italic> selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engen and Saether, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luckinbill, 1978</xref>), was often observed as the trade-off relationship between <italic>r</italic> and <italic>K</italic> in the evolution and ecology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marshall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wortel et al., 2018</xref>). As the <italic>r/K</italic> trade-off was proposed to balance the cellular metabolism that resulted from the cost of enzymes involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wortel et al., 2018</xref>), the deleted genes might play a role in maintaining the metabolism balance for the <italic>r/K</italic> correlation. On the other hand, the experimental evolution (i.e., serial transfer) was strictly performed within the exponential growth phase; thus, the evolutionary selection was supposed to be driven by the growth rate without selective pressure to maintain the carrying capacity. The declined carrying capacity might have been its neutral ‘drift’ but not a trade-off to the growth rate. Independent and parallel experimental evolution of the reduced genomes selecting either <italic>r</italic> or <italic>K</italic> is required to clarify the actual mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Significant variation and random localization of genome mutations</title><p>Genome resequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) identified a total of 65 mutations fixed in the nine Evos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The number of mutations largely varied among the nine Evos, from 2 to 13, and no common mutation was detected in all nine Evos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). A 1199 bp deletion of <italic>insH</italic> was frequently found in the Evos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, highlighted), which agreed with its function as a transposable sequence. Also, 51 out of 65 mutations occurred in the genes, and 45 out of 51 were SNPs. As 36 out of 45 SNPs were nonsynonymous, which was highly significant compared to random mutations (p&lt;0.01), the mutated genes might benefit fitness increase. In addition, the abundance of mutations was unlikely to be related to the magnitude of fitness increase. There was no significant correlation between the number of mutations and the growth rate in a statistical view (p&gt;0.1). Even from an individual close-up viewpoint, the abundance of mutations poorly explained the fitness increase. For instance, A2 accumulating only two mutations presented a highly increased growth rate compared to F2 of eight mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which poorly improved the growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). B2, D2, and E2 all succeeded in increasing fitness to an equivalent degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas they fixed 13, 7, and 3 mutations, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The mutated genes were varied in 14 gene categories, somehow more frequently in the gene categories of Transporter, Enzyme, and Unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). They seemed highly related to essentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp</ext-link>) as 11 out of 49 mutated genes were essential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Although the essentiality of genes might differ between the wild-type and reduced genomes, the experimentally determined 302 essential genes in the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain were used for the analysis, of which 286 were annotated in the reduced genome. The ratio of essential genes in the mutated genes was significantly higher than that in the total genes (286 out of 3290 genes, chi-square test p=0.008). As the essential genes were determined according to the growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baba et al., 2006</xref>) and were known to be more conserved than nonessential ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang, 2022</xref>), the high frequency of the mutations fixed in the essential genes was highly intriguing and reasonable.

As the essential genes showed higher expression levels than the nonessential ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ying et al., 2017</xref>), the high essentiality of the mutated genes might result in a higher mean expression level. On the other hand, the high frequency of the mutations fixed in the essential genes was unexpected because the essential genes were generally more conserved than nonessential ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jordan et al., 2002</xref>).

Firstly, various genetic functions seemed to trigger the increased growth rates of the Evos. A few mutations could compensate for the sizeable genomic deficiency. In particular, mutations in the essential genes, such as RNA polymerases (<italic>rpoA</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic>, <italic>rpoD</italic>) identified in three Evos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), were supposed to participate in the global regulation for improved growth. Nevertheless, the considerable variation in the fixed mutations without overlaps among the nine Evos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) implied no common mutagenetic strategy for the evolutionary improvement of growth fitness. It was supported by the fact that no genomic locational bias for mutations fixed in the evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Secondly, the transcriptomes presented conserved chromosomal architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and universal directional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), regardless of the significant and differentiated changes in gene expression in response to evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the periodicity of chromosomal architecture was well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathelier and Carbone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krogh et al., 2019</xref>) and coordinated with the bacterial growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), employing its homeostasis as the evolutionary consequence provided a conceptual and unique understanding of growing cells.</p><p>It is unclear whether the differentiation in evolutionary paths was particularly significant for the reduced genome used in the present study. Evolution studies often focus on finding the common mutations accumulated in multiple evolutionary lineages to obtain the reasonable mechanism responsible for the adaptation to the defined condition. Common mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>) or identical genetic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2022</xref>) were reported in the experimental evolution with different reduced genomes, commonly known as parallel evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, i). In addition, as not all mutations contribute to the evolved fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2022</xref>), another strategy for varied phenotypes was known as divergent evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, ii). The present study accentuated the variety of mutations fixed during evolution. Considering the high essentiality of the mutated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), most or all mutations were assumed to benefit the fitness increase, partially demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2022</xref>).

Instead, the newly constructed gene modules successfully enriched the gene categories of mobile elements and unknown functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left) as the evolutionary compensation for genome reduction. The represented mobile elements, flagella, were known to be responsive to environmental stresses such as hypoosmotic pressure or pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maurer et al., 2005</xref>).

The compensation of evolution to genome reduction not only verified the known function and mechanism from a global regulatory viewpoint but also revealed a novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms and gene functions.</p><p>The discriminated functions of gene modules might play a crucial role in response to genomic and evolutionary changes. WGCNA was conducted to discover the potential correlation of gene expression to growth fitness. It succeeded in finding the genes participating in the evolutionary changes of the reduced genome to regain growth fitness. Three enriched gene modules were assumed separately responsible for replication, transcription, and population dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The growth-correlated gene module significantly enriched the iron-related biological functions (M2). Although the translation was commonly reported to be correlated to the growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scott and Hwa, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2016</xref>), it was enriched in the gene module coordinated to transcriptional changes (M10).

We assumed that the various chemicals disturbed different metabolic fluxes in which different gene modules might have participated. The biological meaningfulness of the gene modules suggested an alternative genetic classification besides the commonly used clustering criteria, such as Gene Orthology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) and Regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>).

Nine evolutionary lineages were all initiated from the identical culture stock prepared in advance. The 24-well microplates specific for microbe culture (IWAKI) were used, and every four wells of four tenfold serial dilutions, for example, 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>6</sup>, were used for each lineage. Multiple dilutions changing in order promised at least one of the wells within the exponential growth phase after the overnight culture.

The growth performance of the end-point lineages evolved in M63 medium was comparable to the full-length wild-type level at lower cell densities.</p><p>Subsequent mutation profiling and RNA-Seq analysis revealed many changes on the genome and transcriptomes of the evolved lineages. The authors did a great deal on analyzing the patterns of evolutionary changes between independent lineages, such as the chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomes, pathway enrichment analysis, weight gene co-expression analysis, and so on. They observed a striking diversity in the molecular characteristics amongst the evolved lineages, which, as they suggest, reflect divergent evolutionary strategies adopted by the genome-reduced organism.</p><p>As for the overall quality of the manuscript, I am rather torn. The manuscript leans towards elaborating observed findings, rather than explaining their biological significance. For this reason, readers are left with more questions than answers. For example, fitness assay on reconstituted (single and combinatorial) mutants was not performed, nor any supporting evidence on the proposed contributions of each mutants provided. This leaves the nature of mutations - be them beneficial, neutral or deleterious, the presence of epistatic interactions, and the magnitude of fitness contribution, largely elusive. Also, it is difficult to tell whether the RNA-Seq analysis in this study managed to draw biologically meaningful conclusions, or instill insight into the nature of genome-reduced bacteria. The analysis primarily highlighted the differences in transcriptome profiles among each lineage based on metrics such as 'DEG counts' and the 'GO enrichment'. However, I could not see any specific implications regarding the biology of the evolved minimal genome drawn. In their concluding remark, 'Multiple evolutionary paths for the reduced genome to improve growth fitness were likely all roads leading to Rome,' the authors observed the first half of the sentence, but the distinctive characteristics of 'all roads' or 'evolutionary paths', which I think should have been the key aspect in this investigation, remains elusive.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>I appreciate the author's responses. They responded to most of the comments, but I still think that there is room for improvement. Please refer to the following comments. Quoted below are the author's responses.</p><p>&quot;We agree that our study leaned towards elaborating observed findings rather than explaining the detailed biological mechanisms.&quot;</p><p>- Comment: I doubt if there are scientific merits in merely elaborating observed findings. The conclusion of this study suggests that evolutionary paths in reduced genomes are highly diverse. But if you think about the nature of adaptive evolution, which relies upon the spontaneous mutation event followed by selection, certain degree of divergence is always expected. The problem with current experimental setting is that there are no ways to quantitively assess whether the degree of evolutionary divergence increases as the function of genome reduction, as the authors claimed. In addition, this notion is in direct contradiction to the prediction that genome reduction constraints evolution by reducing the number of solution space. It is more logical to think and predict that genome reduction would, in turn, lead to the loss of evolutionary divergence. We are also interested to know whether solution space to the optimization problem altered in response to the genome reduction. In this regard, a control ALE experiment on non-reduced wild-type seems to be a mandatory experimental control. I highly suggest that authors present a control experiment, as it was done for &quot;JCVI syn3.0B vs non-minimal M. mycoides&quot; (doi: 10.1038/s41586 023 06288 x) and &quot;<italic>E. coli</italic> eMS57 vs MG1655&quot; (doi: 10.1038/s41467 019 08888 6).</p><p>&quot;We focused on the genome wide biological features rather than the specific biological functions.&quot;</p><p>- Comment: The 'biological features' delivered in current manuscript does not give insight as to which genomic changes translated into strain fitness improvement. Rather than explaining the genotype-phenotype relationships and/or the mechanistic basis of fitness improvement, authors merely elaborated on the observed phenotypes. I question the scientific merits of such 'findings'.</p><p>&quot;Although the reduced growth rate caused by genome reduction could be recovered by experimental evolution, it remains unclear whether such an evolutionary improvement in growth fitness was a general feature of the reduced genome and how the genome wide changes occurred to match the growth fitness increase.&quot;</p><p>- Comment: This response is very confusing to understand. &quot;it remains unclear whether such an evolutionary improvement in growth fitness was a general feature of the reduced genome&quot; - what aspects remain unclear?? What assumption led the authors to believe that reduced genome's fitness cannot be evolutionarily improved?</p><p>- Comment: &quot;and how the genome wide changes occurred to match the growth fitness increase&quot; - this is exactly the aspect that authors should deliver, instead of just elaborating the observed findings. Why don't authors select one or two fastest-growing (or the fittest) lineages and specifically analyze underlying adaptive changes (i.e. genotype-phenotype relationships)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93520.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Studying evolutionary trajectories provides important insight in genetic architecture of adaptation and provide potential contribution to evaluating the predictability (or unpredictability) in biological processes involving adaptation. While many papers in the field address adaptation to environmental challenges, the number of studies on how genomic contexts, such as large-scale variation, can impact evolutionary outcomes adaptation is relatively low. This research experimentally evolved a genome-reduced strain for ~1000 generations with 9 replicates and dissected their evolutionary changes. Using the fitness assay of OD measurement, the authors claimed there is a general trend of increasing growth rate and decreasing carrying capacity, despite a positive correlation among all replicates. The authors also performed genomic and transcriptomic research at the end of experimental evolution, claiming the dissimilarity in the evolution at the molecular level.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experimental evolution approach with a high number of replicates provides a good way to reveal the generality/diversity of the evolutionary routes.</p><p>The assay of fitness, genome, and transcriptome all together allows a more thorough understanding of the evolutionary scenarios and genetic mechanisms.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>#5 in the last round of comments: When the authors mentioned no overlapping in single mutation level, I thought the authors would directly use this statement to support their next sentence about no bias of these mutations. As the author's responded, I was suspecting no overlapping for 65 mutation across the entire genome is likely to be not statistically significant. In the revised version, the authors emphasized and specified their simulation and argument in the following sentences, so I do not have questions on this point anymore.</p><p>#14 in the last round of comments: As what authors responded, &quot;short-term responses&quot; meant transcriptional or physiological changes within a few hours after environmental or genetic fluctuation. &quot;long-term responses&quot; involve new compensatory mutations and selection. The point was that, the authors found that &quot;the transcriptome reorganization for fitness increase triggered by evolution differed from that for fitness decrease caused by genome reduction.&quot; That is short vs long-term responses to genetic perturbation. Some other experimental evolution did short vs long-term responses to environmental perturbation and usually also found that the short-term responses are reverted in the long-term responses (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/1/25/2579742">https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/1/25/2579742</ext-link>). I hope this explanation makes more sense. And I think the authors can make their own decisions on whether they would like to add this discussion or not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93520.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hitomi</surname><given-names>Kenya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tsukuba</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tsukuba</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ishii</surname><given-names>Yoichiro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tsukuba</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tsukuba</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ying</surname><given-names>Bei-Wen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tsukuba</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tsukuba</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Response to Reviewer #1:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the careful reading and the positive evaluation of our manuscript.

Overall, your evos lineages evolved higher growth rates and lower carrying capacity (Figures 1B, C, E). If selection was driving the evolution of higher growth rates, it may have been that there was no selective pressure to maintain high carrying capacity. This means that the evolutionary change you observed in carrying capacity may have been neutral &quot;drift&quot; of the carrying capacity trait, during selection for growth rate, not because of a trade-off between R and K. This is especially likely since carrying capacity declined during evolution.

It was somehow consistent with the positive correlations between the colony growth rate and the colony size of a genome-reduced strain 11 and between the growth rates and the saturated population size of an assortment of genome reduced strains 13. Nevertheless, the negative correlation between growth rate and carrying capacity, known as the r/K selection30,31 was often observed as the trade-off relationship between r and K in the evolution and ecology studies 32 33,34. As the r/K trade-off was proposed to balance the cellular metabolism that resulted from the cost of enzymes involved 34, the deleted genes might play a role in maintaining the metabolism balance for the r/K correlation. On the other hand, the experimental evolution (i.e., serial transfer) was strictly performed within the exponential growth phase; thus, the evolutionary selection was supposed to be driven by the growth rate without selective pressure to maintain the carrying capacity. The declined carrying capacity might have been its neutral &quot;drift&quot; but not a trade-off to the growth rate. Independent and parallel experimental evolution of the reduced genomes selecting either r or K is required to clarify the actual mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 103 Genome mutations.

As nonsynonymous mutations were not detected in all nine Evos, the spontaneous mutation rate couldn't be calculated (because it should be evaluated according to the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous single-nucleotide substitutions in molecular evolution).

We agree that our study leaned towards elaborating observed findings rather than explaining the detailed biological mechanisms. We focused on the genome-wide biological features rather than the specific biological functions. The underlying mechanisms indeed remained unknown, leaving the questions as you commented. We didn't perform the fitness assay on reconstituted (single and combinatorial) mutants because the research purpose was not to clarify the regulatory or metabolic mechanisms. It's why the RNA-Seq analysis provided the findings on genome-wide patterns and chromosomal view, which were supposed to be biologically valuable.

The sentences were rewritten for clarity as follows.</p><p>(L64-70) “Although the reduced growth rate caused by genome reduction could be recovered by experimental evolution, it remains unclear whether such an evolutionary improvement in growth fitness was a general feature of the reduced genome and how the genome-wide changes occurred to match the growth fitness increase.

It resulted in four wells of different initial cell concentrations. Multiple dilutions promised that at least one of the wells would show the OD600 within the range of 0.01 to 0.1 after the overnight culture. They were then used for the next serial transfer. Fig. S1 provides the details of the experimental records. The experimental evolution was strictly controlled within the exponential phase, quite different from the commonly conducted ALE that transferred a single culture in a fixed dilution rate. Serial transfer with multiple dilution rates was previously applied in our evolution experiments and well described in Nishimura et al., 2017, mBio; Lu et al., 2022, Comm Biol; Kurokawa et al., 2022, Front Microbiol, etc. The following sentence was added in the Materials and Methods.</p><p>(L344-345) “Multiple dilutions changing in order promised at least one of the wells within the exponential growth phase after the overnight culture.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The measured growth rate of the end-point 'F2 lineage' shown in Figure S2 seemed comparable to the rest of the lineages (A1 to H2), but the growth rate of 'F2' illustrated in Figure 1B indicates otherwise (L83-84). What is the reason for the incongruence between the two datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the unclear description. The growth rates shown in Fig. S2 were obtained during the evolution experiment using the daily transfer's initial and final OD600 values. The growth rates shown in Fig. 1B were obtained from the final population (Evos) growth assay and calculated from the growth curves (biological replication, N=4). Fig. 1B shows the precisely evaluated growth rates, and Fig. S2 shows the evolutionary changes in growth rates. Accordingly, the following sentence was added to the Results.</p><p>(L84-87) “As the growth increases were calculated according to the initial and final records, the exponential growth rates of the ancestor and evolved populations were obtained according to the growth curves for a precise evaluation of the evolutionary changes in growth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Are the differences in growth rate statistically significant in Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>Eight out of nine Evos were significant, except F2.

However, the missing element in their analysis is the directionality of gene expression changes.

RNA-seq analysis in its current form seems superficial to derive biologically meaningful interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that most studies often discuss the direction of transcriptional changes. The present study aimed to capture a global view of the magnitude of transcriptome reorganization. Thus, the analyses focused on the overall features, such as the abundance of DEGs, instead of the details of the changes, e.g., the up- and down-regulation of DEGs.

Random mutations lead to ~33% of nonsynonymous SNP in a rough estimation. Additionally, the regression is unreliable because there's no statistical significance between the number of mutations and the magnitude of fitness increase.

There was no significant correlation between the number of mutations and the growth rate in a statistical view (p &gt; 0.1).

Is the observed number statistically significantly higher?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the improper and insufficient information on the essential genes. Yes, it's significant. The statistical test was additionally performed. The corresponding part was revised as follows.</p><p>(L134-146) “They seemed highly related to essentiality7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp</ext-link>), as 11 out of 49 mutated genes were essential (Table S3). Although the essentiality of genes might differ between the wild-type and reduced genomes, the experimentally determined 302 essential genes in the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain were used for the analysis, of which 286 were annotated in the reduced genome. The ratio of essential genes in the mutated genes was significantly higher than in the total genes (286 out of 3290 genes, Chi-square test p=0.008). As the essential genes were determined according to the growth35 and were known to be more conserved than nonessential ones 36,37, the high frequency of the mutations fixed in the essential genes was highly intriguing and reasonable. The large variety of genome mutations fixed in the independent lineages might result from a highly rugged fitness landscape 38. Nevertheless, it was unclear whether and how these mutations were explicitly responsible for recovering the growth rate of the reduced genome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mentioned no overlapping in the single mutation level. Is that statistically significant? The authors can bring up what the no-overlap probability is given that there are in total x number of fixed mutations observed (either theory or simulation is good).</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry, we feel confused about this comment. It's unclear to us why it needs to be statistically simulated. Firstly, the mutations were experimentally observed. The result that no overlapped mutated genes were detected was an Experimental Fact but not a Computational Prediction. We feel sorry that you may over-interpret our finding as an evolutionary rule, which always requires testing its reliability statistically. We didn't conclude that the evolution had no overlapped mutations. Secondly, considering 65 times random mutations happened to a ~3.9 Mb sequence, the statistical test was meaningful only if the experimental results found the overlapped mutations. It is interesting how often the random mutations cause the overlapped mutations in parallel evolutionary lineages while increasing the evolutionary lineages, which seems to be out of the scope of the present study. We are happy to include the analysis in our ongoing study on the experimental evolution of reduced genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors mentioned no overlapping in the single mutation level. How about at the genetic level? Some fixed mutations occur in the same coding gene. Is there any gene with a significantly enriched number of mutations?</p></disp-quote><p>No mutations were fixed in the same gene of biological function, as shown in Table S3. If we say the coding region, the only exception is the IS sequences, well known as the transposable sequences without genetic function. The following description was added.</p><p>(L119-122) “The number of mutations largely varied among the nine Evos, from 2 to 13, and no common mutation was detected in all nine Evos (Table S3). A 1,199-bp deletion of insH was frequently found in the Evos (Table S3, highlighted), which well agreed with its function as a transposable sequence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 151-156- It seems like the authors argue that the expression level differences can be just explained by the percentage of essential genes that get fixed mutations. One further step for the argument could be to compare the expression level of essential genes with vs without fixed mutations. Also, the authors can compare the expression level of non-essential genes with vs without fixed mutations. And the authors can report whether the differences in expression level became insignificant after the control of the essentiality.</p></disp-quote><p>It's our pleasure that the essentiality intrigued you. Thank you for the analytical suggestion, which is exciting and valuable for our studies. As only 11 essential genes were detected here and &quot;Mutation in essentiality&quot; was an indication but not the conclusion of the present study, we would like to apply the recommended analysis to the datasets of our ongoing study to demonstrate this statement. Thank you again for your fruitful analytical advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 169- &quot;The number of DEGs partially overlapped among the Evos declined significantly along with the increased lineages of Evos (Figure 4B). &quot; There is a lack of statistical significance here while the word &quot;significantly&quot; is used. One statistical test that can be done is to use re-sampling/simulation to generate a null expectation of the overlapping numbers given the DEGs for each Evo line and the total number of genes in the genome. The observed number can then be compared to the distribution of the simulated numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the inappropriate usage of the term. Whether it's statistically significant didn't matter here.

The common DEGs 177 of genome reduction and evolution varied from 168 to 540, fewer than half of the DEGs 178 responsible for genome reduction in all Evos&quot; Is the overlapping number significantly lower than the expectation? The hypergeometric test can be used for testing the overlap between two gene sets.</p></disp-quote><p>There's no expectation for how many DEGs were reasonable. Not all numbers experimentally obtained are required to be statistically meaningful, which is commonly essential in computational and data science.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The authors should give more information about the ancestral line used at the beginning of experimental evolution. I guess it is one of the KHK collection lines, but I can not find more details. There are many genome-reduced lines. Why is this certain one picked?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the insufficient information on the reduced genome used for the experimental evolution. The following descriptions were added in the Results and the Materials and Methods, respectively.</p><p>(L75-79) “The <italic>E. coli</italic> strain carrying a reduced genome, derived from the wild-type genome W3110, showed a significant decline in its growth rate in the minimal medium compared to the wild-type strain 13. To improve the genome reduction-mediated decreased growth rate, the serial transfer of the genome-reduced strain was performed with multiple dilution rates to keep the bacterial growth within the exponential phase (Fig. S1), as described 17,20.”</p><p>(L331-334) “The reduced genome has been constructed by multiple deletions of large genomic fragments 58, which led to an approximately 21% smaller size than its parent wild-type genome W3110.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) How was the saturated density in Figure 1 actually determined? In particular, the fitness assay of growth curves is 48h. But it seems like the experimental evolution is done for ~24 h cycles. If the Evos never experienced a situation like a stationary phase between 24-48h, and if the author reported the saturated density 48 h in Figure 1, the explanation of the lower saturated density can be just relaxation from selection and may have nothing to do with the increase of growth rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the unclear description. Yes, you are right. The evolution was performed within the exponential growth phase (keeping cell division constant), which means the Evos never experienced the stationary phase (saturation). The final evolved populations were subjected to the growth assay to obtain the entire growth curves for calculating the growth rate and the saturated density. Whether the decreased saturated density and the increased growth rate were in a trade-off relationship remained unclear. The corresponding paragraph was revised as follows.</p><p>(L100-115) “Intriguingly, a positive correlation was observed between the growth fitness and the carrying capacity of the Evos (Fig. 1D). It was somehow consistent with the positive correlations between the colony growth rate and the colony size of a genome-reduced strain 11 and between the growth rates and the saturated population size of an assortment of genome reduced strains 13. Nevertheless, the negative correlation between growth rate and carrying capacity, known as the r/K selection30,31 was often observed as the trade-off relationship between r and K in the evolution and ecology studies 32 33,34. As the r/K trade-off was proposed to balance the cellular metabolism that resulted from the cost of enzymes involved 34, the deleted genes might play a role in maintaining the metabolism balance for the r/K correlation. On the other hand, the experimental evolution (i.e., serial transfer) was strictly performed within the exponential growth phase; thus, the evolutionary selection was supposed to be driven by the growth rate without selective pressure to maintain the carrying capacity. The declined carrying capacity might have been its neutral &quot;drift&quot; but not a trade-off to the growth rate. Independent and parallel experimental evolution of the reduced genomes selecting either r or K is required to clarify the actual mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) What annotation of essentiality was used in this paper? In particular, the essentiality can be different in the reduced genome background compared to the WT background.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the unclear definition of the essential genes. They are strictly limited to the 302 essential genes experimentally determined in the wild-type E coli strain.

We agree that the essentiality could differ between the WT and reduced genomes. Identifying the essential genes in the reduced genome will be an exhaustedly vast work. The information on the essential genes defined in the present study was added as follows.</p><p>(L134-139) “They seemed highly related to essentiality7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/genes.jsp</ext-link>), as 11 out of 49 mutated genes were essential (Table S3). Although the essentiality of genes might differ between the wild-type and reduced genomes, the experimentally determined 302 essential genes in the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain were used for the analysis, of which 286 were annotated in the reduced genome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The fixed mutations in essential genes are probably not rarely observed in experimental evolution. For example, fixed mutations related to RNA polymerase can be frequently seen when evolving to stressful environments. I think the author can discuss this more and elaborate more on whether they think these mutations in essential genes are important in adaptation or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful reading and the suggestion. As you mentioned, we noticed that the mutations in RNA polymerases (rpoA, rpoB, and rpoD) were identified in three Evos. As they were not shared across all Evos, we didn't discuss the contribution of these mutations to evolution. Instead of the individual functions of the mutated essential gene functions, we focused on the enriched gene functions related to the transcriptome reorganization because they were the common feature observed across all Evos and linked to the whole metabolic or regulatory pathways, which are supposed to be more biologically reasonable and interpretable. The following sentence was added to clarify our thinking.</p><p>(L268-273) “In particular, mutations in the essential genes, such as RNA polymerases (rpoA, rpoB, rpoD) identified in three Evos (Table S3), were supposed to participate in the global regulation for improved growth. Nevertheless, the considerable variation in the fixed mutations without overlaps among the nine Evos (Table 1) implied no common mutagenetic strategy for the evolutionary improvement of growth fitness.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In experimental evolution to new environments, several previous literature also show that long-term experimental evolution in transcriptome is not consistent or even reverts the short-term response; short-term responses were just rather considered as an emergency plan. They seem to echo what the authors found in this manuscript. I think the author can refer to some of those studies more and make a more throughput discussion on short-term vs long-term responses in evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the advice. It's unclear to us what the short-term and long-term responses referred to mentioned in this comment. The &quot;Response&quot; is usually used as the phenotypic or transcriptional changes within a few hours after environmental fluctuation, generally non-genetic (no mutation). In comparison, long-term or short-term experimental &quot;Evolution&quot; is associated with genetic changes (mutations). Concerning the Evolution (not the Response), the long-term experimental evolution (&gt;10,000 generations) was performed only with the wild-type genome, and the short-term experimental evolution (500~2,000 generations) was more often conducted with both wild-type and reduced genomes, to our knowledge. Previous landmark studies have intensively discussed comparing the wild-type and reduced genomes. Our study was restricted to the reduced genome, which was constructed differently from those reduced genomes used in the reported studies. The experimental evolution of the reduced genomes has been performed in the presence of additional additives, e.g., antibiotics, alternative carbon sources, etc. That is, neither the genomic backgrounds nor the evolutionary conditions were comparable. Comparison of nothing common seems to be unproductive. We sincerely hope the recommended topics can be applied in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some minor suggestions</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figures S3 &amp; Table S2 need an explanation of the abbreviations of gene categories.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the missing information.
