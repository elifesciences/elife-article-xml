This ability is called anhydrobiosis (from the Greek for ‘life without water’). When the desiccated organisms encounter water again, they resume life as normal. Two organisms commonly used in research, a roundworm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and a yeast called <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, are anhydrobiotes.</p><p>To survive without water, anhydrobiotes alter the chemical reactions that sustain their life, and so change their metabolic state. The organisms also produce molecules that preserve the structure of their cells. One such essential molecule is a sugar called trehalose. However, both worms and yeast can only enter anhydrobiosis during particular stages of life where they do not eat. So where does the trehalose come from?</p><p>Erkut et al. have now addressed this question by studying the metabolism of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as these species entered anhydrobiosis. The experiments revealed that while preparing for desiccation, both species change their metabolism to favor creating sugars rather than releasing energy. In this process, the worms and yeast use a biochemical pathway called the glyoxylate shunt, which can convert fat or acetic acid into sugar. Genetic mutations that deactivate this pathway severely reduce the ability of both organisms to produce trehalose and tolerate desiccation. From these findings, Erkut et al. conclude that the source of trehalose in non-feeding worms is their fat deposits, while in yeast it is acetate: a molecule that is derived from ethanol, the end-product of the fermentation process.</p><p>The glyoxylate shunt had been thought only to be a non-essential biochemical shortcut of another well-known metabolic pathway called the Krebs cycle. Now that Erkut et al. have shown that the glyoxylate shunt has its own specific biological role, further investigation is needed to understand how it is activated to act as a metabolic switch. The molecules that regulate similar metabolic transitions will also need to be identified in future studies. Ultimately, understanding these processes could present new ways of diagnosing and treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13614.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13614.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>desiccation</kwd><kwd>glyoxylate shunt</kwd><kwd>anaplerosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurzchalia</surname><given-names>Teymuras V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust-DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intermediate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laxman</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Roundworms and yeast can survive extreme desiccation only by switching their metabolism into a gluconeogenic mode and producing very high amounts of trehalose via the glyoxylate shunt.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Terrestrial organisms regularly encounter severe drought. For species with no means of preventing evaporative water loss, drought might result in desiccation, and eventually death. To cope with this environmental insult, many organisms enter an ametabolic state known as anhydrobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keilin, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leprince and Buitink, 2015</xref>). In this state, organisms can persist in the absence of water for a long period of time; when water becomes available, they exit the anhydrobiotic state and fully resume their normal activities. The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are excellent anhydrobiotes. Studies of these two model organisms have revealed various strategies for desiccation tolerance, many of which appear to be broadly conserved among other anhydrobiotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dupont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erkut and Kurzchalia, 2015</xref>).</p><p>One strategy for anhydrobiosis common to both worm and yeast is the biosynthesis and accumulation of trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>), a disaccharide made of two alpha-linked glucose moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elbein, 2003</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> trehalose preserves the native packing of membranes in the dried state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2012</xref>) and stabilizes membranes against the adverse effects of fast rehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abusharkh et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, trehalose also functions as a long-lived chaperone, preventing protein aggregation upon desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that this disaccharide plays conserved roles in desiccation tolerance. However, the metabolic basis for synthesis of trehalose remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to identify the source of trehalose carbons and the pathway(s) that promote trehalose biosynthesis and accumulation.</p><p>Neither <italic>C. elegans</italic> nor <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> invests in trehalose production during growth and development. By contrast, in their non-proliferative stages, i.e., the dauer larva in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Penkov et al., 2015</xref>, and this study) and stationary phase in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">François and Parrou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Werner-Washburne et al., 1993</xref>), both species devote a substantial amount of their internal carbon reserve to trehalose biosynthesis. In the non-feeding dauer larva (the only desiccation-tolerant stage of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> life cycle), trehalose levels rise dramatically upon exposure to mild desiccation stress (preconditioning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, stationary phase yeast cells, which are tolerant to desiccation, also accumulate trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calahan et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in these specific developmental stages, these organisms must be able to divert available carbon sources to the production of sugars.</p><p>In these non-growing stages, both worm and yeast must enter metabolic modes distinct from those that are active during growth. Reproductive stage larvae of <italic>C. elegans</italic> feed on bacteria, from which they ingest mostly lipids and proteins, and to some extent sugars; they assimilate these nutrients via glycolysis and/or the TCA cycle to produce energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the other hand, when fed its preferred carbon source (glucose), budding yeast grows exponentially and uses fermentative glycolysis for its energetic and biosynthetic needs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Under these conditions, the cells secrete ethanol as well as acetate.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13614.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic modes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive larvae, which are feeding and growing, can utilize nutrients (purple) via TCA cycle and produce energy.

The dauer larva relies on its internal carbon reserves, which are mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hellerer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narbonne and Roy, 2008</xref>), but must also retain the ability to produce sugars. In yeast, as glucose is consumed and glucose concentrations drop, cells undergo the diauxic shift, i.e., a transition to respiratory metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweizer and Dickinson, 2004</xref>). Following this shift, yeast produce acetyl-CoA from accumulated ethanol, acetate, and glycerol, and switch to oxidative phosphorylation via the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweizer and Dickinson, 2004</xref>), which provides energy as well as precursor metabolites for amino acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. Finally, in the stationary phase, yeast cells accumulate trehalose and glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">François and Parrou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweizer and Dickinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Werner-Washburne et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>These observations imply that in order to synthesize trehalose, both organisms must undergo a transition to a gluconeogenic mode in which they synthesize glucose or glucose-6-phosphate from non-carbohydrate precursors. How is this transition implemented? In theory, the TCA cycle could provide the intermediates required for gluconeogenesis, but this pathway generates substantial amounts of ATP, as well as NADH, which must be oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> to maintain cellular redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voet and Voet, 2010</xref>). At first glance it seems counterintuitive that these two processes run in parallel, considering the low energetic demands of dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast cells. However, cells could be driven into gluconeogenesis via an alternate route, the glyoxylate shunt (GS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, depicted in red). The GS has been implicated in anhydrobiosis in the nematode <italic>Aphelencus avenae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madin et al., 1985</xref>). We hypothesized that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast cells, the GS serves a critical function in anabolic processes required for desiccation tolerance, in particular by enabling or promoting gluconeogenesis for trehalose biosynthesis.</p><p>The GS, a shortcut in the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kornberg and Madsen, 1958</xref>), is conserved in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg, 1966</xref>), fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopez-Boado et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz and Fink, 2001</xref>), protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levy and Scherbaum, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2005</xref>), nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siddiqui et al., 2000</xref>), and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eastmond and Graham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg and Beevers, 1957</xref>). It bypasses two CO<sub>2</sub>-releasing steps of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, reactions 3 and 4) to produce succinate, and incorporates an additional molecule of acetyl-CoA to form L-malate from glyoxylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, reaction 10). Instead of remaining within the TCA cycle, excess malate can be converted into oxaloacetate and diverted into gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, reaction 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voet and Voet, 2010</xref>). Thus, the GS serves as a prototypical anaplerotic pathway, leading to the accumulation of critical TCA cycle intermediates, particularly oxaloacetate, which can be consumed for gluconeogenesis. Moreover, this pathway generates less ATP and NADH than the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg, 1966</xref>).</p><p>To date, the biological importance of the GS has been largely ignored, and its physiological functions remain obscure. The GS has primarily been studied in the context of microbial sporulation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg and Krebs, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Megraw and Beers, 1964</xref>), fungal virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz and Fink, 2001</xref>), and plant seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eastmond et al., 2000</xref>). However, the GS is not physiologically essential to any of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voet and Voet, 2010</xref>). On the other hand, it is astonishing that <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a nematode and thus a member of the animal kingdom, has the full set of enzymes required for the GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1995</xref>). Although the GS has been proposed to be involved in sugar homeostasis in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frazier and Roth, 2009</xref>), its absence results in neither a detectable phenotype nor any effect on wild-type adult lifespan. However, it may be required for the extended longevity of some mitochondrial mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallo et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, at present, no physiological role has been definitively assigned to this pathway in the worm.</p><p>Here, we present evidence that the dauer larva is in a hypoaerobic, gluconeogenic state, which enables efficient production of trehalose using internal reserves (TAGs and amino acids). Importantly, during preconditioning, the GS is the major pathway for conversion of TAGs into trehalose; in its absence, the dauer larva cannot produce sufficient trehalose to survive desiccation. Expanding our studies to the budding yeast, we discovered that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> utilizes a similar metabolic strategy, relying on the GS to drive trehalose synthesis and achieve desiccation tolerance. These results reveal, for the first time, a functionally conserved and central role for the GS in a process that is essential for survival under certain conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dauer larva is in a hypoaerobic, gluconeogenic mode</title><p>We characterized the energetic/metabolic states of the dauer larva and its parallel reproductive stage (the L3 larva).

The latter accumulated substantially larger amounts of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation suggested that, in addition to being hypometabolic, dauer larvae rearrange their metabolism to favor intensive gluconeogenesis, leading to trehalose accumulation.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we adopted an approach that combined metabolic labeling with 2-dimensional high-performance thin-layer chromatography (2D-HPTLC). This relatively simple method enabled us to detect major small-molecules, including amino acids, sugars, and intermediates of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). First, we labeled <italic>C. elegans</italic> metabolites by feeding the worms <sup>14</sup>C-acetate-supplemented bacteria until they formed L3 or dauer larvae. This labeling strategy allowed us to detect and identify metabolites derived from <sup>14</sup>C-acetate that has entered the TCA cycle. Subsequently, we extracted the metabolites from worms, separated the extracts into organic and aqueous phases, and analyzed the latter with 2D-HPTLC.</p><p>The aqueous phase of L3 extract contained many labeled compounds, including various amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but trehalose was not abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, spot 1). Thus, in this growth stage, the TCA cycle is mainly cataplerotic: in addition to reducing NAD<sup>+</sup> and producing ATP, L3 larvae use intermediates to synthesize various building blocks such as amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars. By contrast, the aqueous fraction of dauer larvae contained only a limited number of metabolites, and fluorograms of this extract had one predominant spot, i.e., trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, spot 1). Other, barely detectable spots corresponded to glucose, glutamate, and glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, spots 2, 3, and 4, respectively). These data suggest that metabolism in dauer larvae is almost entirely switched to a gluconeogenic mode in which sugars are produced by non-carbohydrate sources (acetate/fatty acids).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13614.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Metabolic modes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive and dauer larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Radioactively labeled metabolites of <italic>daf-2</italic> L3, as well as non-preconditioned (NP) and preconditioned (P) dauer larvae.

For preconditioning, worms are treated with mild desiccation at 98% relative humidity (RH) for an extended period of time (4 days), after which they can survive in the almost complete absence of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we preconditioned worms in this manner, and then analyzed the organic and aqueous fractions of radioactively labeled dauer larvae before and after preconditioning. In the organic phase, the amount of radioactivity incorporated into TAGs decreased substantially during preconditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At the same time, preconditioning dramatically increased the level of radioactively labeled trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, spot 1), and the amounts of glutamate and glutamine also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, spots 3 and 4, respectively; this observation is discussed later). These results suggest that the dauer larva takes advantage of its gluconeogenic mode to boost trehalose synthesis upon desiccation stress.</p><p>We next asked how the transition to this gluconeogenic mode is reflected in the transcriptome. Previously, we surveyed differential expression of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes during preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>).

Moreover, <italic>mdh-1</italic> (cytosolic malate dehydrogenase) and <italic>pck-2</italic> (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), both of which are crucial for gluconeogenesis, were significantly upregulated during preconditioning, consistent with the increase in gluconeogenesis and sugar accumulation observed in the dauer larva.</p><p>Collectively, our data demonstrate that, during dauer formation, worms enter a gluconeogenic mode associated with a large increase in the levels of sugars such as trehalose, and that this phenomenon is even more pronounced during preconditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An intact GS is required for utilization of acetate/fatty acids for trehalose biosynthesis</title><p>We hypothesized that the GS in dauer larvae plays an important role in gluconeogenesis, and thus in trehalose biosynthesis. We tested this idea in worm lines having no functional GS.</p><p>In plants, yeast, and bacteria, two enzymes are responsible for the GS: isocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.1), which breaks isocitrate down to glyoxylate and succinate, and malate synthase (EC 2.3.3.9), which condenses glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to produce L-malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cozzone, 1998</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, these two enzymes are combined in one protein, ICL-1 (formerly known as GEI-7), which has both isocitrate lyase and malate synthase domains, and can thus carry out both reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 1995</xref>). We produced a strain (<italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic>) with a deletion mutation in <italic>icl-1</italic>, and then exploited the <italic>daf-2</italic> background to produce large populations of pure dauer larvae. The deletion in the <italic>icl-1(ok531)</italic> allele introduces a frame-shift and an early stop codon (A373*), which should completely inactivate the GS strains harboring this mutation.</p><p>Compared to <italic>daf-2</italic>, the dauer and L3 larvae of <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> exhibited no difference in respiration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or basal trehalose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the GS has no influence on oxygen consumption or basal gluconeogenesis. By contrast, trehalose induction upon preconditioning differed dramatically between <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> dauer larvae. We quantitated the total amount of trehalose, normalized to the amount of soluble protein, in both strains before and after preconditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar to our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>), the total trehalose level in <italic>daf-2</italic> dauer larvae was ~100 µg trehalose/mg protein at baseline, and increased ~5-fold upon preconditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). In <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic>, although the initial level of trehalose was the same as that of <italic>daf-2</italic>, the increase was only 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). This suggests that the major source of trehalose during preconditioning is the GS.</p><p>To further investigate this possibility, we labeled <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> larvae with <sup>14</sup>C-Ac, as described above for <italic>daf-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Incorporation of radioactivity into trehalose was considerably reduced in <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> relative to that in <italic>daf-2</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>). Nevertheless, as in <italic>daf-2</italic>, the level of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled trehalose increased in <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Densitometry of fluorogram spots revealed that, during preconditioning, radioactively labeled trehalose increased ~6-fold in <italic>daf-2</italic>, but only 2-fold in <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The average increase in labeled trehalose in <italic>daf-2</italic> was larger than the increase in total (i.e., unlabeled) trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting preferential use of lipid sources for sugar production in this strain. By contrast, in <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic>, the levels of total and labeled trehalose increased to similar extents. These differences in trehalose induction levels between <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> cannot be assigned to the trehalose biosynthetic pathway because the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, reaction 25) activity of <italic>daf-2</italic> is not higher than that of <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the utilization of acetate (and thus fatty acids) for gluconeogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis depends on the existence of a functional GS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The GS is essential for desiccation tolerance of the dauer larva</title><p>Next, we asked whether the absence of the GS affects desiccation tolerance. For this purpose, we determined the survival rates of dauer larvae after mild (98% RH) and harsh (60% RH) desiccation.

As described earlier, dauer larvae accumulate large amounts of trehalose, despite the fact that worms in this stage of the life cycle do not feed or grow. A similar phenomenon occurs in budding yeast. In the presence of its preferred carbon source (glucose), yeast uses fermentative glycolysis during rapid proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); under these conditions, very little trehalose accumulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). However, once glucose concentration falls, the cells undergo a diauxic shift, thereafter using aerobic respiration for their energetic needs in order to continue proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>); eventually, as external energy sources are depleted, the cells enter stationary phase. Although both glycolytic and respiratory activities are low in stationary phase, the cells continue to accumulate trehalose and glycogen, which ultimately constitute &gt;30% of total cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">François and Parrou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Werner-Washburne et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, yeast might also rely on alternate carbon metabolism to generate trehalose. Therefore, we asked whether the GS in yeast can be used to drive gluconeogenesis for synthesis of trehalose.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13614.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Growth of GS-deficient yeast cells in media with different carbon sources.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth of wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in YP + Glc medium in batch culture.

Acetyl-CoA can enter the TCA cycle as well as the GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In yeast, the GS is carried out by isocitrate lyase, Icl1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez et al., 1992</xref>), and the malate synthases, primarily Mls1p but also Dal7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartig et al., 1992</xref>).

By contrast, when grown in high ethanol, GS mutants grew normally in YP medium, but their growth was impaired in minimal medium (S min) lacking free amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggests that free amino acids can feed into carbon consumption in the TCA cycle, as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that in the absence of free amino acids, the GS plays an important role in carbon metabolism. In addition, we compared the growth rates of WT and GS-deficient cells growing on acetate as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Under these conditions, yeast have high GS activity and exhibited elevated TCA-independent acetate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweizer and Dickinson, 2004</xref>).

To test this idea, we quantitated these metabolites in WT and GS-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). In cells grown in glucose, following the diauxic shift (20 hr, black bars) and in stationary phase (48 hr, grey bars), WT cells accumulated considerable amounts of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast, despite reaching high cell densities, GS-deficient cells contained low (but detectable) amounts of trehalose, but no detectable glycogen stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also measured trehalose and glycogen in WT and GS-deficient cells grown with acetate as a carbon source. Under these conditions, we observed an even greater accumulation of trehalose and glycogen in WT cells, whereas GS-deficient cells contained low levels of trehalose and no detectable glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). As controls, we also measured the amounts of trehalose and glycogen in mutant cells lacking trehalose synthase (Tps1) or the heat-shock protein Hsp104, both of which are important for yeast desiccation tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). As expected, <italic>∆tps1</italic> cells contained very low levels of trehalose, but high levels of glycogen, whereas <italic>∆hsp104</italic> cells had no defects in trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or glycogen storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We grew saturated cultures of WT, GS-deficient, Tps1-deficient, or Hsp104 deficient cells, desiccated them for up to 30 days, and then rehydrated them. All strains survived very well after 1 day of desiccation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The viability of cells in WT cultures remained high after 30 days of desiccation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). By contrast, <italic>∆icl1</italic>, <italic>∆icl1/∆tps1</italic>, and <italic>∆icl1/∆hsp104</italic> cells exhibited very poor desiccation tolerance after 30 days, with viability at least 10-fold lower than that of WT cells and comparable to that of <italic>∆tps1</italic> cells lacking trehalose altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Importantly, <italic>∆icl1</italic> cells supplemented with trehalose in the medium 24 hr before desiccation exhibited near-WT levels of desiccation tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we expanded our study to investigate whether other environmental insults, such as heat-shock and freezing/thawing, were affected by GS deficiency.

This state depends primarily on an active glyoxylate shunt (GS), which serves as the main route for synthesis of trehalose from TAG reserves during preconditioning. We also showed that budding yeast undergoes a conceptually convergent process. In order to survive desiccation, stationary phase yeast cells must produce high levels of trehalose from acetate or glycerol. This conversion can be successfully accomplished only in the presence of a functional GS.</p><p>In addition to the GS, gluconeogenesis/trehalose biosynthesis should use alternative carbon sources, such as amino acids, glycerol, and pyruvate, because <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> accumulated some trehalose upon preconditioning. Amino acids, for example, can be converted into their corresponding α-keto acids, which then undergo a specific series of reactions to enter the TCA cycle, in which they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, even via utilization of amino acids or other metabolites, <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> dauer larvae cannot tolerate desiccation as well as <italic>daf-2</italic>. Our data indicate that an intermediate level of trehalose is insufficient for desiccation tolerance: Below some threshold level, trehalose cannot exert its protective effects and overcome the adverse consequences of desiccation. This hypothesis was previously explored in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tapia et al., 2015</xref>). Our results strongly suggest that a conceptually similar trehalose threshold may exist in the worm as well. It is worth to note that gluconeogenesis is in general associated with the energetic needs of the organism. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the yeast, however, it is additionally used as a defense against environmental stress. Taking advantage of the GS, worms and yeast devote large amounts of resources to the production of trehalose, which in turn protects the organism against desiccation or other water-related stresses, such as freezing and thawing during winter.</p><p>Although the GS was discovered and dissected at the molecular level almost 60 years ago, no clear physiological function has yet been assigned to it. For several decades, the germination of plant seeds was considered to be the most prominent process requiring this pathway, and it was assumed that production of sugars from seed oils was a prerequisite for germination. However, studies of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines with no functional GS revealed that in the presence of light, this pathway is non-essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eastmond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eastmond and Graham, 2001</xref>). Other studies suggested a requirement for the GS in fungal virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz and Fink, 2001</xref>), although at present we have no mechanistic understanding of why this would be the case. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first clearly defined physiological role for the GS in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>It remains unclear how the GS is regulated in animals. In the worm, regulation is directly connected to sensing of a desiccative environment (hygrosensation). We previously showed that hygrosensation is at least partially mediated by head neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>). Although we still do not know the details of this sensation, one of its downstream effects is likely to be increased lipolysis. This process, followed by β-oxidation of fatty acids, yields acetyl-CoA, the fuel for GS. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that lipolysis determines the extent of the GS. Another finding that supports this view is the localization of ICL-1 within the organism. As shown above, ICL-1 is predominantly localized in the hypodermis. The major enzyme that synthesizes trehalose (TPS) is localized to the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Penkov et al., 2015</xref>), but is not expressed in the gut. On the other hand, the major TAG deposit in the form of fat droplets resides in the gut, and to some extent in the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mak, 2011</xref>). Thus, synthesis of trehalose in the hypodermis must depend on the transport of fatty acids from the gut. Indeed, as we previously found, one of the fatty acid-binding proteins (FAR-3) is strongly upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels upon preconditioning (~160 and four fold, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>). FAR-3 is predicted to have a 20 amino acid signal sequence for secretion, and could thus be involved in the transport of fatty acids between cells. These observations strongly suggest that the regulation of the GS by substrate availability is a complex process that depends on interactions between different tissues.</p><p>An interesting aspect of our study is that worm ICL-1 is localized to mitochondria, suggesting that the GS takes place in this organelle. By contrast, in plants and the yeast, this pathway is split between mitochondria and a specialized organelle (glyoxysome or peroxisome) or the cytoplasm. Furthermore, in contrast to yeast and many other organisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> ICL-1 is a bifunctional enzyme with both glyoxylase and malate synthase activities. The physiological meaning of these differences remains elusive, but they suggest that transition into gluconeogenic mode is regulated differently in different organisms.</p><p>In summary, we showed that dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast switch to a gluconeogenic mode, in which the GS plays an essential role. In both species, loss of the GS is deleterious during desiccation. Our results reveal a novel physiological role for the GS and a conserved mechanism by which diverse organisms can regulate their metabolism to achieve desiccation tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and culture conditions</title><p>C. <italic>elegans</italic> wild-type (N2), <italic>daf-2(e1370)III, icl-1(ok531)V, tps-1(ok373)X</italic> and <italic>tps-2(ok526)II</italic> strains were received from <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (Minneapolis, MN), which is funded by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440).

The debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 g for 1 min at 4°C. A micro BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) was used to determine total soluble protein amounts from the supernatant. Next, the pellet was resuspended and the homogenate was extracted according to Bligh and Dyer’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>). Briefly, homogenized sample in 1 ml water was mixed with 3.75 ml of chloroform–methanol (1:2, v/v) in glass tubes for at least 20 min. Then 1.25 ml of chloroform and 1.25 ml of water were added sequentially, with rigorous mixing after each addition. Phase separation was facilitated by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 15 min. Next, organic (lower) and aqueous (upper) phases were collected into fresh glass tubes using sterilized glass Pasteur pipettes. Organic fractions from radioactively labeled samples and all aqueous fractions were dried under vacuum with heating. Organic fractions from non-labeled samples were dried under nitrogen gas flow. All organic and aqueous fractions were dissolved in chloroform–methanol (2:1, v/v) and methanol–water (1:1, v/v), respectively. Non-labeled samples were normalized according to total soluble protein amounts measured from homogenates. For each mg of protein, organic and aqueous fractions were dissolved in 166 µl and 332 µl of the corresponding solvent, respectively. Labeled organic samples were dissolved in 100 µl of the corresponding solvent and total radioactivity in each sample was measured by a scintillation counter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Trehalose measurement from worm extracts</title><p>After sample homogenization and protein measurement prior to organic extraction, trehalose measurement was performed in some samples using a trehalose assay kit with a modified protocol (Megazyme, Ireland). First, 40 µl of each homogenate supernatant was heated at 95°C for 5 min to inactivate endogenous enzymes. Next, reducing sugars in the homogenate were reduced to sugar alcohols by adding 40 µl of freshly prepared alkaline borohydride (10 mg/ml sodium borohydride in 50 mM sodium hydroxide) into each tube and incubating at 40°C for 30 min with shaking at 300 rpm. Then, the mixture was neutralized by adding 100 µl of 200 mM acetic acid. Subsequently, the pH was adjusted by adding 40 µl of 2 M imidazole buffer (pH 7.0). 70 µl of the final mixture was transferred to a plastic cuvette and the reaction mixture was added (70 µl of 2 M imidazole buffer, 35 µl of NADP<sup>+</sup>/ATP mix, 7 µl of hexokinase/glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase mix and 700 µl of distilled water). The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 min. Then the basal absorbance at 340 nm was measured (A<sub>1</sub>). After that, 7 µl of trehalase was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before the final absorbance at 340 nm was measured (A<sub>2</sub>). Trehalose concentration was calculated from the difference of absorbance values and normalized to the protein amounts measured from the same samples. This experiment was carried out on 3 different days with 3 technical replicates on each day for each treatment. Median values of technical replicates were used for calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Trehalose measurement from yeast samples</title><p>Trehalose and glycogen from yeast samples were quantified as described previously, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). Cell samples were collected and pelleted. Cell pellets were quickly washed with 1 ml of ice-cold water and then resuspended in 0.25 ml of 0.25 M sodium carbonate and stored at -80°C until processed. For batch cultures, 20 OD<sub>600</sub> total cells were collected. After resuspension in water, 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred to two capped Eppendorf tubes (one tube for glycogen assay and the other tube for trehalose assay). When sample collections were complete, cell samples (in 0.25 M sodium carbonate) were boiled at 95–98°C for 4 hr, and then 0.15 ml of 1 M acetic acid and 0.6 ml of 0.2 M sodium acetate were added into each sample. Each sample was incubated overnight with 1 U/ml amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich, India) rotating at 57°C for the glycogen assay, or 0.025 U/ml trehalase (Sigma-Aldrich, India) at 37°C for the trehalose assay. Samples were then assayed for glucose using a glucose assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, India). Glucose assays were done using a 96-well plate format. Samples were added into each well with appropriate dilution within the dynamic range of the assay (20–80 µg/ml glucose). The total volume of sample (with or without dilution) in each well was 40 µl. The plate was pre-incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and then 80 µl of the assay reagent from the kit was added into each well to start the colorimetric reaction. After 30 min of incubation at 37°C, 80 µl of 12 N sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 540 nm was determined to assess the quantity of glucose liberated from either glycogen or trehalose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>TPS activity assay in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>TPS activity assay was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dmitryjuk et al. (2014)</xref>. Worm homogenates were prepared in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl (w/v). Total soluble protein and the initial amount of trehalose were measured as described above. Reaction was carried out with 100 µl of the lysate in 40 mM acid-ammonia buffer (pH 4.2), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM UDP-glucose, 0.2 mM glucose 6-phosphate and 80 µM trehalase inhibitor at 37°C for 30 min in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Subsequently, the resulting trehalose 6-phosphate was dephosphorylated with 1 U of alkaline phosphatase in 100 mM phosphoric buffer (pH 8) at 37°C for 30 min. Reaction was stopped via heating the samples to 95°C for 5 min. Next, the final amount of trehalose was measured and the difference from initial level of trehalose was calculated. This difference was then normalized to the total soluble protein amount. The unit enzyme activity is defined as the normalized molar amount of trehalose 6-phosphate produced in 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Detection of Tps1 and Tps2 proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>A 3X-FLAG epitope tag was added to the carboxy termini of Tps1 and Tps2 at the endogenous chromosomal locus in the indicated strains. Tps-FLAG containing wild type and GS-deficient strains were grown to stationary phase (72 hrs) in YPD medium, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were extracted by first precipitating with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), followed by removal of TCA, and solubilization of the protein extracts in SDS-glycerol sample buffer, normalizing for total protein. Proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and detected with standard immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope, using a mouse anti-FLAG antibody, and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Thin-layer chromatography</title><p>High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) was used to separate and visualize molecules of interest. The TLC system was developed using non-radioactive amino acid and sugar standards, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tweeddale et al. (1998)</xref>. Individual amino acid samples were first separated on 1 dimension for either mobile phases, visualized by ninhydrin staining, and their corresponding R<sub>f</sub> values were calculated. Then they were mixed and separated on 2 dimensions. Individual R<sub>f</sub> values calculated from the 1D TLC runs coincided largely with each molecule in question also on 2D. Furthermore, the positions of glutamate and glutamine were confirmed in another set of experiments, where glutamate- or glutamine-lacking mixtures of amino acids were separated on 2D. Localization of sugars on the 2D TLC system was done similarly, only using Molisch staining as the visualization method.</p><p>Before any analysis, sample normalization following organic extraction was confirmed by loading 5 µl of each organic fraction on an HPTLC plate (Merck, Germany), eluting with chloroform–methanol–water (45:18:3, v/v/v) and visualizing with copper acetate solution (3% copper acetate and 8% ortho-phosphoric acid in water) after baking at 200°C. It was expected that the phospholipids should have comparable levels in every sample.</p><p>Sugars were separated using chloroform–methanol–water (4:4:1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase and visualized with Molisch’s reagent (3% 1-naphtol in sulfuric acid (96%)–water–ethanol (13:8:80, v/v/v)) after baking at 180°C. For comparison of trehalose levels of dauer larvae before and after preconditioning, 8 µl of aqueous fraction was used.</p><p>Triacylglycerol levels were compared by running 4 µl of the organic fraction with the solvent system petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°C)–diethyl ether–glacial acetic acid (82:18:1, v/v/v) and visualizing with copper acetate.</p><p>We used the 2-dimensional TLC approach to compare the metabolites in aqueous fractions of radioactively labeled worm extracts. An amount of aqueous fraction equivalent to 2700 worms (L3 or dauer larvae) was applied as a spot to an HPTLC plate and eluted on the first dimension with 1-propanol–methanol–ammonia (32%)–water (28:8:7:7, v/v/v/v). Then, the plate was dried for 15 min and eluted on the second dimension with 1-butanol–acetone–glacial acetic acid–water (35:35:7:23, v/v/v/v). Finally, it was sprayed with EN<sup>3</sup>HANCE spray surface autoradiography enhancer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and exposed on an X-ray film, which was developed by standard methods.</p><p>Differences in the amounts of radioactively labeled trehalose were calculated via densitometry. For this purpose, TLCs were exposed to X-ray films for a shorter period (2 hr), which was optimized to prevent the saturation of spots. Subsequently, films were developed and scanned, after which trehalose spot intensities were calculated using Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc">fiji.sc</ext-link>) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mitochondrial staining and microscopy</title><p><italic>daf-2:icl-1::GFP</italic> L3 and dauer larvae were grown in liquid culture for 3 days at 15 and 25°C, respectively. Subsequently, they were pelleted in a 15 ml tube and resuspended in 100 µl of the original culture medium still containing bacteria. MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) stock solution (1 mM in DMSO) was diluted into 10 µM in the worm-bacteria suspension. Our previous experience shows that worms can tolerate up to 1% DMSO in the medium, therefore 1:100 dilution of the MitoTracker solution is the highest concentration that can be safely achieved. Worms were incubated in this solution for 1.5 hr at room temperature in dark. Next, the excess dye was washed off with M9 buffer and worms were resuspended again in 100 µl. They were incubated in M9 for 30 min so that they could defecate the excess dye in the gut. Finally, L3 and dauer larvae were anesthetized in 20 mM and 50 mM sodium azide, respectively.</p><p>Meanwhile, agarose pads on microscope slides were prepared and 5 µl of worm suspension was transferred on them. They were immediately covered with a coverslip and sealed with nail polish. We used a Zeiss LSM 700 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope and a Zeiss LCI Plan-Neofluar 63×/1.3 Imm Corr DIC M27 objective to image mitochondria (Zeiss, Germany). Simultaneously, GFP was excited at 488 nm and the emission below 550 nm was acquired by the first PMT while MitoTracker Red CMXRos was excited at 555 nm and the emission above 560 nm was acquired by the second PMT. Optical sections at 0.1×0.1×0.5 µm<sup>3</sup> x-y-z resolution were collected in a 4D hyperstack. Final images were adjusted for intensity and merged in Fiji. No non-linear adjustments were done.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Oxygen consumption assay</title><p>Oxygen consumption of worms was measured with a Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup>96 system (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). L3 and dauer larvae of <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> strains were grown in liquid culture for 3 days. Then, they were collected and washed extensively to remove excess bacteria and debris. Approximately 100 worms were pipetted into each well of a 96-well Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup> assay plate, except for the 4 corner wells, which were used to estimate the background measurement. Initial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured until the readings stabilized. Then, sodium azide with phenol red indicator was injected into half of the wells at a final concentration of 20 mM. The rest of the wells were injected only phenol red indicator in water. OCR was measured once again until it stabilized. Then 4 subsequent measurements were done in 6.5 min intervals. Finally, exact number of worms in each well were counted and used for normalization. A small number of abnormal readings were also filtered out at this stage. On average, 7–8 wells (technical replicates) were used for each condition.</p><p>Normalized OCR values were averaged for the last 4 measurements for each strain, stage and injection. OCR after water injection was named as total OCR (tOCR) and OCR after azide injection was named as non-mitochondrial OCR (nmOCR). The difference of tOCR and nmOCR was calculated for each time point (measurement) and named as mitochondrial OCR (mOCR) or respiration rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Biochemical pathway analysis was done by querying the KEGG database for <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins using NemaPath software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nematode.net">www.nematode.net</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wylie et al., 2008</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The glyoxylate shunt is essential for desiccation tolerance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the budding yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While there is interest in this work and the observations are potentially exciting, it was felt that the work presented is too preliminary as the reviewers noted in a number of spots that the observations were of low quality and/or lacked any effort at quantification. There was also a general feeling that there must be some effort to assess the impact of this phenomenon in other stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to justify the specificity of the major claim. The following are specific detailed major revisions that coincide with the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p>1) Trehalose content should be quantified in all experiments using appropriate replicated experimental design and proper statistical analysis. The current presentations are considered to be insufficiently empirical.</p><p>2) Similarly enzyme levels for Tps1 and Tps2 should be quantified if the claim is to focus on the substrate level accumulation.</p><p>3) There was also concern about if the effect is truly specific to the dauer state and an attempt should be made to test other states for stress resistance to test the specific argument being made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The article by Erkut et al. convincingly provides a role for the glyoxylate shunt in desiccation tolerance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and budding yeast. The experiments carried out are convincing and the use of the two model systems rather than the normal one is a considerable boon to the manuscript. Whilst I am find the story compelling there are two issues concerning the radioblots which I think could yet further improve the manuscript. Firstly, it is not clearly defined how the spots were identified – I assume co-running with authentic standards? However, this should be clearly stated. Secondly, whilst the differences are massive and I thus do not doubt the authors’ interpretation could they quantify them? Also is this replicated enough times to perform statistical comparison? As mentioned I do not doubt the findings but it would be nice to define the amount of trehalose production in the glyoxylate mutant. These modifications should be relatively easy to address.</p><p>The authors pass over the fact that the two enzymes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are encoded by a single protein. I find this fascinating and worthy of further comment even though I realise this would only be speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript of Erkut et al. provides compelling evidence that the glyoxylate shunt is critical for their survival of dauer <italic>C. elegans</italic> and stationary cultures of budding yeast to desiccation because the shunt contributes to the accumulation of trehalose. The steps of the glyoxylate shunt and the underlying enzymology were described many decades ago but the biological function of this metabolic pathway remained elusive. Thus the manuscript provides potentially an interesting new insight into the importance of regulating metabolism to achieve the proper characteristics of the quiescent state. Many experiments presented in the manuscript are rigorously performed and the quality of the data is excellent. However, the authors need to address important issues to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>The authors assume that the glyoxylate mutants impact trehalose accumulation by impacting the level of the substrates of the trehalose biosynthetic enzymes. However it is possible that the altered metabolic state reduces the level of the biosynthetic enzymes themselves. The authors should quantitate the levels of Tps1 and Tps2 in <italic>icl</italic> mutants in yeast and worms. This concern raises the more general question whether the function of the glyoxylate pathway is specific to desiccation tolerance or whether it contributes to the overall metabolic state of the dauer or stationary cells. The authors should test whether other representative characteristics of these states, survival, heat tolerance, etc. are altered in the glyoxylate shunt mutants. The answers to these questions might alter the authors' conclusions and discussion.</p><p>The Discussion is mostly a rehash of the Introduction and Results, missing many possibilities to make their results more appealing to a general audience. The authors fail to put their results in context of what is known about metabolic pathways and cell states. For example, have any other metabolic pathways been associated with specific cell states? They also fail to put their discovery into context about what is known about the regulation of trehalose biosynthesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13614.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>While there is interest in this work and the observations are potentially exciting, it was felt that the work presented is too preliminary as the reviewers noted in a number of spots that the observations were of low quality and/or lacked any effort at quantification.

The current presentations are considered to be insufficiently empirical.</italic></p><p>In all experiments concerning trehalose, its content is quantified and mean levels are statistically compared. At least three biological replicates and 2-3 technical replicates were used in these quantifications (subsection “Organic extraction”).</p><p><italic>2) Similarly enzyme levels for Tps1 and Tps2 should be quantified if the claim is to focus on the substrate level accumulation.</italic></p><p>Although, in response to the comment from Reviewer 2, we no longer strongly claim substrate level regulation, we nevertheless measured TPS enzyme levels in the worm as well as in the yeast (subsection “Trehalose measurement from yeast examples”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In worm, we quantified the total trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) activity in lysates of <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic>. We think this approach is very informative, because the activity of an enzyme may depend on other factors such as post-translational modifications or inhibitors. In yeast we measured Tps1 and Tps2 protein levels by expressing FLAG-tagged proteins. In both organisms TPS levels in wild type and glyoxalate shunt deficient mutants are similar.</p><p><italic>3) There was also concern about if the effect is truly specific to the dauer state and an attempt should be made to test other states for stress resistance to test the specific argument being made.</italic></p><p>We already investigated other states for desiccation tolerance (Erkut et al. 2011, Current Biology) and showed that only the dauer larva can survive desiccation. Other developmental stages are sensitive to even slight decreases in ambient humidity. Therefore, none of the assays we present in this work could have been performed in a reproductive stage worm.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The article by Erkut et al. convincingly provides a role for the glyoxylate shunt in desiccation tolerance in C. elegans and budding yeast.

Individual amino acid samples were first separated on 1 dimension for either mobile phases, visualized by ninhydrin staining, and their corresponding R<sub>f</sub> values were calculated. Then they were mixed and separated on 2 dimensions. Individual R<sub>f</sub> values calculated from the 1D TLC runs coincided largely with each molecule in question also on 2D. Furthermore, the positions of glutamate and glutamine were confirmed in another set of experiments, where glutamate- or glutamine-lacking mixtures of amino acids were separated on 2D. Localization of sugars on the 2D TLC system was done similarly, only using Molisch staining as the visualization method.”</p><p><italic>Secondly, whilst the differences are massive and I thus do not doubt the authors’ interpretation could they quantify them? Also is this replicated enough times to perform statistical comparison? As mentioned I do not doubt the findings but it would be nice to define the amount of trehalose production in the glyoxylate mutant. These modifications should be relatively easy to address.</italic></p><p>This is a very important point. In the initial manuscript, we quantified the total (non-radioactive) trehalose levels from biological triplicates in <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> dauer larvae. In the dauer larva before preconditioning, steady-state trehalose levels are approximately 100 µg trehalose per mg total soluble protein. This is increased 5 fold upon preconditioning in <italic>daf-2</italic> larvae, but only 2 fold in <italic>daf-2; icl-1</italic> larvae. Both increases are statistically significant. During the revision of the manuscript, upon the advice of the reviewer, we also measured the fold change of trehalose labeled with <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">14</xref></sup>C-acetate in these strains (subsection “Thin-layer chromatography”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Because we could not measure the absolute amounts of labeled trehalose, we could only measure the difference in folds. The induction of labeled trehalose is ~6 fold for <italic>daf-2</italic> and 2 fold for <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> (subsection “An intact GS is required for utilization of acetate/fatty acids for trehalose biosynthesis”), suggesting that the utilization of acetate (and thus fatty acids) for gluconeogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis depends on the existence of a functional GS. All measurements were done with 3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates.</p><p><italic>The authors pass over the fact that the two enzymes in C. elegans are encoded by a single protein. I find this fascinating and worthy of further comment even though I realise this would only be speculative.</italic></p><p>Indeed, it is extremely interesting that in the worm, ICL-1 has two separate domains for both isocitrate lyase and malate synthase activities. Already after cloning of this enzyme in Epstein’s group 20 years ago, it raised great excitement and it was even compared to the operon logic in bacteria (Liu, F. et al. Dev Biol 169, 399–414). We briefly discuss about this in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript of Erkut et al. provides compelling evidence that the glyoxylate shunt is critical for their survival of dauer C. elegans and stationary cultures of budding yeast to desiccation because the shunt contributes to the accumulation of trehalose. The steps of the glyoxylate shunt and the underlying enzymology were described many decades ago but the biological function of this metabolic pathway remained elusive. Thus the manuscript provides potentially an interesting new insight into the importance of regulating metabolism to achieve the proper characteristics of the quiescent state. Many experiments presented in the manuscript are rigorously performed and the quality of the data is excellent. However, the authors need to address important issues to strengthen the manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic><italic>The authors assume that the glyoxylate mutants impact trehalose accumulation by impacting the level of the substrates of the trehalose biosynthetic enzymes. However it is possible that the altered metabolic state reduces the level of the biosynthetic enzymes themselves. The authors should quantitate the levels of Tps1 and Tps2 in icl mutants in yeast and worms.</italic> </italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out this possibility. We measured enzyme levels in the worm as well as in the yeast (subsection “Trehalose measurement from worm extracts”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In worm, we quantified the total trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS) activity in lysates of <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;icl-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We think this approach is very informative, because the activity of an enzyme may depend on other factors such as post-translational modifications or inhibitors. In yeast we measured Tps1 and Tps2 protein levels by expressing FLAG-tagged proteins under the control of their own promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In both organisms TPS levels in wild type and glyoxalate shunt deficient mutants are similar. These results rule out the trivial explanation that GS-deficient worms/cells have limitations in trehalose biosynthesis and therefore have lower levels of trehalose.</p><p><italic>This concern raises the more general question whether the function of the glyoxylate pathway is specific to desiccation tolerance or whether it contributes to the overall metabolic state of the dauer or stationary cells. The authors should test whether other representative characteristics of these states, survival, heat tolerance, etc. are altered in the glyoxylate shunt mutants. The answers to these questions might alter the authors' conclusions and discussion.</italic></p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we tested how responses to other stress conditions (i.e., heat-shock in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and freeze-thaw stress in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) depend on the glyoxalate shunt (subsections “<italic>C. elegans</italic> heat-stress survival assey” and “<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> heat-stress survival assay”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results indicate that the sensitivity of both organisms to heat shock is independent of the GS. Remarkably, however, GS-deficient yeast cells were very sensitive to freeze-thaw stress compared to wild type cells. These results collective strengthen our conclusion that the GS is specifically involved in water-related stress tolerance, such as desiccation or freezing.</p><p><italic>The Discussion is mostly a rehash of the Introduction and Results, missing many possibilities to make their results more appealing to a general audience. The authors fail to put their results in context of what is known about metabolic pathways and cell states. For example, have any other metabolic pathways been associated with specific cell states? They also fail to put their discovery into context about what is known about the regulation of trehalose biosynthesis.</italic></p><p>The Discussion was rewritten and significantly shortened by about 450 words. Now it is more focused on our novel findings, putting them in a more general context in terms of global regulation of metabolism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
