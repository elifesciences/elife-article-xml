small RNAs (sRNAs) are key elements of regulatory networks that modulate gene expression. The sRNA RydC of <italic>Salmonella sp</italic>. and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is an example of this class of riboregulators. Like many other sRNAs, RydC bears a ‘seed’ region that recognises specific transcripts through base-pairing, and its activities are facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq. The crystal structure of RydC in complex with <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq at a 3.48 Å resolution illuminates how the protein interacts with and presents the sRNA for target recognition. Consolidating the protein–RNA complex is a host of distributed interactions mediated by the natively unstructured termini of Hfq.

Other RNA molecules called small RNAs are also involved in this process: these small RNAs bind to the messenger RNA molecules to either increase or decrease the production of proteins.</p><p>Bacteria and other microorganisms use small RNA molecules to help them respond to stress conditions and to changes in their environment, such as fluctuations in temperature or the availability of nutrients. The ability to rapidly adapt to these changes enables bacteria to withstand harmful conditions and to make efficient use of resources available to them.</p><p>Many small RNA molecules use a protein called Hfq to help them interact with their target messenger RNAs. In some cases this protein protects the small RNA molecules when they are not bound to their targets. Hfq also helps the small RNA to bind to the messenger RNA, and then recruits other enzymes that eventually degrade the complex formed by the different RNA molecules.</p><p>Previous research has shown that six Hfq subunits combine to form a ring-shaped structure and has also provided some clues about the way in which Hfq can recognise a short stretch of a small RNA molecule, but the precise details of the interaction between them are not fully understood. Now Dimastrogiovanni et al. have used a technique called X-ray crystallography to visualize the interaction between Hfq and a small RNA molecule called RydC.</p><p>These experiments reveal that a particular region of RydC adopts a structure known as a pseudoknot and that this structure is critical for the interactions between the RydC molecules and the Hfq ring. Dimastrogiovanni et al. find that one RydC molecule interacts with one Hfq ring, and they identify the contact points between the RydC molecule and different regions of the Hfq ring.</p><p>Based on this information, Dimastrogiovanni et al. propose a model for how the RydC:Hfq complex is likely to interact with a messenger RNA molecule.

In bacteria, the control of gene expression post-transcription is mediated in part by small RNAs (sRNAs), and their contributions enrich the computational complexity and repertoire of regulatory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beisel and Storz, 2011</xref>). Bacterial sRNAs are typically 50 to 300 nucleotides in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Storz et al., 2011</xref>), and each control expression of a distinct set of target mRNAs, which they recognise with high specificity and apparent precision. One of the major facilitators of sRNA activity in bacteria is the protein Hfq, which promotes pairing of an sRNA with its target mRNA in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Møller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vogel and Luisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panja and Woodson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Lay et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the kinetics of target pairing seem an essential aspect of sRNA action in vivo, as many of these sRNAs affect rates of translation or decay, either positively or negatively depending on target and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fröhlich and Vogel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desnoyers and Massé, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papenfort et al., 2013</xref>). It can be envisaged how Hfq acts as a catalyst for such recognition in vivo, but the question naturally arises how sRNAs generally achieve precision, accuracy, and speed in producing their effects and avoid undesired off-target consequences. The key to understanding these fundamental processes of sRNA-based regulation is to determine how RNAs are bound and presented by Hfq and other effector proteins.</p><p>The previous crystal structures of truncated Hfq variants have provided clues as to how the protein recognises short stretches of single-stranded RNA. Hfq bears an α + β fold that is the signature of the highly conserved family of Sm/Lsm proteins that draws members from all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kambach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilusz and Wilusz, 2013</xref>). Like other proteins of this extensive group, the bacterial Hfq self-assembles into a ring-like architecture. Hfq of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other eubacteria forms a compact hexameric toroid that presents two structurally non-equivalent concave surfaces for molecular recognition; these faces are referred to as the proximal and distal faces, with the former exposing an N-terminal α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schumacher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Link et al., 2009</xref>). Crystallographic studies have identified interactions of short RNA polymers with either of these two surfaces and have inferred sequence preferences that have been corroborated and refined by mutagenesis and solution binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schumacher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Link et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). According to these results, the proximal site interacts preferentially with uridine-rich sequences, while the distal site favours the binding of ARN or ARNN motifs (with R being a purine and N any nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schumacher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Link et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</xref>). In addition to the distal and proximal faces, the torus-shaped Hfq hexamer bears a convex circumferential rim that has recently been identified as a surface contributing to RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Structural studies of the hetero-heptameric Sm assembly from the mammalian splicing machinery have identified RNA binding surfaces that share some similarities with the bacterial counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leung et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial sRNAs may recognize their cognate target mRNAs in different ways. In some sRNAs, a target-recognition region is presented at or near the 5′-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papenfort et al., 2010</xref>). For another subset of sRNAs, several pairing regions are non-continuous and each can independently bind distinct targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beisel and Storz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). In both cases, the sRNA recognition site (referred to as the ‘seed’) and the target can have imperfect complementarity of various lengths with interactions being as short as 6 base-pairs, as seen for example in the SgrS/<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pair from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Kawamoto et al., 2006</xref>). To fully understand the mechanism of sRNA mediated regulation, it is important to address the questions of how the intricate RNA folds are recognised, how the seeds are presented, and how the pairing of sRNAs with mRNAs is facilitated. As the sRNAs, mRNAs, and their complexes can all be remodelled upon binding Hfq, the rules for recognition are likely to be highly dependent on context.</p><p>In this study, we describe the structure of the sRNA RydC in complex with the full-length Hfq protein of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Previous studies demonstrated that RydC is involved in biofilm regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordeau and Felden, 2014</xref>) as well as in the control of membrane stability through the positive regulation of an isoform of the <italic>cfa</italic> mRNA encoding cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>). RydC is proposed to have a pseudoknot fold that exposes a 5′ seed sequence, and the in vivo stability of RydC requires Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordeau and Felden, 2014</xref>). The crystal structure of the RydC–Hfq complex, together with biochemical and in vivo data, defines key interactions and suggests a hypothetical model for how the sRNA and mRNA targets might be matched through Hfq binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RydC interaction with Hfq and pseudoknot structure is essential for its stability in vivo</title><p>Despite its low abundance in comparison with other sRNAs under standard growth conditions, RydC has been repeatedly recovered with the Hfq protein in pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67a">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48a">Sittka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6a">Chao et al., 2012</xref>). A distinctive feature of RydC is its predicted pseudoknot fold which is highly conserved and whose disruption by point mutations renders the RNA unstable in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>). A double mutant of RydC (G37C and G39C within helix 1; hereafter, RydC-S1) was predicted computationally to form a distinct structure with one short stem-loop at the 5′-end and a strong terminator hairpin at the 3′-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05375.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Association of RydC with the chaperone Hfq and its pseudoknot fold are required for sRNA stability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Secondary structure of the RydC pseudoknot and the predicted alternative structure are formed by the double mutant RydC-SI.

To this end, both RydC and RydC-S1 were expressed in <italic>Salmonella</italic> under the control of the constitutive P<sub>L</sub> promoter from high-copy plasmids. At exponential growth (OD<sub>600</sub> of 1), transcription was stopped by the addition of rifampicin, and RNA levels were monitored at various time-points after treatment. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>), RydC is very stable in wild-type cells (half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) &gt;32 min), while RydC-S1 decayed rapidly (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼2 min). In contrast, the half-life of RydC is already markedly reduced in <italic>hfq</italic> mutant cells (t<sub>1/2</sub> ∼4 min) and there is some further acceleration of the decay rate for RydC-S1, matching that of RydC in the absence of Hfq. This observation led us to assume that RydC stability depends on both the integrity of the pseudoknot fold and the ability to associate with the Hfq protein. Both the wild-type RydC and RydC-S1 mutant bind Hfq in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro synthesized RNA although the affinity of the mutant is lower than for the wild-type RydC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Competition experiments suggest that the binding sites for the RydC and RydC-S1 overlap at least partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that the destabilisation in vivo might result mostly from the integrity of the pseudoknot fold, but to some degree, the Hfq binding alone may inhibit the degradation of RydC from initiating in single-stranded regions as suggested for other sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saramago et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overview of the structure of the RydC–Hfq complex</title><p>The strong association of RydC with Hfq both in vivo and in vitro as well as its highly compact structure made it an ideal candidate for co-crystallizations. Co-crystals of full length <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq and <italic>Salmonella</italic> RydC were obtained that diffracted to 3.48 Å resolution, and the crystal structure of the RydC–Hfq complex was solved by molecular replacement using a model of the structured hexameric core of <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq (i.e., lacking the C-terminal residues beyond amino acid 65). Unbiased, interpretable density for the RNA was apparent in the early maps calculated from the positioned protein hexamer, and a model for most of RydC could be fitted into the electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a map in which the RNA was omitted from the refinement and phase calculations). As the crystal structure is limited to a resolution of 3.48 Å, the map does not provide unequivocal alignment of RydC sequence with structure; however, the path of the majority of the RNA and the duplex regions could be modelled confidently. The asymmetric unit of the crystal comprises one full Hfq hexamer and one RydC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fold of the RydC is consistent with the pseudoknot structure predicted from solution studies and sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>). The RNA bridges two adjacent Hfq hexamers in the crystal lattice, effectively forming a distorted sandwich with a wedge-shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The 3′-end of the RNA interacts with the proximal face of the principle hexamer, while the 5′-end interacts with the upper portion of the lateral surface of another hexamer in the asymmetric unit (see below for details, paragraph ‘<italic>Interactions of RydC with the lateral surface of Hfq</italic>’).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05375.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the RydC/Hfq complex.</title><p>The content of the asymmetric unit is shown.

The sedimentation of the different species was followed both at 260 nm and 275 nm, corresponding respectively to the maximum absorbance of RNA and Hfq. The program Sedfit was used to extrapolate the sedimentation coefficients (S) for RydC, Hfq, and the protein–RNA complexes and their observed mass, after assuming that vHfq = 0.7248, vRydC = 0.5500 and after calculating the vcomplex with the following equation: vcomplex = (MWprotein × vprotein + MWRNA × vRNA)/(MWprotein + MWRNA) = 0.6835.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05375.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05375.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05375-fig2-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05375.008</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Size exclusion chromatography dynamic light scattering (SEC-MALS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Elution profile for the RydC:Hfq complex from a Superdex 200 column superimposed on the estimated molecular masses.

However, solution studies using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicate that the RydC can form a stable 1:1 complex with the Hfq hexamer under various buffer conditions when the components are present in unitary stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 2–3</xref>). When Hfq is present at twice the concentration of RydC under low ionic strength conditions, some 2:1 Hfq:RydC species can be identified; moreover, a higher order complex can be observed by electrophoretic mobility shifts when Hfq is in excess over RNA (results not shown). These observations suggest that the stoichiometry of Hfq/RNA complexes is very sensitive to solution conditions. In vivo, it seems unlikely that one RydC can find two Hfq hexamers when the protein is limiting to total RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner, 2013</xref>), and we suggest that the 1:1 complex is likely to represent the physiologically relevant species. We propose that the 2:1 sandwiching complex we observe in the crystal is not the biologically relevant species, but that it encompasses the full set of interactions that would form in a closed 1:1 RydC:Hfq complex. We suggest that the contacts made by RydC with the neighbouring Hfq hexamers can form on the proximal face of the same, single hexamer to form an idealised 1:1 complex. This hypothetical model will be elaborated on further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interactions of the U-rich tail of RydC with the proximal face of Hfq</title><p>The 3′-end of RydC has a U-rich tail that - together with a strong hairpin structure - facilitates Rho-independent transcription termination and which is an important determinant for recognition of many sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>). The RydC/Hfq structure reveals that the U-rich tail is bound in a recessed channel on the proximal face of Hfq. The electron density is not well defined in this region, and there may be disorder or multiple conformations of the polyU tail, but the features do show that uridines U61, U62, and U64 (as well as C63) each forms an aromatic base stacking interaction with the ring of F42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; distances provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). K56 forms hydrogen bonds with the O2 group of the uracils, consistent with the importance of this residue in binding RNA on the proximal face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mikulecky et al., 2004</xref>). The model indicates that there are likely to be hydrogen bonds between the uridine bases and Q41 and Q8, as well as between the furanose 2′ OH group with the imidazole group of H57. These interactions are consistent with the crystal structure of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium Hfq/polyU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sauer and Weichenrieder, 2011</xref>; PDB code 2YLC) and with fluorescence quenching experiments for binding U<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>).

In principle, the RNA can visit each of the uridine pockets following a clockwise or counter-clockwise path, but the polarity seems to be consistently clockwise in the reference frame that views the proximal face.

To address the function of the highly conserved U residues, three mutant variants of RydC were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). RydC-LI (U23G U24C), RydC-LII (U46C U47G), as well as RydC-LI/II (U23G U24C U46C U47G) were expressed from a constitutive promoter in wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> cells, and RNA stability was assessed by rifampicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In vitro binding experiments show that the affinity of purified Hfq truncated at residue 66 (Hfq<sup>66</sup>) for binding <italic>cfa</italic> is similar to that of the wild-type protein; however, the presence of RydC decreases substantially the binding of Hfq<sup>66</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The curve for Hfq<sup>66</sup>/RydC binding to <italic>cfa</italic> could not be modelled, but the affinity is likely to be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared with the binding of Hfq<sup>66</sup> alone to <italic>cfa.</italic> This reduction is much greater than the fivefold decrease in affinity when comparing the mRNA binding of the wild-type Hfq and its Hfq/RydC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We observe interactions of the 3′ polyU tract with the recessed pore in the Hfq proximal face and interactions of U–U dinucleotide steps in single-stranded regions with the surface near the rim. Based on results from in vivo crosslinking and RNA sequencing from enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic>, it has been proposed that the consensus Hfq binding site on many sRNAs includes a U–U dinucleotide associated with an unpaired region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tree et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with this prediction and provide a structural rationalisation: the unpaired region is required to engage the U–U step on the rim. Interactions with the rim may account for the capacity of longer U-tracts to bind Hfq more strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panja et al., 2013</xref>), since these are anticipated to bridge between the rim and the 3′-polyU-binding pore. The rim might also be the binding site for the internal U-rich region in SgrS that is required for stable association with Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure suggests that one RydC can be sandwiched between two Hfq hexamers, and a similar model has been proposed for interaction of Hfq with the sRNA DsrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). However, solution data indicate that the stoichiometry of the complex is sensitive to buffer conditions and that a 1:1 complex is preferred at higher salt concentrations, but a 2:1 Hfq hexamer:RydC complex can be formed in lower ionic strength buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We propose that the 1:1 complex is the physiologically relevant species in vivo and that the sandwiching complex we observe in the crystal is likely to mimic a folding intermediate en route to forming a closed 1:1 RydC:Hfq complex. Accordingly, the contacts formed by the RydC with the neighbouring Hfq hexamers can both occur on the proximal face of the same, single hexamer to form the 1:1 complex (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05375.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of the RydC/mRNA/Hfq effector complex.</title><p>Portions of the protomers forming the Hfq core have been represented with six spheres, from which the disordered C-terminal tails extend radially. RydC (orange) sits on the proximal face of Hfq, with the 3′-end U-rich tail interacting with the central channel and the two conserved U–U pairs (U23/U24 and U46/U47) making contacts with the lateral face of the hexamer. The two double strands conferring the pseudoknot structure to RydC are indicated as S I and S II. The target mRNA <italic>cfa</italic>, depicted in yellow, associates with the distal face of Hfq, and it is proposed to form a duplex with the 5′-end ‘seed’ region of RydC that is recognised by the circumferential rim of Hfq. The six long C-termini are depicted in the cartoon, and the shorter N-termini are not shown for clarity. The association of the two RNA partners is aided by the C-terminal tails of Hfq, which extend towards the RNA molecules, embracing them and stabilizing the seed/target pairing. The natively unstructured termini make distributed interactions with the RNA, visiting dynamically multiple points on the nucleic acid.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05375.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05375.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05375-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Solution studies indicate that the C-termini of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq are natively unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beich-Frandsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vincent et al., 2012</xref>). For most of the Hfq subunits in the crystal structure studied here, the C-terminal regions beyond residue 77 are disordered, but broken density in the vicinity is likely to be due to multiple conformations of the C-terminal region. These regions make consolidating interactions with the RNA and appear to be distributed over the exposed surfaces of the nucleic acid. A structural condensation of the C-terminal domains with sRNA binding is also consistent with data from X-ray and neutron solution scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>). Both the structural data as well as in vivo experiments suggest that the C-terminal end of Hfq contributes to the association with RydC. The distributive interactions of the C-terminal domain are not expected to provide specificity to the recognition but may enhance the stability of equilibrium complexes as well as boosting the association rates by increasing the effective molecular encounter radius. The distributive interaction may account for the finding that deletion of the C-terminal extension decreases binding to mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Večerek et al., 2008</xref>) and that the C-terminal tail can bind to some RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>). The same might be true for yeast Lsm1 mutants with C-terminal truncations that have reduced affinity for RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhury et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These results are in agreement with a study that compared the distribution of <italic>Salmonella</italic> RNAs associating with Hfq variants of different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51a">Sittka et al, 2009</xref>). Similar to several orthologues of various bacterial species, Hfq of the archaeon <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> lacks the unstructured C-terminus. <italic>M. jannaschii Hfq</italic> is generally able to complement a <italic>Salmonella hfq</italic> null mutant; however, the distribution of associated sRNAs recovered from pull-down experiments varies greatly compared to the wild-type. While a number of <italic>Salmonella</italic> sRNAs (including, for example, the Hfq-dependent SroC, InvR, and GcvB) are not reduced in their cellular abundance, a second class of sRNAs is strongly affected by the absence of the C-terminal end. This latter group includes RydC and also several sRNAs highly abundant in the wild-type (e.g., RprA, SdsR, and ArcZ), and it is tempting to speculate that this subpopulation of sRNAs is associated with Hfq through supporting interactions with the C-terminal tail. The differing roles of the tails for different sRNAs may account for the apparently conflicting results reported in the literature on the effects of the C-terminus on sRNA binding and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Finally, it should be noted that the C-terminal tails have different lengths in different Hfq homologs, and it is likely that their role differs in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vincent et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As a general principle, the interactions of natively unstructured regions with RNA may be important in other nucleic acid/protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tompa and Csermely, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kucera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013</xref>), and they can contribute to cooperative binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunter and Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>). We envisage that these interactions would help to keep the sRNA and mRNA in proximity without constraining them, so that the mRNA might travel along the distal face while the sRNA was held in a more fixed conformation on the proximal face. In this way, the complex can glide along an mRNA until the seed and target region meet. Once this occurs, they will close like a zipper to form a short duplex that could be engaged on the convex rim of the Hfq. The mismatch of molecular symmetries and the high flexibility of both the N- and C-termini of Hfq ensure that the complex will be intrinsically heterogeneous in conformation, but highly dynamic.</p><p>Based on the current crystal structure, including the lattice interactions observed, and on other available structural and biophysical data, we propose a speculative model for the ternary complex of Hfq/sRNA and mRNA target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The model shares some similarity to the schematic proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panja et al. (2013)</xref> and predicts that the 5′ seed will be exposed and available for interaction with the target to form a duplex region that binds to the convex rim of the Hfq hexamer. We envisage that a different model will be required to explain the interactions of sRNA using recognition regions that are internal and not in the 5′ seed. One prediction is that the base-pairing sites in this group of sRNAs will be presented near the rim of Hfq. This model awaits testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of Hfq</title><p>Wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfq was expressed and purified as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyra et al.

Labelled RNA RydC or RydC-S1 (4 pmol) was denatured (95°C, 2 min), chilled on ice for 5 min, and supplemented with 1× structure buffer and 1 μg yeast RNA. Upon addition of purified Hfq (concentration as indicated in the figure legends) or Hfq dilution buffer (control; 1× structure buffer, 1% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100), samples were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Unlabelled competitor RNA was added at the indicated concentrations, and samples were incubated for additional 10 min. Prior to loading, reactions were mixed with native loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.5× TBE, 0.02% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue) and separated by native PAGE (6% PAA). Gels were dried and signals were determined on a Typhoon FLA 7000 phosphorimager.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (BFL) and the Bavarian BioSysNet programme (JV).

Your article has been favourably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. All three thought the structure of a full small regulatory RNA bound to Hfq was a major advance. Their comments listed below are related to the need for clarification of some data.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Is it clear that the wild-type RydC and the RydC-S1 mutant, while binding Hfq with similar affinities (cited as results not shown), bind to the same face and in the same way to Hfq? One question is how much the findings with this pseudoknot RNA can be extrapolated to other Hfq-binding sRNAs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that RydC-S1 expressed in cells in the presence of Hfq is at a very low level at the time rifampicin is added (t=0). Hfq may bind to RydC-S1, but it apparently is unable to protect it from degradation. The data clearly shows the presence of Hfq inhibits degradation of RydC. This could be an indirect effect, but it could be due to Hfq binding/stabilizing the RydC pseudoknot fold and inhibiting degradation from the 5' end. The conclusions and comments here should be clarified.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The major issue from the crystallography is that in the crystal, RydC is interacting with two adjacent Hfq hexamers. The authors suggest that the contacts seen on neighboring hexamers can also form on a single one, and that such single interaction is likely to be the functional complex. A clearer discussion of what interacts with each hexamer would at least clarify whether there are mutational tests that might demonstrate the importance of each type of interaction. Related to this point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is the only figure that provides a picture of the whole structure and therefore is important for readers to understand the major conclusions, as well as the nature of the complex with two Hfq hexamers. It might be easier to understand this if the second RydC (at upper right) in 2b were in a different shade, for instance (lighter), and possibly if a schematic were included to make it clear what is going on (what the contacts are on each proximal face). Highlighting in some fashion (maybe box and expand to the side) the rim interaction region is important in trying to understand the implications of this sandwiched structure for the rim interaction. It is hard to read the label in some cases. Is the U-rich tail on one hexamer and the 5' end on the other Hfq hexamer? How important is the 5' end for function?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The data in this figure is difficult to understand. By stability measurements alone, LI and LI/LII should be similarly defective; however, for activity, LI is much more active than LI/LII, and in terms of accumulation of RydC, LI looks better than LII (or the double). Is there an explanation for this?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: Why was an Hfq mutant with 6 changes used for this experiment? It is difficult to know which rim interactions are in fact important, given this drastic change. Is this active for RydC regulation of <italic>cfa</italic> in vivo? Is this mutant derivative present at wild type levels in the cell? Does the lateral rim mutant show wild type binding to <italic>cfa</italic> in the absence of RydC and reduced binding in the presence of RydC in vivo?</p><p>Also, no data is shown on response vs time to obtain the kinetic rates for the SPR experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. This data and the fit should be added to supplementary information. The response values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> are low and raise a concern on the accuracy of the evaluated parameters. Additionally, the asymptotic maximum response value for the Hfqrim (1.8) is less than half than that for HfqWT (5.0). If both Hfq's bind <italic>cfa</italic> RNA in a similar way what accounts for this difference? The authors could support their conclusions from the SPR data by including electrophoretic gel shift data on HfqWT and Hfqrim binding to the <italic>cfa</italic> RNA and RydC.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: The authors need to comment on these decay curves. While they emphasize here the very early points (half-life reduced to 5', compared to hfq null), it is striking that only a fraction of the RNA is in fact degraded (40%?) in this mutant. Does that suggest that a subpopulation becomes sensitive, but an almost equal part is stably bound to Hfq? Is this truncated Hfq active for RydC regulation in vivo?</p><p>6) Discussion: The authors should comment on the fact that some Hfq homologs do not have this extension as well as name the proteins that have unstructured regions important to other nucleic acid/protein complexes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05375.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: Is it clear that the wild-type RydC and the RydC-S1 mutant, while binding Hfq with similar affinities (cited as results not shown), bind to the same face and in the same way to Hfq?

The conclusions and comments here should be clarified</italic>.</p><p>To address the question of whether RydC and RydC-S1 bind the same face of Hfq, we performed EMSA competition experiments. Our results demonstrate that the affinity for Hfq of the S1 mutant is lower than that of wild type RydC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> panel A). The complex formed by RydC with Hfq can only be partially outcompeted in the presence of a 500-fold excess of cold RydC-S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> panel B, lanes 1-7). In contrast, RydC-S1/Hfq complexes appeared more susceptible to competition and were already destabilized in the presence of 10-fold excess of unlabelled RydC RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref> panel B, lanes 8-14). We conclude that the low in vivo stability of RydC-S1 is likely due to its lower affinity for Hfq and its relatively weak performance in competition for chaperone binding. Additionally, our competition experiments suggest that RydC wild type and S1 mutant share at least an overlapping binding site. This result is described in the modified text and included in the revised supplementary Materials and methods section.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with in vitro synthesized, 5' end-labelled RydC and RydC-S1 RNAs (RydC* and RydC-S1*, 4 nM) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Hfq protein as indicated.

We assume that the lower stability of RydC-S1 is most likely arising from the susceptibility of the RNA to RNase attack when not bound by Hfq. Wild-type RydC is very stable in vivo (t<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 32’), and its half-life cannot further increase in a temperature sensitive RNase E mutant (rne-ts) compared to the control strain in the course of a 32’ experiment. We do observe an even flatter decay rate though. This suggests that RydC is mostly immune to the action of RNase E when bound to Hfq. In contrast, the half-life of the S1 pseudoknot mutant was increased in the absence of RNase E (from ∼3 min to ∼6.5 min), suggesting that the S1 mutant is more susceptible to degradation. However, the S1 mutant is not as stable as wild-type RydC and might be preferentially attacked by other cellular nucleases. Whether this susceptibility is due to an alternative structure or reduced binding capability to Hfq is unclear. We have clarified in the text that both the formation of the pseudoknot and the binding of Hfq may contribute to the in vivo stabilization of RydC.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Stabilities of RydC and RydC-S1 were determined in <italic>Salmonella</italic> rne-ts by Northern blot analysis of total RNA samples withdrawn prior to and at indicated time-points after inhibition of transcription by rifampicin (OD600 of 1). In the temperature-sensitive rne-ts <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain, RNase E retains its normal capacity when grown at the permissive temperature of 28°C. As cells are shifted to 44°C, RNase E undergoes a conformational rearrangement rendering it catalytically inactive (Apirion, 1978; Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2009). To quantify the decay rates, the signal obtained at 0 min was set to 100, and the amount of RNA remaining at each time-point was plotted as a function of time. The time-point at which 50% of RNA had been decayed (dashed line) was calculated to determine the half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05375-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: The major issue from the crystallography is that in the crystal, RydC is interacting with two adjacent Hfq hexamers.

Also, the UU steps make pseudoequivalent contacts, so that U23/U24 make interactions with the rim portion in one hexamer while the U46/U47 make nearly the same interactions with the same residues in the second hexamer (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).

By stability measurements alone, LI and LI/LII should be similarly defective; however, for activity, LI is much more active than LI/LII, and in terms of accumulation of RydC, LI looks better than LII (or the double)</italic>. <italic>Is there an explanation for this?</italic></p><p>Regarding the differences in LI and LII, we suggest the causes are complex in vivo. Synthesis rate may not be a major factor since all the variants are expressed from the same constitutive promoter. Instead, the differences might be due to rates of assembly onto Hfq, rates of target binding, and of decay. Our tentative explanation for this is that the assembly rate of LI is sufficiently high to make enough active regulator whereas the LI/II double mutant may be compromised for both assembly and stability, resulting in an intracellular copy number too low for <italic>cfa</italic> activation. Such effects are difficult to distinguish in vivo and will need the development of a suitable in vitro assay that can separate sRNA decay and activity in a more quantitative fashion. We suggest that LI and LII are both interacting with Hfq, but there might be two alternative binding patterns involving LI or LII. One of the binding options (the one using site LI) is more beneficial for RydC with regard to stability. If interacting via LI RydC is capable of target binding, but also protection by Hfq. If interacting via LII, RydC is still able to interact with <italic>cfa</italic> but is more susceptible to degradation. The LI/LII double mutant does not bind Hfq, and is degraded without ever interacting with the target. We have changed the text to clarify the limitations in interpreting these data.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>: Why was an Hfq mutant with 6 changes used for this experiment?

We have found that these signals differ for different constructs, likely due to differences in the relationship of the various Hfq species and the surface of the sensor. The electrophoretic gel shift mobility data show two bands with titrations for the Hfq<sup>WT</sup> while only one band is seen for the Hfq<sup>rim</sup> mutant, and these may account for the different layer thicknesses of the two samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Author response image 8</xref> below). These data also show that polyU is slightly more effective than polyA for competitive binding of RydC to Hfq, consistent with proximal face binding for both wild type and rim mutants. We also do not observe a strong effect of polyA or polyU on <italic>cfa</italic> binding for both wild-type Hfq and the mutant, what suggests that Hfq<sup>Rim</sup> interacts with it in a similar manner.<fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><p>Hfq wild-type (Hfq<sup>WT</sup>) and mutant (Hfq<sup>Rim</sup>) binding to RydC (left panel) and <italic>cfa</italic> (right panel). 10 nM of 5’ P<sup>32</sup> labelled RNA was used with 20 nM Hfq and 25 nM polyA or polyU.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05375-resp-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>: The authors need to comment on these decay curves. While they emphasize here the very early points (half-life reduced to 5', compared to Hfq null), it is striking that only a fraction of the RNA is in fact degraded (40%?) in this mutant.

Is this truncated Hfq active for RydC regulation in vivo?</italic></p><p>This is an interesting point, and we agree that our results might reflect that there are two subpopulations of RydC with one being more sensitive to decay in the absence of the Hfq C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 9</xref> panel A). As suggested by the reviewer, we have investigated <italic>cfa</italic> regulation by RydC in the presence of Hfq70, and found that <italic>cfa</italic> activity was only slightly compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Author response image 9</xref> panel B). In vitro affinity measurements of Hfq<sup>66</sup> for RydC show similar binding to the wild type. One potential explanation is that the interaction of RydC with the C-terminus acts as a foothold and increases the on-rate of the RNA. As a consequence there is more free RydC in the cell in the hfq70 background. Bound RydC remains stable and can interact with <italic>cfa</italic> mRNA while the unbound fraction is decayed quickly, leading to a stepwise degradation pattern.
