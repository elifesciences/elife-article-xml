Finally, we show that the transgenerational acquisition of longevity in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants is associated with accumulating genomic H3K9me2 that is inherited by their long-lived wild-type descendants at a subset of loci. These results suggest that heterochromatin facilitates the transgenerational establishment and inheritance of a complex trait. Based on these results, we propose that transcription-coupled H3K4me via COMPASS limits lifespan by encroaching upon domains of heterochromatin in the genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transgenerational inheritance</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>COMPASS</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12GM00680-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Teresa W</given-names></name><name><surname>Carpenter</surname><given-names>Brandon Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS1354998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>David John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS098663-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstrom</surname><given-names>Amanda Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan is facilitated by the accumulation of repressive chromatin across generations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lifespan is governed by complex interactions between genetics and the environment. Despite its complexity as a trait, lifespan is limited by the germline in a wide range of metazoans. For example, genetic or physical ablation of the germline extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arantes-Oliveira, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Flatt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). These observations led to the disposable soma theory of aging, which posits that resources are shifted to the germline to promote progeny fitness at the expense of maintaining the parental soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979</xref>). Some have theorized that one cost of a germline is transcription during gametogenesis, but the molecular details of how germline transcription affects lifespan remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ghazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Regions of active transcription are marked by post-translational histone modifications, like the methylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shilatifard, 2008</xref>). H3K4me is deposited by the MLL/COMPASS complex, which travels with elongating RNA Polymerase II during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wood et al., 2007</xref>). In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, animals with reductions in COMPASS complex subunits (<italic>wdr-5, ash-2,</italic> and the methyltransferase <italic>set-2</italic>) live longer than wild-type individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>). The lifespan extension of COMPASS mutants requires the presence of an actively proliferating germline, suggesting that COMPASS acts specifically in the germline to limit lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequent work showed that reducing COMPASS solely in the germline activates a fatty acid desaturation pathway in the intestine that increases lifespan, in part by down-regulating an S6 kinase normally expressed in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of this pathway causes the accumulation of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and this increase is sufficient to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Greer and colleagues also found that longevity could be heritable. The lifespan extension of COMPASS mutants was inherited by their wild-type descendants for four generations, before reverting to wild-type lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2011</xref>). The transgenerational inheritance of longevity suggests that it is an epigenetic trait, but the mechanism of inheritance remains unknown. In particular, it is difficult to reconcile how reduced H3K4me in COMPASS mutants can block COMPASS from restoring a normal chromatin environment in genetically wild-type descendants of COMPASS mutants. Thus, the longevity of COMPASS mutants may be due to another heritable factor.</p><p>We have previously described an epigenetic reprogramming mechanism in which two chromatin modifiers cooperate to erase traces of prior transcription at fertilization. The demethylase SPR-5 (LSD1/KDM1A) removes active H3K4me1/2, while the methyltransferase MET-2 (SETDB1) methylates histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerr et al., 2014</xref>). This reprogramming mechanism responds to reduced H3K4me in COMPASS mutants by adding more H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerr et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the longevity of COMPASS mutants could be associated with H3K9me2 deposited in response to reductions in transcription-coupled H3K4me.</p><p>H3K9me2 is classically considered a repressive modification and often associated with heterochromatin. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 each have distinct roles in the genome, with H3K9me2, rather than H3K9me3, most closely associated with canonical heterochromatin factors like HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>). One theory of aging, the heterochromatin loss model, is supported by several lines of evidence suggesting that losing repressive chromatin is detrimental for lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsurumi and Li, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Villeponteau, 1997</xref>). In humans, two premature aging diseases are caused by mutations in lamins that reduce heterochromatin and disrupt its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shumaker et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals, heterochromatin decreases as individuals grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wood and Helfand, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haithcock et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, across eukaryotes, mutations that increase repressive chromatin extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kennedy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maures et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the interaction between repressive H3K9me2 and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan over generational time.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transgenerational longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants</title><p>It has previously been reported that animals mutant for genes encoding components of the COMPASS complex have a lifespan extension of up to 28% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>).This lifespan extension is inherited by wild-type descendants of these mutants, before reverting back to wild-type levels in the fifth generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2011</xref>).

Starting with P0 as described above, we followed a single population of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants and assessed lifespan periodically. For the first six generations (which are hereafter referred to as early-gen populations), <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had slightly shorter lifespans than wild-type populations of the same generation, though the decrease was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In generations F8 to F14 (hereafter referred to as mid-gen populations), <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had lifespans that were the same as, or slightly longer than, wild-type populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), though the change was only statistically significant in some generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By generation F20 and in subsequent generations (hereafter referred to as late-gen populations), <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations were consistently and statistically longer-lived than wild-type populations of the same generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, populations of wild-type animals continuously treated with <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi experienced a similarly gradual increase in lifespan, with a modest increase seen by generation F12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, p=0.039, log-rank test). Overall, late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had median lifespan extensions ranging from 5–40% (with an average of 17% across multiple replicates) which recapitulated the 16–28% extension originally reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we conclude that <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had longer lifespans, but only after many generations of lacking WDR-5 activity.</p><p>In many taxa, fecundity is inversely correlated with lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). To determine whether the appearance of longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations correlates with a decrease in fecundity, we measured progeny number across generational time. It has previously been shown that <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants have decreased broods and increased embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simonet et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with prior observations, early-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had 27–47% fewer progeny than wild-type populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>). However, we did not observe a correlation between the onset of longevity and the decrease in progeny number, as long-lived late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants did not have significantly fewer progeny than early- or mid-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, p=0.11 and p=0.13, respectively, unpaired t-test). This result suggests that lifespan extension in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants was not a direct consequence of reduced fecundity, despite the fact that it requires a proliferative germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The appearance of longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants could be caused by the acquisition of background mutations in lifespan-determining genes, but several observations make this scenario unlikely. First, we have repeated the transgenerational analysis of lifespan in these populations seven additional times. In each replicate, lifespan increased gradually between early-, mid-, and late-gen populations, with late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants consistently living longer than late-gen wild-type populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, when long-lived late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants were subjected to either starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) or freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), lifespan reverted back to wild-type levels. We have also outcrossed long-lived late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants to wild-type populations, maintained these populations as heterozygotes for five generations, and re-selected new homozygous P0 <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations. These P0 <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants reverted back to being short-lived, even as the original late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations remained long-lived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Concurrent and opposite changes in lifespan account for the full <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan extension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lifespan of early-, mid-, and late-gen wild-type (yellow, tangerine, and burnt orange, respectively) and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations (lavender, purple, and plum, respectively) descended from animals recovered from a thaw.

In our transgenerational lifespan experiments, <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations were compared to wild-type populations of the same generation. Therefore, the appearance of longevity could be caused by a relative extension in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan, a relative decrease in wild-type lifespan, or changes in both populations. To distinguish between these possibilities, we directly compared the lifespan of early-, mid-, and late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant and wild-type populations in the same lifespan assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, wild-type lifespan decreased over generational time by 12%, primarily between early- and mid-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’</xref>, p=0.02, log-rank test), despite the fact that progeny number did not change in these populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>). As mentioned previously, we assayed wild-type lifespan in descendants of animals recovered from a thaw, which we consider the P0 population. The process of freezing a strain involves an L1 larval diapause induced by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baugh, 2013</xref>). The generational change in wild-type lifespan after recovery from a thaw suggested that some aspect of starvation may increase lifespan in descendants, as has been previously shown in populations recovered from L1 diapause or from dauer diapause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the effect of starvation on wild-type populations, we starved a late-gen population that had already experienced a decrease in lifespan. Wild-type descendants of starved animals lived longer than their non-starved cousins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, p=0.001, log-rank test). To further confirm that the increase in wild-type lifespan in populations recovered from a freeze was caused by the freeze itself, we compared <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants and wild-type populations that were both descended from the same outcrossed population that had been maintained as <italic>wdr-5/+</italic> heterozygotes for five generations. If the initial increase in wild-type lifespan was caused by the freeze-thaw process, then wild-type populations derived from the outcross, which did not undergo a freeze-thaw, should not have this initial increase in lifespan. Consistent with this possibility, we found that after the outcross, both early-gen wild-type animals and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had similar lifespans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, p=0.32, log-rank test). In addition, early-gen wild-type animals from the outcross had a shorter lifespan than early-gen wild-type animals from a thaw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, p=0.02, log-rank test). These results confirmed that wild-type lifespan was only extended after undergoing the freeze-thaw process.</p><p>In contrast to what occurred in wild-type animals, lifespan in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants increased over generational time by 20%, primarily between mid- and late-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’’</xref>, p=0.009, log-rank test).

However, changes in wild-type lifespan were not the sole driver of longevity in late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, since late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants lived significantly longer than even early-gen wild-type populations (p=0.0009, log-rank test).

At all genes, H3K9me2 enrichment was low and decreased from early- to late-gen in both wild-type and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Likewise, at germline genes, wild-type H3K9me2 enrichment decreased between early- and late-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, H3K9me2 enrichment at germline genes increased between early- and late-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This increase countered the slight global decrease observed in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants between early- and late-gen populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’’</xref>).

To examine this possibility, we assayed H3K9me2 enrichment over generational time. By western blot, global H3K9me2 levels were fairly low, making it difficult to detect the inheritance of enriched H3K9me2. For a more quantitative measure of H3K9me2 enrichment, we used ChIP-qPCR on wild-type descendants of long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, choosing six loci that had high levels of H3K9me2 in long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). At all loci, H3K9me2 levels were elevated in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutant populations and were relatively low in a late-gen wild-type control, which confirmed our ChIP-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). At three of the loci examined, H3K9me2 levels remained high in long-lived F4 wild-type animals descended from long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, and dropped back to low levels in F7 wild-type descendants of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. At a fourth locus, H3K9me2 levels remained high in one of two long-lived F4 wild-type replicates. At two other loci, H3K9me2 levels were low in all wild-type descendants of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, indicating that the elevated H3K9me2 was not inherited at a subset of loci.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lifespan is a complex trait determined by many factors, including overall chromatin state. In this study, we find that lifespan gradually increases with each generation in populations lacking WDR-5 activity for at least twenty generations. These data provide a rare example of a complex trait acquired transgenerationally across successive generations.</p><p>We were surprised to find that wild-type lifespan decreases over generational time in populations recovering from a thaw. The changes in wild-type lifespan indicate that lifespan can be modulated transgenerationally irrespective of any mutations in chromatin modifiers. If a trait as complex as lifespan can change over time without a mutation, it seems likely that other phenotypes may be epigenetically regulated over generational time. In addition, the transgenerational nature of wild-type lifespan could account for some discrepancies in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging field. We find that after starving or recovering from a thaw, wild-type lifespan decreases for about twelve generations before reaching a steady state. These data, along with other studies, suggest that starving increases lifespan by altering the epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webster et al., 2018</xref>). Independent of any lifespan changes in wild-type populations, the extension of lifespan in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants is truly caused by loss of COMPASS activity, because late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants live longer than any generation of wild type. This could account for why the transgenerational nature of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant longevity had not previously been reported. Ultimately, we see the greatest difference in lifespan when comparing late-gen wild-type and late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations (on average, a 22% increase), recapitulating prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two pieces of evidence indicate that the transgenerational increase of lifespan in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants is an epigenetic phenomenon. First, the COMPASS complex deposits transcription-coupled H3K4me, a modification that is able to be inherited between generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heard and Martienssen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). Second, the lifespan increase in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants can be reset and subsequently reproduced, making it unlikely that longevity is caused by background genetic effects. But what changes over so many generations in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants? In the continued absence of COMPASS activity, <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants have less H3K4me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Kelly, 2011</xref>). However, it is difficult to imagine how a modification missing for so many generations could account for the inheritance of longevity in animals that have normal COMPASS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether the loss of COMPASS activity affects another heritable factor.</p><p>The gradual appearance of longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations suggests that this factor accumulates over many generations, while two other findings indicate that it resides in the germline. First, heritable factors must be passed through germline tissue, whether they are genetically or epigenetically inherited. Second, a proliferating germline is required for longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greer et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, in this study we examined whether H3K9me2 might be the heritable factor that confers longevity. Across generational time, we found that the relative enrichment of H3K9me2 generally correlates with longevity in both wild-type and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant populations, raising the possibility that H3K9me2 may be protective for lifespan. Our approach to ChIP-seq does not allow us to compare absolute quantities of H3K9me2 across samples, but we are able to detect a relative H3K9me2 enrichment in the populations that experienced the most significant changes in lifespan. For example, the largest decrease in wild-type lifespan occurs between early- and mid-gen populations, which is when we observe a genome-wide decrease in H3K9me2. Similarly, the largest increase in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan occurs between mid- and late-gen populations, correlating with a genome-wide increase H3K9me2 enrichment. Overall, among the transgenerational populations examined, we find that relative H3K9me2 enrichment changes most during the same generations that lifespan changes. However, it should be noted that, although the overall trend of H3K9me2 enrichment does parallel the lifespan changes we observe, the correlation is not absolute. For example, there are generational time periods where H3K9me2 enrichment decreases even as lifespan remains unchanged: in mid- to late-gen wild-type populations, and in early- to mid-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that only a subset of loci, of the thousands identified, may be responsible for extending lifespan.</p><p>The general correlation between H3K9me2 enrichment and longevity is further supported by our finding that the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 is necessary both for a normal lifespan and for the lifespan extension of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants. However, multiple pathways are able to shorten lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). To test whether higher levels of H3K9me2 can extend lifespan independent of COMPASS activity, we examined animals lacking JHDM-1, a putative H3K9 demethylase. The absence of JHDM-1 is sufficient to increase lifespan. Additionally, longevity appears more quickly in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants than in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, perhaps because JHDM-1 has a more direct effect on H3K9me2 than COMPASS. Within a few generations, we observe that long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants have already experienced a large increase in H3K9me2 enrichment. This result provides further evidence of the correlation between longevity and H3K9me2. In addition, the majority of H3K9me2 peaks in long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants are shared with long-lived <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, which is consistent with the possibility that lifespan extension is caused by similar means in both mutants. Finally, we noticed that mid- or late-gen <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants appear healthier than their <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant counterparts, indicating that H3K9me2 may affect health-span in addition to lifespan.</p><p>Based on our data, we developed the following model. Normally, WDR-5 functions as a component of COMPASS to add H3K4me during transcription. After thawing or starving, the genome has elevated H3K9me2, which is eroded in subsequent generations by the deposition of transcription-coupled H3K4me. This H3K9me2 reduction gradually reduces lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In wild type, the continued presence of COMPASS activity in the germline keeps H3K9me2 levels low over genes by maintaining H3K4me levels. COMPASS’s maintenance of H3K4me over expressed genes occurs even when H3K9me2 levels are elevated overall in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, the lack of transcription-coupled H3K4me protects H3K9me2 in the genome, allowing it to accumulate at germline genes over generational time and extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, we propose that the transgenerational inheritance of H3K9me2 extends lifespan in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants.</p><p>Our model may also explain how longevity is transgenerationally inherited in genetically wild-type descendants of COMPASS mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2011</xref>). Inappropriately high H3K9me2 in long-lived <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants could be inherited by their descendants, initially preventing COMPASS from restoring a steady-state chromatin environment and conferring longevity. After several generations of normal COMPASS activity, H3K4me would then reestablish wild-type levels of H3K9me2, resulting in the reversion to normal lifespan by the fifth generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with H3K9me2’s involvement in the inheritance of longevity, we find that MET-2 is necessary for the inheritance of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant longevity. Furthermore, if H3K9me2 mediates inheritance directly, we would not expect the short lifespan of <italic>met-2</italic> mutants to be inherited when H3K9me2 is restored by MET-2. We show that F3 genetically wild-type descendants of <italic>met-2</italic> mutants have normal lifespans, suggesting that H3K9me2 is directly involved in inheritance of longevity. However, this genetic interaction does not distinguish whether MET-2’s effect on inheritance is directly through H3K9me2 or through another factor responding to the absence of H3K9me2.</p><p>The extended lifespan of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants allows for an independent test of whether H3K9me2 mediates the inheritance of longevity. If H3K9me2 is the mechanism by which descendants of COMPASS inherit their longevity, it should be heritable and confer longevity no matter the genetic background. Similar to what was previously reported for <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, we find that F4 wild-type descendants of long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants are long-lived, and longevity reverts to normal in F5-F7 descendants. In addition, at four out of six H3K9me2 ChIP-seq peaks examined by ChIP-qPCR, we find evidence that elevated H3K9me2 levels remain high in F4 genetically wild-type descendants of long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. This result suggests that H3K9me2 enrichment can be inherited at a subset of loci. By F7, when the lifespan of genetically wild-type descendants has reverted to wild-type levels, we find that H3K9me2 enrichment has also decreased back to wild-type levels at these four loci. Based on these observations, we propose that H3K9me2 is also the factor that allows for the transgenerational inheritance of longevity.</p><p>Previously, mutants lacking the H3K4 demethylase SPR-5 were found to acquire increased lifespan after six to ten generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we considered the possibility that <italic>spr-5</italic> and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants share a common mechanism. However, <italic>spr-5</italic> mutants accumulate the active modification H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>), which differs from the H3K9me2 accumulation observed in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants. Additionally, <italic>spr-5</italic> mutant longevity is mediated by the known DAF-36/DAF-12 lifespan signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer et al., 2016</xref>), whereas the lifespan extension of COMPASS mutants occurs independent of this pathway. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms underlie the transgenerational acquisition of longevity in these mutants.</p><p>Although this work demonstrates that H3K9me2 functions in the establishment and inheritance of extended lifespan, it does not address the mechanism by which H3K9me2 affects longevity. However, the increased lifespan in COMPASS mutants has been linked to the fatty acid desaturation pathway in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2017</xref>). It is not clear how these metabolic changes correlate with the transgenerational acquisition of longevity in COMPASS mutants or its inheritance by wild-type descendants. Nevertheless, the increase in mono-unsaturated fatty acids in COMPASS mutants is at least partially mediated by downregulating germline target genes, including the S6 kinase <italic>rsks-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2017</xref>). When we examined H3K9me2 at this locus over generational time, we found that late-gen <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants had much higher H3K9me2 enrichment than their wild-type counterparts, matching the overall trend we see at all H3K9me2 peaks. Thus, it is possible that the accumulation of mono-unsaturated fatty acids in COMPASS mutants may be caused by higher levels of H3K9me2 in long-lived populations. Further work will be necessary to determine whether this is the case.</p><p>Overall, we have established a role for a heterochromatic histone modification in both the establishment and inheritance of a complex trait. This work also relates two seemingly disparate theories of aging that are widely observed among eukaryotes: the disposable soma theory of aging, which is based on observations that reproductive ability often comes at the expense of lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979</xref>), and the heterochromatin loss model of aging, which is based on the observation that heterochromatin declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsurumi and Li, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Villeponteau, 1997</xref>). Our model proposes a mechanism that could connect both theories: if reduced heterochromatin is a burden on lifespan, then limiting H3K9me2 through transcription-coupled H3K4me deposition in the germline may represent one cost of maintaining a germline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, hermaphrodite)</td><td valign="top">N2 wild type</td><td valign="top">Wormbase</td><td valign="top">WB Cat# N2_(ancestral), RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:N2_">WB-STRAIN:N2_</ext-link>(ancestral)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>, hermaphrodite)</td><td valign="top"><italic>wdr-5 (ok1417) III</italic></td><td valign="top">Wormbase</td><td valign="top">WB Cat# RB1304;

On Day 1, young adults (on their first day of egg-laying) were allowed to lay for 4–6 hr to hatch a synchronized population for the assay. When progeny were L4s or young adults, 90 animals per condition were transferred to new plates, with 30 animals per plate. Animals were transferred every day or every other day during their fertile period (usually the first ten days of adulthood). Plates were scored daily and animals marked as dead if they did not move in response to repeated prodding with a platinum pick. Animals were censored from analysis if they died from ruptured vulvas, matricide (‘bag of worms’ phenotype), or crawling off the agar. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated in GraphPad Prism and significance was calculated using a log rank test (Mantel-Cox). Lifespan differences are reported as percentages of median lifespans. The following core observations were repeated in double-blind experiments: transgenerational acquisition of longevity in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the change in wild-type lifespan after freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the requirement for MET-2 in inheritance of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Progeny count assay</title><p>Individual hermaphrodites were cloned as L4s and transferred daily until no longer fertile.

transgenerationally through epigenetic regulation. This has been best characterized in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> through studies showing that genetic perturbation of histone methylation in prior generations can have far reaching effects on lifespan in future generations. Lee and colleagues provide new mechanistic insight into this phenomenon by identifying specific histone methylation marks that mediate transgenerational inheritance of lifespan for up to 20 generations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;H3K9me2 protects lifespan against the transgenerational burden of germline transcription in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carlos Gio Silva Garcia (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Lee et al. hypothesized that the retention of H3K9me2 across generations correlates with the transgenerational longevity in the COMPASS complex mutant <italic>wdr-5</italic>, and is required for the inheritance of longevity to genetically wild-type offsprings descended from <italic>wdr-5</italic> homozygous mutants. The authors began with an observation that early generation <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants do not live longer than early generation wild-type worms recovered from a thaw. However, <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant lifespan lengthens over generations while wild-type lifespan shortens over generations. The authors correlated these lifespan changes with differences in H3K9me2. They observed that levels of H3K9me2 enrichment at ChIP-seq peaks and at gene bodies decrease over generations in wild-type worms while they are retained more effectively in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant worms. The authors then took genetic approaches to show that H3K9me2 is required for <italic>wdr-5</italic> longevity and its transgenerational inheritance. They further showed that the mutant for the putative histone demethylase, <italic>jhdm-1</italic>, has a similar pattern of H3K9me2 enrichment and longevity inheritance as <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants.</p><p>In general, this study is interesting and very relevant to the field. If the authors' model was correct, it would represent a fundamental step forward towards understanding how chromatin modifiers can influence longevity across generations. Particularly interesting is the idea that H3K9me2 could be the inherited mark that confers longevity to COMPASS complex mutants, as this is an unresolved question in the field. The authors have clearly put much effort into these experiments, however, there are concerns regarding to some of the technical aspects of the experiments and the interpretations of some of the results which need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the effects the authors are reporting are highly dependent on experimental technique – for example the reported changes in <italic>wdr-5</italic> lifespan occur over many generations in the lab – it is critically important that these experiments are well-controlled. The authors have generally done a good job of replicating their findings multiple times. However, it is unclear why they used N2 from frozen stock as their control when the <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants came from a heterozygote cross. A more appropriate control would have been the wild-type siblings from the original <italic>wdr-5</italic> cross (outcrossed for more than 5 generations to eliminate the inherited longevity effects as in Figure 1). Those generation-matched wild-type siblings could have been compared to <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants. Completing this experiment, at least for an early generation time-point, would validate the authors' observations that <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants are not long-lived until later generations compared to generation-matched wild-types while avoiding the problem of recently-thawed worms which themselves have changes in longevity over time.</p><p>2) The author's model that <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutation only confers a longevity benefit after many generations or when compared to late-generation wild-type is not sufficient to explain the previous observation that <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi leads to increased longevity in worms within one generation (Greer et al., 2010). The authors should attempt to reproduce this finding, perhaps in early and late-generation wild-type worms, and comment on how their model can incorporate the RNAi phenotype of <italic>wdr-5</italic>. It is necessary to provide evidence that explains why the RNAi, in only one generation, is enough to extend lifespan meanwhile the <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, after outcross, do not have this phenotype in early-gen populations. The type of food (in the paper, animals were grown on OP50 bacteria and for the RNAi is on HT115 bacteria) or that <italic>wdr-5</italic> is in an operon (CEOP3136) could explain this difference.</p><p>3) Related to #1, the wild-type lifespans throughout the paper are extremely variable which make the data difficult to interpret. Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild-type lifespan is known to be variable, the typical range at 20°C is between 17-20 days, and the authors present several figures with average wild-type lifespans of 23-24 days (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), whereas other figures have much shorter average lifespans. The differences do not seem to be only due to the change in generation after a thaw, as in Figure 1 the mid-generation lifespans for wild-type are 23-24 days, at which time the authors showed in Figure 2 that wild-type lifespan should already have decreased. Given that the authors expect mid-generation worms to no-longer have this extended lifespan after recovering from a thaw, they should attempt to explain these abnormally high results.</p><p>4) In the authors' working model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), they propose that H3K9me2 levels are decreasing over generations in wild-type animals but become stable or elevated in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants and their genetically wild-type F1-F4 descendants (Figure 5B—figure supplement 2). However, ChIP-seq experiments without a spike-in control do not allow direct quantitative comparison of H3K9me2 levels between samples. The metaplots of H3K9me2 ChIP-seq signal in Figure 3 and Figure 4 only indicate redistribution of H3K9me2 within a given sample but not changes in absolute quantity. To validate their model, the authors should perform ChIP-seq experiments with a spike-in control. Alternatively, they could also do Western blotting to measure the global levels of H3K9me2 in early/mid/late-generations of wild-type, <italic>wdr-5</italic>, and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants and genetically wild-type descendants of <italic>wdr-5</italic> (F1/F3/F5 in Figure 5B—figure supplement 2).</p><p>5) The authors attempted to claim that H3K9me2 may be the inherited mark that accounts for the inheritance of longevity in wild-type offspring of COMPASS complex mutants. They said that H3K4 is unlikely to be the inherited mark, which is presumably based on evidence from the Greer et al., 2011 paper that shows that wild-type descendants of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants regain their H3K4me3 global levels even though they are still long-lived. However, if the authors want to claim that H3K9me2 may be this inherited mark, they need to show that unlike H3K4me3, H3K9me2 levels do not return to normal in wild-type offspring of <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. This is a critical experiment and would make their paper much more convincing. Specifically, the authors should immunoblot for H3K9me2 (and H3K4me3 to confirm previously published work) in <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, wild-type long-lived offspring, and normal wild-type worms as suggested in the previous comment.</p><p>6) It seems like the authors try to make a correlation between levels of H3K9me2 enrichment and lifespan phenotype. However, this explanation does not always fit the data. For example, wild-type, <italic>wdr-5</italic>, and <italic>jhdm-2</italic> animals all have decreased H3K9me2 enrichment at ChIP-seq peaks and from early to late generations. However, <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-2</italic> become long-lived at late-generations while wild-type worms have shortened lifespan. The authors should attempt to reconcile these patterns more clearly in their Discussion and avoid presenting the data as clear-cut. Additionally, it could be helpful to do a more gene-specific analysis, as perhaps the authors are missing the most important regions by looking at the average plots of all peaks, or even all germline genes. For example, the authors could look at differential peaks between wild-type and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, and check for functional categories of the nearest genes to break down this analysis further in an informative way.</p><p>7) Figure 4D is difficult to interpret because all wild-type worms used were late-generation according to the supplementary table. If the authors want to claim there is a gain in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> lifespan similarly to <italic>wdr-5</italic> lifespan over generations, they should repeat this experiment with the appropriate generation-matched controls. Alternatively, they should make it very clear in the text that they used late-generation wild-type animals, as it currently reads as if there were generation-matched controls.</p><p>8) Figure 5E-G is also difficult to interpret because the authors are missing several important controls. The WT(WT) used does not appear to be a descendent from a control cross as was done for Figure 5B and C, so it is unclear whether the WT(WT) lifespan is really a proper control. Additionally, for Figure 5E there is no <italic>met-2</italic> mutant control for lifespan. Since the authors claim that <italic>met-2</italic> mutants are usually short-lived, there should be a <italic>met-2</italic> mutant control to test whether being descended from a <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant could allow for increased lifespan relative to the shortened <italic>met-2</italic> lifespan, not just wild-type lifespan. Additionally, the only replicate for Figure 5F shows no statistically significant difference between WT(<italic>jhdm-1</italic>) lifespan and WT lifespan, making the authors' claims in Figure 5F somewhat weak. Adding an additional replicate would strengthen this claim. Importantly, there appears to be no replicate of Figure 5G. In order to keep Figure 5F and G, an additional replicate needs to be added to Figure 5G at the minimum.</p><p>9) <italic>jhdm-1</italic> is predicted to specifically demethylate H3K36 instead of H3K9me2. While it is interesting that H3K9me2 enrichment patterns change in <italic>jhdm-1</italic>, it could be an indirect consequence of the alterations of H3K36 methylation. Moreover, <italic>jmjd-1.2</italic> is the putative H3K9/H3K27 demethylase. The authors should include the <italic>jmjd-1.2</italic> mutants in the genetic analysis to rule out that <italic>jmjd-1.2</italic> is the more relevant demethylase.</p><p>10) The model that the WDR-5/MET-2/JHDM-1 pathway induces transgenerational inheritance of longevity through germline could be strengthened. Western blot of H3K9me2 in dissected gonads of different backgrounds/conditions and a germline rescue for <italic>met-2</italic> in the <italic>wdr-5</italic> background across generations will help this.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Repressive H3K9me2 protects lifespan against the transgenerational burden of COMPASS activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The <italic>wdr-5.1</italic> RNAi data should be included as supplementary data. An obvious question that the readers would have after reading about the <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant data would be how they could be reconciled with the previously published RNAi data. The authors should include their own <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi data, to indicate that at least under their experimental condition, the RNAi data are not inconsistent with their mutant data.</p><p>2) There is some remaining concern about the inability to quantify H3K9me2 levels by Western Blot. While the ChIP results (Figure 5H) are consistent with the model, it would be helpful to know the abundance of H3K9me2. It sounds like these experiments have already been done but the results are variable, so perhaps this can be provided as supplementary data or discussed further.</p><p>3) Please clarify the model in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A. It appears to be incorrect for the wild type. We know now that the proper wild-type control, i.e. wild-type siblings from the original <italic>wdr-5</italic> cross, does not have an extended lifespan.

However, it is unclear why they used N2 from frozen stock as their control when the wdr-5 mutants came from a heterozygote cross. A more appropriate control would have been the wild-type siblings from the original wdr-5 cross (outcrossed for more than 5 generations to eliminate the inherited longevity effects as in Figure 1). Those generation-matched wild-type siblings could have been compared to wdr-5 mutants. Completing this experiment, at least for an early generation time-point, would validate the authors' observations that wdr-5 mutants are not long-lived until later generations compared to generation-matched wild-types while avoiding the problem of recently-thawed worms which themselves have changes in longevity over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the experiments suggested by the reviewers. Our previous data indicated that something about the freeze-thaw process initially increases the longevity of wild-type worms. By middle generations, wild-type animals reach a steady state with slightly shorter lifespan. In contrast, wild-type animals coming from an outcross of <italic>wdr-5</italic> or <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants have not gone through a freeze-thaw. As a result, we would not expect them to have an increased lifespan. Consistent with this expectation, we find that wild-type animals coming from an outcross of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants are indistinguishable from their corresponding generation-matched mutant population (added to manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This result validates our observations that <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutantsare not initially long lived, even when compared to generation-matched controls from the outcross. In addition, we compared these populations to early and late generation wild-type populations from a thaw in the same experiment. As expected, wild-type animals from the <italic>wdr-5</italic> outcross have a shorter lifespan than early-gen wild-type populations from a thaw, and their short lifespan resembles that of late-gen wild-type animals from a thaw.</p><p>We also made the same comparison with <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. Similar to what we found with <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, the lifespan of early-gen wild-type populations from a <italic>jhdm-1</italic> outcross are indistinguishable from late-gen wild-type animals from a thaw (added to manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This validates our findings that <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants do not reach maximum longevity until after a few generations. Consistent with our previous observations, <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants at this early generation (F2) have a slight increase in lifespan, similar to early generation wild-type populations from a thaw.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author's model that wdr-5 mutation only confers a longevity benefit after many generations or when compared to late-generation wild-type is not sufficient to explain the previous observation that wdr-5 RNAi leads to increased longevity in worms within one generation (Greer et al., 2010). The authors should attempt to reproduce this finding, perhaps in early and late-generation wild-type worms, and comment on how their model can incorporate the RNAi phenotype of wdr-5. It is necessary to provide evidence that explains why the RNAi, in only one generation, is enough to extend lifespan meanwhile the wdr-5 mutants, after outcross, do not have this phenotype in early-gen populations. The type of food (in the paper, animals were grown on OP50 bacteria and for the RNAi is on HT115 bacteria) or that wdr-5 is in an operon (CEOP3136) could explain this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original paper (Greer et al., 2010), the Brunet lab reported that a single generation of exposure to <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi increases lifespan. We agree with the reviewers that the RNAi result is not consistent with our observation that it takes many generations for <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants to obtain longevity. To resolve this contradiction, we have now assessed lifespan in animals undergoing <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi. Consistent with our transgenerational <italic>wdr-5</italic> lifespan results, we find maintaining animals on <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi for a single generation does not confer longevity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It is unclear why the Brunet lab originally obtained different results. However, after following these populations for twelve consecutive generations on <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi, we do observe a slight increase in longevity (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>wdr-5</italic> RNAi may be able to affect lifespan, and lends further support to our model that lifespan is only affected after multiple generations without WDR-5 activity.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48498-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to #1, the wild-type lifespans throughout the paper are extremely variable which make the data difficult to interpret. Although C. elegans wild-type lifespan is known to be variable, the typical range at 20°C is between 17-20 days, and the authors present several figures with average wild-type lifespans of 23-24 days (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), whereas other figures have much shorter average lifespans. The differences do not seem to be only due to the change in generation after a thaw, as in Figure 1 the mid-generation lifespans for wild-type are 23-24 days, at which time the authors showed in Figure 2 that wild-type lifespan should already have decreased. Given that the authors expect mid-generation worms to no-longer have this extended lifespan after recovering from a thaw, they should attempt to explain these abnormally high results.</p></disp-quote><p>During one of the many times that we replicated <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutant’s transgenerational increase in lifespan, the wild-type and <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants were longer lived than normal. This was originally included as Figure 1. It is unclear why this was the case, but we did not observe this in other repeats of the experiment. To avoid any confusion, Figure 1 has now been replaced with another replicate where wild-type median lifespan resembles the typical range. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the authors' working model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), they propose that H3K9me2 levels are decreasing over generations in wild-type animals but become stable or elevated in wdr-5 mutants and their genetically wild-type F1-F4 descendants (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). However, ChIP-seq experiments without a spike-in control do not allow direct quantitative comparison of H3K9me2 levels between samples. The metaplots of H3K9me2 ChIP-seq signal in Figure 3 and Figure 4 only indicate redistribution of H3K9me2 within a given sample but not changes in absolute quantity. To validate their model, the authors should perform ChIP-seq experiments with a spike-in control. Alternatively, they could also do Western blotting to measure the global levels of H3K9me2 in early/mid/late-generations of wild-type, wdr-5, and jhdm-1 mutants and genetically wild-type descendants of wdr-5 (F1/F3/F5 in Figure 5B—figure supplement 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that, without a spike-in control, we cannot quantify an absolute increase in H3K9me2. However, we have performed ChIP-seq experiments across generations in multiple mutants, which has allowed us to clearly demonstrate a relative increase in H3K9me2 in long-lived mutants. We developed our model based on the relative increase in H3K9me2 enrichment, rather than absolute levels. Importantly, because this phenomenon occurs across large parts of the genome over many generations, we do not expect that every transgenerational population experiences precisely the same genomic changes. As a result, precisely quantifying an absolute increase at individual loci is unlikely to be meaningful. To more accurately reflect the relative increase, we have included the longer form of our discussion (formerly included in the supplement), and amended the text.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we tried to quantify global changes in H3K9me2 across generational time using western blots. However, by western blot, global H3K9me2 levels are very low, and we only can detect robust bands when the histone extraction is completely optimal. When we do reliably detect bands, we consistently observe increased H3K9me2 in <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, as we reported. Therefore, we are confident in reporting that these mutants have a global H3K9me2 increase. However, by western blot the level of increase varies both between samples and between experiments. As a result, we are not comfortable using this technique to quantify a gradual increase across generations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors attempted to claim that H3K9me2 may be the inherited mark that accounts for the inheritance of longevity in wild-type offspring of COMPASS complex mutants. They said that H3K4 is unlikely to be the inherited mark, which is presumably based on evidence from the Greer et al., 2011 paper that shows that wild-type descendants of wdr-5 mutants regain their H3K4me3 global levels even though they are still long-lived. However, if the authors want to claim that H3K9me2 may be this inherited mark, they need to show that unlike H3K4me3, H3K9me2 levels do not return to normal in wild-type offspring of wdr-5 and jhdm-1 mutants. This is a critical experiment and would make their paper much more convincing. Specifically, the authors should immunoblot for H3K9me2 (and H3K4me3 to confirm previously published work) in wdr-5 and jhdm-1 mutants, wild-type long-lived offspring, and normal wild-type worms as suggested in the previous comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that if H3K9me2 is indeed the factor enabling longevity in descendants of long-lived <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, we would expect the following: high levels of H3K9me2 would be retained in long-lived wild-type descendants, and this increase would revert to normal levels after five generations, co-incident with reversion of lifespan.</p><p>To examine this possibility we examined H3K9me2 by ChIP-PCR in wild-type descendants of long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. We chose to use <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants because these mutants have more H3K9me2 enrichment than <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, which provides a wider dynamic range in which to observe any potential changes. We chose six H3K9me2 peaks from our ChIP-seq data that had high levels of H3K9me2 in long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> populations (added to the manuscript as Figure 5H). Consistent with our ChIP-seq data, we find that all six loci had elevated H3K9me2 levels in long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type. At three loci, we find that H3K9me2 is also high in long-lived F4 wild-type descendants of long-lived <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, whereas levels reverted to normal in F7 wild-type descendants of <italic>jhdm-1</italic>. This finding provides molecular evidence that H3K9me2 is epigenetically inherited in long-lived populations. At another locus, H3K9me2 was enriched in F4 WT (<italic>jhdm-1</italic>) in one of two replicates. In two other loci, H3K9me2 levels are not inherited. Altogether, these data are consistent with H3K9me2 being the inherited factor that maintains longevity in wild-type descendants of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. Furthermore, these data suggest that the inheritance of longevity may be mediated only by a subset of loci with elevated H3K9me2 levels in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, rather than by a global increase in H3K9me2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It seems like the authors try to make a correlation between levels of H3K9me2 enrichment and lifespan phenotype. However, this explanation does not always fit the data. For example, wild-type, wdr-5, and jhdm-2 animals all have decreased H3K9me2 enrichment at ChIP-seq peaks and from early to late generations. However, wdr-5 and jhdm-2 become long-lived at late-generations while wild-type worms have shortened lifespan. The authors should attempt to reconcile these patterns more clearly in their Discussion and avoid presenting the data as clear-cut. Additionally, it could be helpful to do a more gene-specific analysis, as perhaps the authors are missing the most important regions by looking at the average plots of all peaks, or even all germline genes. For example, the authors could look at differential peaks between wild-type and wdr-5 mutants, and check for functional categories of the nearest genes to break down this analysis further in an informative way.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that since we do not know which loci are responsible for longevity, it is not possible to say that H3K9me2 levels absolutely correlate with lifespan in our populations over generational time.</p><p>Between early- to mid-gen <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutant populations, we observe a true increase in H3K9me2 enrichment, which correlates well with the lifespan increase that occurs during the same time period. However, as the reviewers correctly identified, in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants H3K9me2 enrichment changes over generational time in ways that are not always reflected by lifespan. We have added additional text to the Discussion to more accurately reflect this nuance. For example, H3K9me2 enrichment decreases further from mid- to late-gen wild-type populations, as lifespan remains unchanged. Likewise, in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants, H3K9me2 enrichment decreases from early- to mid-gen populations as lifespan remains unchanged. Nevertheless, whenever lifespan changes significantly, we observe a corresponding change in H3K9me2 enrichment. For example, lifespan decreases in wild-type between early- and mid-gen populations, which correlates with an H3K9me2 decrease. Similarly, the lifespan increase in <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants occurs between mid- and late-gen populations, which is when we observe a large increase in H3K9me2 enrichment. Therefore, among all transgenerational populations examined, whenever we observe a significant change in lifespan, we also find a corresponding change in H3K9me2 enrichment. This general trend is consistent with a model where elevated H3K9me2, perhaps only at a subset of loci, mediates longevity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4D is difficult to interpret because all wild-type worms used were late-generation according to the supplementary table. If the authors want to claim there is a gain in jhdm-1 lifespan similarly to wdr-5 lifespan over generations, they should repeat this experiment with the appropriate generation-matched controls. Alternatively, they should make it very clear in the text that they used late-generation wild-type animals, as it currently reads as if there were generation-matched controls.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2, we demonstrated that wild-type animals initially have longer lifespans after a thaw, with lifespan decreasing over a few generations until it reaches a steady state. To avoid this complication in our analysis of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, we chose to compare them to late-gen wild-type populations that had already researched a steady state lifespan. We have amended the text to clarify our reasoning. Importantly, in Figure 4D, <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants are initially slightly longer lived than steady state late generation wild-type populations. If we had used generation-matched wild-type populations (as was suggested in Comment 1), the lifespan of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants would have resembled that of wild-type populations (added to the manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Therefore, using generation-matched populations would have only lent further support to our interpretation that <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants acquire longevity over generational time (rather than contradicted our interpretation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5E-G is also difficult to interpret because the authors are missing several important controls. The WT(WT) used does not appear to be a descendent from a control cross as was done for Figure 5B and C, so it is unclear whether the WT(WT) lifespan is really a proper control. Additionally, for Figure 5E there is no met-2 mutant control for lifespan. Since the authors claim that met-2 mutants are usually short-lived, there should be a met-2 mutant control to test whether being descended from a wdr-5 mutant could allow for increased lifespan relative to the shortened met-2 lifespan, not just wild-type lifespan. Additionally, the only replicate for Figure 5F shows no statistically significant difference between WT(jhdm-1) lifespan and WT lifespan, making the authors' claims in Figure 5F somewhat weak. Adding an additional replicate would strengthen this claim. Importantly, there appears to be no replicate of Figure 5G. In order to keep Figure 5F and G, an additional replicate needs to be added to Figure 5G at the minimum.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the WT (WT) control in Figure 5E. It was indeed derived from a control cross (shown on the right part of Figure 5A), as the reviewers suggested it should be. We originally left out the cross from the schema in Figure 5D for simplicity. We have now amended Figure 5D to add the ancestry of this control population.</p><p>During a replicate of Figure 5E, we did perform a <italic>met-2 (met-2)</italic> control to compare the F3 <italic>met-2 (wdr-5)</italic> populations in Figure 5E, as well as WT (<italic>wdr-5)</italic> and <italic>wdr-5 (wdr-5)</italic> controls. We originally omitted these curves for simplicity, but have added the comparison to the manuscript as Figure 5—figure supplement 1. The lifespan of the <italic>met-2 (met-2)</italic> control was shorter than wild-type and resembled that of <italic>met-2 (“wdr-5”).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestions regarded Figures 5F and 5G. We have added two additional replicates of each to Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) jhdm-1 is predicted to specifically demethylate H3K36 instead of H3K9me2. While it is interesting that H3K9me2 enrichment patterns change in jhdm-1, it could be an indirect consequence of the alterations of H3K36 methylation. Moreover, jmjd-1.2 is the putative H3K9/H3K27 demethylase. The authors should include the jmjd-1.2 mutants in the genetic analysis to rule out that jmjd-1.2 is the more relevant demethylase.</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated the lifespan of <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants because JHDM-1 is a ortholog of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Epe1, which affects H3K9me levels and is required for the transgenerational inheritance of this mark. Consistent with their similarity, both our western blot data and ChIP-seq data suggest that H3K9me2 levels increase in <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants. During our original experiments, we also sought to examine lifespan in <italic>jmjd-1.2 (ok3628)</italic>, but we were unable to complete the experiments because homozygotes are embryonic lethal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The model that the WDR-5/MET-2/JHDM-1 pathway induces transgenerational inheritance of longevity through germline could be strengthened. Western blot of H3K9me2 in dissected gonads of different backgrounds/conditions and a germline rescue for met-2 in the wdr-5 background across generations will help this.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two reasons that we concluded that the transgenerational effects on H3K9me2 levels primarily occur through the germline. In their initial experiments, the Brunet lab demonstrated that longevity in COMPASS mutants requires a proliferating germline. Additionally, for a phenotype to be inherited transgenerationally, it must be mediated through the germline. However, to more accurately reflect the work directly presented in this manuscript, we have removed “germline” from the title. We have also included the longer version of our discussion (originally included in the supplement), in which we make the connection between the germline and transgenerational inheritance more explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The wdr-5.1 RNAi data should be included as supplementary data. An obvious question that the readers would have after reading about the wdr-5 mutant data would be how they could be reconciled with the previously published RNAi data. The authors should include their own wdr-5 RNAi data, to indicate that at least under their experimental condition, the RNAi data are not inconsistent with their mutant data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the RNAi data as Figure 1—figure supplement 3, amended the text to discuss the figure, and added the data to Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is some remaining concern about the inability to quantify H3K9me2 levels by Western Blot. While the ChIP results (Figure 5H) are consistent with the model, it would be helpful to know the abundance of H3K9me2. It sounds like these experiments have already been done but the results are variable, so perhaps this can be provided as supplementary data or discussed further.</p></disp-quote><p>Because global H3K9me2 levels are very low, by western blot, the level of increase varies both between samples and between transgenerational experiments. However, when we do reliably detect bands, we consistently observe increased H3K9me2 in <italic>wdr-5</italic> and <italic>jhdm-1</italic> mutants, as we reported. Therefore, we are confident in reporting that these mutants have a global H3K9me2 increase.</p><p>We now mention the difficulty of quantifying minute changes across generational time by western in our Results. Because we are not comfortable using this technique to quantify a gradual increase across generations, we are not including the westerns as supplementary data. Instead, we feel that the more quantitative ChIP-qPCR results presented in Figure 5H demonstrate the heritability of H3K9me2 across generations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify the model in Figure 5—figure supplement 2A. It appears to be incorrect for the wild type. We know now that the proper wild-type control, i.e. wild-type siblings from the original wdr-5 cross, does not have an extended lifespan. Or clarify that they are referring to wild type animals from a thaw.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the figure legend to clarify that Figure 5—figure supplement2A represents wild-type animals recovered from a thaw.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The new Abstract is repetitive and would benefit from additional editing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion – we have edited the Abstract as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
