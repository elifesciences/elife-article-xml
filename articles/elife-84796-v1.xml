Seven subtypes of P2X receptor channels have been identified in mammals that can form both homomeric and heteromeric channels. P2X1–4 and P2X7 receptor channels are cation-selective, whereas P2X5 has been reported to have both cation and anion permeability. P2X receptor channel structures reveal that each subunit is comprised of two transmembrane helices, with both N-and C-termini on the intracellular side of the membrane and a large extracellular domain that contains the ATP binding sites at subunit interfaces. Recent structures of ATP-bound P2X receptors with the activation gate open reveal the unanticipated presence of a cytoplasmic cap over the central ion permeation pathway, leaving lateral fenestrations that may be largely buried within the membrane as potential pathways for ions to permeate the intracellular end of the pore. In the present study, we identify a critical residue within the intracellular lateral fenestrations that is readily accessible to thiol-reactive compounds from both sides of the membrane and where substitutions influence the relative permeability of the channel to cations and anions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ions can enter or exit the internal pore through lateral fenestrations that play a critical role in determining the ion selectivity of P2X receptor channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>purinergic</kwd><kwd>ion permeation</kwd><kwd>ion selectivity</kwd><kwd>P2X</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS003018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mapping the ion permeation pathway within the internal pore of ATP-activated P2X receptor channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>P2X receptors are a family of ion channels that are activated by extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khakh and North, 2006</xref>).

We identified a residue lining the lateral fenestrations that is a conserved acidic residue in the cation-selective P2X1–4 and P2X7 receptor channels but is a conserved basic residue in the anion permeable P2X5 receptor channel and could therefore play a role in determining ion selectivity. When mutated to Cys, this position is accessible to Cys-reactive reagents from both sides of the membrane, and charge-reversing mutations influence the relative permeability of cations to anions. Our results demonstrate that the lateral fenestrations provide an ion permeation pathway at the intracellular end of the pore and that they contain a critical determinant of ion selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The objective of the present study was to investigate how ions permeate through the internal pore of P2X receptor channels given the presence of the cytoplasmic caps recently identified in P2X3 and P2X7 receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>).

In addition, although the side chain of K14 was not well-resolved, it is positioned nearby to E359 and is another candidate for participating in stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the cap. All of these polar residue interactions occur at subunit interfaces, and most of the participating residues are well-conserved across all subtypes of P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). The cytoplasmic cap also contains two conserved Tyr residues (Y10 and Y353), each of which is surrounded by hydrophobic residues likely to contribute to stabilizing hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In the case of Y10, these interactions occur at subunit interfaces, whereas in the case of Y353 the interactions are within each individual subunit, and again these interactions are well-conserved across different P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). Y10 also forms a well-conserved intersubunit hydrogen bond interaction with D340, located at the base of the TM2 helix of the neighboring subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). We also identified a series of additional aromatic residues (F8, F346, and F358) positioned near to where the OPM server would position the polar headgroup region of the inner leaflet of the membrane, and again these are well-conserved across different subtypes of P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). All of these stabilizing interactions observed in the cytoplasmic cap of hP2X3<sub>Slow</sub> are also seen in the structure of hP2X7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) and the participating residues are conserved in most subtypes of P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that structural elements related to the caps seen in P2X3 and P2X7 are likely present in all P2X receptor channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Accessibility of a conserved Glu in the lateral fenestrations of P2X2 receptor channels</title><p>In studying the structure of the cytoplasmic cap and intracellular lateral fenestrations in hP2X3<sub>Slow</sub>, we noticed the presence of a Glu residue (E11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) at the intracellular edge of the lateral fenestration that is conserved in most P2X receptor channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with the exception of both P2X5 and P2X6, which contain a Lys at this position. Although P2X6 channels do not express as homomeric channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lê et al., 1998</xref>) and, therefore, their permeation properties are poorly understood, homomeric P2X5 receptors can be expressed and have been reported to have a significant Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruppelt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bo et al., 2003</xref>). We, therefore, thought this position in P2X receptors might provide a foothold to begin interrogating whether the lateral fenestrations contribute to forming an ion permeation pathway and whether residues in this region influence ion selectivity.</p><p>To explore whether ions might permeate through the lateral fenestrations, we decided to investigate the accessibility of an introduced Cys residue to thiol-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) compounds. The rP2X2 receptor channel has been extensively used for accessibility studies because it slowly desensitizes and, therefore, is well-suited for examining changes in accessibility between open and closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawate et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heymann et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the rP2X2–3 T construct, wherein three native Cys residues were substituted with Thr residues, is insensitive to MTS compounds unless additional Cys residues are introduced and have been extensively used for accessibility studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawate et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heymann et al., 2013</xref>). We began by introducing a Cys into rP2X2–3 T at the position equivalent to E11 in hP2X3 (E17 in the rP2X2), reasoning that if this acidic residue lines the lateral fenestrations in P2X2 receptor channels, a Cys introduced at this position would be accessible to thiol-reactive compounds. The concentration-dependence for activation of the E17C mutation in rP2X2–3 T by free ATP is similar to rP2X2–3 T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the mutant does not dramatically alter the gating mechanism of the receptor. We initially explored the accessibility of 2-trimethylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) applied from the extracellular side of the membrane to E17C, either when channels are open in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), or when they are closed in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). Since MTSET has a fixed positive charge at neutral pH, it cannot cross the membrane and only reacts when a Cys is positioned within an aqueous environment within the channel protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2008</xref>), when we applied MTSET to the external solution for cells expressing the background rP2X2–3 T construct, we observed no discernible effect of the reagent when applied in the absence or presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, E and F</xref>). In contrast, the application of MTSET in the presence of ATP resulted in robust and irreversible inhibition of the E17C rP2X2–3 T channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). Application of external MTSET in the absence of ATP had no discernible effect on subsequent current activation by external ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>), suggesting that the MTS reagent can only access E17C through the ion permeation pathway from the extracellular side of the membrane when the channel is open. To confirm that MTSET accessibility to E17C requires activation by ATP, we confirmed that the application of MTSET in the presence of ATP produced robust inhibition following the application of the MTSET in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). We did not attempt to reverse the inhibitory effects of MTSET using reducing agents as there are five conserved disulfide bonds in the extracellular domains of P2X receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>) that are important for channel trafficking or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clyne et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ennion and Evans, 2002</xref>), and in our experience reducing agents make recordings unstable.

The time courses for MTS modification in the presence of ATP could be reasonably well fit by a single exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), from which we calculate that MTSET modified E17C with a rate of 3.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>, while the smaller MTSEA modified that position with a rate of 2.6 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). From previous MTSET modification rates obtained in the presence of ATP for multiple positions within the TM2 helix, we can appreciate that rates of modification diminish as Cys residues are introduced deeper into the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Notably, the modification rate for externally applied MTSET at E17C is only incrementally slower than the deepest position in the transmembrane region when applying the reagent to the external solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Given that the reagents must traverse the entire TM pore to react with E17C, these relatively rapid rates of modification suggest that E17C is positioned in a high dielectric environment that is favorable for modification. Although, lipid molecules likely occupy the upper regions of the lateral fenestrations, it seems unavoidable that the most intracellular end of the lateral fenestrations, where E17 is located, resides in an aqueous environment.

Neither mutation appreciably altered the concentration-dependence for activation of mP2X5 by external ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that as for rP2X2, mutations at this position within the lateral fenestrations do not appreciably alter gating.

These findings indicate that K17 is a critical determinant of the unusual anion permeability of mP2X5 receptor channels. Collectively, our results support the idea that the lateral fenestrations observed in recent structures of P2X3 and P2X7 receptor channels contribute to the intracellular end of the ion permeation pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of the present study was to explore whether ion permeation through the internal pore of P2X receptor channels could occur through the lateral fenestrations seen in recent structures of P2X3 and P2X7 receptors. One enigmatic feature of the lateral fenestrations is that they were observed for detergent-solubilized proteins, and one might expect that they would be partially or completely buried within the lipid bilayer when the protein resides in a membrane environment, in agreement with many residues at the edges of the lateral fenestrations having hydrophobic side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, an acidic residue Glu at the intracellular edge of the lateral fenestrations is conserved in P2X receptors thought to be cation-selective but is substituted with the basic residue Lys in P2X5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the one subtype of P2X receptor reported to also be anion permeable. This correlation between side chain character and ion selectivity suggested that this residue might face the ion-conducting pathway and contribute directly to ion selectivity. For the E17C mutant in rP2X2 receptors, we found that the positively charged MTSET could readily react with this position, but only when the channel was opened by external ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the membrane-permeant MTSEA could react with E17C either when the channel was opened by external ATP, or when applied in the closed state in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that E17C is accessible from both sides of the membrane. Although approximations of P2X receptor channels in the membrane by databases such as OPM suggest that much of the lateral fenestrations are buried in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the efficient reaction between MTS and E17C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that this residue resides in an aqueous environment and is not buried in the membrane, supporting its location within the ion permeation pathway at the intracellular end of the pore. Importantly, charge-reversing mutations in rP2X2 and mP2X5 clearly alter the relative permeability of the two channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although the effect of the mutation in rP2X2 is unambiguous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the result also suggests that other determinants contribute to cation selectivity for this subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawate et al., 2011</xref>). In stark contrast, the influence of the mutations in mP2X5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that K17 is a major determinant of anion permeability in that subtype. Viewed collectively, our results support the idea that ion permeation occurs through the lateral fenestrations and that these structural elements play important roles in determining the ion selectivity of P2X receptor channels.</p><p>An important question remains about whether the cytoplasmic caps seen in structures of slowly desensitizing hP2X3<sub>Slow</sub> receptors in an ATP-bound open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>) and those observed in both closed and ATP-bound open states of hP2X7 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>) are present in other P2X receptor subtypes. Many residues at critical positions in the cytoplasmic cap are conserved in other P2X receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the notion that the cap is a conserved feature of P2X receptor channels. Given that the structures of hP2X3<sub>Slow</sub> where the cap is seen contain three mutations corresponding to residues present in the slowly desensitizing P2X2 receptor, it would seem likely that the cap will also be present in P2X2 receptors. Our results with MTS accessibility and ion selectivity experiments in P2X2 are consistent with the structure of P2X3<sub>Slow</sub> containing the cytoplasmic cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hausmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>), further supporting the presence of a cap in P2X2 receptors. Similarly, the critical influence of K17 in P2X5 on ion selectivity in that subtype would be consistent with the presence of cytoplasmic cap and lateral fenestrations like those present in the P2X3<sub>Slow</sub> structure. Although earlier studies had implicated residues in the outer pore as critical determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability in P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Migita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Samways and Egan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samways et al., 2014</xref>), a recent study also implicated residues in the N-terminus of rP2X7 as determinants of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the E17A mutation in rP2X2 and the equivalent E14A mutation in rP2X7 both diminish fractional Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2019</xref>), supporting a role of the lateral fenestrations in ion permeation and selectivity. In the future, it would be important to solve structures of other P2X receptor subtypes to ascertain whether the cytoplasmic cap and lateral fenestrations are features common to all subtypes, and to determine whether the cap is a transient structure, as proposed for P2X3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>) or a more stable one as proposed for P2X7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One of the unique features seen in structures of detergent-solubilized P2X receptor channels with ATP bound is that the lateral fenestrations present on both sides of the membrane, which enable ions to enter or exit the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawate et al., 2011</xref>), are continuous and present throughout the region likely spanning the lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). As a result, the TM helices lack intersubunit interactions within the membrane and all intersubunit interactions occur within the large extracellular domain and within the cytoplasmic cap. Related membrane-embedded fenestrations have thus far not been observed in structures of other trimeric ion channels under conditions where the open state predominates, including acid-sensing ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>), epithelial sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noreng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noreng et al., 2020</xref>) or proton-activated chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It will be interesting to solve structures of P2X receptor channels in a membrane environment to better understand whether membrane-embedded fenestrations are native features, whether lipids may play key structural roles in stabilizing membrane-spanning subunits or whether the fenestrations might distort the structure of the membrane to enable efficient permeation of ions through the internal end of the pore.</p><p>It will also be fascinating to explore how the ion selectivity of P2X receptor channel subtypes has been tuned to underlie distinct physiological functions in different cellular environments. Although, many important roles of cation-selective subtype of P2X receptors are emerging, the functions of the anion permeable P2X5 receptor remain largely enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khakh and North, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Surprenant and North, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmid and Evans, 2019</xref>). P2X5 is thought to be widely expressed within neurons in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2008</xref>) as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garcia-Guzman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryten et al., 2001</xref>), yet what roles this channel plays will require further investigation. The unique ion selectivity of P2X5 receptors, determined by one critical residue within the lateral fenestrations, suggests that it may play very different roles than other P2X receptor subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Channel constructs</title><p>Rat P2X2 (rP2X2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brake et al., 1994</xref>) cDNA in pcDNA1 was generously provided by Dr. David Julius (the University of California, San Francisco, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Grutter (Reviewer #1); Zhaozhu Qiu (Reviewer #2); Alexandria N Miller (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The strengthen the conclusions of the work, the following essential revisions are requested:</p><p>1) To increase n (especially where n currently equals only 3) and include statistical analysis where appropriate.</p><p>2) Either demonstrate the reversibility of the MTS modifications or include a discussion on the lack thereof.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although I am convinced by provided data, there are some issues that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>1. I would recommend the authors increase the number of cells they provided in some Figures. For example, the authors provide n = 3 cells for E17C in Figure 3F. Although error bars are small, three cells are insufficient.</p><p>2. It seems that the same traces are displayed in Figures 3, 4, and 5 to show currents of E17C in the absence or presence of MTS compounds. I recommend showing another set of relevant traces (for example fitting traces in Figure 5).</p><p>3. Figure 2H and Figure 2 —figure supplementary 1D. It would be nice to add labels of residues E11 and E14 for hP2X3Slow and rP2X7, respectively.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Statistical analyses are necessary for comparing some groups in the data presented, for example, 3E, F, 4E, F, to support the conclusions. Some n numbers are relatively small (i.e. n = 3).</p><p>2. If the block by thiol-reactive reagents can be reversed by reducing agents, it will exclude other alternative explanations of the channel inhibition observed in the cysteine accessibility assay and further strengthen the conclusions. Sometimes, however, the inhibitory effects cannot be reversed by the treatment of reducing agents. In that case, the authors may discuss and comment on that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In this study, the authors 1) use charged MTS reagents, 2) observe partial block with these reagents, and 3) observe changes to cation to anion permeability with charged residue mutations. I was wondering if the authors did an investigation of cation-to-anion permeability using MTS-modified rP2X2-3T. In particular, MTSET is a positively charged MTS reagent and, one would expect that the cation to anion permeability would shift upon MTSET modification of rP2X2. If the data is available, it would be worthwhile to include it in the manuscript.</p><p>2) An ion pore that is formed by a portion of a larger, membrane-embedded fenestration is unusual to me. Is there any evidence that this is shared by other channels in this structural subfamily, such as ASIC, eNaC, and/or PAC? This would be worth discussing.</p><p>3) In the introduction, the cytoplasmic ballast of P2X7 is mentioned but it was unclear to me that this is a structural feature likely not conserved among P2X channels. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>4) Please include this citation:</p><p>Jiang, L-H; Rassendren, F., Spelta, V., Surprenant, A. and North, R.A.

We collected data from many more cells where MTS reagents were applied, and inhibition measured in the presence or absence of ATP. We could have presented those results similarly to what appears in many related studies, however, we decided to adopt a more involved multiple pulse protocols illustrated in these figures to better document irreversible modification and clearly distinguish this from rundown of the ATP responses for a population of cells. The longer protocols, in particular for the closed state modification where we subsequently test for open state modification, resulted in only a fraction of cells surviving long enough to complete the entire protocol, and hence the relatively small n values. We have added additional data to the legend with a larger number of cells using a more conventional approach where we simply state the % inhibition values for MTS reagents and we have also added additional data for 4 cells where we examined open state modification at 0.5 mM MTSEA in Figure 4E. We have also added a statistical analysis to Figure 3 and Figure 4 and provided p-values in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Either demonstrate the reversibility of the MTS modifications or include a discussion on the lack thereof.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience with MTS modification experiments (<italic>1-4</italic>) we consider the demonstration of irreversibility to be the most important feature for concluding that modification has occurred. We have observed reversible effects of MTS reagents due to pore blockade, for example, but at the concentrations used here we observed no effects for the background construct but irreversible inhibition for E17C, which we consider to be strong evidence for modification of that position by both MTSET and MTSEA. In earlier experiments identifying pore-lining residues we had attempted to reverse the actions of MTS reagents with reducing reagents but found that they made recordings unstable, and we have always been concerned by the fact that there are 5 disulfide bonds within the extracellular domain of P2X receptors that might complicate intepretations. It is also worth noting that this experiment speaks more to the accessibility of the reducing reagent than they do about whether modification has occurred. For these reasons, we have not included results with reducing reagents in our previous publications or in the present manuscript. We have added a statement to the Results section to alert the reader that we have not attempted to reduce the MTS aduct with E17 and to provide our reasoning.</p><p>1. M. Li, T. H. Chang, S. D.

If the block by thiol-reactive reagents can be reversed by reducing agents, it will exclude other alternative explanations of the channel inhibition observed in the cysteine accessibility assay and further strengthen the conclusions. Sometimes, however, the inhibitory effects cannot be reversed by the treatment of reducing agents. In that case, the authors may discuss and comment on that.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision 2. As described above, we are confident about concluding that E17C is covalently modified by MTS reagents as the effects are irreversible and only seen in when the Cys has been introduced. With these results in hand, failure of reducing agents to reverse the effects of MTS reagents would speak more to accessibility of the reducing reagents rather than whether the MTS reagent had modified the introduced Cys.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) In this study, the authors 1) use charged MTS reagents, 2) observe partial block with these reagents, and 3) observe changes to cation to anion permeability with charged residue mutations. I was wondering if the authors did an investigation of cation-to-anion permeability using MTS-modified rP2X2-3T. In particular, MTSET is a positively charged MTS reagent and, one would expect that the cation to anion permeability would shift upon MTSET modification of rP2X2. If the data is available, it would be worthwhile to include it in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very cool experiment and one that could be done with both positively and negatively charged MTS reagents.

Is there any evidence that this is shared by other channels in this structural subfamily, such as ASIC, eNaC, and/or PAC? This would be worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a unique feature of P2X receptor channels. Our original view was that the fenestrations at the edges of the membrane are likely to be native features of these channels, but that the separation of subunits within the membrane might be non-native and the result of detergent solubilization. It will be interesting to see whether these features are retained when structures are solved in lipid nanodiscs. As suggested, we have added a section to the discussion to highlight this intriguing feature of the available P2X receptor structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the introduction, the cytoplasmic ballast of P2X7 is mentioned but it was unclear to me that this is a structural feature likely not conserved among P2X channels.
