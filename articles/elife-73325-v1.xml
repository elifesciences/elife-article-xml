associated with risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) arising from the proliferation of fibrosis in the heart. Current clinical risk stratification criteria inadequately identify at-risk patients in need of primary prevention of VA. Here, we use mechanistic computational modeling of the heart to analyze how HCM-specific remodeling promotes arrhythmogenesis and to develop a personalized strategy to forecast risk of VAs in these patients. We combine contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and T1 mapping data to construct digital replicas of HCM patient hearts that represent the patient-specific distribution of focal and diffuse fibrosis and evaluate the substrate propensity to VA. Our analysis indicates that the presence of diffuse fibrosis, which is rarely assessed in these patients, increases arrhythmogenic propensity. In forecasting future VA events in HCM patients, the imaging-based computational heart approach achieved 84.6%, 76.9%, and 80.1% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, and significantly outperformed current clinical risk predictors. This novel VA risk assessment may have the potential to prevent SCD and help deploy primary prevention appropriately in HCM patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>T1 mapping</kwd><kwd>sudden cardiac death</kwd><kwd>personalized medicine</kwd><kwd>computational modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL142496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trayanova</surname><given-names>Natalia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL126802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trayanova</surname><given-names>Natalia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL125239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binka</surname><given-names>Edem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Hara</surname><given-names>Ryan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trayanova</surname><given-names>Natalia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Personalized virtual-heart technology for arrhythmia risk assessment could transform the management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, eliminating many unnecessary primary-prevention defibrillator deployments while ensuring patients at high risk for arrhythmia are adequately protected.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young and is a significant cause of sudden death in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maron, 2004</xref>). The disease, with an incidence of 1 in 500, presents with progressive myocardial fibrosis which can create substrates for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) leading to SCD in patients who are typically asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Olivotto et al., 2012</xref>). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) deployment, a procedure that carries risk of potential complications and morbidity, is used as primary prevention of SCD due to VA in patients with HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lambiase et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jayatilleke et al., 2004</xref>). However, current risk stratification criteria outlined by the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) fail to accurately identify all patients at risk for SCD, leading to suboptimal rates of appropriate ICD implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gersh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">OâMahony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schinkel et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, many HCM patients receive ICDs without deriving any health benefits, while others are not adequately protected. The development of accurate means to stratify SCD risk due to VA in HCM patients for guidance of ICD deployment is an important unmet clinical need.</p><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has unparalleled capability in the detection and quantification of scar and dense fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Prakosa et al., 2014</xref>). In HCM, myocardial fibrosis takes the form of both dense (focal) and diffuse fibrosis, with histopathological evidence showing diffuse fibrosis as the hallmark feature of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galati et al., 2016</xref>). Diffuse fibrosis, however, is not well captured by standard LGE-CMR. Instead, postcontrast T1 mapping, a parametric imaging modality, has been used to visualize diffuse fibrosis in patients with HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellims et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously developed a computational modeling approach (virtual heart) to predict SCD risk due to VA in postinfarction patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arevalo et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesized that a new personalized virtual-heart technology, one that entails constructing fusion electrophysiological models based on the distribution of both dense and diffuse fibrosis, as acquired by the two different CMR modalities, would be predictive of the propensity of the HCM-remodeled substrate to VAs and could thus be used to assess SCD risk due to VA in this patient population.</p><p>The goal of this study is to create a personalized virtual-heart approach based on the combination of postcontrast T1 mapping and LGE-CMR and to employ it (1) to analyze how HCM-specific remodeling promotes arrhythmogenesis and (2) in a targeted strategy to forecast risk of VA in HCM patients. In a proof-of-concept patient cohort, we assess the predictive capability of the approach as compared to that of other clinical metrics for VA risk prediction in HCM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The new approach to analyzing arrhythmogenic propensity in HCM patients developed here involved creating three-dimensional (3D) patient-specific electrophysiological ventricular models based on fusing data from LGE-CMR and postcontrast T1 mapping. Each model thus represented the personalized distribution of focal fibrosis (scar) and diffuse fibrosis. VA inducibility in each HCM patientâs substrate was probed to determine VA risk for the patient and to understand the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis, and specifically, the contribution of the individualized diffuse fibrosis distribution, which is rarely assessed in these patients.

LGE-only models had a total of 15 unique VAs (with a total of 17 VA episodes induced in these models), with only 1 or 2 distinct VA morphologies induced per model.

In contrast, out of 84 pacing sites in the 12 LGE-only inducible models, 17 (20%) resulted in VA induction. Thus, the presence of T1-based diffuse fibrosis renders the substrate inducible from a larger number of ectopic locations, contributing to the overall increased vulnerability to VA. Interestingly, the sector with the pacing sites that induced most VAs (mid-anteroseptal) and that with least (basal inferolateral) were the same in LGE-T1 and LGE-only models, indicating that the additional T1-based diffuse fibrosis localizes to the sectors with arrhythmogenic substrate in the LGE-only models. Overall, the distribution of pacing sites is the same (with small exception in the basal regions), but the number of sites per sector increased with the presence of diffuse fibrosis.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> explores the contribution of T1-based diffuse fibrosis to VA inducibility by comparing arrhythmogenesis in individual models. Panel A shows, for the 13 patients with clinical VAs, the number of distinct VAs per patient model. First, LGE-T1 modeling documented correctly VA occurrence in the digital substrates of 11 of the 13 patients with clinical VAs (compared to 9 LGE-only correct VA predictions); thus, the representation of T1-based diffuse fibroses increased the fidelity of the HCM virtual-heart approach. Second, while the number of unique VA morphologies per inducible virtual heart increased in LGE-T1 models as compared to LGE only (consistent with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), with LGE-T1 models having maximum three unique VAs (vs 2 in LGE only) in the cohort, this plot points to interesting VA dynamics in individual substrates. Patients 5, 6, and 9 had the same level of arrhythmogenicity of the substrate (1 VA induced) regardless of the presence of T1-based diffuse fibrosis. An example of VA dynamics in these models is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (patient 6). The additional diffuse fibrosis did not alter the location or direction of VA reentry; the reentry occurred in a region of dense scar in both types of models. Although the T1-based diffuse fibrosis (36.2%) in this patient augments the existing diffuse fibrosis of the LGE-only model (9.6%), there are no additional VA morphologies. However, the activation dynamics were altered, with propagation being less organized.</p><p>In the reminder of the clinical-VA patients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the presence of T1-based diffuse fibrosis resulted in the occurrence of additional VA(s), on top of that (those) also present in the LGE-only model. Furthermore, there was not a strict correspondence between the VAs in the LGE-only models and the equivalent ones in the LGE-T1 virtual heart in terms of VA locations and dynamics. This indicates that the arrhythmogenic substrate changes in a global fashion when T1-based diffuse fibrosis in considered. An example is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (patient 9).</p><p>As VAs in HCM patients can occur under different circumstances and be documented by different means, there is no invasive clinical mapping data for these patients regarding the location and morphologies of the clinical VAs.

The amount of diffuse fibrosis in these two substrates (42.4 Â± 12.2%) was similar to that in the 11 inducible substrates (41.2 Â± 10.9%); similar was the finding regarding dense scar. Additionally, the maximum wall thickness and the thickness distribution fall into the same ranges as the averages of the cohort. It is possible that there have been other factors, including electrophysiological remodeling that the fusion substrate-based modeling approach presented here cannot capture.

Our technology uses multiscale computational models of patientsâ hearts reconstructed on the basic of the fusion of imaging data from LGE-CMR and T1 mapping. With the inclusion of information from postcontrast T1 mapping, a quantitative and parametric imaging modality, extensive diffuse fibrotic remodeling, which is a hallmark of HCM, is adequately represented. Here, this is done by adjusting the diffuse fibrosis intensity-based thresholds in model construction based on the T1 maps, while preserving the identification of dense scar from LGE-MRI. These are the first personalized heart models created with data from different types of CMR; previous personalized modeling approaches for VA assessment have utilized LGE-MRI scans in reconstructing model geometry/structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Prakosa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartoski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arevalo et al., 2016</xref>). Once constructed, the mechanistic personalized electrophysiological models were used to analyze how HCM-induced remodeling, and specifically the presence of diffuse fibrosis promotes arrhythmogenesis. Finally, the capability of our approach to forecast future VA events was assessed in the cohort of 26 HCM patients.</p><p>The presence of diffuse fibrosis has been suggested previously as a potential factor in increased risk of VA, in addition to focal scar. Previous studies have found associations between diffuse fibrosis and VA in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakamori et al., 2018</xref>) and mitral valve prolapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bui et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, diffuse ventricular fibrosis has been found to increase left atrial pressure, and may be a marker of atrial fibrillation recurrence postablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begg et al., 2020</xref>). However, its contribution to arrhythmogenic propensity in HCM patients has never been assessed before. This study found that the presence of T1-based diffuse fibrosis resulted in the occurrence of new VAs, in addition to those arising from scar (as assessed by signal heterogeneities in LGE-MRI). Furthermore, T1-based diffuse fibrosis distribution rendered the substrate inducible from a larger number of ectopic locations, contributing to the overall increased vulnerability to VA. The arrhythmogenic propensity of the ventricular substrate with diffuse fibrosis is patient specific; it is the amount of fibrosis and its distribution (shape and location) that determine inducibility of arrhythmia.</p><p>In this retrospective proof-of-concept HCM study, the personalized LGE-T1 virtual-heart technology demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting future VA events in HCM patients, achieving 84.6%, 76.9%, and 80.1% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively. It outperformed both risk models used in current clinical practice, the ACCF/AHA and ESC models. Indeed, all 26 HCM patients in our study were deemed at high risk for SCD by the ACCF/AHA criteria and received ICDs for primary prevention, but only 13 patients, that is 50% of the cohort, actually experienced VA (appropriate ICD firing). Should our LGE-T1 virtual-heart technology be proven to be a superior risk predictor in larger clinical studies, it would advance the management of patients with this complex disease, helping to ensure that those at high risk for VA are adequately protected by ICDs and that unnecessary ICD implantations and the associated device complications are minimized.</p><p>The HCM virtual-heart technologyâs ability to comprehensively evaluate substrate arrhythmogenicity, as probed by rapid pacing delivered at a number of uniformly distributed ventricular locations, is paramount to its superior performance. Even when using only LGE-CMR in model construction, which reliably detects focal scar (dense fibrosis) but underestimates the amount of nonischemic fibrotic remodeling, our technology still offers VA risk assessment that is superior to the clinical risk models. However, the use of T1 maps in model construction confers a higher level of personalization in each patientâs heart model as compared to LGE only (i.e. personalized thresholds for segmentation), which ultimately translates into superior predictive capability.</p><p>HCM is a genetic disease that progresses throughout the life of the patient, and a cardiac event might be a phenotypic expression of the disease at any point of time. Therefore, we envision that in the clinical application of our technology, patients would be reimaged at different time points and risk assessment repeated to account for changes in arrhythmia susceptibility over time as the diseased heart remodels.</p><p>The technology developed here charts a new direction in the use of biophysically detailed heart modeling in the prognosis of rhythm disorders. A number of different imaging modalities used in patient assessment such as positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computerized tomography could also be integrated with LGE-CMR to construct hybrid heart computational models. Combining such computational approaches with machine learning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shade et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shade et al., 2021</xref>) will enable the incorporation of additional patient clinical data, such as genetic information, phenotypic characterization, time series, such as electrocardiography, and fibrotic distribution in the diagnosis and treatment of complex cardiac diseases with adequately sized patient cohorts.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Our study has a small sample size, limited by the fact that a number of LGE-CMR scans of HCM patients had imaging artifact, which prevented us from reconstructing a larger number of virtual hearts. Specifically, aliasing and motion artifacts were main causes for excluding patient data as well as incomplete scans (operator did not scan the entire left ventricular [LV]). Further, there were minor discrepancies of the in-plane resolution between the postcontrast T1 map and the matching LGE-CMR short-axis scan which were mitigated by binning the regions of fibrotic remodeling and electrophysiological changes instead of using a continuum. The resolution of the CMR scan does not allow representation of small structural heterogeneities.</p><p>Finally, our virtual-heart technology does not incorporate cardiac mechanics into the arrhythmia risk stratification, however we do not expect that including it will alter our prediction. Indeed, a recent paper examining VA in a patient-specific model with structural remodeling that incorporated mechanics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Salvador et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that mechanics only modifies the stability of the arrhythmia, but does not alter its inducibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study overview</title><p>The methodology for assessing VA risk in HCM patients involves creating 3D patient-specific electrophysiological ventricular models with data from LGE-CMR and postcontrast T1 mapping.

Based on evidence in histopathological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellims et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mewton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellims et al., 2014</xref>), these regions in the T1 map represent dense fibrosis (scar) and diffuse fibrosis.</p><p>The thresholds in the LGE-CMR slice, originally 3 and 5 SD of the mean signal intensity of the normal myocardium, were changed to new values (<italic>T</italic><sub>Diffuse</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>Dense</sub>, in units of SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom left) such that the amount and distribution of tissue of mid- and high signal intensity in the LGE-CMR slice matched those in the T1 map. The new personalized signal intensity thresholds in the matching LGE-CMR slice were then applied to all LGE-CMR short-axis slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right) for the given patient to complete the generation of the LGE-T1 personalized geometrical heart model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle) that incorporates regions of focal scar and diffuse fibrosis; the personalized fibrosis segmentation thresholds were unique to each patient. Using T1 mapping provided additional personalization of the model geometrical reconstruction and ensured a comprehensive representation of the individualized structural remodeling in each patientâs heart.</p><p>High-resolution finite-element tetrahedral meshes, with an average resolution of 355 Â± 69 Î¼m, were constructed directly from the ventricular segmented images using finite-element analysis software (Mimics Innovation Suite; Materialise, Leuven, Belgium); the software uses an input target finite-element edge length and generates a computational mesh with a tight edge length distribution around the input value. The mesh resolution requirement in electrophysiological simulations is 300â400 Î¼m to ensure stability of the solution, as demonstrated by a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prassl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Plank et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Fiber orientations, unique to each patient-specific geometry, were applied to each computational mesh on a per-element basis using a rule-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer et al., 2012</xref>) validated using human fiber orientations acquired in histological and diffusion-tensor MRI studies. This methodology uses the LaplaceâDirichlet method to define apicobasal and transmural directions for every element in the personalized ventricular meshes followed by bidirectional spherical linear interpolation to assign fiber orientations based on a set of rules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiological properties in the HCM virtual hearts</title><p>The personalized 3D virtual hearts of HCM patients incorporated electrical functions from the cellular scale to the whole heart. Electrophysiological remodeling was incorporated in each virtual heart based on the reconstruction of heterogeneously distributed structural remodeling.</p><p>At the cellular level, in regions of nonfibrotic myocardium, the human ventricular myocyte model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">ten Tusscher and Panfilov, 2006</xref> was used, with added representation of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaL</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">OâHara et al., 2011</xref>), as done in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartoski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shade et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arevalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prakosa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shade et al., 2021</xref>). For regions of diffuse fibrosis, we modified the ionic channel kinetics of the ten Tusscher model based on data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coppini et al., 2013</xref>. In the latter study, prolonged action potential duration and notch elevation following depolarization were observed in experimental recordings from myocytes in hyperthrophied regions acquired via myectomy. As regions of hypertrophy in the HCM heart are also characterized with diffuse fibrotic remodeling, as per histopathological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galati et al., 2016</xref>), in the absence of experimental reports of specific ionic changes in regions of diffuse fibrosis, we used those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coppini et al., 2013</xref>. Specific changes included 107% increase of <italic>I</italic><sub>NaL</sub> maximal conductance, 19% increase of <italic>I</italic><sub>CaL</sub> maximal conductance, 34% decrease of <italic>I</italic><sub>Kr</sub> maximal conductance, 27% decrease of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> maximal conductance, 85% decrease of <italic>I</italic><sub>to</sub> maximal conductance, 15% decrease of <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> maximal conductance, 34% increase of sodium-calcium exchanger activity, and 43% reduction of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase activity. The net results of the changes to the cell model include increased action potential duration at 90% repolarization from 280 to 330 ms (+18%) and diminution of the notch after depolarization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle, shows the action potentials implemented in regions of fibrotic and nonfibrotic myocardium.</p><p>At the tissue level, conductivity values along the longitudinal and transverse fiber directions in fibrotic and nonfibrotic myocardium were the same as previously implemented for nonischemic patient heart models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shade et al., 2020b</xref>). Dense fibrosis was considered electrically inexcitable. Once completed, the patient-specific HCM electrophysiological heart models were used to assess the patientâs risk of arrhythmia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Assessing VA risk in the personalized HCM computational models</title><p>Full details regarding the simulation of electrical activity in the virtual hearts can be found in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Plank et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prakosa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vigmond et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, these were finite element heart models, where the simulation of electrical activity was performed in a monodomain representation of the myocardium using the software package CARP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://carp.medunigraz.at/">https://carp.medunigraz.at/</ext-link>). Each virtual heart was paced sequentially from seven uniformly distributed endocardial LV locations using a validated rapid pacing protocol described in detail in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prakosa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arevalo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartoski et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to our work on VA risk stratifications for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arevalo et al., 2016</xref>), simulation results were analyzed to determine whether reentrant VA was induced in the LV HCM models following rapid pacing from any of the sites. If VA was induced from at least one pacing site in a given personalized HCM virtual heart, the patient was then considered at risk of VA. Simulation results were blind to clinical outcome.</p><p>The capability of our HCM virtual-heart technology to predict VA risk was compared to risk scores for prophylactic ICD implantation developed by ACCF/AHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gersh et al., 2011</xref>) and ESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">OâMahony et al., 2014</xref>) using the patient clinical data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Johns Hopkins University.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Balram Bhargava as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Colleen E Clancy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address all of the methodological clarifications addressed by Reviewer 1.</p><p>2) Please address all of the conceptual issues raised by Reviewer 2 in the Results/Discussion where appropriate, and more specifically in the Limitations section. Please address the first point in the Recommendations for the Authors section if possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well written manuscript that describes novel work. However, there are some underlying concerns that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1. There is no evidence in the manuscript that the simulated electrical activation and recovery in the models bears any relation to electrical activation and recovery in the patients' hearts. Of course this evidence is difficult to obtain in detail unless the patients undergo electrophysiology study. However, if it were possible to compare some features of a simulated ECG signal with real recordings from the patient group, and demonstrate that the models show features consistent with HCM (changes to Q wave, ST segment and T wave) then this would give confidence in the utility of the model.</p><p>2. It is possible that the electrophysiology model is not needed to predict arrhythmia risk, and that it is the distribution of diffuse and focal fibrosis that is important. The authors have addressed this question to some extent in Figure 2, but I suspect that it is the shape and position of diffuse fibrosis that is important, not the total amount present.</p><p>3.

However, there are some underlying concerns that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1. There is no evidence in the manuscript that the simulated electrical activation and recovery in the models bears any relation to electrical activation and recovery in the patients' hearts. Of course this evidence is difficult to obtain in detail unless the patients undergo electrophysiology study. However, if it were possible to compare some features of a simulated ECG signal with real recordings from the patient group, and demonstrate that the models show features consistent with HCM (changes to Q wave, ST segment and T wave) then this would give confidence in the utility of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our virtual heart models were used purely for the assessment of arrhythmia inducibility in the substrate, and we did not aim to replicate VT in the inducible patients. The rapid pacing protocol we used is not comparable to sinus rhythm, so we cannot make such comparisons. The utility of our model rests on its ability to predict <italic>likelihood of arrhythmia</italic> in the substrate and not on it replicating the patientâs rhythm features or specific VTs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is possible that the electrophysiology model is not needed to predict arrhythmia risk, and that it is the distribution of diffuse and focal fibrosis that is important. The authors have addressed this question to some extent in Figure 2, but I suspect that it is the shape and position of diffuse fibrosis that is important, not the total amount present.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not agree more with the reviewer. We have shown here that the arrhythmogenic propensity of the ventricular substrate with diffuse fibrosis is patient-specific; it is indeed the amount of fibrosis and its <italic>distribution</italic> (shape and location) that determine inducibility of arrhythmia. We have further emphasized this in the Discussion (lines 333-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If this is the case, then it may be that a machine learning approach based on imaging alone may be as good as, and quicker than, the model for risk assessment. The authors should consider this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely agree! Since we have only 26 patients, it is not possible to discern specific features of the fibrotic distribution that are most likely to predict arrhythmogenesis. In the Discussion of the original manuscript, we mentioned that this could be achieved with machine learning in a large cohort (the same text can be found on lines 365-9 of the revised paper). We are in the process of collecting data on a large HCM cohort for a machine learning study to address this question. However, as we expect to determine what features of fibrosis distribution are most important in HCM patients, it is important to keep in mind the mechanistic insight provided by the simulation study as it will provide explainability of the features learned by the algorithm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We wouldnât argue that one can link unequivocally diffuse fibrosis with ventricular arrhythmias based on computational approaches alone. It is the actual fibrotic distribution that determines the arrhythmogenic propensity. A machine learning approach using the MRI images may allow us to determine which features of diffuse fibrosis are most important for arrhythmogenesis. We have made comments along these lines in the Discussion (lines 365-9).</p></body></sub-article></article>
