The EC barrier is established through endothelial cell tight and adherens junctions. However, the expression pattern and precise contribution of different junctional proteins to the EC barrier is poorly understood. Here, we focus on organs with continuous endothelium to identify structural and functional in vivo characteristics of the EC barrier. Assembly of multiple single-cell RNAseq datasets into a single integrated database revealed the variability and commonalities of EC barrier patterning. Across tissues, Claudin5 exhibited diminishing expression along the arteriovenous axis, correlating with EC barrier integrity. Functional analysis identified tissue-specific differences in leakage properties and response to the leakage agonist histamine. Loss of Claudin5 enhanced histamine-induced leakage in an organotypic and vessel type-specific manner in an inducible, EC-specific, knock-out mouse. Mechanistically, Claudin5 loss left junction ultrastructure unaffected but altered its composition, with concomitant loss of zonula occludens-1 and upregulation of VE-Cadherin expression. These findings uncover the organ-specific organisation of the EC barrier and distinct importance of Claudin5 in different vascular beds, providing insights to modify EC barrier stability in a targeted, organ-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelial cell</kwd><kwd>vascular permeability</kwd><kwd>organotypicity</kwd><kwd>Claudin

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessel dysfunction is a hallmark and contributing factor to the progression of numerous pathologies including solid tumours, ischemic diseases and inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Miles, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashizume et al., 2000</xref>). In such pathologies, local concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors are increased, leading to weakening of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier, a regulatable interface between circulating blood and the surrounding tissue environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miles and Miles, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palade et al., 1979</xref>). Loss of EC barrier integrity in-turn leads to enhanced molecular and cellular passage across the endothelium resulting in edema, tissue damage, atrophy, and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fleckenstein et al., 2018</xref>). EC barrier integrity is mediated primarily by adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), composed of transmembrane proteins forming intercellular interactions that bridge adjacent EC membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claesson-Welsh et al., 2021</xref>). These transmembrane proteins also associate with intracellular scaffolding and signaling proteins, as well as the cytoskeleton, which regulate their localisation and stability. The composition and organisation of AJs and TJs thus determines the relative strictness and regulatable nature of the EC barrier.</p><p>AJs are ubiquitously distributed throughout the vascular system in all vessel subtypes (arterial, capillary, and venous) and consist of the largely endothelial-specific transmembrane protein vascular endothelial (VE)-Cadherin, which forms homophilic interactions between cells and associates intracellularly with the actin cytoskeleton via several members of the catenin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazzoni and Dejana, 2004</xref>). VE-cadherin-catenin interactions are highly regulated by their phosphorylation status, which modulates AJ stability and integrity of junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliceiri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TJs are also ubiquitously distributed but are in comparison relatively less well defined, and their composition and localisation appear more heterogeneous in comparison to AJs. Numerous transmembrane proteins are associated with TJs, including members of the claudin family, the tight junction-associated MARVEL proteins, such as Occludin, the junction-associated molecule (JAM) family, and endothelial-cell selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greene et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nasdala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martìn-Padura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raleigh et al., 2010</xref>). With few exceptions, TJ proteins are broadly expressed and not unique to vascular ECs. Similar to AJs, TJ proteins exist in homophilic complexes between adjacent ECs, as well as with intracellular scaffolding proteins including members of the zonula occludens (ZO) family and Cingulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevenson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schossleitner et al., 2016</xref>). The relative proportion of these proteins within junctions is believed to influence barrier strictness, however little is known about the actual composition of TJs and how each component contributes to EC barrier integrity, particularly in vivo.</p><p>Of the TJ proteins, Claudin5 is the best studied regarding its contribution to EC barrier integrity. Claudin5 is highly expressed in the brain vasculature and is an important component of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood retinal barrier (BRB) where it is responsible for restricting the passage of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, constitutive <italic>Cldn5</italic> knock-out in mice results in aberrant BBB permeability and death 10 hours after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, downregulation of Claudin5 expression, and subsequent enhanced EC permeability, is associated with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knowland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). Outside of the CNS, Claudin5 is expressed in ECs to a lower degree, as are other TJ proteins such as Occludin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scalise et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, non-CNS blood vessels have a more permeable EC barrier, although EC permeability also differs greatly between these peripheral tissues and is inherently linked to organ-specific function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin and Koh, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, EC barrier integrity differs between vessel subtypes within these vascular beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>). Typically, the arteriolar aspect of the vasculature is more resistant to EC barrier disruption than the venular side. Interestingly, at least in the mouse ear dermis, EC barrier integrity correlates with Claudin5 expression, which is evident in arterioles but progressively diminishes in capillaries and venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>). The expression pattern of Claudin5 in different vessel subtypes is however poorly understood in tissues outside the CNS, as is the arrangement and differential impact of other TJ proteins on EC barrier integrity. An important goal in clinical medicine is to suppress disease progression by dampening vascular leakage; on the other hand, improved drug delivery across the EC barrier would improve the outcome in a range of diseases. Therefore, better understanding of EC barrier composition will enable the development of tools to both open and close the barrier at will.</p><p>In this study, analysis of single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) datasets from multiple peripheral vascular beds demonstrates that in general, EC junction proteins have a similar distribution in tissues with a continuous endothelium, although with subtle variability in TJ patterning. In all tissues examined here; ear skin, back skin, trachea, skeletal muscle and heart, <italic>Cldn5</italic> exhibits decreasing expression along the arteriovenous axis. We show that <italic>Cldn5</italic> expression inversely correlates with histamine-induced vascular leakage, although precise patterning exhibits tissue-specific variability. Moreover, analysis of Claudin5 function in adult mice using an inducible, endothelial-specific, knock-out mouse shows organotypic differences, with weakening of the EC barrier occurring to different degrees.

Segregation of vessels into their subtypes in the dermis is, however, complicated by their stochastic organisation. Thus, determining precisely which vessels are affected by loss of Claudin5 is not possible. Post-arteriolar vessels were thus instead separated based on luminal dextran diameter. This analysis showed that small vessels (5–10 µm) and subsequent mid-sized venules (10–15 µm) leaked to a greater degree following the loss of Claudin5. In contrast, larger venules (15–20 μm) showed no change in leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To explore further where these vessels lie within the vasculature, analysis of systemically-induced histamine leakage was carried out alongside visualisation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), which is absent on capillaries but present on the arteriolar and venular aspect of the microvasculature. In the ear skin of <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP mice, arteriolar αSMA coverage can be seen to end before <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP expression, whilst its venular expression begins after <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP expression has been lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP expression is thus lost in the αSMA-negative capillary bed. Based on this segregation we observed an almost total loss of Claudin5 levels in capillaries and a 75% reduction in αSMA-positive arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Following histamine stimulation, analysis showed a 2.5-fold increase in leakage from αSMA-positive venules and a fourfold increase in leakage in αSMA-negative capillaries in <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO mice, leakage sites appeared closer to arterioles than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). As expected, any dextran signal associated with arterioles was negligible and unaffected by the loss of Claudin5.</p><p>This data demonstrates that loss of Claudin5 decreases the junctional integrity of capillaries and venules, at least in the ear skin, and moves the limit between leakage resistant and susceptible ECs towards the arteriolar aspect. It is surprising that the phenotypic effects of <italic>Cldn5</italic> recombination is established in vessels seemingly negative for Cldn5 according to immunohistochemistry and the GFP reporter mouse. Use of more sensitive RNA in situ hybridisation, however, showed that in <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP-negative vessels <italic>Cldn5</italic> expression still occurred, albeit to a considerably lower level than <italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP-positive vessels, in keeping with the expression patterning observed from scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><p>From the highly sensitive RNA in situ detection of <italic>Cldn5</italic> expression in capillaries and postcapillary venules, we conclude that in the wild-type vasculature, Claudin5 is responsible for limiting the disruption of EC junctions in capillaries, but also in immediately following venules. Arterioles remain resistant to agonist-induced leakage, as do larger venules, presumably due to residual Claudin5 expression and the relatively high expression of other TJ components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Claudin5 modulates junction protein expression</title><p>The consequence of Claudin5 loss was further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with focus on non-arteriolar vessels in the ear dermis.

Whether Claudin5 expression reciprocally controls the expression of other junctional proteins is unknown. We therefore investigated the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins in <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO mice. Initially, lung RNA was screened for the expression of the AJ gene <italic>Cdh5</italic> (VE-Cadherin) and common TJ genes <italic>Tjp1</italic> (ZO-1), <italic>Ocln</italic> (Occludin), <italic>F11r</italic> (JAM-A), <italic>Cgn</italic> (Cingulin), and <italic>Esam</italic> (ESAM).

Subsequent analysis of lung protein samples confirmed the enhanced protein expression of VE-Cadherin and Occludin and decrease in ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Correlation analysis of these samples also supported this finding, with Claudin5 expression levels inversely correlating with VE-Cadherin and Occludin and positively correlating with ZO-1, but not JAM-A, Cingulin, or ESAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Immunohistochemistry analysis of the ear dermis similarly showed a downregulation of ZO-1 and an upregulation of VE-Cadherin in <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Analysis of Occludin in these samples was precluded by its lack of expression in this vascular bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, ZO-1 and VE-Cadherin levels were unchanged in ECs of the back skin of <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In the ear skin, VE-Cadherin and ZO-1 expression was further investigated to determine in which vessel types, according to αSMA expression, their change in expression is occurring. ZO-1 expression was found to be significantly decreased specifically in venules whilst VE-Cadherin was equally upregulated in both capillaries and venules, but not in arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>).</p><p>Claudin5 expression thus regulates the expression and localisation of other EC junction components. Consequently, whilst Claudin5 loss results in no overt changes in junction structure, in a tissue-specific manner it alters the regulatable and dynamic nature of the remaining junctional complex leading to changes in barrier stability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The EC barrier consists of a variety of transmembrane cell adhesion molecules, creating endothelial junctions of highly variable composition and strictness. However, the correlation between specific expression patterns of cell adhesion molecules and the barrier strictness have remained unclear. Here, we investigated the heterogeneous nature of the BEC barrier and uncovered its composition and integrity in non-CNS, continuous endothelia. Broadly, vessels in the ear skin, back skin, trachea, skeletal muscle, and the heart share a similar complement of AJ and TJ genes. Still, subtle variation in their relative distribution between different vessel subsets are often evident, as is variability in EC barrier integrity and response to stimulation in diverse tissues. Differential gene expression analysis revealed variable gene expression between vessel subsets within tissues, which is provided as a resource along with expression values of genes typically associated with junction regulation and integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2 fig1sdata3 fig1sdata4 fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 1–5</xref>). Generally, transmembrane TJ genes were found to be expressed to a greater degree in the arterial aspect of the microvasculature. In particular, <italic>Cldn5</italic> stands out in this analysis as it exhibited a large gradual decrease in expression from arterioles through capillaries to venules in all tissues analysed, including in the human dermis. Previously we have shown that, in the ear skin, Claudin5 expression inversely correlates with susceptibility to VEGF-A-induced leakage, with capillaries possessing a mixture of Claudin5-positive and -negative cells being responsive to leakage stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>). This correlation however does not extend to other vascular beds such as the back skin and trachea, in which the leakage permissive vasculature was shifted away from the capillary region toward the venous side. To fully address why Claudin5-negative capillaries in the trachea might be resistant to leakage requires more extensive insights into the junctional organisation in these organs. Of note, whilst tracheal capillaries might be resistant to leakage, the trachea shows a much larger leakage response overall than the ear skin. The back skin similarly showed a larger leakage response than the ear skin. These data reveal the highly heterogeneous nature of barrier integrity and patterning across different tissues.</p><p>Differential regulation of EC barrier integrity in tissue-specific vasculatures was also observed following removal of Claudin5 in adult mice. We find that outside of the CNS, the largest influence of Claudin5 is in the ear skin among the organs analysed, with a more modest loss in barrier integrity also observed in back skin and tracheal vasculatures. Similarly, a significant loss in barrier integrity was seen in the ear skin, but not the back skin, following the loss of Claudin5 in an Oxazolone-induced model of dermatitis. EC barrier integrity in skeletal muscle and heart meanwhile showed no change following the loss of Claudin5. This observation might be explained by the expression patterning of <italic>Cldn5</italic>, which declines more proximal to the arterial side along the arteriovenous axis in skeletal muscle than tissue such as the ear skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Alternatively, we observe expression of other TJ genes, such as <italic>Ocln</italic>, <italic>Nectin2</italic> and <italic>Nectin3</italic>, in skeletal muscle and heart which are not evident in the other tissues analysed. Other studies have demonstrated a barrier protective role for Occludin, nectin-2 and nectin-3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Son et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murakami et al., 2009</xref>), but further studies are required to establish whether these actively participate in EC barrier integrity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In keeping with previous observations in the brain, loss of Claudin5 did not alter BEC junction structure in the ear dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, loss of VE-Cadherin in the lungs enhances barrier permeability without causing any structural defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duong et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, concomitant loss of ESAM along with VE-Cadherin produces more overt changes in junction structure and enhances loss of barrier integrity, highlighting the redundant organisation of the EC barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duong et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, interpretation of models that manipulate the EC barrier are often complicated by compensatory effects in gene expression. For example, VE-cadherin has been found to be a major regulator of EC gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morini et al., 2018</xref>). Assembly of VE-Cadherin junctions upregulates Claudin5 expression, whilst its loss leads to compensatory upregulation of N-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taddei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giampietro et al., 2012</xref>). We find here in vivo that Claudin5 can reciprocally alter expression of VE-Cadherin, as well as Occludin and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Tight junctions have previously been suggested to control gene expression through ZO-1’s tension-dependent interaction with the ZO-1–associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balda and Matter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spadaro et al., 2017</xref>). When under tension ZO-1 can interact with ZONAB, resulting its junctional sequestering. ZO-1 also interacts with Claudins through their PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>). Loss of junctional Claudin5 and resulting dislocation of junctional ZONAB may thus modify the EC transcriptome. Upregulation of VE-Cadherin meanwhile may explain the lack of structural defects of junctions in <italic>Cldn5</italic> iECKO mice. Moreover, in contrast to Claudin5, VE-Cadherin at junctions is highly dynamic and its localisation is regulated by numerous cytokines and growth factors that affect its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eliceiri et al., 1999</xref>). Upregulation of VE-Cadherin by Claudin5 deficiency is therefore likely to produce junctions that are less stable and subject to higher turnover in a stimulatory environment.</p><p>Collectively, the data in this study highlights the variable regulation and integrity of the EC barrier in various vascular beds and demonstrates a distinct role for Claudin5 in the EC barrier integrity of different tissues. The mechanisms underlying such organotypic barrier integrity and differential patterning of junctional components are currently poorly understood. Pericytes are known to be essential for maintenance of the tight BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>). Outside of the CNS however pericyte coverage is comparatively low and whether coverage differs between non-CNS vascular beds is unknown. Barrier integrity may also be regulated by basement membrane components such as laminin α5, which enhances VE-Cadherin stability at cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to pericytes, basement membrane coverage differs between different vascular beds, as well as between vessel subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richards et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Russo et al., 2017</xref>). Whether basement membrane components significantly define EC junction composition however is currently unknown. A better understanding of basement membrane, as well as pericyte, coverage however would provide potential new means of manipulating EC biology for therapeutic benefit.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides an in-depth characterisation and comparison of the EC barrier in numerous organs. Furthermore, in accordance with its role in forming the tight BBB and BRB in the CNS, we find that Claudin5 influences vascular permeability in peripheral vascular beds, albeit in an organotypic and vessel-type manner. The impact of Claudin5 in organ-specific vascular permeability was demonstrated by the direct correlation between its expression and high barrier integrity in some, but not all vascular beds. Variability in the pattering of the EC barrier between vascular beds and vessel subtypes,as well as the redundancy, interdependency and crosstalk between different junction components have remained poorly defined. Understanding the role of different EC components in various vascular beds will allow us to better appreciate organ-specific defects in vascular permeability and how they may be therapeutically

To monitor Cre recombinase activity with YFP expression, the fluorescent reporter mouse line B6.129 × 1-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(EYFP)Cos</sup>/J (Stock Number 006148, The Jackson Laboratory) was introduced. Both males and females, aged 8–18 weeks, were included in experiments. In vivo animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the ethical permit provided by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Uppsala (permit 6789/18). Mice were maintained in ventilated cages with group housing (2–5 per cage) and access to water and feed ad libitum. Each experiment was conducted on tissue from at least three age-matched animals representing individual biological repeats. Sample size (number of acquired images / movies and number of mice) were chosen to ensure reproducibility and allow stringent statistical analysis. To induce Cre recombinase-mediated gene recombination tamoxifen (SigmaAldrich, T5648) was injected intraperitoneally (1 mg/day) for 5 consecutive days. The mice were allowed to rest for 5 days before experiments were conducted. For topical tamoxifen induction 50 μg of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (SigmaAldrich, H7904) in acetone was applied to each side of the mouse ear for 3 consecutive days twice. Experiments were conducted 30 days after initial treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Intravital vascular leakage assay</title><p>Intravital imaging of the mouse ear with intradermal injection has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>).

Mice were maintained at a body temperature of 37 °C for the entire experiment, maximum 90 min. Time-lapse imaging was performed using single-photon microscopy (Leica SP8). For intradermal EC stimulation, a volume of approximately 0.1 μl histamine (SigmaAldrich, H7125), concentration 10 ng/μl, was injected using a sub-micrometer capillary needle. 10 kDa TRITC Dextran (ThermoFischer Scientific, D1817) was used as a tracer.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Gou Young Koh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pipsa Saharinen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The comments below recommend to the authors significant additional experimental works for this study. Please provide the reasons for not making some of the suggested changes where necessary.</p><p>1. The authors employed the histamine injection to see the differential vascular leakage at the different capillary beds. To ensure their claims, they are required to examine the vascular leakage in pathologic conditions such as injury or inflammation. Physical injury to the skin and ischemic injury to the skeletal muscle and myocardium could be feasible for the authors.</p><p>2. Gene expression is thoroughly investigated in the ear skin, back skin, trachea, skeletal muscle and heart. However, protein expression was not carefully examined. Claudin5 was still expressed even after the cldn5 gene was knocked out in endothelial cells. Therefore, immunohistochemistry of blood vessels should be carefully performed to confirm where the compensatory increase of gene expression is found.</p><p>3. Given the dominant expression of Claudin5 in arterioles over venules, leakage in the cldn5 KO mouse should be mostly found in arterioles. The authors did not show clear data about the leakage sites. Figure 4B vi and Figure 3C ii suggested the leakage in the capillaries and venules.</p><p>4. In Figure 3Fiii, how could it be explained that the extravasation of larger 200 nm microspheres is increased significantly in the back skin of Cldn5 iECKO mice when compared to controls, whereas the leakage of smaller molecular size dextran (2000 kda) is not? One would expect that smaller tracers would leak out similarly unless the leakage in the control is already saturating.

Figure 3Fiii.

Please provide the reasons for not making some of the suggested changes where necessary.</p><p>1. The authors employed the histamine injection to see the differential vascular leakage at the different capillary beds. To ensure their claims, they are required to examine the vascular leakage in pathologic conditions such as injury or inflammation. Physical injury to the skin and ischemic injury to the skeletal muscle and myocardium could be feasible for the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to address leakage parameters in pathological models of injury and disease; we agree this is an important next step. However, our aim in the current study was to identify vessel segment- and organ-specific leakage response to a specific agonist. This type of ambitious in vivo investigation has not been performed before and it reveals a considerable variability in the leakage parameters between vessel subtypes and between organs. We thus respectfully argue that adding models for example of ischemic injury of the skeletal muscle and heart with endogenous production of a potentially wide range of cytokines, would introduce quite complex incomparable patterns, rendering such data sets out of scope for this study. From attempting to introduce these models (which are not as yet established with us) we also realized that it will require quite some practise to induce the insults in a reproducible manner. We do, however, present new data on ozazolone-induced dermatitis comparing the responses in ear and back skin (Figure 5K and L), which shows a pattern of leakage similar to that established upon exogenous administration of histamine. Thus, following Oxazolone-induced dermatitis, there is a significant increase in 2000kDa dextran leakage in the ear skin of Cldn5 iECKO mice but not the back skin, in keeping with the lesser role of Cldn5 in the back skin, in response to histamine. Overall, these data support the relevance of the design of our study and motivates a new section in the discussion on leakage in pathologies affecting the organs in focus (lines 369-376). We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Gene expression is thoroughly investigated in the ear skin, back skin, trachea, skeletal muscle and heart. However, protein expression was not carefully examined. Claudin5 was still expressed even after the cldn5 gene was knocked out in endothelial cells. Therefore, immunohistochemistry of blood vessels should be carefully performed to confirm where the compensatory increase of gene expression is found.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the need to confirm and examine protein expression and not rely only on gene expression. Therefore, we addressed protein expression to understand which vessel subtypes are affected in Figure 5. Given the lethality of removing Cldn5 from the vasculature (See essential revision 5) and the apparent stability of Cldn5 protein (Figure 3B-E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 B and F), full removal of Cldn5 protein from all endothelial cells seems not possible with the available methodology. In Figure 3 and some of the revision experiments that we have now conducted, we show that there is still some remaining Cldn5 protein expression in arterioles, whereas Cldn5 is no longer visible in capillaries. In venules Cldn5 protein is not visible in the wildtype control situation, but we can detect some mRNA expression by RNAscope. Thus, for Cldn5, we do not claim that there is compensatory gene expression from some other cell type but that loss of the protein from endothelial cells is incomplete.</p><p>We do also address compensatory expression mechanisms at the gene and protein level for other important EC junction proteins in Figures 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Here we find that in response to the loss of Cldn5 there is upregulation of Occludin in the lung. We also find upregulation of VE-cadherin and downregulation of ZO-1 in both the lung and ear dermis, with these changes being present in capillaries and venules, whereas their expression in arterioles appears unaffected. To strengthen the data provided in our initial submission we have conducted further experiments on VE-cadherin and ZO-1 expression in vessel subtypes of the ear dermis following Cldn5 knock-out and added analysis in the back skin, where we see no effect of Cldn5 loss of the expression of VE-cadherin and ZO-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Given the dominant expression of Claudin5 in arterioles over venules, leakage in the cldn5 KO mouse should be mostly found in arterioles. The authors did not show clear data about the leakage sites. Figure 4B vi and Figure 3C ii suggested the leakage in the capillaries and venules.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4A and 4B we aimed to demonstrate that we do not observe leakage occurring from arterioles in neither the wildtype control nor the Cldn5 iECKO. We have now added additional analysis in Figure 4H, showing comparison of extravascular dextran observed in association with aSMA-positive arterioles, aSMA-negative capillaries and aSMA-positive venules. This shows the minimal level of dextran signal that is associated with arterioles compared to capillaries and venules, regardless of Cldn5 levels.</p><p>However, we cannot state definitively that Cldn5-deficient arterioles cannot respond to histamine with increased leakage. As we point out, we cannot fully remove Cldn5 protein from arterioles: even when tamoxifen was administered topically on the ear skin (to avoid sudden death of the animal) and waiting up to 30 days for remaining protein to be cleared, there was still detectable levels of Cldn5 in arterioles (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Small levels of residual Cldn5 may thus allow ECs to maintain sufficient junctional integrity to prevent the leakage of 2000kDa Dextran. Cldn5 in arterioles may also be compensated by other proteins such as Claudin15, which we also see is more highly expressed in arterioles. We have, furthermore, now included data describing histamine receptor expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D) to exclude that the lack of leakage from arterioles would be due to reduced receptor expression. The histamine receptors, Hrh1 and Hrh2, are uniformly expressed among the ear dermal subsets or absent respectively in our scRNAseq analysis indicating that the arterio-venous differences in leakage is not due to the lack of receptor expression in the arterioles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3Fiii, how could it be explained that the extravasation of larger 200 nm microspheres is increased significantly in the back skin of Cldn5 iECKO mice when compared to controls, whereas the leakage of smaller molecular size dextran (2000 kda) is not? One would expect that smaller tracers would leak out similarly unless the leakage in the control is already saturating. This should be clarified as it concerns the authors' conclusion about the size-selective regulation of dermal vasculature by Cldn5.</p></disp-quote><p>An important difference between the 2000 kDa dextran tracer and the 200 nm microspheres is in their dimensions, with the dextran being an extended, rather flexible structure while the microsphere is a static globular entity. In our new analyses of the effects of lower histamine concentrations the difference between the leakage of dextran and microspheres in the Cldn5-deficient condition, was not maintained. Instead, we see an inversion of the phenotype, with the back skin and trachea now having increased leakage to 2000 kDa dextran and not microspheres. We believe that the dynamics and dimensions of the leakage sites can explain the difference in leakage properties of the two tracers, however, this is currently not possible to prove. We have therefore decided to remove the microsphere data from the edited version but are providing for the reviewers graphs of 2000 kDa dextran and microsphere leakage in trachea and back skin for high (10 mg/kg) and low (4 mg/kg) histamine doses for you to observe the different phenotypes (Please see reviewer figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Cldn5 iECKO lung lysates (For example Figure 3aii) show relatively high Cldn5 expression, which is explained by protein stability. The deletion time is 5 days post last tamoxifen.

It is also mentioned that topical administration of tamoxifen was used &quot;to enhance the loss of Claudin5 without causing lethality&quot;. It will be interesting to report if the deletion of Cldn5 in adult mice was lethal.</p></disp-quote><p>The deletion of Cldn5 in adult mice is indeed lethal. This data is being prepared for publication by Christer Betsholtz’s lab. Mean humane endpoints in this model are typically around 12 days post induction. For this reason, we have conducted experiments 5 days post-tamoxifen to avoid any problems related to mouse health. We have used topical tamoxifen as an alternative to attempt to push the deletion further in the ear dermis, however as we report in Figure 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 we still see a similar phenotype using systemic or topical tamoxifen treatment.</p><p>To try and push topical tamoxifen treatment further we are also now including 30 day post topical tamoxifen data with 2 x 3 doses of hydroxy-tamoxifen instead of the previous 1 x 3 doses. We have also investigated histamine-induced leakage in these mice (See Figure 4—figure supplement 1). From these experiments we find that we are able to induce a higher loss of Cldn5 protein (remaining levels, 13% of control). Analysis of histamine-induced leakage in these mice however shows similar response to those systemically treated with tamoxifen. Thus, we still do not observe any obvious arteriolar leakage in topically treated Cldn5 iECKO mice. We argue that the remaining 13% expression level of Cldn5 in arterioles is sufficient to maintain the barrier to 2000 kDa dextran or that other aspects of the EC junctional complex provide sufficient barrier integrity in the absence of Cldn5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The questions and suggestions below are not intended to trigger significant additional experimental work for the present paper, but to perhaps increase clarity and make the study more accessible to readers.</p><p>1.
