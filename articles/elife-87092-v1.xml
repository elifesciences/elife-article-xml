There is a need to deepen our understanding of the underlying cell signaling pathways to unlock effective treatments. In this work, we screen cell signaling pathways in human tendinopathies and find positively enriched IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling alongside signatures of cell populations typically activated by IL-6 in other tissues. In human tendinopathic tendons, we also confirm the strong presence and co-localization of IL-6, IL-6R, and CD90, an established marker of reparative fibroblasts. To dissect the underlying causalities, we combine IL-6 knock-out mice with an explant-based assembloid model of tendon damage to successfully connect IL-6 signaling to reparative fibroblast activation and recruitment. Vice versa, we show that these reparative fibroblasts promote the development of tendinopathy hallmarks in the damaged explant upon IL-6 activation. We conclude that IL-6 activates tendon fibroblast populations which then initiate and deteriorate tendinopathy hallmarks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tendinopathy</kwd><kwd>interleukin-6</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>assembloid</kwd><kwd>scleraxis</kwd><kwd>fibroblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012652</institution-id><institution>ETH Zürich Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-005733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Bock</surname><given-names>Katrien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL-6 signaling drives fibroblast activation in tendinopathy, emerging as a promising therapeutic target for these increasingly prevalent and costly tendon conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendons are essential to every human movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirkendall and Garrett, 1997</xref>). Tendinopathies represent the largest group of common tendon diseases and approximately 22% of all sport-related injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Florit et al., 2019</xref>). They can strike tendons at many different anatomical locations, can dramatically diminish quality of life by limiting the associated movements, and often share a history of repetitive overuse-induced damage and repair cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Florit et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McElvany et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snedeker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yelin et al., 2016</xref>). Once adult tendon regions fail to keep up with functional demands, they fall into a state of non-resolving, uncontrolled lesion repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lipman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Riley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soslowsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Järvinen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Magnusson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These chronic tendon lesions underlying tendinopathies feature characteristics of normal wound healing including accelerated extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and proliferation of reparative fibroblast populations as well as their migration to replace and repopulate damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelberman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma and Maffulli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harvey et al., 2019</xref>). In tendon, reparative (e.g. Scx<sup>+</sup>) fibroblast populations are assumed to reside primarily in the extrinsic compartment comprising epitenon and paratenon from where they are recruited to the damaged intrinsic compartment embodied by the load-bearing tendon core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelberman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mienaltowski et al., 2013</xref>). While the mechanisms governing activation, proliferation, and recruitment of these populations are unclear, some insight can be gleaned from studies on other musculoskeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snedeker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gelberman et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>In acute muscle lesions, mechanisms for repair, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia are dominated by the satellite cells residing in the muscle basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cosgrove et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceafalan et al., 2014</xref>). Satellite cells in muscle and dermal fibroblasts in skin are activated and recruited by interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key player in the acute phase response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serrano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceafalan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muñoz-Cánoves et al., 2013</xref>). Stress-related mechanisms activating <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA transcription in the absence of exogenous pathogens include damage-associated molecular patterns, calcium signaling after membrane depolarization, but also energetic stressors like glycogen depletion and redox signaling following exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kistner et al., 2022</xref>). In humans, IL-6 transmits its signal via classical or trans-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Classical signaling involves the membrane-bound receptor IL-6R, which forms a homodimer with gp130 upon IL-6 binding. Trans-signaling works similarly, except that the IL-6R has been solubilized (sIL-6R) by metalloproteases (mostly ADAM10 and 17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Villar-Fincheira et al., 2021</xref>), which cleave it from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Villar-Fincheira et al., 2021</xref>). Since not all cell populations express IL-6R, trans-signaling via sIL-6R enables IL-6 signaling for a wider range of cell populations. Regardless of classical or trans-signaling initiation, further transduction of the IL-6 signal runs via two major pathways (JAK/STAT/ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watanabe et al., 2004</xref>] and SHP2/GAB2/MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ernst and Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eulenfeld et al., 2012</xref>]) to turn on cellular processes inducing proliferation, migration, metabolic adaptations, and tissue turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choy and Rose-John, 2017</xref>). In chronic muscle lesions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, IL-6 is persistently upregulated, and anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies have been proposed as treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wada et al., 2017</xref>). Anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6 inhibitors) like tocilizumab inhibit both classical and trans-signaling and are routinely used in other chronic inflammatory diseases like systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Srirangan and Choy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simone et al., 2003</xref>). In this context, IL-6 inhibitors have been shown to reduce disease hallmarks including arthritis-concomitant tendon inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poutoglidou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emery et al., 2008</xref>). Analogous to these chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases, tendinopathies present with localized pain, swelling, and functional decline in the affected organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snedeker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Riley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colquhoun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aström and Rausing, 1995</xref>). Histological and molecular characteristics of tendinopathy include hypercellularity, disorganized collagen fibers including mechanically inferior collagen-3, and dysregulated ECM homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riley et al., 1994</xref>). Based on this research performed in other tissues, repair-competent fibroblasts appear as prime targets and effectors for IL-6 signaling in a tendon wound healing context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muñoz-Cánoves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moresi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McFarland-Mancini et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a vital role in activating reparative fibroblasts within the extrinsic tissue compartment (i.e. epitenon or paratenon) and recruitment of these cells to the damaged tendon core tissue in non-sheathed tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stauber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sakabe et al., 2018</xref>).

To see whether an IL-6 KO would partially reverse fibroblast-invoked hallmarks, we matched the list of DEGs (p-value &lt;0.01) to the signatures in the GO database and then compared the surfacing enriched biological processes with those enriched by DEGs between the core of a WT core // fibroblast assembloid and a WT core // cell-free assembloid. The largest overlap lay in the signaling pathways (Wnt, ERK1/2, and IL-6), where 5/5 signatures for biological processes remained similarly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). We found slightly fewer overlapping signatures connected to ECM turnover (6/14) and cellularity (6/18) while there seemed to be a disconnect in hypoxia and glucose metabolism (2/8). Overall, about a third of all signatures enriched by the presence of fibroblasts were also enriched by the IL-6 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). In contrast to the signatures emerging from the presence of fibroblasts however, the respective contribution of transcripts increased and decreased by the IL-6 KO to the enriched GO biological processes and molecular functions indicates a decreasing cellularity and ECM turnover in the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which could mean that IL-6 signaling contributes to the gene expression behind these tendinopathy hallmarks.</p><p>As we have already demonstrated the tissue-level effects of IL-6 signaling on cellularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we next wanted to examine the tissue-level consequences of changed transcript signatures for ECM turnover on core biomechanics. To do so, we measured the assembloid’s linear elastic modulus as an indicator for their ability to resist longitudinal tension, which is one of the main functions of adult tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). In WT core // fibroblast assembloids, the linear elastic modulus decreased the most between the initial clamping of the core explant and 21 days of co-culture (light blue). The linear elastic modulus of assembloids containing a KO core (violet) or a WT core explant devitalized through multiple freeze-thaw cycles (black) decreased as well, but not as fast or as strongly. In connection with the bulk RNA-seq data, the changes in the assembloid’s ability to resist tension suggest that IL-6 signaling accelerates (catabolic) ECM turnover.</p><p>Normally, it would be hard to predict the effect of an accelerated catabolic ECM turnover in vitro on wound healing in vivo since both ECM degradation and synthesis are required to replace damaged tissue structures. However, previous studies have already reported a delayed wound healing response in IL-6 KO mice and our experiments here suggest that the decelerated catabolic ECM turnover could be responsible for this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>IL-6 is an attractive translational research target. Signaling cascades related to IL-6 are upregulated in tendon tissues after exercise, acute tissue damage, and in chronic tendon disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Legerlotz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langberg et al., 2002</xref>). Little is currently understood of the precise role that IL-6 plays in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arvind and Huang, 2021</xref>). The goal of the present work was to clarify the role of IL-6 signaling in the tissues of non-sheathed tendons in the context of chronic damage, with a particular focus on inter-compartmental crosstalk between the damaged tendon core and extrinsic (reparative) fibroblasts populations targeted by it.</p><p>We first reanalyzed existing microarray data of (non-sheathed) tendinopathic tendons to verify a hypothesized (dys)functional role of IL-6 that seems to run partially via the JAK/STAT pathway enriched by transcripts increased in the tendinopathic samples. The JAK/STAT pathway interweaves with ERK1/2 downstream, which fits with recent data from our lab showing that ERK inhibition alone can prevent tendon matrix deterioration while reducing the secretion of IL-11, another member of the IL-6 cytokine family that was also upregulated in the tendinopathic tendons analyzed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blache et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wunderli et al., 2020</xref>). More generally, overactivation of JAK/STAT/ERK has been associated with autoimmune arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ernst and Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eulenfeld et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While analysis of human samples indicated the expression of <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL6ST</italic>, and <italic>ADAM10</italic> (known to transform membrane-bound IL-6R into soluble IL-6R) to be upregulated in tendinopathic tendons, the expression of <italic>IL6RA</italic> itself was downregulated. We speculate that this points toward increased trans-signaling aimed at stromal cells unable to express <italic>IL6RA</italic>, in this tendinopathic context particularly the stromal fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cell populations indicated to be enriched by the cell-type signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rose-John, 2012</xref>). This theory is supported by GO terms enriched in tendinopathic samples compared to controls relating to increased morphogenesis and wound healing, both processes supposedly powered by (reparative) fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyment et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). Most of the remaining top 20 enriched GO terms pointed toward increased cell proliferation, potentially increasing the leverage of the proliferating fibroblasts. Indeed, staining human samples with CD90, an established marker of reparative fibroblasts typically present in healing tissues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2021</xref>, confirmed a higher percentage of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells in (non-sheathed) tendinopathic compared to normal control tendons.</p><p>While beneficial in controlled dosages during normal wound healing, both excessive hypercellularity and imbalanced wound healing are hallmarks of tendinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma and Maffulli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harvey et al., 2019</xref>). To decipher their connections to IL-6 signaling, we investigated IL-6/IL-6R concentration gradients, sources, and targets in patient-derived tissue sections. In tendinopathic patients, the presence of IL-6 over the whole tissue was smaller than expected. However, while IL-6 seemed to be largely confined to the extrinsic compartment in normal control tendons, it was distributed across compartments in tendinopathic tendons. The resulting gradient differences could play a role in the emergence of disease hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crowe et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to the relative transcript-level decrease of <italic>IL6RA</italic> in tendinopathic tendons indicated by the microarray, its presence was increased on the protein level. Although we can only speculate on the clearance rate of both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R as well as of the cells carrying them, the mismatch in its presence on the gene transcription and the protein expression levels could be a legacy from earlier disease stages.</p><p>To identify sources and targets of IL-6 and IL-6R, we co-stained the tendinopathic tissue sections with established markers for macrophages (CD68) and reparative fibroblasts (CD90). Presuming that IL-6 is more concentrated around its sources than its targets due to diffusion, it seems that although both CD68<sup>+</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup> cells express IL-6, the contribution of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells is significantly larger. This observation is in line with sources of IL-6 identified in growing mouse tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2023</xref>). The number of CD90<sup>+</sup> cells among IL-6R<sup>+</sup> cells was also significantly larger than that of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells. Since it has yet to be shown that stromal fibroblasts express and translate IL-6R, a better explanation might be that the IL-6R on CD90<sup>+</sup> cells were originally produced by, i.e., the CD68<sup>+</sup> cells and ended up on CD90<sup>+</sup> cells as part of a trans-signaling process. Why and how CD90<sup>+</sup> cells are targeted by soluble IL-6R as part of IL-6 trans-signaling could be an interesting part of future research.</p><p>To dissect the specific effect of IL-6 signaling on reparative fibroblasts, we turned to tendon assembloids: hybrid explant // hydrogel models of core tendon damage and repair that were recently developed in our lab and which identified an underloaded core explant as a potentially biologically relevant source of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stauber et al., 2021</xref>). The simultaneously increased and imbalanced matrix tissue turnover perpetuated by the crosstalk between the core and an extrinsic fibroblast population seemed to put the system into a prime position to decipher the connections between IL-6, hypercellularity, and (catabolic) matrix turnover. Furthermore, their compartmentalized design adequately mimics the structure of non-sheathed tendons.</p><p>Replacing the WT core explant with an IL-6 KO core explant in our assembloids was sufficient to reduce the expression of genes in gene sets related to matrix turnover, proteolysis, cell proliferation, and cell migration in the extrinsic fibroblast population. We confirmed the IL-6-induced gene-level differences regarding cell migration by exploiting trackable ScxGFP fibroblasts and demonstrated effective manipulation of both recruitment and proliferation of ScxGFP cells through IL-6. We did so by using the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab to desensitize resident cell populations to IL-6 and recombinant IL-6 to replace the IL-6 not secreted by an IL-6 KO core. Recombinant IL-6 rescuing proliferation but not migration of ScxGFP cells highlights the necessity of an IL-6 gradient and/or the establishment of a secondary cytokine gradient (e.g. TGF-β) by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, IL-6 has also been described as an energy allocator in other musculoskeletal tissues and could in this function be accelerating a diverse range of processes (i.e. migration) by increasing the baseline cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kistner et al., 2022</xref>). Fittingly, the extrinsic cell populations around an IL-6 KO core upregulated biological processes related to oxidative stress and hypoxia, which indicates a disrupted energy allocation. Since we found similar biological processes to be positively enriched in human tendinopathic tendons compared to controls, future studies should more closely examine the role of hypoxic signaling in the pathogenesis of tendinopathy.</p><p>To transfer these insights from our in vitro experiments to an in vivo setup, we used an Achilles tenotomy model of the in vivo tendon damage response. Although the number of Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts did increase in injured tendons, the in vivo experiments did not detect an effect of IL-6 on activating Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korcari et al., 2022</xref>) and making them migrate into or proliferate faster in the damaged and unloaded Achilles tendon stump. In addition, previous studies with mice subjected to a patellar punch procedure reported only marginally reduced mechanical properties in the healing patellar tendon of IL-6 KO mice compared to the WT after an acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). However, we are cautious in interpreting these in vivo results, mainly because 14 days after an Achilles tenotomy, the tendon niche condition represents an acute rather than a chronic tendon lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sugg, 2014</xref>). Also, even with breeding a novel IL-6 KO x ScxGFP mouse line to alleviate widely known problems of Scx antibodies, the collagen matrix still caused considerable background noise in our images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the ablation of IL-6 might have led to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands (or other attractant chemokines or cytokines) and one can currently only speculate on their in vivo distribution as well as the resulting patterns of fibroblast migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langberg et al., 2002</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, future in vivo studies could deploy IL-6 inhibitors targeting other members of the IL-6 superfamily as well.</p><p>Since the migrating Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts in vitro were apparently targeting the damaged core tissue (likely to support the limited intrinsic regenerative potential of the explanted tendon core secreting IL-6 in the first place) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stauber et al., 2020</xref>), the next set of experiments we conducted in this work focused on the effects of the activated and recruited fibroblasts on the tendon core.</p><p>According to existing literature and results presented here, Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts are increasingly present in in vivo murine adult tendon lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2021</xref>) and depleting them alternately improves or impairs adult tendon healing depending on the timepoint of depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korcari et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2021</xref>). One underlying reason could be that adult, Scx<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts hold a bi-fated potential that enables a cartilage-like differentiation when exposed to mechanical compression or tensile unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kult et al., 2021</xref>). Our in vitro assembloid model captured these behaviors as well with increased Scx/Sox9 transcripts and enriched gene sets indicating a stronger presence of fibroblasts alongside cartilage development in a core surrounded by (migrating) fibroblasts compared to one embedded in a cell-free hydrogel. Besides, genes differentially expressed in a core explant surrounded by fibroblasts enriched gene sets related to hypercellularity, ERK1/2 signaling, oxygen/glucose metabolism, and ECM turnover. Most of these processes were reduced in an IL-6 KO core, speculatively because of the reduced presence of extrinsic fibroblasts resulting from the reduced migration and proliferation. On the tissue level, we also found signs for a decreased catabolic matrix turnover in the more stable mechanical properties of IL-6 KO core explants, a process likely linked to ERK1/2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blache et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data consistently point to IL-6 signaling targeting reparative fibroblasts being upregulated in chronic human (non-sheathed) tendon lesions in a manner that directly leads to fibroblast recruitment and proliferation as well as aberrant morphogenesis/matrix turnover. This activity contributes to typical hallmarks of tendinopathy including hypercellularity and loss of biomechanical tissue integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human microarray data analysis</title><p>We reanalyzed a microarray dataset (GEO: GSE26051) from 2011 with contemporary methods (principal component analysis, volcano plots, heatmaps, GSEA, and ORA), focusing on the IL-6 signaling cascade.

After 7 days, the assembloids were removed from the clamps and washed with PBS before staining them with ethidium homodimer (EthD-1, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mM stock in DMSO) diluted to 4 µM with PBS (20 min, 37°C). They were then again washed with PBS, fixated with 4% formaldehyde (Roti-Histofix, Karlsruhe) for 1 hr at RT, washed again with PBS, and stored in PBS at 4°C.

We used the Nikon Eclipse T<italic>i</italic>2 confocal scanning microscope controlled by NIS-Elements to acquire the images (three per sample), which we then processed with ImageJ 1.53q. Briefly, we first registered all cell locations by creating a mask from the NucBlue channel. Then, we put this mask over the ScxGFP channel and measured the fluorescence intensity at the identified cell locations. We then transferred the signal intensity per location data to RStudio, where we first calculated the total cell numbers of all the images of one sample combined and normalized them to the WT median. Afterward, we determined the fluorescence threshold for the ScxGFP-signal (using density plots and a negative control image) and applied this threshold to the dataset. We then calculated the total ScxGFP cell numbers for each sample and normalized them to the WT median. Finally, we combined the cell location with the fluorescence intensity data to find the distance from the core where most of the ScxGFP cells were located and to calculate the ratio between ScxGFP present at the core and those present in the surrounding extrinsic hydrogel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode4">Source code 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode5">Source code 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantifying mechanical properties of assembloids</title><p>We mounted the assembloids to a custom-made uniaxial stretching device equipped with a load cell as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stauber et al., 2021</xref>).

In the ex-vivo model, the use of cell counting approaches is somewhat acceptable since the system is constrained by the absence of potential influx of new cells. However, given the nearly unlimited supply of extrinsically derived cells in vivo (vs. the explant model), assessment of actual proliferation (e.g. Edu, BrdU, Ki67) is critical to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the effect of IL-6 on Scx+ fibroblast proliferation in an acute injury, we repeated the in vivo studies with an EdU staining and a newly established IL-6 KO x ScxGFP+ mouse line to combat the considerable background noise of currently available Scx antibodies.</p><p>Under the improved design of these experiments, we could detect no effect of IL-6 on ScxGFP+ cells in an acute injury in vivo.

Indeed, in the discussion, Scx+ cells are treated as though they are uniformly a progenitor population, when the diversity of this population has been established by the cited studies, which do not suggest that these are progenitor populations. Additional definition/ delineation of these cells to identify the subset of these cells that may actually display other putative progenitor markers would support the conclusions. As it stands, the study currently provides important information on the impact of IL6 on Scx+ cells, but not tendon progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We further delineated the extrinsic cell populations isolated from mouse Achilles tendons of ScxGFP+ mice using flow cytometric analysis and RT-qPCR.

This facilitates the identification of potentially conserved regulators of the tendinopathy phenotype.</p><p>The clear transcriptional shifts between WT and IL6-/- cores demonstrates the utility of the assembloid model, and supports the importance of IL6 in potentiating the cell response to this stimuli.</p><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>The authors of this study describe a goal of elucidating the signaling pathways that are upregulated in tendinopathy in order to target these pathways for effective treatments. Their goal is honorable, as tendinopathy is a common debilitating condition with limited treatments. The authors find that IL-6 signaling is upregulated in human tendinopathy samples with transcriptomic and GSEA analyses. The evidence of their initial findings are strong, providing a clinically-relevant phenotype that can be further studied using animal models.</p><p>Along these lines, the authors continue with an advanced in vitro system using the mouse tail tendon as the core with progenitors isolated from the Achilles tendon as the external sheath embedded in a hydrogel matrix. One question that comes to mind is whether the fibroblast progenitors in the extrinsic sheath of Achilles tendon is similar to those surrounding the tail tendon. The similarity of progenitors between different tendons is assumed with this model. I would consider this to be a minor issue, and would consider the in vitro system to be an additional strength of this study.</p><p>In order to address the IL-6 signaling pathway, the authors use core tendons from IL-6 knockout mice and progenitors from wild-type mice. The reasoning behind this approach was a little confusing... is IL-6 expressed solely in the tendon core compared to the extrinsic sheath? Furthermore, is a co-culture system for 7 days appropriate to model tendinopathy without the supplementation of exogenous inflammatory compounds? The transcriptomic differences in Figure 3 seem to be subtle, and may perhaps suggest that it could be a model that more closely resembles steady state compared to tendinopathy. If so, is IL-6 still relevant during steady state?</p><p>Nevertheless, the results presented in Figures 4 and 5 are impressive, demonstrating a link between IL-6 and fibroblast progenitor numbers and migration. Their experimental design in these figures show strong evidence, using Tocilizumab and recombinant IL-6 to rescue shown phenotypes. I would reduce the claims on proliferation, however, unless a proliferation-specific marker (e.g., Ki67, BrdU, EdU) is included in confocal analyses of Scx+ progenitors. The Achilles tendon injury model provides a nice in vivo confirmation of Scx-progenitor migration to the neotendon.</p><p>Given their goal to elucidate signaling pathways that could be targeted in the clinic, I think it would significantly strengthen the study if they could measure tendon healing in IL-6 knockouts or in wild-type mice treated with IL-6 inhibitors, since conventional ablation of IL-6 may lead to the elevation of compensatory IL-6 superfamily ligands that could activate STAT signaling. The authors claim that reducing IL-6 signaling decreases transcriptomic signatures of tendinopathy, but IL-6 may be necessary to promote normal healing of the tendon following injury. It is supposed that a lack of Scx+ progenitor migration would delay tendon healing.</p><p>Overall, the authors of this study elucidated IL-6 signaling in tendinopathy and provided a strong level of evidence to support their conclusions at the transcriptomic level. However, functional studies are needed to confirm these phenotypes and fully support their aims and conclusions. With these additional studies, this work has the potential to significantly influence treatments for those suffering from tendinopathy.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
