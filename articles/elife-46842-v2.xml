recently available, we present a cellular-automaton-based modeling framework focussing on high-level cell functions and their concerted effect on cellular migration patterns. Specifically, we formulate a coarse-grained description of cell polarity through self-regulated actin organization and its response to mechanical cues. Furthermore, we address the impact of cell adhesion on collective migration in cell cohorts. The model faithfully reproduces typical cell shapes and movements down to the level of single cells, yet allows for the efficient simulation of confluent tissues. In confined circular geometries, we find that specific properties of individual cells (polarizability; contractility) influence the emerging collective motion of small cell cohorts. Finally, we study the properties of expanding cellular monolayers (front morphology; stress and velocity distributions) at the level of extended tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computational biology</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd>tissue mechanics</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Excellence Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NanoSystems Initiative Munich (NIM)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frey</surname><given-names>Erwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 1032 (project B02)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frey</surname><given-names>Erwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate School of Quantitative Biosciences Munich (QBM)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goychuk</surname><given-names>Andriy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A computational model, based on single-cell features like contractility and polarizability, quantitatively describes cellular dynamics from the single cell level up to small cohorts and confluent tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell movements range from uncoordinated ruffling of cell boundaries to the migration of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>) to the collective motions of cohesive cell groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>). Single-cell migration enables cells to move towards and between tissue compartments – a process that plays an important role in the inflammation-induced migration of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedl and Weigelin, 2008</xref>). One can distinguish between amoeboid and mesenchymal migration, which are characterized by widely different cell morphologies and adhesive interactions with their respective environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lämmermann and Sixt, 2009</xref>). Cells may also form cohesive clusters and mobilize as a collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trepat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Angelini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doxzen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deforet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vedula et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marel et al., 2014</xref>). This last mode of cell migration is known to drive tissue remodelling during embryonic morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lecaudey and Gilmour, 2006</xref>) and wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poujade et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite this broad diversity of migration modes, there appears to be a general consensus that all require (to varying degrees) the following factors: (i) Cell polarization, cytoskeletal (re)organization, and force generation driven by the interplay between actin polymerization and contraction of acto-myosin networks. (ii) Cell-cell cohesion and coupling mediated by adherens-junction proteins which are coupled to the cytoskeleton. (iii) Guidance by chemical and physical signals. The basic functionalities implemented by these different factors confer on cells the ability to generate forces, adhere (differentially) to each other and to a substrate, and respond to mechanical and chemical signals. However, a fully mechanistic understanding of how these basic functionalities are integrated into single-cell migration and coordinated multicellular movement is still lacking.</p><p>Here, we present a computational model which enables us to study cell migration at various scales, and thus provides an integrative perspective on the basic cell functions that enable the emergence of collective cell migration. While a variety of very successful modeling approaches has been used to describe single-cell dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mogilner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marée et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marée et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziebert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ziebert and Aranson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Schwarz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goychuk et al., 2018</xref>) or the movements of extended tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Szabó et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szabó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabla, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sepúlveda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tarle et al., 2017</xref>), these models are hard to reconcile with each other. Models that focus on single cells are typically difficult to extend to larger cell numbers, largely due to their computational complexity. On the other hand, approaches which are designed to capture the dynamics at the scale of entire tissues generally adopt a rather coarse-grained point of view, and are therefore difficult to transfer to single cells or small cell cohorts. At present there are two partly competing and partly complementary approaches to bridge the gap between single-cell migration and collective dynamics, namely phase-field models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziebert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camley and Rappel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Löber et al., 2015</xref>), and cellular Potts models (CPMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szabó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabla, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szabó and Merks, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Oers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Segerer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Niculescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert and Schwarz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rens and Merks, 2017</xref>) first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graner and Glazier (1992)</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>A simple description of complex cells?</p></caption><p>Mammalian cells are made up of around <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>) in an aqueous compartment enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. A substantial fraction of these proteins is devoted to the structural support of the cell. The cytoskeletal systems that perform this function also mediate elastic deformations of the cell through stresses induced by motor proteins. Cell migration is enabled by transient, transmembrane attachment of the cytoskeleton to external structures (extracellular matrix or a substrate) via integrins, and regulated by various signaling pathways. To gain insights into such a complex system, we simplify these networks, each comprised of many interacting components, into coarse building blocks, which might seem arbitrary at first, but serve to qualitatively capture generic features of the underlying machinery. These generic and qualitative building blocks allow us to finally arrive at a quantitative description of cell dynamics.</p></boxed-text><p>Building on and generalizing the CPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>), we present a cellular automaton model that is designed to capture essential cellular features even in the context of the migration of single cells and of small sets of cells.

Our model reproduces the most pertinent features of cell migration even in the limiting case of solitary cells, and is compatible with a wealth of experimental evidence derived from both small cell groups and larger collectives made up of several thousand cells. Specifically, by studying the characteristics of single-cell trajectories and of small cell groups confined to circular territories, we demonstrate that persistency of movements is significantly affected by cell stiffness and cell polarizability. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of tissues in the context of a typical wound-healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poujade et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trepat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serra-Picamal et al., 2012</xref>), and show that the model exhibits the recurring mechanical waves observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serra-Picamal et al., 2012</xref>), a feature which we attribute to the coupling between cell-sheet expansion and cell-density-induced growth inhibition.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Computational model</title><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>Model geometry</title><p>We consider cells that adhere to a two-dimensional surface, spanned by the coordinates <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, through some contact area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In our computational model, we tesselate the available surface into a honeycomb lattice, where each hexagon corresponds to a discrete adhesion between the cell and the substrate. Then, protrusion and retraction events correspond to the gain and loss of hexagons at the boundary of the substrate contact area, respectively. The occurrence of these events is determined by a Monte Carlo scheme gradually minimizing an effective energy, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℋ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is associated with the cell configuration.

Cell-cell adhesions are indicated in red. (<bold>B</bold>) Cytoskeletal structures respond to external mechanical stimuli through reaction networks involving different feedback loops. We greatly simplify these complex processes into two prototypic feedback loops, which break detailed balance and drive cell migration, as follows. The polarization field induces membrane protrusions and inhibits retractions. In turn, protrusions increase the polarization field (positive feedback) and therefore the likelihood of further protrusive activity, while retractions decrease the polarization field (negative feedback). In the absence of mechanochemical signals, the polarization field approaches its rest state.

To investigate the effect of cell proliferation on tissue dynamics, we introduce a simplified three-state model of cell division. Cells start off in a quiescent state, in which their properties remain constant over time. The cell sizes fluctuate around an average value determined by the cell properties and the local tissue pressure. Cell growth typically arrests at large cell densities, in a phenomenon coined <italic>contact inhibition of proliferation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stoker and Rubin, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puliafito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavel et al., 2018</xref>). Since large cell densities correspond to a small spread area for each individual cell, this implies that cell growth is arrested below a critical threshold size (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). Upon exceeding this threshold size due to size fluctuations, cells leave the quiescent state and enter a growth state. The duration of the quiescent state is thus a random variable, whose average value depends on the tissue pressure, and lower pressure (due to a lower cell density) leads to a shorter quiescent state. During the subsequent deterministic growth state of duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, cells double all of their cellular material and thus double in size. We model this growth as a gradual decrease in the effective cell contractility (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>). As there is no a priori reason to assume that a cell’s migratory behavior should depend on its size, we constrain the parameters accordingly; this is described in detail in Appendix 2. After having grown for a duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, cells switch to a deterministic division state of duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. During division, cells strongly contract, which leads to mitotic rounding and a drastic decrease of their contact area with the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lock et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, a decrease of cell contact area could also lead to perturbations of the stress field in the monolayer. Here, however, we neglect the decrease of the cell spreading area, as the division phase is short compared to the growth phase. We expect that a drastic increase of cell contractility also leads to a loss of polarity in the cell’s migratory machinery. Therefore, each cell reduces its polarizability to zero (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) in order to utilize its cytoskeleton for the separation of the cellular material, leading to mitotic rounding. At the end of the division state, each dividing cell splits into two identical daughter cells, whose properties and parameters are identical to the mother cell’s initial values in the quiescent state. Finally, the daughter cells re-initialize migration from an unpolarized state.

As discussed in ‘Gripping the surface through the cell cytoskeleton’, the cell polarization field does not explicitly distinguish between a local extensibility (e.g. due to actin polymerization), a local contractility (due to myosin-induced contraction) of the cytoskeleton or spatially regulated cell-substrate adhesions. For example, if cell migration is driven by actin polymerization, then blebbistatin treatment will decrease the global cell contractility, which we predict to lead to more elongated cells that move faster and exhibit extended episodes of ballistic motion. Indeed, an increase of cell migration speed after blebbistatin treatment was observed for mouse hepatic stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, cell migration could also be driven by myosin contractility, for example by pulling the cell forward or by locally detaching adhesions. Then, polarizability and contractility concomitantly depend on the ability of the cell to exert forces, which can be inhibited by blebbistatin treatment. If polarizability, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf134"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and contractility, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf135"><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, are equally reduced by a blebbistatin-dependent prefactor, then the <italic>specific polarizability</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf136"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the resulting cell phenomenology should remain unchanged.

Therefore, blebbistatin treatment can either increase or decrease cell motility, depending on the cell type and possibly on the specific mechanism that drives cell migration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Migratory behavior of single cells as a function of the cell’s signaling radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf137"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> at different values for the maximal cytoskeletal polarity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf138"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title><p>(Stiffness parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf139"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.060</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf140"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.18</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; average polarization field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>225</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate dissipation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf142"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate adhesion penalty <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf143"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cytoskeletal update rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf144"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf145"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> independent simulations for each set of parameters). (<bold>A</bold>) The persistence times of directed migration of single cells exhibit a pronounced maximum at an optimal signaling radius, which depends on cell polarizability.

While highly persistent trajectories are observed for cells with ‘crescent’ shapes, more erratic cell motion is typically found for cells with more rounded outlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In other words, our computational model predicts that cells which are able to polarize their cytoskeletal structures more strongly will adopt crescent shapes and show a higher degree of persistent cell motion. It would be interesting to further test these predictions by using phenotypic variations in cell shapes like those reported in experiments with keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keren et al., 2008</xref>); there, the authors also found a correlation between cell shape and speed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Feedback range determines whether individual cells move persistently or rotate</title><p>Moreover, we investigated the influence of different signaling radii <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf148"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (typical range in which signalling molecules diffuse and mediate feedback mechanisms during a single Monte-Carlo step) on the persistence of single-cell trajectories. Since <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the relevant parameter that controls the spatial organization of lamellipodium formation, its value should strongly affect the statistics of a cell’s trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, at small values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we observe that the spatial coherence of cytoskeletal rearrangements is low, which frequently results in the disruption of ballistic motion due to the formation of independent lamellipodia in spatially separate sectors of the cell boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower snapshot). In contrast, at larger values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we find that spatial coherence is restored, and the formation of one extended lamellipodium across the cell’s leading edge maintains a distinct front-rear axis of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper snapshot). However, when the signaling radius is too large compared to the cell size, we find an inhibition of ballistic motion and rounding of the cells as signals originating from one cell edge begin to reach the opposing edge. This effect may also occur when cells in tissue become smaller due to an increase of cell density through proliferation or compression; in other words, this means that the cells become smaller than the typical length scale of the chemical patterns that control cell migration. Then, one would not expect these chemical patterns to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubatsch et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, depending on the cell polarizability (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf152"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), there is an optimal signaling radius that shows both maximal cell elongation and maximal cell persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>Cells with low polarizability need a large signaling radius to feed the positive feedback mechanism and to form a single large cell front. In contrast, highly polarizable cells can already sustain the positive feedback mechanism with a short signaling radius and easily form at least one (or even multiple competing) short cell front(s). With increasing signaling radius, these cell fronts become increasingly correlated and finally merge. Surprisingly, at small signaling radii, we observed that highly polarizable cells slow down with increasing signaling radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; yellow squares and black circles), in contrast to the behavior of cells with low polarizability. Furthermore, at large signaling radii, highly polarizable cells <italic>speed up</italic>, although their persistence time of directed migration has dropped to small values (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>; blue diamonds, green pentagons, yellow squares and black circles).

Furthermore, in a broad parameter regime, we find keratocyte-like motion and polarization along the short axis of the cell. Note that we do not consider the formation of stress fibers, which could lead to cell migration along the long axis in a broad parameter regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kassianidou et al., 2019</xref>). Such stress fibers could be modeled via a nematic field that represents the anisotropic part of the intracellular stress. Our counter-intuitive observation that cell migration along the long axis is faster than cell migration along the short axis can be explained as follows: If the cell migrates along its short axis, then it has to move a greater projected contour length than if it migrates along its long axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Considering that each protrusion takes roughly the same amount of time, migration along the long axis allows for greater cell speeds than migration along the short axis, because the cell has to spend less time to move a smaller projected contour length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the single cell rotations that occur at large signaling radii, we determined the average curvature of the trajectories <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">‖</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">‖</mml:mo><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf158"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the contour length along the corresponding trajectory.

Overall, we find that upon increasing the specific polarizability there is a marked transition from a quiescent state to a state where the cells are collectively moving. Below a threshold value for the specific polarizability (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf185"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mn>450</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the rotation speed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf186"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (purple curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) vanishes and the cells are immobile. In this regime, which we term the <italic>stagnation phase</italic>, or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf187"><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">𝒮</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-phase, cytoskeletal forces are too weak to initiate coherent cell rotation, and the system’s dynamics is dominated by relatively strong contractile forces, which tend to arrest the system in a ‘low energy’ configuration. Beyond this threshold, we identify three distinct phases of collective cell rotation. In the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf188"><mml:msub><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ℛ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>-phase, we find a steep increase in the average rotation speed and a local maximum in the fluctuations of both cell shape and rotation speed; cf. green (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf189"><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) and blue (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf190"><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Now, cytoskeletal forces are sufficiently large to establish actual membrane protrusions against the contractile forces, and cells begin to rotate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). However, the contractile forces still dominate, such that cellular interfaces tend to straighten out and lamellipodium formation is sustained only over finite lifetimes. Thus, due to the dominance of contractile forces, the systems frequently experience transient episodes of stagnation and repeatedly change their direction of rotation (cf. blue trajectory in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Phases of collective motion.</title><p>(<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf191"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-cell systems; confinement radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf192"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>30.6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; area stiffness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf193"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.18</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; average polarization field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf194"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>225</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; signaling radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf195"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; cytoskeletal update rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf196"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-cell adhesion <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf197"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-cell dissipation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf198"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate dissipation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf199"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate adhesion penalty <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf200"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf201"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf202"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf203"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>); 100 independent simulations for each set of parameters).

As the cells migrate into the cell-free space, we observe a strongly (spatially) heterogeneous decrease in the initially high and uniform cell density and mechanical pressure in the expanding monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This is quite distinct from the behavior of a homogeneous and ideally elastic thin sheet, which would simply show a homogeneous relaxation in density as it relaxes towards its rest state. Moreover, cell polarization and the ensuing active cell migration lead to inhomogeneously distributed traction stresses in the monolayer. After initial expansion of the monolayer, facilitated by high mechanical pressure, the cells at the monolayer edge begin to polarize outwards, which enhances outward front migration. These actively propagating cells exert traction on the trailing cells, and thereby yield a trailing region with negative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, this gives rise to a characteristic X-shaped pattern in the kymograph of the total mechanical stresses <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf355"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This profile closely resembles the first period of mechanical waves observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serra-Picamal et al., 2012</xref>). It illustrates how stress is transferred towards the center of the monolayer when cells are highly motile and collectively contribute to tissue expansion. At the end of the simulated time window, the cell density exhibited a minimum in the center of the sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is due to stretching of the central group of cells caused by the equally strong traction forces exerted by their migrating neighbors on both sides. Finally, the simulations also show that outward cell velocities increase approximately linearly with the distance from the center, confirming that in this configuration the entire cell sheet contributes to the monolayer expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To explore the possible range of tissue dynamics and expansion, we also investigated a qualitatively different parameter regime where cells are less densely packed and can also polarize less due to a narrower range of polarizability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Here, the expansion of the monolayer is mainly driven by cell division, and cells keep dividing until they reach a homeostatic cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Even though cells should typically exceed the threshold size and hence enter the growth phase at different times, we observe that the cell sheet exhibits periodic ‘bursts’ of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) coinciding with the total duration of a complete cell cycle (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf356"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>200</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> MCS) and alternating with cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These periodic ‘bursts’ can be explained as follows. Initially, the slightly compressed monolayer expands to relieve mechanical pressure. Due to this initial motion, the cells at the monolayer edge begin to polarize outwards. As in the previous case, where cell proliferation is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), the polarized cells enhance outward front migration and stretch the cells in the bulk of the cell sheet. For the same reasons as before, we observe a typical X-shaped stress pattern in the kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), albeit less pronounced due to the lower polarizability of the cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because a broad region in the monolayer bulk is stretched by the actively migrating cell fronts, these cells exceed the threshold size and begin growing approximately in phase. Once the mechanical pressure of the cell sheet is relieved, it will stop expanding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). However, cell growth and division once more lead to an increase in mechanical pressure (and cell density) in the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). This cycle of migration-dominated monolayer expansion and cell-density-dependent cell growth and division results in a periodic recurrence of the X-shaped stress pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), closely resembling the pattern observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serra-Picamal et al., 2012</xref>). On a sidenote, the synchronization of the cell division and cell migration phases by the deterministic portion of the cell cycle can be counteracted by introducing additional stochastic terms in the transition between the different phases of the cell cycle (cf. 'Cell proliferation and mitosis' in Appendix 1).</p><p>Note that the inhomogeneously distributed traction stresses in the monolayer, and its wave-like behavior, ultimately emerge from cell polarization and the ensuing active cell migration. Therefore, these traction patterns would look much less prominent if one were to inhibit cell motility (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigated which parameters control the roughness of the tissue fronts. We found that increasing cell motility, or increasing cell-cell dissipation leads to rougher front morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and ‘Velocity and roughness of spreading tissue’ in Appendix 2). Therefore, we hypothesized that one could observe <italic>fingering</italic> of cell monolayers by adjusting the parameters accordingly:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Increase of cell motility by decreasing the membrane stiffness and at the same time increasing polarizability and signaling radius of the cells.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase of cell-cell dissipation and slight decrease of cell-cell adhesion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Slower and less homogeneously distributed cell division by increasing the cell threshold size.</p></list-item></list><p>Indeed, we then observe a drastic roughening of the cell fronts and small cohorts of cells that coherently move into cell-free space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This roughening is more pronounced if we further increase the threshold size that a cell has to exceed to initiate growth (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,E</xref>). Analogously to our previous discussion, we observe that an increasing mechanical pressure in the monolayer due to the division of cells initiates outward cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,F</xref>). Then, cells in the tissue begin to polarize outwards and coordinate their motion with their neighboring cells, leading to small coordinated cell cohorts. As before, we also find distinct traction force patterns, as recurring waves of high stress travel backwards relative to the leading edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,G</xref>), and distinct recurring velocity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Expansion of a confluent epithelial cell sheet after removal of boundaries positioned at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf357"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>175</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for two different parameter settings that produce rough tissue fronts.</title><p>(Initially a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf358"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2500</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-cell system; stiffness parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf359"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf360"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.18</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; average polarization field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf361"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>35</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; maximum cell polarity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf362"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; signaling radius <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf363"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cytoskeletal update rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf364"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-cell adhesion <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf365"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-cell dissipation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf366"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate dissipation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf367"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; cell-substrate adhesion penalty <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf368"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; growth time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf369"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>180</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; division time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf370"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf371"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> independent simulations for each set of parameters).

The model implements a coarse-grained routine that captures the salient features of cytoskeletal remodeling processes on subcellular scales, while being computationally tractable enough to allow for the simulation of entire tissues containing up to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf382"><mml:mrow><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">𝒪</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> cells. We have used the model to study the transition from single-cell to cohort cell migration in terms of the interplay between the pertinent cellular functions. Specifically, we have demonstrated that our model consistently reproduces the dynamics and morphology of motile cells down to the level of solitary cells. Our studies also reveal that cytoskeletal forces (relative to cell contractility), as well as the spatial organization of the cells’ lamellipodia, significantly affect the statistics of cellular trajectories, both in the context of single-cell motion and in cohesive cell groups restricted to circular micropatterns. On larger scales, our simulation results suggest that the dynamics of expanding tissues strongly depends on the specific properties of the constituent cells. If monolayer expansion is driven by active cell migration throughout the tissue, then the cell sheet exhibits typical traction-force patterns and an X-shape in the corresponding kymograph. Additionally, a cell-density-dependent cell growth leads to a periodic recurrence of these traction-force patterns in a cycle of migration-dominated expansion and ’burst’-like cell proliferation.</p><p>Taken together, our results further highlight the intricacies of collective cell migration, which involves a multitude of intra- and inter-cellular signaling mechanisms operating at different scales in length and time. Establishing a comprehensive picture that incorporates and elucidates the mechanistic basis of these phenomena remains a pressing and challenging task. The multiscale modeling approach proposed here provides a direct link between subcellular processes and macroscopic dynamic observables, and might thus offer a viable route towards this goal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The computational model is described in section ‘Computational model’.

As will be detailed in the next section, to counteract these contractile forces, we explicitly model cytoskeletal structures within each cell, which provide outward pushing forces to balance cell contraction.</p></sec><sec id="s12-2"><title>Cytoskeletal structures and focal adhesion</title><p>The cytoskeleton plays key roles both in maintaining the mechanical integrity of the cell and in the process of active cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mogilner, 2009</xref>).

proliferation and mitosis</title><p>While cell proliferation and mitosis play no role in the experimental setup of rotating cell clusters, cell growth and division are observed experimentally in a setup where a sheet of cells expands into free space after removal of a stencil. Therefore, it is essential to include proliferation of cells in the numerical model. How this is done is described in this section.</p><p>We distinguish between two phases in the cell cycle, an <italic>interphase</italic> during which cells roughly double in volume and <italic>mitosis</italic>, the process of cell division. Even though a further partitioning of the interphase was considered in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Lowengrub, 2014</xref>), we do not expect that such a distinction is relevant for our results. In our computational framework cell growth may be implemented by progressively changing any cellular parameter that affects the cell’s equilibrium size. The two possible, largely equivalent choices are a successive reduction of the area coupling constant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf787"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> or an increase of the average cell polarization <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf788"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. We here employ the first method. We assume that individual cells grow exponentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barber et al., 2017</xref>) over a well-defined period <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf789"><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Additional variability in cell cycle length can be achieved by introducing an additional refractory phase with exponentially distributed waiting times and the average waiting time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf790"><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, which we set to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf791"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in this work. Moreover, we assume that the migratory behavior of a cell should not change significantly as it grows. However, as the cell grows in size by a factor of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf792"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, it also increases its perimeter and the corresponding energy cost for adding new membrane segments roughly by a factor of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf793"><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, as we do not scale the polarization field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf794"><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the resulting energy gains for protrusions during cell growth, we mitigate the increased cost for ruffling the membrane by reducing the perimeter stiffness by a factor of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf795"><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>. The quantitative viability of this approach is further discussed in section ‘Single cell size’.</p><p>To prevent tissue overgrowth, cell proliferation is generally contact inhibited in healthy cells: When the tissue approaches a state where each cell has formed adhesive contacts with the substrate and is completely surrounded by neighbours, cells stop proliferating. In addition, it has been proposed that the pressure or local density in the tissue has a negative impact on the local growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shraiman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranft et al., 2010</xref>). To account for these phenomena in the model, we complement the two cell cycle periods interphase and mitosis by a quiescent cell state during which cell growth is halted. The parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf796"><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf797"><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are, therefore, kept constant for a quiescent cell; we denote the corresponding values as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf798"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf799"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. There are many possible ways to implement contact inhibition in our computational model. For example, it could be implemented by allowing a quiescent cell to enter the cell cycle triggered by low local cell density, or when a sufficiently large fraction of its membrane length is not in contact with neighbour cells but exposed to free space. In our model it proves numerically advantageous to make a quiescent cell enter the interphase when its area succeeds a certain reference area. We choose this area threshold as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf800"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>T</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ref</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where the factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf801"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">𝒪</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> relates the threshold size to the equilibrium cell size <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf802"><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ref</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> reached by a free, solitary cell with constant polarization field <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf803"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Cells living in a densely packed environment will not exceed the area threshold due to the pressure exerted on them by neighboring cells and can, therefore, not grow. Conversely, cells exposed to free space are more likely to reach this threshold and proliferate. Finally, a growing cell in interphase becomes mitotic after the growth time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf804"><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> has passed, at which point cell size has roughly doubled with respect to the size in the quiescent period. We assume that cell migration and mitosis are processes that exclude each other. Hence, the positive feedback leading to persistent cell migration is switched off for mitotic cells and the polarization field relaxes to the neutral state <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf805"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ20">Equation S13c</xref>.</p><p>There appears to be no universal set of rules which determine the orientation of the cleavage plane along which cells divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minc and Piel, 2012</xref>). Rather, for epithelial tissues there are a variety of factors which include local cell geometry and the direction of stress in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson and Gibson, 2009</xref>). Though it is in principle possible to implement any given rule in our computational model, in its present version the axis along which a cell divides is chosen as a random direction through the geometric center of the cell. In case of irregular cell shapes, a separation of the cellular domain into more than two connected components can occur. To prevent violation of topological constraints, in this case the two largest components are considered as descendant cells and the residual grid sites are filled by substrate.</p><p>We explicitly account for the finite duration of the mitotic phase <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf806"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> by keeping the cells in a mitotic state for the aforementioned time period, until the final instantaneous splitting of the cellular domains. After cell division, persistent cell migration of the daughter cells is enabled again. The descendent cells will subsequently re-enter the growing phase if their area exceeds the defined threshold, as mentioned above.</p><p>The following list summarizes the steps motivated and explained in the previous paragraphs.

While the smaller cell has a perimeter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf867"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mtext>ref</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, neglecting geometric effects the larger cell has a larger perimeter of approximately <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf868"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msqrt><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ref</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Hence, the larger cell has to pay a larger energy cost (roughly by a factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf869"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) to ruffle its membrane by adding segments and therefore increasing its perimeter.

Due to the increased energy cost for adding membrane segments, larger cells finds find it more difficult to polarize, and are therefore rounder, slower and less persistent.</p><p>To offset this increased energy cost for adding membrane segments to the cell, one can scale the perimeter stiffness of the larger cell to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf872"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf873"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mtext>cst</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

While the proposed data collapse for the persistence time of directed migration of a cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1D</xref>) is somewhat unsatisfactory, this may be owed to the following effect: by keeping <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf879"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> constant we have actually varied the ratio between the area that the signaling molecules typically explore due to diffusion and the area of the cell, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf880"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

This can be illustrated as follows: Consider a situation where the cell conquers a new hexagon at its prospective leading edge. Because the cell on average tends to constrain its area and perimeter while migrating, it consequently needs to lose a different hexagon at its prospective trailing edge. However, this retraction at the trailing edge is energetically penalized and thus cell displacement from its initial position and the positive feedback leading to cell polarization are effectively inhibited. With increasing cell-substrate dissipation, retraction events are further penalized and the cell ’sticks’ to the substrate at its trailing edge, preventing persistent motion of the cell. Additionally, to further illustrate the correlation between cell shape and cell migration, we have replotted the values of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C and E-G</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and H</xref>, respectively).

However, the single cell part lacks comparison with real data and proposal for experimental check of falsifiable predictions. The multi-cellular aspect was unanimously found more interesting/novel, but much less developed.

Essentially the authors introduce a more complicated version of the cellular Potts model (CPM) to study individual and collective cell motility. The original CPM had several clear deficiencies involving the lack of active cytoskeleton-based driving and the insufficient treatment of adhesion. There have been some remedies for these deficiencies already published but on the whole the model proposed here seems to be a good step forward.</p><p>But I do not see sufficient scientific findings that have emerged so far from this new model to warrant acceptance of this paper for <italic>eLife</italic>. The results on single cell motion are not actually compared to any data, for example to keratocyte shapes versus parameters as available from the Theriot lab. Also, although the authors claim that at small R there is a lack of coherence of active protrusion across the cell front (Figure 3D), when this happens in actual cells such as <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> we see much more pronounced stochasticity involving pseudopods of a characteristic scale; as far as I can tell this does not happen in this model. The fact that cells exhibit persistent random walks with correlation times that depend on various parameters is hardly surprising. Other issues regarding single cell motion, such as guidance in the presence of gradients either chemical or mechanical are not presented at all.</p><p>Again, I saw nothing strikingly different from previous results for rotating clusters and again no comparison to any experimental data. The model seems to make reasonable predictions but this is not enough for acceptance given the previously published work on this situation.</p><p>For tissues the case is somewhat better. Some of the ideas and results here recapitulate what has been seen in other models; this holds for example for the density structure of the population, which in this paper is based on a division rule that directly mimics those used in earlier works. Other aspects appear more novel, such as the reproduction of some the findings regarding wave-like behavior in expanding tissues. But again, this agreement stays at the purely qualitative level, leaving the reader with no specific predictions which could be used to test the validity of the proposed mechanism.</p><p>Finally, it was almost impossible to understand the presentation of the model in the main text, with all sorts of symbols and rules appearing out of nowhere. The appendix remedies this problem, but it would almost be better to just describe the pieces qualitatively in the main text instead of undertaking a valiant but in the end failed attempt to include some detailed formulas. In passing, Figure 1 seems to be missing some subfigures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript features a coarse-grained description of cell and tissue migration based on the generalization of the cellular Potts model. I think the work contains enough new results to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, prior to the publication, the following points need to be addressed. My main concern is that the potential of the computational model is not fully explored.</p><p>1) Computational model. The description of the model is rather comprehensive and clear. However, it is necessary to highlight the differences between the current model and earlier CPM approaches to cell motility, e.g. in Kabla, 2012, Doxzen et al., 2013. What is the main difference that enables bridging the single-cell and collective dynamics?</p><p>2) Single cell migration. The computational model demonstrates that the cells can polarize and adopt a crescent shape. However, recent experimental studies predicted a phenotype change for the same cell line: a transition from migration to rotation: (i) Lou et al., 2015. (ii) Raynaud F. et al., 2016. This transition was captured in the framework of the phase-field model for slightly higher rates of actin polymerization, Reeves et al., 2018. I am wondering if the CPM model can also capture this transition for stronger driving parameters.</p><p>3) The tissue level dynamics. This part of the work is possibly the most innovative and crucial. However, exploration of the tissue dynamics in this section is rather brief. Certainly, the reproduction of the X-pattern is interesting. But many other relevant phenomena can be easily investigated with this method, e.g. instability of the growing front of the cells. Many experiments show that in the course of wound healing, the cell front exhibits a sort of fingering instability. Is this phenomenon captured by the model or the front always remains flat? Another interesting issues are the change of topology and stress distribution at the onset of confluence, and how the number of neighbors changes in the process of cell migration. The CPM model can be contrasted for example to active vertex model where the topological changes are not allowed, DL Barton, S Henkes, CJ Weijer, R Sknepnek, PLoS computational biology 13 (6), e1005569.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bridging the gap between single-cell migration and collective dynamics&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers found the paper much improved, in particular regarding the way the model is explained and justified. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>– The model for cell division (subsection “Tissue growth by cell division”) should be justified better. Division is said to occur stochastically when the cell size reaches a threshold. Here, the size refers to the spread area, not to the cell volume. Why should division be triggered by an increase of spread area. Single cells actually round up and detach from the substrate before dividing. Are there experimental indications that cell division in an epithelium is triggered by an increase of cell area?</p><p>– Blebbistatin is claimed not to affect cell shape of speed (subsection “Cell persistence increases with polarizability”), which is explained by it affecting polarizability and contractility to the same extent. This argument is not entirely convincing. First, it is not clear why blebbinstatin should reduce protrusive force due to actin polarisation. One could make the counter argument that myosin contraction reduce protrusion forces by increasing actin retrograde flow, and blebbistatin-treated cells are often seen to spread faster than intreated cells. Second, the effect of blebbistatin on single cell motility is very diverse, and highly depend on the cell type. Both enhancement and decrease of the migration speed are reported in the literature. This paragraph should not give the feeling that the effect of blebbistatin on motility is universal.</p><p>– Regarding the correlation between cell shape and speed (subsection “Cell persistence increases with polarizability”), the model seems apt to capture the behaviour of keratocyte (fast and crescent shaped), but many cell types are actually elongated in the direction of their motion. The is presumably due to polarised protrusion forces along the direction of motion with slow cell detachment at the back. While one can hardly expect a single model to capture all phenotypes, could the author speculate and comment why their model is more appropriate for the crescent-shape phenotype.</p><p>– Figure 3F suggest two possible correlation between cell shape and direction of motion: the crescent shape, where cell is elongated perpendicular to its direction of motion, and a cell aligned with the direction of motion. This is not discussed in the text, which is unfortunate. What factor determines in which situation the system is, and how does this affect speed and persistence?</p><p>– The discussion of tissue level dynamics uncovers several regimes of growth: i.e. driven by the motility of the cells at the tissues edge, or by cell division. It would be interesting to discuss the extent to which these two regimes could be obtained from a continuous model with an effective viscosity (cf. Appendix 1—figure 3) and a driving force due to motility at the edge or a pressure coming from cell division. Such an effective continuous model should be attempted and compared to the numerical results. For instance, judging from Figure 5, the cell front expands almost linearly in time for motility driven, and may be quadratically in division driven. Could such law be discussed and obtained from simple continuous models?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46842.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes a Cellular Potts Model for single and collective cell migration.</p><p>Single cell motility reproduces the crescent shape of keratocyte-like crawling cells and gives prediction regarding cell size and polarisation.</p><p>At the multicellular level, the model reproduces collective rotation of cells confined in circular domains.

Cells are complex active objects with interacting mechanical and chemical regulatory components. These regulatory networks, which can be represented by reaction-diffusion systems, are themselves quite complicated. We chose to reduce the complexity by designing a coarse-grained model that captures some (but probably not all the relevant) general features of these reaction-diffusion networks – for instance, positive feedback, pattern size scales, and signaling ranges. The advantage of this modeling approach is that it enables us to identify which of these (Abstract) features are actually crucial for cell migration. Moreover, at present, the detailed knowledge of the molecular processes required for a more refined model seems out of reach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparison with experiments remains qualitative at best, or even anecdotal. For instance, the recent shape of single migrating cell is universally obtained from a number of models.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that our results go far beyond the emergence of crescent-shaped solitary cells (whose universal appearance is interesting in its own right, as discussed below):</p><p>1) In the revised section “Cell persistence increases with polarizability”, we now show that there is a correlation between the elongated shape of solitary cells and their persistent migratory behavior. Then, we investigate how these two phenomena depend on parameters like perimeter stiffness, which models actin cortex contractility. We now compare key features of our numerical simulations with experiments on blebbistatin treated keratocytes (Wilson et al., 2010, from the Theriot lab) and keratocyte fragments (Ofer et al., 2011), and recover the following essential trends:</p><p>“Then, polarizability and contractility concomitantly depend on the ability of the cell to exert forces, which can be inhibited by blebbistatin treatment. […] Indeed, blebbistatin treatment of keratocytes and keratocyte fragments was reported not to affect cell shape and speed to any significant degree (Wilson et al., 2010; Ofer et al., 2011).”</p><p>2) Furthermore, it has recently come to our attention that single keratocytes in an open space can also exhibit circular motion; see e.g. https://doi.org/10.1101/443408. Our model (like some others) also reproduces this migratory mode, as we now show in the revised section entitled “Feedback range determines whether individual cells move persistently or rotate”.</p><p>3) It is noteworthy that these various observations are all derived from a coarse-grained model that neither depends on, nor attempts to implement, specifics. Here, cell migration arises from a positive feedback loop that drives both membrane protrusions and retractions. Therefore, we expect that a broad class of models in which a positive feedback drives migration should show qualitatively similar behavior. This might explain why a number of models universally yield similar cell shapes. This is now discussed in the new section “Active self-regulation of the cytoskeleton”.</p><p>4) Beyond our single-cell results, our computational model also faithfully reproduces a number of key features of collective cell behavior, including collective rotations of cell clusters in confined geometries (see the section “Cell clusters on circular micropatterns”) and typical stress patterns in expanding tissues (section “Tissue-level dynamics”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, they predict that cell must be large enough to polarise and move persistently, which is highly non-trivial (may be even counter-intuitive?) and could be a crucial test of the model as compared to others, but is not discussed further.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss this feature in the revised section “Feedback range determines whether individual cells move persistently or rotate”.

To the best of our knowledge, this effect also compares well to experimental results, where cell motility decreases rapidly as the cell density in a tissue rises.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think going beyond these limitations would probably require quite a bit of additional work.

In these experimental studies, the authors argue that blebbistatin treatment of keratocytes and keratocyte fragments has only marginal effects on cell shape and cell speed. In our computational model, blebbistatin treatment would be equivalent to adjusting two model parameters: (1) cell polarizability due to a decrease in the force that a cell can exert on the substrate, and (2) perimeter stiffness due to a decrease of cell contractility. If both cell polarizability and cell contractility have the same functional dependence on myosin activity, then the ratio between polarizability and contractility should remain constant, and our model predicts that neither cell motility nor cell shape will be significantly affected for keratocyte-like cells, which is consistent with the results of both experimental studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, although the authors claim that at small R there is a lack of coherence of active protrusion across the cell front (Figure 3-D), when this happens in actual cells such as Dictyostelium we see much more pronounced stochasticity involving pseudopods of a characteristic scale; as far as I can tell this does not happen in this model.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3—video 1 shows that cells with low signaling radius and high polarizability can form pseudopods and move much more randomly (i.e. at high cell speed and with low cell persistence).

The description of the model is rather comprehensive and clear. However, it is necessary to highlight the differences between the current model and earlier CPM approaches to cell motility, e.g. in Kabla, 2012; Doxzen et al., 2013. What is the main difference that enables bridging the single-cell and collective dynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these kind remarks. We have improved Figure 1 to better describe our model. Furthermore, in the revised section on “Active self-regulation of the cytoskeleton”, we now compare our approach to other methods. The basic ingredients of our model (mechanical constraints, together with mechanochemical feedback loops) are similar to those of other models and yield similar phenomenology. What enables us to bridge the scales and investigate large tissues in our model is its simplicity and low computational cost, which scales linearly with cell size and number of cells.</p><p>Other CPM approaches to cell motility have implemented a polarization vector that drives the migration of cells. Such approaches typically reproduce cell migration but cannot account for the formation of multiple competing lamellopodia/pseudopods, which would imply a spatially dependent polarization vector field, or, in our case, a scalar field with gradients. We now discuss this point in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Cell migration couples to a single polarity vector (Albert et al., 2016), if propulsive forces are distributed homogeneously throughout the cell. However, this simplification of the former two cases cannot account for the formation of multiple competing lamellopodia/pseudopods.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Single cell migration. The computational model demonstrates that the cells can polarize and adopt a crescent shape. However, recent experimental studies predicted a phenotype change for the same cell line: a transition from migration to rotation: (i) Lou et al., 2015. (ii) Raynaud et al., 2016. This transition was captured in the framework of the phase-field model for slightly higher rates of actin polymerization, Reeves et al., 2018. I am wondering if the CPM model can also capture this transition for stronger driving parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that keratocytes can also perform rotations. This is indeed very interesting. Our model predicts such a transition from persistent migration to persistent rotations of single cells: see Figure 2—video 1. We observe rotations when the signaling radius is increased. Note that a larger range of mechanochemical feedback is akin to the stronger driving parameters mentioned by the Reviewer. We explain this observation as follows: For high signaling radii (and cells polarizing along their short axis) signaling from the leading and trailing edges results in mutual interference. Therefore, the cell repeatedly adjusts its polarization axis slightly, which leads to rotations. In the revised paper, we have now discussed this feature in section entitled “Feedback range determines whether individual cells move persistently or rotate”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The tissue level dynamics. This part of the work is possibly the most innovative and crucial. However, exploration of the tissue dynamics in this section is rather brief. Certainly, the reproduction of the X-pattern is interesting. But many other relevant phenomena can be easily investigated with this method, e.g. instability of the growing front of the cells. Many experiments show that in the course of wound healing, the cell front exhibits a sort of fingering instability. Is this phenomenon captured by the model or the front always remains flat?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Indeed, as now discussed in the revised section on “Tissue-level dynamics”, the model can reproduce rougher cell fronts and small cohorts of cells that coherently move into cell-free space, while retaining back-propagating stress waves at the edges of the monolayer and distinct traction force patterns (see Figure 6 and Figure 6—videos 1 and 2). We observe that an increasing mechanical pressure in the monolayer due to the division of cells initiates outward cell migration. Then, cells in the tissue begin to polarize outwards and coordinate their motion with their neighbors, leading to the formation of small coordinated cell cohorts.</p><p>To arrive at the corresponding parameter values, we proceeded as follows. We observed that one can slightly increase front roughness if cell polarizability and therefore cell motility is high or if cell-cell dissipation is large (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Based on that, we hypothesized that one should observe ‘fingering’ if the parameters are adjusted accordingly, compared to the original parameters used in the wound-healing assay with cell proliferation:</p><p>- “Increase of cell motility by decreasing the membrane stiffness and at the same time increasing polarizability and signaling radius of the cells.”</p><p>- “Increase of cell-cell dissipation and slight decrease of cell-cell adhesion.”</p><p>- “Slower and less homogeneously distributed cell division by increasing the cell threshold size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another interesting issues are the change of topology and stress distribution at the onset of confluence, and how the number of neighbors changes in the process of cell migration. The CPM model can be contrasted for example to active vertex model where the topological changes are not allowed, DL Barton, S Henkes, CJ Weijer, R Sknepnek, PLoS computational biology 13 (6), e1005569.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In fact, our generalized CPM model is able to model that situation as well. However, it seems to us that this goes beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers found the paper much improved, in particular regarding the way the model is explained and justified. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>– The model for cell division (subsection “Tissue growth by cell division”) should be justified better. Division is said to occur stochastically when the cell size reaches a threshold. Here, the size refers to the spread area, not to the cell volume. Why should division be triggered by an increase of spread area. Single cells actually round up and detach from the substrate before dividing. Are there experimental indications that cell division in an epithelium is triggered by an increase of cell area?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ comments, we have clarified and improved on the description of the cell division model in the revised manuscript.</p><p>From an experimental perspective, it has been observed in multiple studies (Stoker &amp; Rubin, 1967; Pavel et al., 2018, Puliafito, 2012) that cell growth is inhibited by a large cell density, which was coined contact inhibition of proliferation. A large cell density implies that each individual cell has a small spread area. Therefore, we assume that a cell must exceed a certain threshold size to grow. Below this threshold size, cell growth is inhibited (as in our model).</p><p>As the reviewers have remarked, in our model we refer to the cell spread area and not to the cell volume. However, in a cell monolayer, an increase in cell volume (mass) due to cell growth should also lead to an increase of cell spread area as the cell not only further expresses additional integrins but also tries to keep the same thickness as the monolayer.</p><p>In experiments, cells round up and decrease the substrate contact area before division, while still maintaining some substrate adhesions (Lock et al., 2018). Furthermore, it was shown that adhesion complex area increases during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, and then decreases during the G2 phase (Jones et al., 2018). We model cell rounding during cell division (after the initial growth phase) via a depolarization of the cells, assuming that cell division and cell migration are mutually exclusive cell behaviours. Instead of a depolarization, one could also assume a drastic increase of cell contractility (at the cost of an additional parameter), which in addition to cell rounding would also lead to cell detachment from the substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Blebbistatin is claimed not to affect cell shape of speed (subsection “Cell persistence increases with polarizability”), which is explained by it affecting polarizability and contractility to the same extent. This argument is not entirely convincing. First, it is not clear why blebbinstatin should reduce protrusive force due to actin polarisation. One could make the counter argument that myosin contraction reduce protrusion forces by increasing actin retrograde flow, and blebbistatin-treated cells are often seen to spread faster than intreated cells. Second, the effect of blebbistatin on single cell motility is very diverse, and highly depend on the cell type. Both enhancement and decrease of the migration speed are reported in the literature. This paragraph should not give the feeling that the effect of blebbistatin on motility is universal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their critique and apologize for having missed some of the literature. Indeed, in (Liu et al., 2010) it was also shown that blebbistatin can increase cell speed. To clarify this point, we have improved our explanation on how blebbistatin might affect cell polarizability:</p><p>In our model, the area and perimeter stiffnesses refer to a global and homogeneous contractility of the cell, while the cell polarization field ∈ drives cell migration. Here, the cell polarisation field does not explicitly distinguish between a local extensibility (e.g. due to actin polymerisation), a local contractility (due to myosin contraction) of the cytoskeleton or spatially regulated cell-substrate adhesions. For example, if cell migration is driven by actin polymerization, then blebbistatin treatment will increase protrusion forces by decreasing the retrograde flow. However, if cell migration is driven by myosin contractility, for example by pulling the cell forward or by locally detaching adhesions, then blebbistatin treatment would also decrease cell polarizability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding the correlation between cell shape and speed (subsection “Cell persistence increases with polarizability”), the model seems apt to capture the behaviour of keratocyte (fast and crescent shaped), but many cell types are actually elongated in the direction of their motion. The is presumably due to polarised protrusion forces along the direction of motion with slow cell detachment at the back. While one can hardly expect a single model to capture all phenotypes, could the author speculate and comment why their model is more appropriate for the crescent-shape phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now briefly discussed this in footnote 2 in the revised manuscript. In our model, we have implemented a scalar field ∈ that regulates cell migration, and which corresponds to an isotropic stress field. This model shows the tendency to produce keratocyte-shaped migrating cells. This migratory phenomenology corresponds to a persistently migrating force monopole. In (Goychuk et al., 2018), we have shown that a compliant substrate can lead to a transition to an anisotropic force dipole, where the cell is greatly elongated. A similar effect could be achieved by explicitly considering the local orientation of the cytoskeleton. Then, we would have to introduce a nematic field which represents the local orientation of stress fibres (Kassianidou et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3F suggest two possible correlation between cell shape and direction of motion: the crescent shape, where cell is elongated perpendicular to its direction of motion, and a cell aligned with the direction of motion. This is not discussed in the text, which is unfortunate. What factor determines in which situation the system is, and how does this affect speed and persistence?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for picking up that we have not discussed Figure 3F in sufficient detail. We have amended this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discussion of tissue level dynamics uncovers several regimes of growth: i.e driven by the motility of the cells at the tissues edge, or by cell division. It would be interesting to discuss the extent to which these two regimes could be obtained from a continuous model with an effective viscosity (cf. Appendix 1—figure 3) and a driving force due to motility at the edge or a pressure coming from cell division. Such an effective continuous model should be attempted, and compared to the numerical results. For instance, judging from Figure 5, the cell front expands almost linearly in time for motility driven, and may be quadratically in division driven. Could such law be discussed and obtained from simple continuous models?</p></disp-quote><p>It would indeed be very interesting to reduce our model to an 2D or even 1D model (neglecting shear viscosity) of a compressible active fluid. However, such an endeavour would ultimately require the derivation, implementation and the study of a compressible hydrodynamic model with proliferation. This is significantly beyond the scope of the present manuscript. We speculate that such a model would show the following behaviour. If we suppose that all cells in the monolayer divide, then the total amount of cells should grow exponentially. However, the expansion of the cell front will ultimately be limited by the migration speed of the front cells, which will lead to an increase of cell density over time. Due to contact inhibition of proliferation, such an increase of cell density will lead to an arrest of cell divisions and to a stagnating proliferative ‘pressure’. Therefore, we expect the monolayer expansion velocity to reach a plateau at high cell densities. At low cell densities, the cell speed should increase with time due to feedback mechanisms in the cell polarization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
