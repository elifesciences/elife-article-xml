from immune checkpoint inhibitors. This may be partly due to the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that forms a barrier for T cells. Comparing five preclinical mouse tumor models with heterogeneous tumor microenvironments, we aimed to relate the rate of tumor stiffening with the remodeling of ECM architecture and to determine how these features affect intratumoral T cell migration. An ECM-targeted strategy, based on the inhibition of lysyl oxidase, was used. In vivo stiffness measurements were found to be strongly correlated with tumor growth and ECM crosslinking but negatively correlated with T cell migration. Interfering with collagen stabilization reduces ECM content and tumor stiffness leading to improved T cell migration and increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade. This study highlights the rationale of mechanical characterizations in solid tumors to understand resistance to immunotherapy and of combining treatment strategies targeting the ECM with anti-PD-1 therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>stiffness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EL2020.LNCC/EmD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolas-Boluda</surname><given-names>Alba</given-names></name><name><surname>Vimeux</surname><given-names>Lene</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrin</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Kantari-Mimoun</surname><given-names>Chahrazade</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnadieu</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program HTE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolas-Boluda</surname><given-names>Alba</given-names></name><name><surname>Vimeux</surname><given-names>Lene</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrin</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Kantari-Mimoun</surname><given-names>Chahrazade</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnadieu</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>685795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gazeau</surname><given-names>Florence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-IDEX-0004-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaquero</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202003010517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fouassier</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tumor stiffness blocks T cell migration in tumors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last decade, significant progress has been made in the development of T-cell-based immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller and Sadelain, 2015</xref>). The two main T-cell-based immunotherapies are adoptive T cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies blocking the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death one receptor (PD-1) have quickly gone from proof of concepts to FDA-approved first- and second-line treatments for a significant number of tumors even in late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callahan et al., 2016</xref>). However, an elevated percentage of patients with solid tumors fail to respond to these therapies. The mechanisms underlying the poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are still uncertain; nevertheless, recent results suggest that T cell function and distribution in the tumor are affected by numerous immunosuppressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). It is well established that in progressing tumors T cells exhibit a particular phenotype unable to normally respond to tumor antigens. In addition, in a large proportion of tumors, T lymphocytes are excluded from the tumor cell regions in a so-called ‘excluded-immune profile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hegde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herbst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joyce and Fearon, 2015</xref>). Ineffective T cell migration and penetration into the tumor mass might represent an important obstacle to T cell-based immunotherapies. As a support for this notion, various clinical studies have shown that tumors enriched in T cells are more susceptible to be controlled by PD-1 blockade. In contrast, tumors with so-called immune-excluded profiles, in which T cells are present within tumors but not in contact with malignant cells, are refractory to PD-1 blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herbst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>). Particularly, the fibrotic state of desmoplastic tumors can cause immunosuppression through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turley et al., 2015</xref>). The hypothesis of physical resistance to T cell infiltration and migration-related to the heterogeneity and aberrant organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) with respect to the tumor nests has emerged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickup et al., 2014</xref>). By using dynamic imaging microscopy, we highlighted the detrimental impact of collagen fibrils architecture on the migratory behavior of T cells in fresh human tumor explants. Both a guiding strategy combined with a physical hindrance process has been shown to restrain T cells from contacting tumor cells, thus leading to the T cell excluded profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salmon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peranzoni et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, a dense fibrotic stroma could raise physical obstacles to immune cell infiltration similar to the previously established stromal resistance to chemotherapeutics, antibodies, nanoparticles, or virus tumor penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Netti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stylianopoulos et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, cellular components of tumor-associated fibrosis, particularly the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), can have both direct and indirect effects on T cell infiltration and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turley et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, one important challenge in the field is to develop strategies targeting tumor fibrosis in order to reverse immune exclusion and to improve T cell-based immunotherapy. Recent studies have been undertaken with this objective. T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor together with heparanase, an ECM-degrading enzyme, show enhanced infiltration into xenografted tumors as well as anti-tumor efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caruana et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a major role for the TGFβ signaling pathway in promoting T cell exclusion from tumor cells has been demonstrated. In breast and colorectal mouse tumor models, neutralizing antibodies against TGFβ were shown to reduce collagen I production, overcoming the T cell excluded profile and increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>). In cholangiocarcinoma, an immune mesenchymal subtype has been identified, which is associated with TGFβ signature and poor tumor-infiltrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Job et al., 2020</xref>). Other axes including the CXCR4/CXCL12 in breast metastasis and the focal adhesion kinase in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have also been associated with both desmoplasia and absence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in tumors from mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, the inhibition of these axes in preclinical mouse cancer models was shown to reduce fibrosis while significantly increasing T cell infiltration and improving response to checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Incio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical trials testing such combination are currently ongoing in advanced pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, urothelial carcinoma, and other malignancies (NCT02546531, NCT02758587, NCT02734160, NCT04064190, and NCT02947165).</p><p>However, due to patient and tumor heterogeneity, there is no clear indication of how the T cell distribution in tumors is related to the fibrosis level and to the different architectures of ECM. Thus, there is an urgent need to assist in matching combination approaches to patient populations who could benefit from stromal modulation strategies to improve their response to immunotherapy. Companion matrix-derived biomarkers and imaging approaches should provide insights into the contribution of ECM remodeling in shaping the immune milieu of the tumor. Particularly, a critical determinant of fibrotic tumor progression – the tumor mechanics – has been poorly investigated through the prism of immune impact. An important feature of fibrotic tumors is their considerable higher stiffness compared to their neighboring healthy tissues, which are highly correlated with cancer progression and metastasis, particularly in breast, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venkatesh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samani et al., 2007</xref>). The use of non-invasive imaging techniques such as shear wave elastography (SWE) and magnetic resonance elastography, designed to monitor stiffness of any given tissue, allows an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic and characterization of malignant lesions in vivo with prognostic significance, for instance in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riegler et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the extensive remodeling of the stromal components which increase tumor stiffness can mechanically activate intracellular signaling pathways that promote tumor progression and at the same time can dampen T cell functions including migration and infiltration into tumor islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datar and Schalper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krebs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 2017</xref>). However, there is a lack of studies correlating the mechanical properties of tumors to their heterogeneous ECM architecture and T cell infiltration capacity. Here we aim at filling this gap through a comprehensive investigation of stiffness evolution in several preclinical mouse models of pancreatic, breast, and bile duct carcinomas, presenting different ECM organizations, coupled with dynamic imaging of fresh tumor slices to monitor T cell motility. In concert with these imaging biomarkers of both mechanical properties, ECM architecture, and T cell migration, we explored the consequences of altering the ECM by inhibition of the lysyl oxidase (LOX), a copper-dependent enzyme responsible for the crosslinking of collagen molecules into fibers that has been seen to be overexpressed in many metastatic tumors and responsible for malignant progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2016</xref>). We highlight that LOX inhibition has different mechanical modulating effects depending on the ECM architecture, with significant improvement in T cell mobility. Despite minor effects in primary tumor growth upon LOX inhibition or PD-1 blockade treatment alone, their combination increases effector CD8 T cell accumulation in tumors and significantly delays tumor progression in a pancreatic cancer model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relationship between tumor structure and tumor mechanical properties in different preclinical carcinoma mouse models</title><p>One key aspect when testing immunotherapeutic agents is the use of relevant preclinical models that closely mimic the properties of human solid tumors. Human carcinomas derive from epithelial cells and therefore harbor a typical though heterogeneous structure with tumor cells forming compact islets or nests surrounded by the stroma, enriched in ECM proteins, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and immune cells. To unravel the relationship between tumor growth, ECM remodeling, stiffening, and immune infiltration, we characterized the tumor structure and the mechanical properties of five different preclinical models, recapitulating the structural heterogeneity of different carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>): a subcutaneous model of cholangiocarcinoma (EGI-1), a subcutaneous (MET-1) and a transgenic model (MMTV-PyMT) of mouse breast carcinoma, and an orthotopic (mPDAC) and a subcutaneous (KPC) model of mouse PDAC. A multiscale evaluation of the mechanical properties of the tumors was performed. At the macroscale, we measured tumor stiffness during tumor growth using SWE, a non-invasive imaging technique that allows the quantification and mapping of tumor stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The presence of very stiff regions, defined as areas with an elastic modulus &gt; 40 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marangon et al., 2017</xref>), in the tumor was quantified together with the average stiffness of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). At the micron-scale, we evaluated tumor organization and fibrosis using hematoxylin–eosin–Safran (HES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and Sirius Red staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Sirius Red is a highly specific stain for collagen fibers that combined with polarizing microscopy allows differentiating thin collagen fibrils from thick and densely packed collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rittié, 2017</xref>). Under polarized light, thin fibers show a greenish-yellow birefringence, whilst thicker and densely packed fibers give an orange-red birefringence. By separating these two colors, it is possible to quantify the amount of thick and densely packed fibers present in the tumor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

The stiffness distribution is highly heterogeneous, presenting 20% of stiff regions (&gt;40 kPa) on average that goes up to 50–60% in tumors with higher volume. In terms of architecture, the tumor and its extensive stroma compartment, occupying around 20% of the tumor, are well separated. This is a typical trait of desmoplastic tumors and the model accurately reproduces the architecture of human cholangiocarcinoma. Its collagen network is characterized by long (85.9 ± 42.0 µm) and thick (7.4 ± 2.2 µm) collagen fibers that are densely packed (6% of the tumor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The mouse PDAC KPC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hingorani et al., 2005</xref>) exhibits similar features to that of EGI-1. A high positive correlation between tumor stiffness and volume, presenting over 20% of stiff regions at high tumor volumes, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). KPC tumors present typical segregation of ECM and tumor nests, with a high proportion of stroma (~20%). However, the extension of the stromal areas is lower than that of EGI-1 with higher intercalation with tumor islets. Its collagen network is characterized by shorter (67.1 ± 35 µm) and thinner (4.4 ± 0.9 µm) collagen fibers than that of EGI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The spontaneous orthotopic murine breast cancer model MMTV-PyMT, although slower in its growth as compared to subcutaneous tumors, also stiffens during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, there is a lower density of stiff regions (&lt;16%). Of note, the fact that it is an orthotopic tumor in a genetic model that develops about 10 tumors limits the maximal tumor volume reached for this analysis. Hence, we cannot compare this model with the other models at high tumor volumes for ethical reasons. This spontaneous tumor model also presents a tumor islets-stroma structure, but with a lower amount of stroma (~13%) as compared to EGI-1 and KPC models. The stroma is more dispersed and intercalated with the tumor compartment. Collagen fibers are characterized for being thin (3.6 ± 1.1 µm) and long (83 ± 41 µm), forming densely packed regions taking up to 4.8% of the tumor.</p><p>The orthotopic murine PDAC (mPDAC) model has a very different profile compared to the other models. The stroma takes up ~40% of the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) but without clear spatial segregation of stromal and tumor compartments. The mPDAC collagen network is made up of thin (3.5 ± 0.8 µm) and dispersed collagen fibers, which accounts for the lower presence of densely packed collagen regions (2.7% of the tumor). The mean tumor stiffness is lower than that of the other models, partly explained by the limits of the maximal tumor volume reached in this orthotopic model (for ethical reasons) and partly by the collagen architecture. Tumor stiffness also increases with tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in line with previous studies performed in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilles et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike the above-mentioned models that exhibit a high correlation between stiffness and tumor growth, the mouse breast carcinoma MET-1 tumor model is characterized by low tumor stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a limited stroma (~6%), the lack of tumor-islet/stroma organization, and the presence of thin (3.2 ± 0.9 µm) and dispersed collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>In human breast cancer, a significant correlation between tumor stiffness and tumor size was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Here, our analysis enabled us to confirm such correlation in different mouse tumor models covering three types of carcinomas. In addition, we show a correlation between tumor stiffness measured non-invasively with collagen accumulation associated with a segregated architecture of thick and densely packed collagen fibers (Sirius red positive) surrounding tumor nests. In contrast, tumors with an entangled and thin mesh of collagen fibers present lower rigidity despite overall high collagen content. Particularly the appearance of stiff regions &gt; 40 kPa is seen as a physical biomarker of intratumor heterogeneity and ECM segregation. This analysis maps out potentially relevant preclinical tumor models, which might reproduce the diverse fibrotic evolutions of human breast, pancreatic, and bile duct tumors and their architecture heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LOX modulates tumor stiffness and the ECM organization</title><p>The panel of tumor stroma structures reported above allows us to investigate the direct effects of ECM modulating agents in situations mimicking the heterogeneity observed in human carcinoma. Thus, we sought to determine whether beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor for LOX enzymatic activity, could modulate tumors’ mechanical properties in concert with the stroma architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levental et al., 2009</xref>). For these experiments, BAPN was administered in the drinking water of mice upon tumor cell implantation and until their sacrifice for most models, except for the MMTV-PyMT model that was treated approximately at the time that tumors start to spontaneously develop. LOX stabilizes collagen fibers by enzymatic reactions that culminate in the formation of trivalent mature crosslinks including pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamauchi et al., 2018</xref>). PYD and DPD have an intrinsic fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richards-Kortum and Sevick-Muraca, 1996</xref>), which can be measured by two-photon microscopy (Ex 720 nm, Em 400 nm) on tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marturano et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we adopted a similar strategy and assessed these two LOX-generated crosslinks in tumor slices from control and BAPN-treated KPC-bearing mice. Our data indicate that the average fluorescence signals of PYD and DPD, measured in SHG-positive regions, were significantly decreased in BAPN as compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that BAPN specifically blocks LOX enzymatic activity. We then examined the effect of LOX inhibition on tumor stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>) and on the presence of stiff regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Results show that all models, except for MET-1, undergo a reduction in mean stiffness when LOX is inhibited. EGI-1 and KPC models both show the most striking differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Changes are mainly perceived at late stages of tumor developments since, in these models, tumor stiffness is positively correlated with tumor growth. In the MMTV-PyMT model, however, significant differences were noted throughout the development of the tumor. For the mPDAC model, tumor stiffness was only evaluated at the end of the BAPN treatment. A significant decrease in mean tumor stiffness is seen in BAPN-treated mPDAC tumors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of LOX inhibition on tumor stiffness and tumor stroma organization in EGI-1, KPC, MMTV-PyMT, and mPDAC tumor models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tumor stiffness measured by SWE in control and BAPN-treated (LOX inhibitor) tumors in relation to tumor volume for EGI-1, MMTV-PyMT, and KPC tumor models.

In general, the collagen fibers in normal tissues are typically curly and anisotropic in contrast to the situation observed in progressing tumors in which many of the fibers progressively thicken and linearize. Collagen fiber orientation was described as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the angle for all fibers, the smaller the CV is, the more aligned the fibers are.

The level of collagen linearization was quantified by measuring the curvature ratio of the fibers. The curvature ratio of control tumors for all models was close to one meaning that the collagen fibers were fully linearized. In contrast, LOX inhibition severely affected fiber curvature, as there was a reversion of the fibers linearization resulting in less linear and wavier fibers in all models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, LOX inhibition also significantly decreased the surface covered by thick and densely packed collagen fibers in EGI-1, KPC, and MMTV-PyMT model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), correlating with the significant decrease in average tumor stiffness and in the proportion of stiff areas measured in vivo.</p><p>In vivo stiffness imaging and ex vivo characterization of the ECM structure were completed by ex vivo mechanical evaluation of isolated tissue samples with atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanomechanical measurements and plate shear rheometry at the tissue level in the KPC model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the mean values of storage modulus (G’) of control and BAPN-treated tumors. It can be noted that tumors treated with BAPN were softer than control ones, with mean stiffness of 1.80 ± 0.51 kPa compared to 4.15 ± 1.92 kPa for the control. These results are in line with SWE measurements in vivo confirming a significant reduction in the mean stiffness of KPC tumors treated with a LOX inhibitor. In contrast to bulk rheometry, AFM reveals the spatial heterogeneity of Young’s moduli at the sub-cellular level measured on six controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and six BAPN-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This confirms that the high heterogeneity in local tissue mechanical properties of KPC tumor can be reduced upon treatment with a LOX inhibitor.

Motile T cells were mainly found in loose ECM stromal regions, whereas fibrotic areas were devoid of lymphocytes. Based on this, we hypothesized that LOX-dependent tumor stiffness could consequently affect T cell migration in tumors and eventually predict the T cell behavior in the various ECM environments. To test this, we performed dynamic imaging of T cell migration on fresh tumor slices from mice treated or not with BAPN. The tumor slice assay that we have established preserves the original tissue microenvironment and permits monitoring with confocal microscopy the behavior of either ex vivo purified and plated T cells or endogenous T cells labeled with directly coupled fluorescent antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peranzoni et al., 2018</xref>). EGI-1 is a xenografted tumor model, with implantation of human carcinoma cells into immune-suppressed mice that lack resident T cells. Thus, in order to evaluate T cell migration in this model we isolated human peripheral blood T cells (PBT) and activated them in vitro. We then added the activated PBT onto fresh tumor slices and analyzed their migration using real-time confocal microscopy. As the MMTV-PyMT tumor model is poorly infiltrated in host T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guerin et al., 2019</xref>), we investigated the migration of exogenously purified murine-activated PBTs in the same manner as for the human EGI-1 model.

We found that in both models, LOX inhibition leads to an increase in the displacement of T cells with a fivefold increase in the mPDAC model. In terms of cell speed, enhancements were observed only in the mPDAC model. Likewise, the trajectory straightness was increased in mPDAC models, but not in KPC tumors. In addition, we also evidenced an increased infiltration of resident T cells in KPC tumors when treated with BAPN. In control conditions, an identical number of T cells (around 100 per mm<sup>2</sup>) were found in the stroma and tumor cell regions. By comparison, BAPN treatment resulted in a threefold to fourfold increase of CD8+ T cells in both the stroma and tumor islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> have been obtained with data pooled from all mice either treated or not with BAPN. We decided to extend our analysis at the level of individual mouse and investigated the relationship between T cell motility (speed and displacement) and mean stiffness of control and BAPN-treated tumors. Our data indicate that T cell motility was inversely correlated to tumor stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) in line with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. However, in three out of the four models tested this correlation is different if one compares control and BAPN-treated tumors. In BAPN-treated tumors, there is a clear inverse linear correlation between T cell migration speed and mean tumor stiffness as evidenced by a steep slope. In comparison, such correlation is less pronounced in control stiff tumors. Similar results were observed when comparing T cell displacement and mean tumor stiffness. These results suggest that above a stiffness threshold that depends on the model, T cells are mostly arrested. In contrast, as tumor stiffness decreased by inhibition of LOX, T cell migration was restored. Thus, T cell motility is highly influenced by small variations in the stiffness of softer tumors as is the case when LOX’s activity is inhibited.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Correlation between mean tumor stiffness and T cell migration parameters in EGI-1, KPC, MMTV-PyMT, and mPDAC tumor models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between mean tumor stiffness and mean T cell velocity.

In different settings, an increase in intratumoral T cell motility is not sufficient to reduce tumor growth if T cells are still impaired in their capacity to respond to tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peranzoni et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, we decided to assess whether LOX inhibition could improve the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The KPC model was chosen for these experiments as tumors are stiff, respond to LOX inhibition in terms of ECM normalization, and are infiltrated with T cells. KPC tumor-bearing mice were treated with BAPN combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Mice were treated or not with BAPN from tumor cell injection up to their sacrifice and were treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies when the tumor volume was around 80–150 mm<sup>3</sup>. At this point, the mice received four doses i.p. injection of anti-PD-1 or isotype control antibody at 4 days intervals (i.p. injection). Unlike BAPN, PD-1 blockade did not affect tumor stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) nor collagen organization including fiber orientation and curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Moreover, the combination therapy was similar to that of BAPN alone on all of these parameters. We then investigated the consequences of these treatments on tumor growth. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, while treatment with single agents alone only shows non-significant reduction in tumor growth, the combination of BAPN with the checkpoint inhibitor significantly delays tumor progression. We then profiled the immune cell population in these tumors using flow cytometry and a gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. We found that BAPN treatment alone significantly decreases the number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but increases the presence of MHCII+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), while the combination therapy expanded the percentage of GrzmB CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and the ratio of CD8+ to Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We also analyzed the amount of cytokines in supernatants of whole-tumor slices derived from these experiments. Results show that the combination therapy led to an increase in TNFα and RANTES, supporting further the increase of T cell activation and infiltration and activation in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>). In both BAPN and BAPN combined with anti-PD-1 conditions, we observed an increase of GrzmB+ levels compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Of note, BAPN and anti-PD-1 alone also showed a similar tendency for an increase in TNFα and RANTES, which prompted us to study the consequences of these treatments on the intratumoral T cell motility.

In the first part of this study, we tackle two of these challenges. One of them is finding ways to accurately assess the architecture of the stroma. In this paper, we propose a thorough analysis combining non-invasive imaging techniques for a macroscopic characterization of tumor stiffness with advanced microscopy techniques to elucidate the collagen network structure, one of the most important components of the tumor ECM. Previous studies had already explored the link between tumor stiffness and collagen architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Venkatesh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mieulet et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we provide novel insights about this relationship through a multiscale analysis performed in several preclinical mouse models of pancreatic, breast, and bile duct carcinomas, presenting different ECM organizations and thus covering the heterogeneity found in cancer patients. This allowed us to extract mechanical and structural reference values and allowed us to later evaluate the effect of an ECM-targeted therapy. Such an approach could be translated to patients given the availability of SWE techniques that could be correlated to histological observations of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Accurately modeling tumor complexity and heterogeneity found in patients’ tumors using a single preclinical model is a real challenge. In the first place, many preclinical models do not always reproduce the carcinoma structure found in their respective human tumors. Another important feature of human solid tumors, often absent in mouse tumor models, is their considerable higher stiffness compared to their neighboring healthy tissues, which is highly correlated with cancer progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). These two features can often be found in human xenograft models that, on the other hand, are not suitable to study immune reactions. In this study, we have set up and characterized five different solid tumor models covering three types of carcinomas that differentiate in terms of tumor-stroma organization, tumor stiffness, collagen structure, and T cell infiltration. The xenotransplanted cholangiocarcinoma tumor model (EGI-1) has an extensive stromal compartment well separated from tumor islets, which is a typical feature of desmoplastic tumors. Likewise, the KPC tumor model has also typical segregation of ECM and tumor nests and reproduces many of the key features observed in human PDAC including a stiff tumor and an exclusion of T cells from tumor islets. The orthotopic mPDAC model also contains very few T cells, although tumors are less stiff than the previous two models. The spontaneous MMTV-PyMT model is relevant with respect to human breast carcinoma as tumors developed in four stages (hyperplasia, adenoma/mammary intraepithelial neoplasia, and early and late carcinoma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2003</xref>). As a result, the architecture of MMTV-PyMT tumors resembles that of human breast cancers. On the other hand, the MET-1 model only contains thin stromal compartments and unlike the previous models, tumors are not very stiff, probably reflecting a specific subtype of human breast cancers. Once the tumor structure and mechanical properties of each model were characterized, an ECM-targeting therapy dependent on LOX inhibition with BAPN was tested. Previous studies performed by Levantal et al. in a spontaneous mouse model of breast carcinoma showed that LOX inhibition induces structural changes in the collagen network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levental et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we confirm and extend these results in other models and provide multiscale insights about different effects of LOX inhibition from model to model, including stiffness measurements at the tissue level. Whilst for cholangiocarcinoma (EGI-1) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma models (KPC and mPDAC), LOX inhibition drastically decreases tumor stiffness, this effect is less marked in the breast adenocarcinoma model (MMTV-PyMT). Although collagen fiber curvature was affected in all models, changes in fiber orientation were only significant in KPC and mPDAC models. These changes can be explained by the fact that the tumor microenvironment and thus the basal collagen structure in each tumor model is different; hence, the inhibition of collagen crosslinking modifies the tumor collagen network to different extents. This emphasizes the need of developing reliable diagnostic markers, such as SWE stiffness mapping, based on a clear understanding of the tumor collagen network, in order to predict the response to ECM-targeting strategies.</p><p>In this study, LOX inhibition was performed in a preventive setting. We assume that it is during early tumor stages and the construction of fibrous stroma that LOX activity is the highest. In established tumors, with stroma having a significant level of crosslinked collagen, LOX inhibition would have a more marginal effect. Although not dealing with anti-PD-1 treatment, several articles are consistent with the notion that LOX inhibition is more effective in early tumor stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nilsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). For example, blocking LOX in combination with gemcitabine reduced metastases and increased survival of the mice when treatment was started in the early stages of the disease, but not at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that the number of T cells found within a tumor as well as their ability to migrate and reach cancer cells is key for an effective antitumoral response. These last few years a lot of efforts have been made in identifying cells and factors controlling the migration of T cells within tumors. The notion that prevailed is that growing tumors are composed of cells and factors, such as macrophages and hypoxia, hostile for T cells to migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peranzoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manaster et al., 2019</xref>). The importance of the ECM in controlling the distribution and migration of T cells in tumors has also emerged. In human lung and ovarian tumors we found that T cells preferentially accumulate and migrate in stromal regions that exhibited a loose matrix architecture but not in dense regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salmon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bougherara et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, in aged skin, dermal fibroblasts harbor a phenotype similar to CAFs and produce ECM matrices that limit T cell displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>). However, in triple-negative breast cancers and in pancreatic tumors, T cells were still found in dense networks of collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstens et al., 2017</xref>). Since most of the aforementioned studies were correlative, we decided in this study to specifically alter the ECM network by LOX inhibition and investigated the consequences on T cell motile behavior. Our results confirmed the importance of the ECM and tissue stiffness in controlling the migration of T cells in tumors. In particular, enhancements of T cell displacements were noticed in all tumor models under LOX inhibition. When we extended our analysis at the level of the individual mouse, we found that T cell intratumoral motility was inversely correlated to tumor stiffness as measured non-invasively using SWE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and this was true in all tested models. However, this relationship is not linear. In most models, T cells strongly decelerate when a threshold in stiffness is reached. In soft tumors such as those induced by LOX inhibition, T cells manage to migrate. Conversely, in stiff non-treated control tumors, T cell migration is impeded. These data fit well with results obtained in vitro in a range of 3D collagen matrices showing that T lymphocytes have the ability to adapt their morphology to the structure of the tissue up to a certain limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolf et al., 2013</xref>). In dense collagen matrices, T cell motility is halted. Our analysis supports the idea that elastography measurements could provide valuable companion markers to evaluate the need for anti-stromal strategy in order to normalize tumor stiffness and consequently improve T cell migration.</p><p>In this study, we did not take into consideration the possible effects of LOX inhibition on other determinants that could either positively or negatively regulate T cell migration. Along with tumor ECM, other cells and factors play important roles in controlling T cell migration. Hence, PD-1 blockade that does not affect collagen structure increases T cell migration within tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). It is well established that anti-PD-1 treatment is associated with the production of IFNγ and inflammatory chemokines (e.g. CXCL10) that are presumably responsible for enhancing T cell motility in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2012</xref>). A number of studies have shown that fibrotic tumors are, at the same time, enriched in cells and factors that are known to impede T cells from migrating (e.g. hypoxia and tumor-associated macrophages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manaster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deligne et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, a reduction in ECM content might normalize the tumor stroma rendering it more prone to stimulate T cell migration. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> showing a decrease in PMN and Treg and an increase in MHC class II + macrophages upon BAPN treatment support this assumption.</p><p>As for possible effects of LOX inhibition on tumor blood vessels, previous studies have reported reduced angiogenesis after LOX and LOX-like protein inhibition and an increased perfused vessel density in the case of overexpression of LOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zaffryar-Eilot et al., 2013</xref>). This could partly explain why we observe a significant increase in T cell infiltration in KPC tumors upon BAPN treatment. However, other recent studies argue the opposite as an increase in collagen crosslinking and matrix stiffness resulted in an increase in angiogenic sprouting. Conversely, the inhibition of collagen crosslinking in tumors resulted in reduced vascular density and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bordeleau et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given the low efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies in solid tumors, any method to increase its effect on tumor regression is of interest. With the exception of desmoplastic melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eroglu et al., 2018</xref>), features of wound healing and fibrosis are usually detrimental to anti-PD-1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hugo et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, a number of anti-fibrotic strategies have been recently implemented in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). One of the most promising targets appears to be TGFβ. In preclinical mouse tumor models, TGFβ inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade induces complete and durable responses in otherwise unresponsive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>). However, due to TGFβ pleiotropic effects, concerns regarding the blockade of this cytokine arose.</p><p>Our study indicates that LOX represents another valuable target as its inhibition in the transplanted KPC model increases the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment, while monotherapy with either agent alone is ineffective. Moreover, the combination treatment was associated with a tumor microenvironment shifted toward antitumoral effector cells and components, whereas immunosuppressive cells were reduced.</p><p>Although the clinical use of BAPN has been impeded by concerns regarding toxicities, other strategies to inhibit LOX in cancer and fibrotic disease patients are currently ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lampi and Reinhart-King, 2018</xref>). Our work confirms LOX as a molecular target to improve T cell migration dynamics as well as to ameliorate the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It paves the way for clinical trials combining LOX inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, possibly in biomarker-selected cohorts of patients with high tumor stiffness evaluated with non-invasive imaging approaches such as SWE.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The same protocol was followed to evaluate T cell migration in MMTV-PyMT cells except that activated murine CD8+ T cells were used.</p><p>To evaluate resident T cell migration in KPC and mPDAC model, tumor slices were then transferred to 0.4 μm organotypic culture inserts (Millicell; Millipore) in 35 mm Petri dishes containing 1.1 mL phenol red-free RPMI media. Live vibratome sections were stained with BV421 anti-mouse EpCAM (G8.8 clone; BD Biosciences), PerCP-e710 anti-mouse CD8a (53–6.7 clone, eBioscience), PE anti-podoplanin (8.1.1 clone; BioLegend), and anti-human/mouse fibronectin (HFN7.1 clone; Novus Biologicals).</p><p>T cells were imaged with a DM500B upright microscope equipped with an upright spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with a 37°C thermostatic chamber. For dynamic imaging, tumor slices were secured with a stainless steel slice anchor (Warner Instruments) and perfused at a rate of 0.8 mL/min with a solution of RPMI without Phenol Red, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Ten minutes later, images from a first microscopic field were acquired with a 25× water immersion objective (20×/0.95 N.A.; Olympus). For four-dimensional analysis of cell migration, stacks of 10–12 sections (z step = 5 μm) were acquired every 30 s for 20 min at depths up to 80 μm. Regions were selected for imaging when tumor parenchyma, stroma, and T cells were simultaneously present in the same microscopic field. For most of the tumors included in the study, between two and four microscopic fields were selected for time-lapse experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dynamic imaging analysis</title><p>A 3D image analysis was performed on x, y, and z planes using Imaris 7.4 (Oxford Instruments). First, superficial planes from the top of the slice to 15 μm in depth were removed to exclude T cells located near the cut surface. Cellular motility parameters were then calculated. Tracks of &gt;10% of the total recording time were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SHG microscopy</title><p>The images were obtained using an inverted stand Leica SP5 microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) coupled with a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon, Coherent, Saclay, France) tuned at a wavelength of 810 or 850 nm for all experiments. The laser beam was circularly polarized and a Leica Microsystems HCX IRAPO 25×/0.95 W objective was used. SHG (collagen structure) signal was detected in epi-collection through a 405/15 nm bandpass filters, respectively, by NDD PMT detectors (Leica Microsystems) with a constant voltage supply, at constant laser excitation power, allowing direct comparison of SHG intensity values. All images were then analyzed using CT-FIRE software to obtain the width and the length of the collagen fibers. To calculate the curvature ratio, line regions were drawn along the length of the fibers (A) and along the linear distance between the start and the end of the fibers (B), the curvature ratio was calculated CR = A/B. For each image at least, 15 fibers were analyzed. Fiber alignment was determined using the directionality plugin in Image J. The fiber alignment was defined by the CV of the angle for all fibers per image. The smaller the CV is, the more aligned the fibers are.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Detection of collagen crosslinks using two-photon microscopy</title><p>An upright stand Leica SP5 multiphoton microscope (Leica Microsystems) was used to assess PYD and DPD natural fluorescence within tumor slices of KPC tumors. Samples were illuminated at a wavelength of 720 nm using a Ti:Sa Chameleon Ultra II (Coherent, Saclay, France) as a laser source. Fluorescence emissions were measured at a wavelength of 400 ± 25 nm. Mean fluorescent signals were measured in SHG-positive regions. The background noise of each region was subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>For most of the tumors, half of the biopsy was fixed overnight at 4°C in a periodate–lysine–paraformaldehyde solution (0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M <sc>l</sc>-lysine [pH 7.4], 2 mg/mL NaIO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mg/mL paraformaldehyde). After fixation, tumors were dehydrated in graded solutions of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Five micrometer tissue sections were stained with HES and Sirius Red. For Sirius Red-stained slices, linear polarized light or bright field microscopy was performed using full-field microscopy (Statif Axio Observer Z.1, Zeiss) equipped with a linear polarizer and a 20× dry objective (Plan Achromatic [NA = 0.7]). Under polarized light, thin fibers show a greenish-yellow birefringence, whilst thicker and densely packed fibers give an orange-red birefringence. The percentage of Sirius Red staining defined the amount of thick and densely packed fibers, to do so images were split in the RGB channel and the signal in the red channel was quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Atomic force microscopy and shear rheometry</title><p>Mechanical measurements of the control and BAPN mice tumors were performed ex vivo at the nanoscopic and macroscopic scale using AFM and shear rheometer.</p><p>AFM experiments were made maximally 3 hr after sample thawing, and tissues were stored and kept in culture medium during the experiment at room temperature. Millimeter-scale samples of mice KPC model tumors were measured with a JPK Bruker NanoWizard 4 BioScience atomic force microscope working in the force spectroscopy mode. Force vs. indentation curves were collected using a silicon nitride cantilever with a spring constant of 0.6 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and a 4.5 μm diameter bead attached. Each sample was indented in multiple locations to account for possible heterogeneity in tissue mechanical properties. Briefly, up to nine maps consisting of 64 points corresponding to the scan area of 10 × 10 µm (for one map) per sample were made. Final Young’s modulus values were derived from the Hertz–Sneddon model applied to force vs. indentation curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pogoda et al., 2012</xref>), assuming the spherical shape of the probe and Poisson’s ratio equal 0.5. Distributions of Young’s modulus values for each control and treated sample, as well as the mean values along with standard deviations, were prepared.</p><p>For the macroscopic rheological tests, HAAKE Rheostress 6000 rheometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), fitted with an 8 mm diameter parallel plate system, was used. Tissues were firstly cut into disk-shaped samples using an 8 mm punch. To avoid tissue slippage during the tests, samples were arranged in sand paper glued inside the Petri dishes and fixed to the rheometer bottom plate. Rheological experiments were made maximally 3 hr after tissue thawing, and all the samples were kept in humid conditions during the experiment. The rheological evaluation consisted of the oscillating shear deformation with 2% shear amplitude and frequency of 1 Hz. Final results are presented as the mean values of storage modulus (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>’</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) of control and treated tumors ± standard deviation (SD) values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Immune cells in tumors were stained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peranzoni et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, tumors were mechanically dissociated and digested for 45 min at 37°C in RPMI 1640 with 37.5 µg/mL Liberase TM (Roche) and 8,000 U/mL DNase I from bovine pancreas (Merck Millipore). The resulting digestion was filtered through a 70 µm cell stainer and centrifuged. Red blood cell lysis with ACK buffer was performed on the remaining pellet and subsequently filtered on a 40 µm cell strainer. The cell suspension was then rinsed in PBS and stained in 96-well round-bottom plates with a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed and stained with Abs against surface proteins at a concentration of 10 µg/mL for 20 min at 4°C.</p><p>The anti-mouse antibodies used were the following:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Antigen</th><th valign="bottom">Fluorophore</th><th valign="bottom">Clone</th><th valign="bottom">Company</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> CD11b</td><td valign="top">PE-Cy7</td><td valign="top">M1/70</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD11b</td><td valign="top">BV421</td><td valign="top">M1/70</td><td valign="top">BD Biosystems</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD11c</td><td valign="top">BV605</td><td valign="top">N418</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD45</td><td valign="top">AF700</td><td valign="top">30-F11</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Ly-6C</td><td valign="top">APC-Cy7</td><td valign="top">HK1.4</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Ly-6G</td><td valign="top">BV510</td><td valign="top">1A8</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD4</td><td valign="top">BV 711</td><td valign="top">GK1.5</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD8a</td><td valign="top">PerCP-e710</td><td valign="top">53–6.7</td><td valign="top">eBioscience</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> TCRβ</td><td valign="top">BV605</td><td valign="top">H57-597</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Nkp46</td><td valign="top">eFluor660</td><td valign="top">29A1.4</td><td valign="top">eBioscience</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> PD-1</td><td valign="top">BV421</td><td valign="top">29F.1A12</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> MHC II</td><td valign="top">BV785</td><td valign="top">M5/114.15.2</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD80</td><td valign="top">FITC</td><td valign="top">16-10A1</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD64</td><td valign="top">PE</td><td valign="top">X54-5/7.1</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> CD206</td><td valign="top">BV605</td><td valign="top">CO68C2</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> F4/80</td><td valign="top">StarBright Violet 670</td><td valign="top">CI:A3-1</td><td valign="top">BIO-RAD</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>After surface staining, cells were fixed with BD fixation and permeabilization solution for 20 min at 4°C.

It is due not only to the 'exhausted' phenotype of tumor-infiltrating T cells but also to the fact that several fibrotic tumors show physical resistance to T cell infiltration. The present study highlights the detrimental impact of collagen fibrils architecture on the migratory behavior of anti-tumoral T cells in fresh human tumor explants, and specifically explores the consequences of 'softening' the extracellular matrix by inhibition of the lysyl oxidase (LOX), a copper-dependent enzyme that is responsible for the crosslinking of collagen molecules into fibers and is overexpressed in many metastatic tumors. The study shows that LOX inhibition has different mechanical modulating effects depending on the ECM architecture and results in significant improvement in T cell mobility. Importantly, combining LOX inhibition and PD-1 blockade treatment increases effector CD8 T cell accumulation in tumors and significantly delays tumor progression in a pancreatic cancer model.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tumor stiffening reversion through collagen crosslinking inhibition improves T cell migration and anti-PD-1 treatment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The work analyzes the stiffness and collagen distribution in different tumor models implanted in mice and shows that treatment with an inhibitor of collagen crosslinking correlates with changes in their stiffness. This results in a change in the motility of resident T cells. The inhibitor of collagen crosslinking increases the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and leads to increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade on tumor growth. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor and their views concur. Although the work has potential for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, it requires essential additional data and statistics to support the central claims of the paper. Each reviewer raised substantive concerns (see below) that need to be resolved experimentally. To quote a few, you should provide a measurement of the collagen crosslinking in mice treated by BAPN to confirm that this drug has the expected effects. The combined BAPN plus anti-PD-1 therapy needs also to be confirmed in another model. Measurements of stiffness, collagen structure and T cell speed should be provided for all treatment conditions (control, LOXi, PD1i and combo) rather than just for LOX inhibition. Importantly, several important conclusions are based on inadequate sample size to be conclusive (see below). Along that line, the number of mice and tumor cells plus corresponding statistics need to be indicated in all the figures.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In their article entitled &quot;Tumor stiffening reversion through collagen crosslinking inhibition improves T cell migration and anti-PD-1 treatment&quot; Alba Nicolas-Boluda and co-authors analyze the stiffness and collagen distribution in different tumor models implanted in mice. They show that treatment with an inhibitor of collagen crosslinking modifies the collagen network in these tumors and that this correlates with changes in their stiffness. They then analyze the motility of T cells in the different models and show that this motility is modified by the treatment and correlates with the stiffness of the tumor. In the last part of their study, the authors show that treatment of the mice with the inhibitor of collagen crosslinking changes the immune infiltrates in the tumors characterized by a more abundant presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. They finally show that interfering with collagen stabilization leads to increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 blockade on tumor growth.</p><p>Relevance of the study:</p><p>T cells are excluded from a large proportion of solid tumor. This represents an obstacle to T-cell-based immunotherapies. The authors make the hypothesis that this can be, at least partly, due to the organization of the ECM in the tumor that would oppose physical resistance to the infiltration and migration of T cells. The results are sound and important for the community since 1) they describe thoroughly some of the mechanical aspects of several models used in the literature, 2) they thoroughly analyzed the effect of an inhibitor of collagen crosslinking on these mechanical properties 3) study the effects of these modifications in T cell motility and 4) test in one tumor model the effects of the combination of an inhibitor of collagen crosslinking with anti-PD1 immunotherapy. The results are convincing and I only have minor concerns.</p><p>In the first part of their study, the authors analyze the structure heterogeneity of 5 different carcinomas, i.e. subcutaneous model of cholangiocarcinoma (EGI-1), subcutaneous (MET-1) and transgenic model (MMTV-PyMT) of mouse breast carcinoma, orthotopic (mPDAC) and subcutaneous (KPC) models of mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</p><p>They measure the tumor stiffness during tumor growth using Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) and analyze the organization of the collagen fibers in these models. To my knowledge, this represents the first characterization of different tumor models classically used to study tumor immunity and is thus very useful for the scientific community. In particular, the authors show a correlation between high tumor stiffness and accumulation of thick and densely packed collagen fibers.</p><p>Minor modifications: The authors should indicate more clearly the number of mice and tumors investigated.</p><p>In the second part of their study, the authors treat the mice with beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor for LOX enzymatic activity in the drinking water and analyze the stiffness of tumors and collagen fiber organization in tumors. They show the heterogeneity of response in the different models in both stiffness modulation and collagen fibers remodeling. Mostly this treatment reduces the stiffness of tumors without affecting their growth.</p><p>Minor modifications: The authors should clarify how &quot;normalized tumor stiffness&quot; indicated in the legend of figure 2 is calculated. Indeed, this is an important point since tumor stiffness is associated to the sizes of tumors. Moreover, they should also indicate more clearly the number of mice and tumors investigated. Concerning collagen fibers orientation, authors should use a dot plot representation instead of bar histograms in order to show the distribution in the different tumors.</p><p>The authors then analyze how BAPN treatment modifies the migration of T lymphocytes in the tumors. Because of the different models used, the authors either added activated purified T cells from human donors (EGI-1model), or mouse activated T cells (MMTV-PyMT tumor model) or followed the motility of human resident T cells in mPDAC and KPC mice tumor models. Although the models are very different, the correlation between tumor stiffness and T cell speed and T cell displacement is specially striking in tumors from BAPN treated mice. It seems that T cell motility responds to two different regimens in tumor from untreated or BAPN treated mice. This might be due to difference of stiffness in untreated and treated mice but might also results from another parameter.</p><p>Minor modifications: The authors should discuss this point. Indeed, the main conclusion of their work and short title of their study is that the main parameter involved in T cell motility and access to the tumor is tumor stiffness but then the slopes should be the same as in the spontaneous MMTV-PyMT tumor model. There are probably other parameters involved in the regulation.</p><p>The authors then investigate the effect of BAPN treatment of tumor bearing mice on response to PD-1 immunotherapy. They perform experiments in KPC tumor bearing mice and show that BAPN treatment alone significantly decreases the number of neutrophils, increases the presence of MHCII+ TAMs. Yet, the combined therapy (BAPN and PD-1) is necessary to expand the percentage of GrzmB CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the ratio of CD8<sup>+</sup> to Treg cells and is associated with an increase in cytokine production. The combined treatment also leads to a decrease in the tumor sizes. Although these results are convincing as they are, confirmation of the results in another model would strengthen the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the ECM architecture and stiffness in 4 murine tumor models. They then attempt to correlate ECM architecture and mechanics with T-cell migration and PD-1 efficacy. Substantive concerns are as follows:</p><p>1. The study is highly correlative with inadequate sample size to be conclusive. The authors attempts to draw conclusions about when stiffness does and doesn't affect migration by attempting to interpret data across 4 very different tumor types. In two tumors the migration changes with BAPN and with 2 it does not. It is not possible to draw a conclusion based on 2 points.</p><p>2.

The authors study migration of cells on slices, but isn't the more appropriate metric to study cell invasion into the tissue?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The focus of the manuscript by Nicolas-Boluda et al. is timely as it has been shown by this team and by others that dense collagen fibers and other features of the matrix architecture surrounding tumors may form a barrier for T cell infiltration into solid tumors. Despite the authors' claims, however, the data in this manuscript fall short of definitively demonstrating that response to anti-PD-1 therapy and T cell migration into tumors is improved upon reduction of collagen cross-linking. I have a number of concerns that would require additional substantive experiments to be adequately addressed. Below I list major points that should be addressed before further consideration for publications.</p><p>1) BAPN is used as a covalent inhibitor of LOX activity however the authors provide no evidence that the drug is having the expected effects in vivo. In order to draw specific conclusions about these studies the authors would need to provide measurements of collagen cross-links (DHLNL, PYP, DPD).</p><p>2) Imbalance between the mechanical characterization of multiple tumor models with little space for defining the effect of tumor stiffness on anti-PD-1 efficacy and T cell distribution, motility and activation.</p><p>3) Rationale for selected tumor models relative to human tumors was unclear.</p><p>4) Sample sizes, # independent experiments and statistical analyses were inadequate across multiple figures.</p><p>5) Measurements of stiffness, collagen structure and T cell speed should be provided for all treatment conditions (control, LOXi, PD1i and combo) rather than just for LOX inhibition.</p><p>6) Lox inhibition was performed in a preventive setting. Do the authors think LOX inhibition would be as effective in changing tumor stiffness and matrix architecture if the treatment started at the same time point as anti-PD-1?</p><p>7) In Figure 1 the correlation of tissue stiffness/collagen accumulation with tumor volume in clinical samples should be provided in order to attribute collagen cross-linking to tumor progression.</p><p>8) The efficacy data in Figure 6 should be accompanied by survival data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58688.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] In the first part of their study, the authors analyze the structure heterogeneity of 5 different carcinomas, i.e. subcutaneous model of cholangiocarcinoma (EGI-1), subcutaneous (MET-1) and transgenic model (MMTV-PyMT) of mouse breast carcinoma, orthotopic (mPDAC) and subcutaneous (KPC) models of mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</p><p>They measure the tumor stiffness during tumor growth using Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) and analyze the organization of the collagen fibers in these models.

These include chemical factors (e.g., chemokines) but also cellular entities that could either positively or negatively regulate T cell intratumoral migration. Although the anti-LOX strategy that we used in our study targets collagen crosslinking, we cannot rule out possible indirect effects of LOX inhibition on cells and elements important for the migration of T cells. Thus, we have added a chapter in the discussion highlighting the fact that tumor ECM is part of a microenvironment having detrimental effects on T cell migration.</p><p><italic>“</italic>In this study, we did not take into consideration possible effects of LOX inhibition on other determinants that could either positively or negatively regulate T cell migration. […] The data in Figure 6 showing a decrease in PMN and Treg and an increase in MHC class II+ macrophages upon BAPN treatment support this assumption”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then investigate the effect of BAPN treatment of tumor bearing mice on response to PD-1 immunotherapy.

The combined treatment also leads to a decrease in the tumor sizes. Although these results are convincing as they are, confirmation of the results in another model would strengthen the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. However, finding a relevant tumor model to perform combination treatments (immune checkpoint and collagen crosslinking inhibitors) has proven to be difficult. In principle, such a model should exhibit three main features, namely a stiff tumor, ECM normalization upon LOX inhibition, and T cells infiltrated in tumors. The KPC tumor model that we have used for these combination experiments encompasses all three characteristics. However, this is not the case with the other tumor models that we have studied in the first part of our study. Specifically, the MET-1 model is not stiff and thus does not respond to LOX inhibition in terms of ECM structure. On the other hand, spontaneous tumor models are structurally relevant but often lack the presence of T cells in tumors as in the case of MMTV-PyMT tumors.</p><p>Nonetheless, we performed additional experiments in three other tumor models that gave us inconclusive results. We provide here the results of experiments that we have conducted in transplanted MMTV-PyMT tumors. This model consists of injecting subcutaneously cells from freshly dissociated MMTV-PyMT tumors (5). In this condition, the tumors grow much faster than in the spontaneous model. The difference in development pace results in differences at the level of the tumor composition. The extracellular matrix in the spontaneous tumors is much more abundant than in the transplanted ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This translates also at the macroscopic level with spontaneous tumors being stiffer than transplanted tumors at equivalent tumor volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Despite the differences in the extracellular matrix density, we decided to test the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 with LOX inhibition.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Confocal microscopy images of transplanted and spontaneous MMTV-PyMT tumors.</title><p>Fibronectin (red), EpCAM (tumor cells, blue) CD8 (green).

However, no further decrease is observed when immune checkpoint inhibitors are combined with BAPN. We believe that the lack of additional effect is related to the fact that LOX inhibition does not produce a significant decrease in tumor stiffness as it is the case in other models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). In addition, when we examined the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the tumor, we could see that both the immunotherapies alone and BAPN alone separately induce an increase in CD8 T cells in the tumor (compared to the control), however, the combination does not enhance this accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Tumor fold change after combination therapy of BAPN and anti-PD1/anti-CTLA 4 in transplanted MMTV-PyMT tumor.</title><p>(B) Normalized tumor stiffness (C) %CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell/CD45+ cells (D) Confocal microscopy images Fibronectin (red), EpCAM (tumor cells, blue) CD8 (green).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58688-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In conclusion, we are convinced that finding another relevant tumor model to perform combination treatments is important. However, it will require considerable efforts that would go beyond the scope of the current study and should be addressed in future work. What seems to us important is that the variety of models investigated in the paper reveals the most relevant and intertwined parameters, namely tumor architecture (segregation of ECM with respect to tumor islet) collagen structure, tumor stiffness and T cell infiltration that conditions the response to LOX inhibition and immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the ECM architecture and stiffness in 4 murine tumor models.

The authors study migration of cells on slices, but isn't the more appropriate metric to study cell invasion into the tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>In principle, intravital two-photon microscopy is the method of choice to monitor T cell migration in intact tissues. However, this approach is technically challenging to set up with some tumors and especially with the orthotopic tumor model used here. Instead, we have used a technique of fresh tumor slices that has been instrumental for our team in elucidating the mechanisms of T cell migration within tumors (11,12). The fresh slices preserve the complex multicellular tumor microenvironment and they are thick enough to study T cell migration within the tissue.</p><p>We now provide details in the Results section about the slice assay as follows:</p><p>“The tumor slice assay that we have established preserves the original tissue microenvironment and permits to monitor with confocal microscopy the behavior of either ex vivo purified and plated T cells or endogenous T cells labeled with directly-coupled fluorescent antibodies”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The focus of the manuscript by Nicolas-Boluda et al. is timely as it has been shown by this team and by others that dense collagen fibers and other features of the matrix architecture surrounding tumors may form a barrier for T cell infiltration into solid tumors. Despite the authors' claims, however, the data in this manuscript fall short of definitively demonstrating that response to anti-PD-1 therapy and T cell migration into tumors is improved upon reduction of collagen cross-linking. I have a number of concerns that would require additional substantive experiments to be adequately addressed. Below I list major points that should be addressed before further consideration for publications.</p><p>1) BAPN is used as a covalent inhibitor of LOX activity however the authors provide no evidence that the drug is having the expected effects in vivo. In order to draw specific conclusions about these studies the authors would need to provide measurements of collagen cross-links (DHLNL, PYP, DPD).</p></disp-quote><p>Traditional methods to measure fibrillar collagen crosslinks include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS). A systematic search of the MEDLINE database indicates that the number of labs in the world able to perform such measurement is limited. In fact, none of the proteomic facilities we contacted was having the proper expertise to conduct collagen crosslinks analysis. As an alternative approach, we have decided to exploit the intrinsic fluorescence of two trivalent LOX-generated crosslinks, pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD), (Ex 325 nm, Em 400 nm) (13) and use two-photon imaging to measure the natural fluorescence of PYD and DPD in tumor sections from mice treated or not with BAPN. Notably, such a fluorescence imaging strategy to assess the level of collagen crosslinks in tissue sections has already been conducted and validated by comparing microscopy results to those obtained with traditional amino acid analyses (14).</p><p>In the revised version of our manuscript, we include new data (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing that the average fluorescence signals of PYD and DPD, measured in SHG positive regions, are significantly decreased in BAPN as compared to control conditions. Changes were also made to the text to reflect these observations. This result together with the effects of BAPN treatment on collagen organization in tumors suggests that this pharmacological compound has the expected effects in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Imbalance between the mechanical characterization of multiple tumor models with little space for defining the effect of tumor stiffness on anti-PD-1 efficacy and T cell distribution, motility and activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the novelty of our study comes from a comprehensive investigation of tumor mechanical properties (particularly tumor stiffness which is a physical biomarker easily accessible in patients through clinical elastography) and their relationships with the ECM architecture and subsequent impacts on T cell intratumoral migration. In this paper, we have investigated 5 different preclinical models recapitulating the heterogeneity of the ECM architecture and representing distinct evolution of the tumor stiffness upon tumor progression, with important consequences on T cell infiltration and migration. In this regard, LOX inhibition was used and characterized as a critical modulator of the collagen architecture, with profound consequences on tumor stiffness and T cell migration, acting differently depending on the tumor type. Our main message is thus that the stiffness of the tumor, and more generally the precise architecture of the tumor, must be carefully examined in order to categorize patients that could be resistant to immunotherapies due to poor access and migration capacity of effector T cells. The use of anti-PD-1 in combination with LOX inhibition was proposed in our study as an illustration of this concept in one of the preclinical models, knowing this combined strategy is not enough to induce complete tumor regression. Nevertheless and as requested by the Reviewer in his/her point #5, we provide novel data about the effects of LOX inhibition and PD-1 blockade on tumor stiffness, stroma organization, and T cell motility in KPC tumors (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Rationale for selected tumor models relative to human tumors was unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss the different tumor models used in our study more explicitly, as follows (p16):</p><p>“In this study, we have set up and characterized five different solid tumor models covering 3 types of carcinomas that differentiate in terms of tumor-stroma organization, tumor stiffness, collagen structure, and T cell infiltration. […] On the other hand, the MET-1 model only contains thin stromal compartments and unlike the previous models, tumors are not very stiff, probably reflecting a specific subtype of human breast cancers”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Sample sizes, # independent experiments and statistical analyses were inadequate across multiple figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s request, we have now clearly stated, in the figure legends, the number of mice and tumors investigated for each experiment. The number of T cells analyzed for each motility experiment (Supplementary File 4) was also included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Measurements of stiffness, collagen structure and T cell speed should be provided for all treatment conditions (control, LOXi, PD1i and combo) rather than just for LOX inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s suggestions, we performed additional experiments measuring tumor stiffness, collagen structure, and T cell motility within KPC tumors for all treatment conditions (Control, BAPN, anti-PD1 and combination). Our new results (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1) indicate that anti-PD1 treatment does not affect tumor stiffness nor collagen organization. However, we found that PD-1 blockade results in an increase in T cell motility as comparable to that induced by BAPN treatment. Changes were also made to the text to reflect these observations. We also discuss these findings as follows:</p><p>“Along with tumor ECM, other cells and factors play important roles in controlling T cell migration. […] It is well established that anti-PD-1 treatment is associated with the production of IFNγ and inflammatory chemokines (e.g., CXCL10) that are presumably responsible for enhancing T cell motility in tumors (1)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Lox inhibition was performed in a preventive setting. Do the authors think LOX inhibition would be as effective in changing tumor stiffness and matrix architecture if the treatment started at the same time point as anti-PD-1?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this important point, we have included several sentences to the discussion as follows:</p><p>“In this study, LOX inhibition was performed in a preventive setting. […] For example, blocking LOX in combination with gemcitabine reduced metastases and increased survival of the mice when treatment was started in the early stages of the disease but not at later stages (16)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1 the correlation of tissue stiffness/collagen accumulation with tumor volume in clinical samples should be provided in order to attribute collagen cross-linking to tumor progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in our revised manuscript references of clinical studies showing a correlation between tumor stiffness and tumor size. It reads as follows:</p><p>“In human breast cancer, a significant correlation between tumor stiffness and tumor size was demonstrated (17,18). […] In addition, we show a correlation between tumor stiffness measured non-invasively with collagen accumulation associated with a segregated architecture of thick and densely packed collagen fibers (Sirius red positive) surrounding tumor nests”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The efficacy data in Figure 6 should be accompanied by survival data.</p></disp-quote><p>Such experiments are not possible in this tumor model. Subcutaneous KPC tumors do not metastasize and therefore mice do not die from even very large tumors. For ethical reasons, mice must be killed when tumors reached 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>References :</p><p>1. Peng W, Liu C, Xu C, Lou Y, Chen J, Yang Y, et al.
