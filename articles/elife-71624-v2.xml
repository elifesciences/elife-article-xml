At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of somatic cell reprogramming, which suggests full reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first “maturation phase transient reprogramming” (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are selectively expressed until this rejuvenation point then withdrawn. Applying MPTR to dermal fibroblasts from middle-aged donors, we found that cells temporarily lose and then reacquire their fibroblast identity, possibly as a result of epigenetic memory at enhancers and/or persistent expression of some fibroblast genes. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome was rejuvenated to a similar extent, including H3K9me3 levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MPTR appears substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. In addition, MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, and showed partial functional rejuvenation of their migration speed. Finally, our work suggests that optimal time windows exist for rejuvenating the transcriptome and the epigenome. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from complete pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>rejuvenation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Diljeet</given-names></name><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Fátima</given-names></name><name><surname>Okkenhaug</surname><given-names>Hanneke</given-names></name><name><surname>Hernando-Herraez</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name><name><surname>Stubbs</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name><name><surname>Milagre</surname><given-names>Inês</given-names></name><name><surname>Reik</surname><given-names>Wolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>215912/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parry</surname><given-names>Aled</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Milky Way Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Diljeet</given-names></name><name><surname>Reik</surname><given-names>Wolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Investigator award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210754/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reik</surname><given-names>Wolf</given-names></name><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Christopher D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transiently reprogramming human fibroblasts up to the maturation phase rejuvenates cells according to several aging markers whilst enabling them to return to their original identity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is the gradual decline in cell and tissue function over time that occurs in almost all organisms, and is associated with a variety of molecular hallmarks such as telomere attrition, genetic instability, epigenetic and transcriptional alterations, and an accumulation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). This leads to perturbed nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased incidence of cellular senescence, which impacts overall cell function and intercellular communication, promotes exhaustion of stem cell pools, and causes tissue dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). The progression of some aging related changes, such as transcriptomic and epigenetic ones, can be measured highly accurately and as such they can be used to construct “aging clocks” that predict chronological age with high precision in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>) and in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stubbs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). Since transcriptomic and epigenetic changes are reversible at least in principle, this raises the intriguing question of whether molecular attributes of aging can be reversed and cells phenotypically rejuvenated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rando and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manukyan and Singh, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming is the process by which almost any somatic cell can be converted into an embryonic stem cell-like state. Intriguingly, iPSC reprogramming reverses many age-associated changes, including telomere attrition and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapasset et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, the epigenetic clock is reset back to approximately 0, suggesting reprogramming can reverse aging associated epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>). However, iPSC reprogramming also results in the loss of original cell identity and therefore function. By contrast, transient reprogramming approaches where the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) are expressed for short periods of time may be able to achieve rejuvenation without loss of cell identity. Reprogramming can be performed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2013</xref>), and indeed, cyclical expression of the Yamanaka factors in vivo can extend lifespan in progeroid mice and improves cellular function in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>). An alternative approach for reprogramming in vivo also demonstrated reversal of aging-associated changes in retinal ganglion cells and was capable of restoring vision in a glaucoma mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, in vitro transient reprogramming has been shown to reverse multiple aspects of aging in human fibroblasts and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the extent of epigenetic rejuvenation achieved by previous transient reprogramming methods has been modest (~3 years) compared to the drastic reduction achieved by complete iPSC reprogramming. A more detailed comparison of previous methods is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Here, we establish a novel transient reprogramming strategy where Yamanaka factors are expressed until the maturation phase (MP) of reprogramming before abolishing their induction (maturation phase transient reprogramming, MPTR), with which we were able to achieve robust and very substantial rejuvenation (~30 years) whilst retaining original cell identity overall.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transiently reprogrammed cells reacquire their initial cell identity</title><p>Reprogramming can be divided into three phases: the initiation phase (IP) where somatic expression is repressed and a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition occurs; the MP, where a subset of pluripotency genes becomes expressed; and the stabilization phase (SP), where the complete pluripotency program is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous attempts at transient reprogramming have only reprogrammed within the IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). However, reprogramming further, up to the MP, may achieve more substantial rejuvenation. To investigate the potential of MPTR to reverse aging phenotypes, we generated a doxycycline-inducible polycistronic reprogramming cassette that encoded <italic>Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc,</italic> and GFP. By using a polycistronic cassette, we could ensure that individual cells were able to express all four Yamanaka factors. This reprogramming cassette was capable of generating iPSC lines from human fibroblasts and induced a substantial reduction of DNA methylation age throughout the reprogramming process, consistent with previous work using a different reprogramming system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, DNA methylation age as measured using the multi-tissue epigenetic clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>) was substantially reduced relatively early in the reprogramming process (which takes about 50 days to complete in this system), with an approximate rejuvenation of 20 years by day 10 and 40 years by day 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar results were obtained using the skin and blood clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horvath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, other epigenetic clocks were rejuvenated later in the reprogramming process. This may suggest that the epigenome is rejuvenated in stages; however, we note that these other epigenetic clocks were not trained on fibroblast data. We therefore focussed on the window between days 10 and 17 to develop our MPTR protocol for human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), predicting that this would enable substantial reversal of aging phenotypes whilst potentially allowing cells to regain original cell identity. Beyond this window, cells would enter the SP and the endogenous pluripotency genes would become activated, preventing the cessation of reprogramming by withdrawing doxycycline alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</xref>). The reprogramming cassette was introduced into fibroblasts from three middle-aged donors (chronologically aged 38, 53, and 53 years old and epigenetically aged 45, 49, and 55 years old, according to the multi-tissue epigenetic clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>) by lentiviral transduction before selecting successfully transduced cells by sorting for GFP. We then reprogrammed the fibroblasts for different lengths of time (10, 13, 15, or 17 days) by supplementing the media with 2 µg/ml doxycycline and carried out flow sorting to isolate cells that were successfully reprogramming (labeled ‘transient reprogramming intermediate’: SSEA4 positive, CD13 negative) as well as the cells that had failed to reprogram (labeled ‘failing to transiently reprogram intermediate’: CD13 positive, SSEA4 negative). At this stage, approximately 25% of the cells were successfully reprogramming and approximately 35% of the cells were failing to reprogram, whilst the remainder were double positive or double negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cells were harvested for DNA methylation array or RNA-seq analysis and also replated for further culture in the absence of doxycycline to stop the expression of the reprogramming cassette. Further culture for a period of 4–5 weeks in the absence of doxycycline generated ‘transiently reprogrammed fibroblasts,’ which had previously expressed SSEA4 at the intermediate stage, as well as ‘failed to transiently reprogram fibroblasts,’ which had expressed the reprogramming cassette (GFP-positive cells) but failed to express SSEA4. As a negative control, we simultaneously ‘mock infected’ (subject to transduction process but without lentiviruses) populations of fibroblasts from the same donors. These cells underwent an initial flow sort for viability (to account for the effects of the GFP sort) before culture under the same conditions as the reprogramming cells and flow sorting for CD13 (cells harvested at this stage generated a ‘negative control intermediate’ for methylome and transcriptome analyses). Finally, these ‘negative control intermediate’ cells were grown in the absence of doxycycline for the same length of time as experimental samples to account for the effects of extended cell culture, generating ‘negative control fibroblasts’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transiently reprogrammed cells reacquire their initial cellular identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean DNA methylation age (calculated using the multi-tissue clock; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>) throughout the reprogramming process where cells were transduced with our tetO-GFP-hOKMS vector and treated continuously with 2 µg/ml of doxycycline. Reprogramming is divided in three distinct phases: initiation phase (IP), maturation phase (MP), and stabilization phase (SP).

The tetO-GFP-hOKMS reprogramming construct was introduced into fibroblasts from older donors by lentiviral transduction. Alternatively, cells were ‘mock infected’ as a negative control. Following this, cells were grown in the presence of 2 µg/ml doxycycline to initiate reprogramming. At several time points during the MP, cells were flow sorted and successfully reprogramming cells (CD13− SSEA4+) and cells that were failing to reprogram (CD13+ SSEA4−) were collected for analysis. These were termed ‘transient reprogramming intermediate’ and ‘failing to transiently reprogram intermediate,’ respectively. Sorted cells were also further cultured, and grown in the absence of doxycycline for at least 4 weeks—these were termed ‘transiently reprogrammed’ (CD13− SSEA4+) or ‘failed to transiently reprogram’ (CD13+ SSEA4−).

After sorting, these cells were cultured in medium no longer containing doxycycline, and appeared to return to their initial fibroblast morphology.

Upon visual inspection using a light microscope it appeared that the cells had undergone a mesenchymal-to-epithelial like transition and were forming colony structures that progressively became larger with longer periods of reprogramming, consistent with the emergence of the early pluripotency marker SSEA4. After sorting the cells and culturing in the absence of doxycycline, we found they were able to return to their initial fibroblast morphology, showing that morphological reversion is possible even after 17 days of reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We quantified the morphology changes by calculating a ratio indicative of ‘roundness’ (maximum length divided by perpendicular width) for individual cells before, during, and after MPTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that successfully reprogramming cells became significantly rounder at the intermediate stages of MPTR compared to the starting fibroblasts and then returned to an elongated state upon the completion of MPTR. Of note, we found that there was no significant difference in roundness between cells before and after MPTR, further supporting that fibroblasts were able to return to their original morphology. In comparison, failing to reprogram and negative control cells did not undergo as substantial a change during MPTR and were significantly more elongated at the intermediate stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>We investigated further the identity of the cells after MPTR by conducting DNA methylation array analysis and RNA sequencing to examine their methylomes and transcriptomes, respectively. We included published reprogramming data sets in our analysis as well as a novel reprogramming data set that we generated based on Sendai virus delivery of the Yamanaka factors to act as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohnuki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banovich et al., 2018</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) using expression values of all genes in the transcriptome separated cells based on the extent of reprogramming and the reference data sets formed a reprogramming trajectory along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Transient reprogramming intermediate cells (collected after the reprogramming phase but before the reversion phase) clustered halfway along this trajectory, implying that cells lose aspects of the fibroblast transcriptional program and/or gain aspects of the pluripotency transcriptional program, which is consistent with the loss of the fibroblast surface marker CD13 and gain of the iPSC surface marker SSEA4. We note that the different time points for the transient reprogramming intermediate samples clustered closer together when examining their transcriptomes compared to their DNA methylomes. This suggests that changes in the DNA methylome occur more gradually, whereas changes in the transcriptome occur in more discrete stages. Notably, upon completion of MPTR, transiently reprogrammed samples clustered at the beginning of this trajectory showing that these samples once again transcriptionally resemble fibroblasts rather than reprogramming intermediates or iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar findings were made when the reference data sets were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For example, transiently reprogrammed cells did not express the pluripotency marker <italic>NANOG</italic> and expressed high levels of the fibroblast marker <italic>FSP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, <italic>NANOG</italic> was temporarily expressed at high levels at the intermediate stages of transient reprogramming alongside FSP1, suggesting that these cells simultaneously possessed some transcriptional attributes of both fibroblasts and iPSCs.</p><p>Similarly, PCA of the methylomes separated cells based on the extent of reprogramming and the reference data sets formed a reprogramming trajectory along PC1. PC2 separated mid reprogramming samples from initial fibroblasts and final iPSCs and was driven by CpG sites that are temporarily hypermethylated or hypomethylated during reprogramming. These CpG sites appeared near genes associated with asymmetric protein localization according to gene ontology analysis. As with the transcriptome, intermediate samples from our transient reprogramming experiment clustered along this reprogramming trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), showing that cells move epigenetically toward pluripotency. Notably, the transiently reprogrammed samples returned back to the start of this trajectory (with the reference fibroblast samples) revealing that they epigenetically resembled fibroblasts once again. Like the transcriptome, similar findings were made when the reference data sets were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We found typical regions that change during reprogramming were fibroblast-like after transient reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>), such as the promoter of <italic>POU5F1</italic> being hypermethylated and the promoter of <italic>FSP1</italic> being hypomethylated in our transiently reprogrammed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, the <italic>POU5F1</italic> promoter was temporarily demethylated and the <italic>FSP1</italic> promoter remained lowly methylated at the intermediate stages of transient reprogramming, suggesting that these intermediate stage cells possess some epigenetic features of both fibroblasts and iPSCs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fibroblasts can be transiently reprogrammed to the MP and then revert to a state that is morphologically, epigenetically, and transcriptionally similar to the starting cell identity. To our knowledge, this is the first method for MPTR, where Yamanaka factors are transiently expressed up to the MP of reprogramming before the expression of the factors is abolished.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Epigenetic memory and transcriptional persistence are present at the intermediate stages of transient reprogramming</title><p>Though transiently reprogrammed fibroblasts temporarily lost their cell identity (becoming SSEA4 positive and CD13 negative), they were able to reacquire it once the reprogramming factors were removed, suggesting that they retained memory of their initial cell identity. To examine the source of this memory, we initially defined fibroblast-specific and iPSC-specific gene sets using differential expression analysis on fibroblasts before and after complete reprogramming with our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We subsequently analyzed the expression of these gene sets throughout MPTR and observed that fibroblast-specific genes were temporarily downregulated whilst iPSC-specific genes were temporarily upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, these gene sets were further downregulated and upregulated during complete reprogramming, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We note that this approach generalizes the expression changes and as a result, may obscure subclusters within these gene sets that display different expression trajectories. Therefore, we analyzed the expression levels of individual genes to gain further insight into these gene sets. After performing hierarchical clustering, we observed that the majority of genes within the fibroblast-specific gene set were temporarily downregulated during transient reprogramming (2803 genes out of 4178). However, we also observed that the remaining genes formed two additional clusters that were temporarily upregulated (961 genes) and persistently expressed (414 genes), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also clustered the genes within the iPSC-specific gene set and observed that the majority of iPSC genes were upregulated in transient reprogramming intermediate cells to levels similar to iPSCs and the remaining genes were not yet activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We subsequently performed gene ontology analysis on the fibroblast-specific gene clusters and found that the temporarily upregulated cluster was enriched for gene ontology categories such as ‘response to lipopolysaccharide’ suggesting that inflammatory signaling pathways are temporarily activated during transient reprogramming, likely in response to the reprogramming factors. Interestingly, the persistently expressed gene cluster was enriched for gene ontology categories such as extracellular matrix and collagen fibril organization, suggesting that some aspects of fibroblast function are maintained during transient reprogramming at least at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Epigenetic memory at enhancers and persistent fibroblast gene expression may allow cells to return to their initial identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The mean expression levels of fibroblast-specific and iPSC-specific gene sets during transient reprogramming and complete reprogramming.

We therefore examined the DNA methylation levels at regulatory elements linked to the fibroblast-specific genes. We used the Ensembl Regulatory Build (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zerbino et al., 2015</xref>) to obtain the locations of promoter and enhancer elements as well as their activity status in dermal fibroblasts and iPSCs. We then focussed on promoter and enhancer elements that are active in fibroblasts and linked them to the nearest transcription start site (within 1 kb for promoters and 1 mb for enhancers). The promoters associated with fibroblast genes remained lowly methylated throughout transient reprogramming and complete reprogramming regardless of the gene cluster, suggesting that promoter methylation does not contribute substantially toward memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, enhancers associated with fibroblast genes gained DNA methylation but only during complete reprogramming and not during transient reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This was the case for enhancers linked to the genes in all three clusters and in the case of temporarily downregulated genes, the lack of hypermethylation may confer epigenetic memory at a time when the associated genes are transcriptionally repressed. We also examined fibroblast-specific enhancers in general and defined these as enhancers that are active in fibroblasts but are no longer active in iPSCs. Similar to the previous analysis, we found that DNA methylation was relatively dynamic at fibroblast-specific enhancers. Approximately half of all fibroblast-specific enhancers (2351 out of the covered 4204 enhancers) gained DNA methylation during iPSC reprogramming. However, even at day 17 of the reprogramming process (the longest transient reprogramming intermediate tested here), these enhancers still remained hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Overall, we hypothesize that both epigenetic memory at genes such as MMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and transcriptional persistence at genes such as COL1A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) enable cells to return to their original cell type once the reprogramming factors are withdrawn. Taken together, these two attributes may act as the source of memory for initial cell identity during a time when the somatic transcriptional program is otherwise mostly repressed and somatic proteins such as CD13 are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Polo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David and Polo, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transient reprogramming reverses age-associated changes in the transcriptome and partially restores fibroblast function</title><p>We next investigated the transcriptome to determine if there was any evidence of rejuvenation in this omic layer. We initially identified genes that significantly correlated with age in a reference fibroblast aging data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>) and used genes with a significant Pearson correlation after Bonferroni correction (p≤0.05) to carry out PCA (3707 genes). The samples primarily separated by age and reference fibroblast samples formed an aging trajectory. The transiently reprogrammed samples clustered closer to the young fibroblasts along PC1 than the negative control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Based on the relationship between PC1 and age in the reference data set, we inferred that transient reprogrammed samples were approximately 40 years younger than the negative control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further quantify the extent of rejuvenation, we investigated the effect of MPTR using transcription clocks. Unfortunately, existing transcription clocks failed to accurately predict the age of our negative control samples. This may be due to batch effects such as differences in RNA-seq library preparation and data processing pipelines. To overcome this problem, we trained a transcription age-predictor using random forest regression on published fibroblast RNA-seq data from donors aged 1–94 years old that was batch corrected to our transient reprogramming data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>). The transcription age predictor was trained on transformed age, similar to the Horvath epigenetic clock, to account for the accelerated aging rate during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>). The final transcription age predictor had a median absolute error of 12.57 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), this error being higher than that of the epigenetic clock consistent with previous transcription age predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>). Using our predictor, we found that transient reprogramming reduced mean transcription age by approximately 30 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also observed a moderate reduction in transcription age in cells that failed to transiently reprogram (SSEA4 negative at the intermediate time point), suggesting expression of the reprogramming factors alone was capable of rejuvenating some aspects of the transcriptome. Interestingly, we observed that MPTR with longer reprogramming phases reduced the extent of rejuvenation, suggesting that 10 or 13 days may be the optimum for transcriptional rejuvenation. We note that the reduction in transcription age from MPTR appears to be greater than that recently achieved by transient transfection of the Yamanaka factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>), which was by approximately 10 years according to our transcription age predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with our approach of reprogramming further into the MP rather than only up to the end of the IP. Recently, a novel transcription clock called BiT age clock has been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer and Schumacher, 2021</xref>), which has been trained on binarized gene expression levels. This clock has a very low median absolute error, which is comparable to that of epigenetic clocks. We ran a retrained version of the BiT age clock on our data set and made similar findings to our random forest-based clock. Of note, we observed that transient reprogramming also rejuvenated the BiT age clock by approximately 20 years relative to negative controls and that 10 or 13 days of reprogramming was optimal for maximal transcriptional rejuvenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transient reprogramming reverses age-associated changes in the transcriptome and partially restores fibroblast migration speed.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) of fibroblast aging-associated gene expression levels in transient reprogramming (magenta) and reference aging fibroblast samples (light blue-dark blue).

As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lago and Puzzi, 2019</xref>), we found collagen I and IV were downregulated with age, with collagen IV demonstrating a more dramatic reduction. Notably, the expression of both genes was restored to youthful levels after transient reprogramming, though this was not significant for collagen I likely due to the small expression difference associated with age and lower number of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We then assessed by immunofluorescence whether this increased mRNA expression resulted in increased protein levels and indeed found that transient reprogramming resulted in an increase in collagen I and IV protein toward more youthful levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Fibroblasts are also involved in wound healing responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Wang, 2011</xref>), so we investigated the impact of transient reprogramming on this function using an in vitro wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We found that migration speed was significantly reduced in our control fibroblasts from middle-aged donors compared to fibroblasts from young donors (aged 20–22 years old). Transient reprogramming improved the median migration speed, however, the individual responses were quite variable and in some cases migration speed was improved and in other cases it was unaffected. Interestingly, this did not appear to correlate with other aging measures such as transcription and methylation clocks. Our data show that transient reprogramming followed by reversion can rejuvenate fibroblasts both transcriptionally and at the protein level, at least based on collagen production, and functionally at least in part. This indicates that our rejuvenation protocol can, in principle, restore youthful functionality in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Optimal transient reprogramming reverses age-associated changes in the epigenome</title><p>After finding evidence of transcriptomic rejuvenation, we sought to determine whether there were also aspects of rejuvenation in the epigenome. We initially examined global levels of H3K9me3 by immunofluorescence. H3K9me3 is a histone modification associated with heterochromatin that has been previously shown to be reduced globally with age in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), including in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>). We were able to confirm this observation and found that MPTR was able to substantially reverse this age-associated reduction back to a level comparable with fibroblasts from younger donors (with a mean age of 33 years old). Both 10 and 13 days of transient reprogramming increased global levels of H3K9me3 suggesting that this epigenetic mark, similar to the transcriptome, has a relatively broad window for rejuvenation by transient reprogramming. We also observed a slight increase in H3K9me3 levels in cells that failed to transiently reprogram, suggesting that expression of the reprogramming factors alone is capable of partially restoring this epigenetic mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), as was observed for our transcriptome-based age-predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Notably, with 13 days of transient reprogramming, we observed a substantial reduction of the median DNA methylation age—by approximately 30 years, quantitatively the same rejuvenation as we saw in the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A shorter period of transient reprogramming (10 days) resulted in a smaller reduction of DNA methylation age, consistent with our results profiling DNA methylation age throughout the reprogramming process, where DNA methylation age gradually reduced throughout the MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This epigenetic rejuvenation is potentially promoted by de novo methylation and active demethylation as the de novo methyltransferases and TET enzymes are upregulated during the MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Potentially, some of the rejuvenating mechanisms occurring in MPTR may mirror those that occur during embryonic development as epigenetic rejuvenation during embryonic development coincides with de novo methylation of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerepesi et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to the transcription clocks, we also observed a smaller reduction in DNA methylation age with longer transient reprogramming times, suggesting that some aspects of the observed epigenetic rejuvenation are lost during the reversion phase of our MPTR protocol. Potentially, extended reprogramming (for 15 or 17 days) may make reversion more difficult and result in cellular stresses that ‘re-age’ the methylome during the process. Similar results were obtained using the skin and blood clock and the Weidner clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horvath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Other epigenetic clocks were not rejuvenated by MPTR; however, we note that these clocks either rejuvenate later in the reprogramming process or are unaffected by reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that consist of repetitive sequences. Telomere length decreases with age due to cell proliferation in the absence of telomerase enzymes and is restored upon complete iPSC reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapasset et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate the effect of transient reprogramming on telomere length, we used the telomere length clock, which predicts telomere length based on the methylation levels at 140 CpG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2019b</xref>). We found that MPTR does not affect telomere length and, in some cases, slightly reduces it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with our results profiling telomere length throughout complete reprogramming using our doxycycline inducible system, where telomere length did not increase until the SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This coincides with the expression of telomerase during reprogramming, where it is weakly expressed during the later stages of the MP and only strongly expressed during the SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the locations of the rejuvenated CpG sites and found that most were individual sites spread across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Some of these individual CpG sites may be part of larger regions of rejuvenated methylation, which we are unable to fully detect due to the targeted nature of DNA methylation array profiling; however, we found a few small clusters of rejuvenated CpG sites. We found that a small region in the <italic>IRX5</italic> promoter became demethylated with age and transient reprogramming was able to partially remethylate this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). IRX5 is involved in embryonic development so demethylation of its promoter with age may lead to inappropriate expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costantini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>). We also found two regions that became hypermethylated with age and were demethylated by transient reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). One of these regions is in the <italic>GAD1</italic> promoter; encoding an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid into glutamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bu et al., 1992</xref>). The other region is within the <italic>HOXB</italic> locus, involved in anterior-posterior patterning during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, we examined whether there was any overlap between the epigenetic and transcriptional rejuvenation. We therefore annotated the rejuvenated CpG sites with the nearest gene and then overlapped this gene set with the list of genes with rejuvenated expression. We found that there was a significant overlap between these two groups suggesting that epigenetic rejuvenation and transcriptional rejuvenation may be partially linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We further examined these overlapping genes and found that several had structural roles. These included <italic>FBN2</italic> and <italic>TNXB</italic>, which encode components of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bristow et al., 1993</xref>) and <italic>SPTB</italic>, which encodes a component of the cytoskeletal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garbe et al., 2007</xref>). WISP2 was also rejuvenated transcriptionally and epigenetically; this gene is an activator of the canonical WNT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grünberg et al., 2014</xref>) and has recently been shown to inhibit collagen linearisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janjanam, 2021</xref>). ASPA and STRA6 respectively encode an enzyme that hydrolyses N-acetyl-I-aspartate and a vitamin A receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amengual et al., 2014</xref>). Neither of these genes have obvious roles in fibroblasts. We note that additional overlaps between epigenetic and transcriptional rejuvenation may exist that are not observed in our study due to the limited genomic coverage of DNA methylation arrays. Overall, our data demonstrate that transient reprogramming for 13 days (but apparently not for longer or shorter periods) represents a ‘sweet spot’ that facilitates partial rejuvenation of both the methylome and transcriptome, reducing epigenetic and transcriptional age by approximately 30 years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have developed a novel method, MPTR, where the Yamanaka factors are ectopically expressed until the MP of reprogramming is reached, and their induction is then withdrawn. MPTR rejuvenates multiple molecular hallmarks of aging robustly and substantially, including the transcriptome, epigenome, functional protein expression, and cell migration speed. Previous attempts at transient reprogramming have been restricted to the IP in order to conserve initial cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). This is a valid concern as fully reprogrammed iPSCs can be difficult to differentiate into mature adult cells and instead these differentiated cells often resemble their fetal counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hrvatin et al., 2014</xref>). With our approach, cells temporarily lose their identity as they enter the MP but, importantly, reacquire their initial somatic fate when the reprogramming factors are withdrawn. This may be the result of persisting epigenetic memory at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jadhav et al., 2019</xref>), which notably we find is not erased until the SP, as well as persistent expression of some fibroblast genes.</p><p>With our method employing longer periods of reprogramming, we observed robust and substantial rejuvenation of the whole transcriptome as well as aspects of the epigenome, with many features becoming approximately 30 years younger. This extent of rejuvenation appears to be substantially greater than what has been observed previously for transient reprogramming approaches that reprogram within the IP. The methylome appears to require longer reprogramming to substantially rejuvenate and consequently, previous work using shorter lengths of reprogramming resulted in modest amounts of rejuvenation of the methylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). However, we note that future studies are required to thoroughly compare these approaches with our method, ideally being performed in parallel on the same starting material and with the same reprogramming system, especially as different reprogramming systems can reprogram cells at different speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlaeger et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, these findings demonstrate that different parts of the epigenome undergo contrasting changes during transient reprogramming with age-associated CpG sites becoming differentially methylated during the MP and cell-identity regions remaining unchanged until the SP. The CpG sites within these two categories are distinct and the differential timing may suggest that different and potentially specific mechanisms are responsible for these changes. Telomere attrition is another aging hallmark, which can induce DNA damage and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marion et al., 2009</xref>), our reprogramming system did not induce telomere elongation until the SP, likely explaining why telomeres were not elongated by MPTR.</p><p>More recently, there have been in vivo transient reprogramming approaches that elicit similar magnitudes of rejuvenation to our in vitro MPTR method. In mice, 1 week of reprogramming induction followed by 2 weeks of recovery reversed age-associated expression changes (including collagen gene expression) and partially rejuvenated the DNA methylome in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chondronasiou et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, these outcomes closely mirror those observed in our human fibroblasts after MPTR. We note that iPSC reprogramming proceeds faster in mouse cells than in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teshigawara et al., 2017</xref>) and so this in vivo approach likely also reprograms up to the MP, supporting our findings that transient reprogramming up to the MP can substantially reverse multiple features of aging. In another recent approach, reprogramming was cyclically induced in mice for 2 days followed by 5 days of recovery for 7 months. This substantially reversed epigenetic clocks by up to 0.4 years (equivalent to 20 years in humans, similar to our system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browder, 2022</xref>). These results suggest that the rejuvenation from shorter periods of transient reprogramming is additive and when performed long term can reach the magnitude elicited by MPTR.</p><p>Quantifying the age of the transcriptome is challenging and our attempts to quantify transcriptional rejuvenation suggested varying magnitudes ranging from 20 to 40 years. In addition, we needed to apply batch correction to compare to reference aging data sets. There is a need in the field for a more robust transcription clock that can predict age accurately and can be applied to other data sets without the need to batch correct. Such a tool would be invaluable and enable us to quantify more accurately the true extent of transcriptional rejuvenation arising from MPTR.</p><p>Upon further interrogation of the transcriptomic rejuvenation, we also observed changes in genes with non-fibroblast functions. In particular, the age-associated downregulation of <italic>APBA2</italic> and the age-associated upregulation of <italic>MAF</italic> were reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). APBA2 stabilizes amyloid precursor protein, which plays a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki, 2003</xref>). MAF regulates the development of embryonic lens fibre cells, and defects in this gene lead to the development of cataracts, which are a frequent complication in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ring et al., 2000</xref>). These observations may signal the potential of MPTR to promote more general rejuvenation signatures that could be relevant for other cell types such as neurons. It will be interesting to determine if MPTR-induced rejuvenation is possible in other cell types, which could help us understand and potentially treat age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and cataracts. Potentially we may be able to rejuvenate ex vivo clinically relevant cell types and administer these rejuvenated cells as an autologous cell therapy, for example, fibroblasts rejuvenated by MPTR may be applicable for treating skin wounds and improving wound healing. In addition, we may be able to use MPTR as a screening platform to find novel candidate genes that are responsible for reversing age-associated changes during reprogramming. Potentially by targeting such genes, we may be able to reverse age-associated changes without inducing pluripotency.</p><p>In our study, we investigated different lengths of reprogramming for our MPTR method and surprisingly found that longer lengths of reprogramming did not always promote more rejuvenation in the transcriptome and epigenome. Instead, we found that 13 days of reprogramming was the optimal period and that longer lengths of reprogramming diminished the extent of transcriptional and epigenetic rejuvenation. This finding contrasts with the observations of cells undergoing complete iPSC reprogramming and highlights the importance of assessing multiple reprogramming durations when using transient reprogramming approaches.</p><p>The Yamanaka factors possess oncogenic properties, which can lead to teratoma formation when persistently overexpressed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach should avoid these properties as we only temporarily express the factors, similar to other transient reprogramming approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarkar et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst we could not find any signatures of pluripotency within the transcriptomes or methylomes of transiently reprogrammed cells, we cannot discount the possibility that a minor subset of cells within the population maintain pluripotent-like characteristics, and could therefore induce teratoma formation if transplanted in vivo. We note though that this is a proof-of-concept study and that the method will eventually require modifications to be more suitable for therapeutic applications, such as by replacing the lentiviral vectors with non-integrating vectors.</p><p>The effect of starting age is a factor that remains to be explored. In our study, we examined the effects of MPTR on fibroblasts from middle-aged donors and observed an approximately 30-year rejuvenation. It will be interesting to perform our method on fibroblasts from younger and older donors to see if the rejuvenating effect of MPTR is constant. In that case, cells would always become 30 years younger than their controls. Alternatively, the effect of MPTR may scale with starting age, with more rejuvenation being observed in cells from older donors compared to cells from younger donors. Finally, we note that multiple cycles of transient reprogramming can be performed with some approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to examine if MPTR can be performed repeatedly on cells and if this may improve the extent of rejuvenation. However, this may not be possible with our current system as telomere length is unaffected by MPTR. In addition, multiple cycles may not improve the extent of rejuvenation as there may be a minimum age that can be achieved when limiting reprogramming to the MP.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that substantial rejuvenation is possible without acquiring stable pluripotency and suggest the exciting concept that the rejuvenation program may be separable from the pluripotency program. Future studies are warranted to determine the extent to which these two programs can be separated and could lead to the discovery of novel targets that promote rejuvenation without the need for iPSC reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and lentivirus production</title><p>The doxycycline-inducible polycistronic reprogramming vector was generated by cloning a GFP-IRES sequence downstream of the tetracycline response element in the backbone FUW-tetO-hOKMS (Addgene 51543, a gift from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cacchiarelli et al., 2015</xref>).

Reprogramming was initiated 24 hr after lentiviral transduction by introducing doxycycline (2 µg/ml) to the media. Media were changed daily throughout the experiment subsequently. On day 2 of reprogramming, cells were flow sorted for viable GFP positive cells and then cultured on gelatine coated plates. On day 7 of reprogramming, cells were replated onto irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) and on day 8 of reprogramming, the medium was switched to hES medium (DMEM-F12, 20% KSR, 1× Glutamax, 1× MEM-NEAA, 1× beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.2× penicillin/streptomycin, and 8 ng/ml FGF2).

Cells were grown without doxycycline for 4 weeks in the first experiment and 5 weeks in the second experiment. Cells had returned to fibroblast morphology by 4 weeks in the second experiment, however, needed to be further expanded to generate enough material for downstream analyses. Negative control cells underwent the same procedure as the transient reprogramming cells to account for the effects of growing cells on iMEFs in hES media, flow sorting cells and keeping cells in culture for extensive periods of time.

DNA methylation age was calculated using the multi-tissue clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horvath, 2013</xref>), the skin and blood clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horvath et al., 2018</xref>), the epiTOC clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), the GrimAge clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2019a</xref>), the Hannum clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>), the PhenoAge clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levine et al., 2018</xref>), and the Weidner clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, the reference data sets included novel data examining the intermediate stages of dermal fibroblasts being reprogrammed with the CytoTune-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Invitrogen). Samples were carried forward for further analysis if they had a total read count of at least 500,000 with at least 70% of the reads mapping to genes and at least 65% of the reads mapping to exons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence and imaging</title><p>Young control dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Lonza, Gibco, and the Coriell Institute (GM04505, GM04506, GM07525, GM07545, and AG09309) and were used at passage 4 after purchase. Antibody staining was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santos et al., 2003</xref>) on cells grown on coverslips or cytospun onto coverslip after fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS for 1 hr; blocked with 1% BSA in 0.05% Tween20 in PBS (BS) for 1 hr; incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in BS; followed by wash in BS and secondary antibody. All secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor conjugated (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000 in BS and incubated for 30 min. For the morphology analysis, cells were not permeabilized and were stained with direct labeled primary antibodies. Incubations were performed at room temperature, except where stated otherwise. DNA was counterstained with 5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS. Optical sections were captured with a Zeiss LSM780 microscope (63× oil-immersion objective). Fluorescence semi-quantification analysis was performed with Volocity 6.3 (Improvision). 3D rendering of z-stacks was used for semi-quantification of collagen I and IV. Single middle optical sections were used for semi-quantification of H3K9me3.

GM04505, GM04506, GM07545, and AG09309 fibroblasts were used at passage 5 as young controls. After 24 hr, the insert was removed generating 500 µm gaps between the cell-containing areas. The dishes were imaged every 20 min for 20 hr using a Nikon Ti-E equipped with a full enclosure incubation chamber (37°C; 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and the 20× objective. The images were pre-processed by cropping and rotating so that the wound area was on the right-hand side of the image. A Fiji macro was used to generate masks of the wound healing images. The coverage of the wound by immerging cells was analyzed by measuring the intensity of the mask along a line across the image. R was used to determine the location of the wound edge by collecting all of the x coordinates where the mask intensity was high enough to indicate that it was no longer part of the wound. The wound edge at each time point was expressed relative to the starting position to obtain the distance closed. Migration speed was calculated from the gradient between distance closed and time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Downstream analyses of RNA-seq and DNA methylation data were performed using R (version 4.0.2). Ggplot2 (version 3.3.2) was used to generate the bar charts, boxplots, line plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and violin plots. ComplexHeatmap (version 2.4.3) was used to generate the heatmaps. The combat function from the package sva (version 3.36.0) was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> to batch correct the novel Sendai reprogramming data set to the other data sets.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It is discussed that fibroblast morphology is reversed. It would be good to quantify this morphological dynamics. For instance, whether cell size undergoes transition from mesenchymal to epithelial lineages and if any reversal is observed.</p><p>2. The data will strongly profit from one function test like wound healing or any other simple assay to analyze the function of the transiently reprogrammed fibroblast in comparison to the negative control for example.</p><p>3. Based on the standard protocols used for the culture of fibroblasts using culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), it is possible that the recovery of cellular identity following reprogramming is mainly due to differentiation signals coming from factors present in the medium. For these reasons, knockout serum (KSR) is used at later stages (day 8) of reprogramming to allow generation of iPSCs. The authors should rule out the possibility that recovery of fibroblast identity is due to the culture of reprogramed fibroblasts in FBS containing medium. For this purpose, the authors should test whether the fibroblast identity can be recovered following withdrawal by culturing the cell in KSR or 1% FBS containing medium instead of 10% FBS. This is a very important concept for the message that the manuscript tries to communicate regarding an epigenetic memory responsible for the recovery of fibroblast identity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Concerns/Comments</p><p>I do not get the title (it might be the multi-omic…). Rejuvenation is achieved by Yamanaka, but not by multi-omics. So, the current title does not work.</p><p>There needs to be more information provided on the fibroblast. Passage numbers, expansions etc. That is only briefly mentioned in the MaM section. Passaging might influence aging….</p><p>The PC analysis of the samples is somewhat difficult to understand and actually not very informative nor fully convincing. What would happen simply without the reference data set in the PC analysis? This should be shown.</p><p>The intermediate cells fall indeed together with the reference cells doing almost exactly the same, 10-20 days of reprogramming. In that case, it might have been nice to have a fully reprogrammed set off these sample probes (expression of 40 days of the factors), and not simply a reference set.</p><p>Within the expression PC analysis, day 10-17 fall closely together, but not so in the CpG analysis. That might need to be commented on.</p><p>Is there are real difference in Figure 1d between the transient reprogramming intermediate and the failed to transiently reprogram intermediate? That might need to be the major focus of these analyses.</p><p>This reviewer does not appreciate picking out single, individual genes like in Figure 1e or g, as the overall global changes count, not single genes. Picking on single genes might be a bit misleading for the reader, especially as it is not clear whether these genes have a central function in the whole process.</p><p>It would further strengthen the manuscript if there was more information on the limitation of the transient procedure? At which length of reprogramming will we see additional negative effects on the overall procedure? Will they still return to be fibroblast after transient reprogramming for longer periods etc? That is not really addressed.</p><p>The overall question that Figure 2 is trying to address is indeed interesting.</p><p>The type of analyses provided in Figure 2 though remain very superficial, so that at the end the question is what additional novel and informative data does Figure 2 provide other than that the transient intermediate is not a fibroblast anymore, and that after stopping of Yamanaka, they return to become fibroblasts again, which though is already part of Figure 1. Again, out of a large number of genes, only 2 are picked that share a distinct pattern, but it is not listed how many other genes might share this pattern, and whether they might then also contribute to the phenotype, nor is there an attempt to validate the function of one or the other gene in the fibroblasts.</p><p>While the data in Figure 3 is really strong, there is concern about the conclusions of data from Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 3c with respect to the optimum days of Yamanaka exposure for rejuvenation, as there is not analysis on differences among the transiently reprogrammed samples between day 10 and 17. That needs to be included to validate that statement in lines 350 and 360,361 of the manuscript (see also my comments above on limitations of the procedure).</p><p>The data will strongly profit from one function test like wound healing or any other simple assay to analyze the function of the transiently reprogrammed fibroblast in comparison to the negative control for example.</p><p>Data presented in Figure 4 is a bit redundant and for example epi-clock data is already part of Figure 1 and the new epic-clock data might be simply already included in Figure 1. For the H3K9me3 data, what is the statistics between failed to reprogram and reprogrammed? That is missing and interesting to know. The focus on the overlap of gene expression and epigenetics is highly interesting, and these analyses could be easily more expanded on, or some more information and context provided, as these genes might now be indeed more important.</p><p>Discussion lines 544 to 551. I am not sure whether that the data allows to compare directly extent of rejuvenation to other approaches, as distinct analyses have been done in these publications, and direct functional comparisons have not been done/performed. While obviously there is a great level of rejuvenation within the approach the authors introduced, whether that is substantially greater than xy might require more detail comparisons on multiple levels.</p><p>The translational aspects listed in line 571 to 574 is somewhat vague and need to be either described in more detail or simply omitted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71624.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

For instance, whether cell size undergoes transition from mesenchymal to epithelial lineages and if any reversal is observed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. To address this, we have quantified the morphological changes using confocal microscopy and measuring a ratio of roundness (the maximum length divided by the perpendicular width) of individual cells before, during and after maturation phase transient reprogramming (MPTR). Cells became temporarily rounder during MPTR (lower ratio) and then returned to an elongated state (higher ratio) which matched that of the starting fibroblasts (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Negative control fibroblasts from middle-aged donors moved more slowly than young control fibroblasts into the scratch wound and transient reprogramming partially restored migration speed, suggesting some functional rejuvenation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We planned to investigate this by growing cells in fibroblast medium containing 10% KSR instead of 10% FBS after withdrawal of doxycycline following 13 days of reprogramming, as suggested. However, we have found that human fibroblasts were unable to be cultured long-term in KSR containing media. In addition, human fibroblasts grew substantially slower in 1% FBS containing medium (the other condition suggested), which would prevent us from collecting sufficient material with our current protocol. In addition, the substantially reduced growth speed would be a confounding factor that would limit the utility of any conclusions drawn. So unfortunately, whilst it was a very good suggestion, in practise it proved not possible to do these experiments.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71624-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Concerns/Comments</p><p>I do not get the title (it might be the multi-omic…).

With 17 days of MPTR, we already observe diminished rejuvenation according to transcription and epigenetic clocks. We hypothesise that after the maturation phase, transient reprograming will be more difficult as the endogenous pluripotency factors are activated and so the reprogramming factors can no longer be reverted by withdrawing doxycycline. This point is now discussed in lines 118-120.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overall question that Figure 2 is trying to address is indeed interesting.</p><p>The type of analyses provided in Figure 2 though remain very superficial, so that at the end the question is what additional novel and informative data does Figure 2 provide other than that the transient intermediate is not a fibroblast anymore, and that after stopping of Yamanaka, they return to become fibroblasts again, which though is already part of Figure 1.

We have added the number of genes in each cluster to Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and provided the lists of gene names in supplementary file 3.

The epigenetic clock analysis in figure 1 is different in that it does not include cells that have undergone MPTR, rather epigenetic clocks are used across a reprogramming time course to define the timepoint when rejuvenation occurs.</p><p>For figure 4A, we have added statistics comparing failed to transiently reprogram and transiently reprogrammed cells.</p><p>We agree that the overlap between epigenetic and transcriptional rejuvenation is interesting, and we have expanded upon the roles of these genes in the Results section (lines 422-430).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion lines 544 to 551.
