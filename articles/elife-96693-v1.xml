caused by mutations affecting the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). To understand how CSF-1R-mutation affects human microglia – the specialized brain-resident macrophages of the central nervous system – and the downstream consequences for neuronal cells, we used a macrophage and forebrain organoid co-culture system based on induced pluripotent stem cells generated from two patients with HDLS, with <italic>CSF-1R</italic> gene-corrected isogenic organoids as controls. Macrophages derived from iPSC (iMacs) of patients exhibited a metabolic shift toward the glycolytic pathway and reduced CSF-1 sensitivity, which was associated with higher levels of IL-1β production and an activated inflammatory phenotype. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed that iMacs adopt a reactive state that leads to impaired regulation of neuronal cell populations in organoid cultures, thereby identifying microglial dysregulation and specifically IL-1β production as key contributors to the degenerative neuro-environment in HDLS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>HDLS</kwd><kwd>CSF1R</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Co-culture between donor-derived iPSC-induced macrophages and forebrain organoids revealed microglial impairment leading to the degenerative neuro-environment in HDLS.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary diffused leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) – also known as adult-onset leukodystrophy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), is a rare, inherited, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by patchy axonal swellings (spheroids) and demyelination that result in the alteration of the white matter of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marotti et al., 2004</xref>). Although detailed epidemiological data are lacking, in 2021, it was estimated that approximately a quarter of a million people globally are affected by the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Papapetropoulos et al., 2021</xref>); yet our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is limited, and there is no cure or even effective treatment.</p><p>For more than a decade, we have known that HDLS is caused by mutations affecting the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rademakers et al., 2011</xref>) which most often occur in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhuang et al., 2020</xref>), and lead to reduced auto-phosphorylation in response to CSF-1, which results in impaired downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhuang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pridans et al., 2013</xref>). These mutations most profoundly affect microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biundo et al., 2021</xref>), the specialized brain-resident macrophages that play critical roles in brain development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in a wide range of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bachiller et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with HDLS have few, small, microglia that are distributed abnormally within the neocortex and that express low levels of the homeostatic marker P2RY12 and high levels of the inflammatory marker CD68, compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kempthorne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Konno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tada et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies aiming to understand the pathophysiology of HDLS have used various approaches. Rodent models have been generated, but do not faithfully recapitulate the disease phenotype in humans: the earliest haplo-insufficient Csf-1r<sup>+/−</sup> mice model exhibited microgliosis within brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chitu et al., 2015</xref>), but this was not recapitulated in a later Csf-1r knockout rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patkar et al., 2021</xref>) while a subsequent orthologous mouse model has phenocopied the reduced microglia density seen in patients with HDLS but does not exhibit brain pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stables et al., 2022</xref>). A zebrafish model of HDLS similarly saw reduced microglia during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdowski et al., 2022</xref>), but does not offer the opportunity to study pathology associated with adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). To overcome these species-specific limitations, in this study we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages from patients with HDLS and used them to create microglia-sufficient autologous brain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Park et al., 2023</xref>) in which we characterized the effects of naturally occurring <italic>CSF-1R</italic> mutation on microglial function. By comparing iPSC-derived macrophages to genetically corrected macrophages from the same patients, we uncovered evidence of significant transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming that was associated with profound changes to neuronal regulation by these cells, indicative of the likely mechanistic links between microglial dysfunction and HDLS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of iPSC lines from patients with HDLS</title><p>We first isolated dermal fibroblasts from skin biopsies taken from two patients with HDLS and confirmed mutations in the TDK region of the <italic>CSF-1R</italic> gene (HD1, HD2; clinical characteristics shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>) then cultured them for approximately 4 weeks before reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Four to five weeks post-transfection, we observed iPSC-like colonies emerging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and 7–10 days later, we selected those clones that were proliferating and displayed typical iPSC morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We also confirmed that these clones had normal karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and termed them Mut HD1 and Mut HD2. One clone per cell line was used for further analysis. We then generated isogenic from Mut HD1 and Mut HD2 iPSC cell lines which we termed IsoHD1 and IsoHD2, respectively, as controls (see Methods).

Briefly, iPSCs were initially inducted toward the mesodermal lineage before being differentiated into hemangioblast-like cells with the potential to differentiate into both endothelial and hematopoietic progenitors – the latter emerging as free-floating cells as early as day 6 after seeding – which we collected and then terminally differentiated into iMacs by the addition of CSF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although HDLS mutation downregulates the sensitivity of CSF-1R to its ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pridans et al., 2013</xref>), we were able to successfully generate iMacs using this protocol: the yield of iMacs from iPSC varied between cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but flow cytometry confirmed their consistent macrophage-like phenotype, with abundant expression of CD45 and CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and Giemsa staining showed that iMacs exhibited comparable morphology between donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We therefore compared the survival of our mutant and isogenic cells lines from both patients during culture with CSF-1. As expected, even with high concentrations of CSF-1, relatively few mutant cells survived across 7 days of culture; by contrast, even low CSF-1 levels allowed significantly more isogenic cells to survive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we generated iMacs from iPSC of patients with HDLS and their respective isogenic controls that exhibit typical macrophage morphology, phenotype, and phagocytic capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutant and isogenic control iMacs have distinct gene expression profiles</title><p>Although iMacs derived from patients with HDLS exhibited core macrophage features, we wanted to more fully understand the impact of <italic>CSF-1R</italic> mutation on these cells.

Interestingly, we did not detect any change in the NPC population for either HD1 or HD2 after co-culture, likely because their numbers were relatively low to begin with due to the cellular composition of the forebrain organoid. Similarly, the iMac population was also small in all co-cultures. Transcriptomic analysis of the neurons of HD2 co-culture saw the mutant iMac co-culture having upregulated expression of genes associated with mitochondrial respiration (BCS1L, MRPL18, TSFM, MRPL11, MRPS30) but this phenomenon was not present in the isogenic iMac co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Conversely, transcriptomic analysis of the NPCs of HD2 co-culture saw the isogenic iMac co-culture having upregulated expression of genes associated with mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Efforts to elucidate the functional or dysfunctional aspects of the causative mutations in the <italic>CSF-1R</italic> gene have been hampered by the lack of an accurate disease model that recapitulates the human pathology: although rodent and zebrafish models have been generated and imparted valuable insights toward HDLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chitu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patkar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stables et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berdowski et al., 2022</xref>), discrepancies and limitations in each case have led to incomplete recapitulation of the disease’s pathology, specifically in microglia numbers within brain regions and the effects on respective cognitive and sensorimotor tests. Additionally, a model looking into immune-neuronal crosstalk to better understand a neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily associated with microgliopathy, is important to advance the field. Here, we first generated iPSC lines from two patients with HDLS and then used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to reinstate a fully functional <italic>CSF-1R</italic> gene into some of the lines. While the generation of an HDLS donor-derived iPSC cell line has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), no other in vitro studies have yet reverted the causative mutation to wild type; a necessary step to understanding the direct impacts of diminished/absent CSF-1R signaling.</p><p>We then generated and characterized iMacs – precursors of microglia – from these lines, which exhibited typical morphology, phenotype, and phagocytic capacity that were not obviously affected by <italic>CSF-1R</italic> mutation. Although we were able to generate phenotypically and functionally similar iMac across these lines for example for phagocytic capability, iMac yield varied greatly between the cell lines with a 50% lower yield for Mut HD1 compared to IsoHD1 and, conversely, a higher yield for Mut HD2 200% compared to IsoHD2. This fundamental difference could be attributed to their respective mutations: the nonsense mutation identified in HD2 could not only more profoundly affect receptor signaling, but might also be a major factor during the course of gene editing leading to incomplete reversion to wild type at the epigenetic level, which we speculate was not the case for IsoHD1. Additionally, this observation could also be attributable to a reduced CSF-1 sensitivity in HD2 Mut iMacs as compared to HD1 Mut iMacs and we speculate that this would potentially give rise to the generation and subsequent maintenance of immature iMacs that lacks maturation even after terminally differentiated into tissue-resident macrophages.</p><p>Functionally, while phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> beads was similar across lines, the baseline cytokine production as well as after phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cell line was different with an increase of IL-1β secretion in both mutant HD1 and HD2, compared to isogenic HD1 and HD2 iMacs. In the case of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, this was not due to a difference in phagocytic activity as all cells were able to phagocytose apoptotic cells at a similar level. Importantly, higher levels of baseline pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in the control group without apoptotic cells were observed within HD1 mutant, and both HD1 and HD2 mutant iMacs, respectively. This suggests that mutant iMacs are innately in a more reactive or activated state when compared to isogenic iMacs and could reflect the reactive phenotype of HDLS-associated microglia and macrophage identified in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kempthorne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tada et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, isogenic iMacs seems to adopt less of the reactive phenotype with the reverted mutation as identified with an overall lesser cytokine production level. Importantly, such reactive phenotype was also highlighted by our transcriptomic and metabolic profiling with upregulated pathways involving pro-inflammatory cytokines and preferential utilization of the glycolytic pathways in the mutant groups, a feature of macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Viola et al., 2019</xref>), respectively.</p><p>We subsequently incorporated donor-specific and their isogenic controls into a co-culture system using 3D forebrain organoids and iPSC-derived macrophages to better study HDLS. Isogenic and mutant iMacs co-cultured separately with their respective isogenic forebrain organoid differentiate into microglia-like cells with 23 days of co-culture as shown by the expression of the microglial marker IBA-1, their ramified morphology as well as their transcriptomic profiles with upregulation of genes associated with biological pathways that are typical of microglia functions such as neurodevelopment, neurodifferentiation, neurogenesis, and brain development.</p><p>Subsequently, we analyzed the size of the organoids before and after co-culture as we recently showed that addition of iMac modulated NPC differentiation, limiting their proliferation and promoting axonogenesis, resulting in a reduction of co-culture organoid size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Park et al., 2023</xref>). Here, while we noticed a significant decreased in the size of isogenic HD1 forebrains co-cultured with isogenic HD1 iMac compared to isogenic HD1 organoids, we did not measure any significant change in organoid size in the isogenic HD1 organoids co-cultured with mutant HD1 iMacs. This suggested that the crosstalk between iMicro and NPC is dysregulated in the context of the HD1 mutation. Since we showed that such size reduction is mediated by cholesterol transfer from iMicro to NPC, further work will be required to characterize cholesterol metabolism of HD iMac.</p><p>While we did not observe major changes in cell type composition in these co-cultures, transcriptomic analysis of neuronal and NPC population after co-culture showed an increase in mitochondrial respiratory pathways associated genes in the mutant HD2 iMac co-culture neuron and isogenic HD2 iMac co-culture NPCs population, respectively. This suggests increased metabolic rates in these respective populations that are contributed to by the different variants of iMac during co-culture, and show that mutated iMicro can change the states of non-mutated isogenic organoid cells. A parallel process in vivo would likely have profound long-term consequences for brain development and homeostasis.</p><p>Altogether, we propose that CSF-1R mutation in HDLS may cause subtle yet impactful disruptions to microglia homeostasis due to abnormal metabolic functions in the developing fetal brain, that subsequently compound and result in aberrant microglia functions during adulthood. This could also be mediated by upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL-1β at a basal level or upon clearing of cellular debris during development and adulthood homeostasis. IL-1β is of particular interest as numerous studies reported the role of IL-1β in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration especially within the field of Alzheimer’s disease: for example, postmortem brain sample analysis revealed elevated levels of Il-1β production, including around amyloid beta plaques; all suggestive of pathology-associated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cacabelos et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shaftel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Italiani et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we speculate that in CSF-1R<sup>+/−</sup> mutant microglia, which already have a predisposition toward increased secretion of IL-1β, are constantly being activated by IL-1β, either autocrine or paracrine, creating a dysfunctional neuro-environment that contributes to HDLS pathology. As such, experimental models looking to block or reduce IL-1β levels in the brain using the human mAb, canakinumab, targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ridker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>), during both health and disease could be a potential target for therapy and may help to ameliorate HDLS pathology.</p><p>While no model perfectly recapitulates the full complexity of a disease, the application of iPSC-derived organoid co-culture approaches to primary patient-derived cells offers a valuable way to study the disease mechanisms of this rare pathology using human cells.

The authors aimed to understand how mutations in the gene CSF-1R affect microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, and which alterations and factors lead to the specific pathophysiology. To model the human brain with the pathophysiology of HDLS, they used the human-specific model system of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived forebrain organoids with integrated iPSC-derived microglia (iMicro) from patients with the HDLS-causing mutation and an isogenic cell line with the corrected genome. They found that iPSC-derived macrophages (iMac) with HDLS mutations showed changes in their response, including increased inflammation and altered metabolism. Additionally, they studied these iMacs in forebrain organoids, where they differentiate into iMicro, and showed transcriptional differences in isolated iMicro when carrying the HDLS mutation. In addition, the authors described the influence of the mutation within iMicro on the transcriptional level of neurons and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the organoid. They observed that the one mutation showed implications for impaired development of neurons, possibly contributing to the progression of the disease. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying HDLS and emphasizes the importance of studying diseases like these with a suitable model system. These findings, while promising, represent only an initial step towards understanding HDLS and similar neurodegenerative diseases, and thus, their direct translation into new treatment options remains uncertain.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the work lies in the successful reprogramming of two HDLS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with different mutations, which is crucial for the study of HDLS using human forebrain organoid models. The use of corrected isogenic iPSC lines as controls increases the validity of the mutation-specific observations. In addition, the model effectively mimics HDLS, particularly concerning deficits in the frontal lobe, mirroring observations in the human brain. Obtaining iPSCs from patients with different CSF1R mutations is particularly valuable given the limitations of rodent and zebrafish models when studying adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. The study also highlights significant metabolic changes associated with the CSF1R mutation, particularly in the HD2 mutant line, which is confirmed by the HD1 line. In addition, the work shows transcriptional upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in cells carrying the mutation, particularly when they phagocytose apoptotic cells, providing further insight into disease mechanisms.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Most of the points have been addressed in the revision, but some points remain (see below) and are well within the scope of the current manuscript in this reviewer's opinion.</p><p>(1) The characterization of iMicros is incomplete, with limited protein-level analysis (e.g. validate RNA-seq data via flow cytometry, ELISA etc.).</p><p>(2) Additionally, the claim of microglial-like morphology lacks adequate evidence, as the provided image is insufficient for such an assessment (also the newly provided Supp. Fig. 3C is insufficient and looks rather like background). Show single channels for each staining. Show examples for both cell lines.</p><p>(3) RNA-seq experiments are still difficult to read. A combination of data from both lines into one big analysis would be advantageous. E.g. showing overlapping GO terms for both lines. What is common, what is different in both lines?</p><p>(4) Statistical test information is missing in the legends.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"
