(T4SS) more than 300 proteins into macrophages, its main host cell in humans. Certain of these proteins are implicated in reprogramming the metabolism of infected cells by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) early after infection. Here. we show that despite reduced OXPHOS, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub>) is maintained during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). We reveal that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a T4SS-dependent manner, which leads to a conservation of the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub>, preserves mitochondrial polarization, and prevents macrophage cell death. Analyses of T4SS effectors known to target mitochondrial functions revealed that <italic>Lp</italic>Spl is partially involved in conserving the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub>, but not LncP and MitF. The inhibition of the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-induced ‘reverse mode’ of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase collapsed the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and caused cell death in infected cells. Single-cell analyses suggested that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in hMDMs that conserved the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and showed delayed cell death. This direct manipulation of the mode of activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is a newly identified feature of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> allowing to delay host cell death and thereby to preserve the bacterial replication niche during infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic></kwd><kwd>OXPHOS</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>FOF1-ATPase</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial membrane potential</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchrieser</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU201903007847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchrieser</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006367</institution-id><institution>Association Instituts Carnot</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INNOV-SP10-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escoll</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>French National Research Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 21- CE15- 0038- 01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escoll</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During infection, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> reverses the ATP-synthase activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to ATP-hydrolase activity in a type 4 secretion-dependent manner to prevent early cell death, thereby preserving its replication niche.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beyond their essential role in cellular bioenergetics, mitochondria are integrated into diverse signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells and perform various signaling functions, such as immune responses or cell death, as they play crucial roles in the regulation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bock and Tait, 2020</xref>). Thus, mitochondria are targeted by several intracellular bacteria during infection to modulate their functions to the bacterial advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spier et al., 2019</xref>). One of these bacteria is <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease. We have shown previously that this pathogen targets mitochondrial dynamics during infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) by injecting type 4 secretion system (T4SS) effectors such as MitF, leading to a fragmented mitochondrial network via the recruitment of the host fission protein DNM1L to the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escoll et al., 2017b</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Legionella</italic> induced mitochondrial fragmentation at early time points such as 5 hr post-infection (hpi), when bacterial replication has not started yet, and in the absence of cell death signs. The fragmentation of mitochondrial networks provoked a T4SS-dependent reduction of mitochondrial respiration in <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected macrophages, evidencing a functional connection between mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escoll et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial respiration results from coupling the activity of five complexes in the electron transport chain (ETC) at mitochondrial cristae. In this process, the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated at the mitochondrial matrix by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are oxidized at complexes I and II where their electrons are extracted to energize the mitochondrial ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nolfi-Donegan et al., 2020</xref>). The sequential transit of these electrons through complexes I, III, and IV allows to pump protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space (IMS) and at complex IV, diatomic oxygen O<sub>2</sub> serves as the terminal electron acceptor, and H<sub>2</sub>O is formed. The increased concentration of protons [H<sup>+</sup>] at the IMS, compared to [H<sup>+</sup>] at the matrix, generates the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub>). This is necessary to produce ATP by fueling the rotation of complex V, the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, in a process termed oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nolfi-Donegan et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous studies determined that at 5 hpi <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, by altering mitochondrial dynamics, reduced OXPHOS as well as the cellular ATP content in hMDMs in a T4SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escoll et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Why <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and other species of intracellular bacteria reduce mitochondrial OXPHOS during infection of host cells remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escoll and Buchrieser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). As intracellular bacteria can obtain resources only from host cells, it has been suggested that halting mitochondrial OXPHOS during infection might benefit pathogenic bacteria by redirecting cellular resources, such as glycolytic or TCA intermediates, to biosynthetic pathways that might sustain intracellular bacterial replication instead of fueling mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escoll and Buchrieser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, it has been shown that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> redirects pyruvate to fatty acid synthesis and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> subverts the pentose phosphate pathway to increase the synthesis of nucleotides for its own intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siegl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, upon sensing bacterial lipopolysaccharides, macrophages redirect mitochondrial TCA intermediates, such as citrate or succinate, to drive specific immune functions such as the production of cytokines or the generation of antimicrobial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoll and Buchrieser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Neill and Pearce, 2016</xref>). Thus, while these metabolic shifts, which are redirecting resources from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, should be activated in macrophages to develop their antimicrobial functions, they could also benefit intracellular bacteria as more resources would be available in the cytoplasm for bacterial growth. Importantly, reduction of OXPHOS may lead to decreased Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and ATP production at mitochondria, which are events that trigger the activation of cell death programs. How intracellular bacteria withdraw OXPHOS, deal with the subsequent Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> drop, and host cell death but manage to preserve their host cell to conserve their replication niche is a question that remains poorly understood.</p><p>To answer this question, we monitored the evolution of mitochondrial polarization during infection of hMDMs by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and showed that in the absence of OXPHOS <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> regulates the enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase during infection. This allows maintaining the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and delays cell death of infected hMDMs in a T4SS-dependent manner. Our results identified a new virulence mechanism of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, namely, the manipulation of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to preserve the integrity of infected host cells and thereby the maintenance of the bacterial replication niches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Despite <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-induced reduction of mitochondrial respiration, the mitochondrial membrane potential is maintained</title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain Philadelphia JR32 impairs mitochondrial respiration during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escoll et al., 2017b</xref>). Here, we analyzed <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain Paris (Lpp) to learn whether this is a general characteristic of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. We infected hMDMs with Lpp WT or a T4SS-deficient mutant (Δ<italic>dotA</italic>) for 6 hr and analyzed their mitochondrial function compared to uninfected hMDMs by using a cellular <italic>respiratory control assay</italic> in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Nicholls, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connolly et al., 2018</xref>). This assay determines oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in basal conditions and during the sequential addition of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors. OCR variations observed indicate how mitochondrial respiration is functioning in a cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our results showed that basal respiration is significantly reduced (p&lt;0.0001) in WT-infected hMDMs compared to Δ<italic>dotA</italic>- and noninfected hMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This indicates that O<sub>2</sub> consumption, which is predominantly driven by ATP turnover and the flow of H<sup>+</sup> to the matrix through the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, is severely impaired in WT-infected hMDMs. Further analysis of OCR changes upon addition of oligomycin, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, indicated that the rate of mitochondrial respiration coupled to ATP synthesis is highly reduced in WT-infected hMDMs compared to Δ<italic>dotA</italic>- or noninfected cells. Other respiratory parameters such as proton leak were also reduced in WT-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Subsequent addition of an uncoupler to create a H<sup>+</sup> short-circuit across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), such as FCCP, allowed measuring the maximum respiration rate and the spare respiratory capacity, revealing that both were severely impaired in WT-infected cells compared to Δ<italic>dotA</italic>- and noninfected hMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Finally, inhibition of the respiratory complexes I and III with rotenone and antimycin A, respectively, measured O<sub>2</sub> consumption driven by nonmitochondrial processes, such as cytoplasmic NAD(P)H oxidases, which showed similar levels of nonmitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption in all infection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Despite a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) maintain their Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> during infection by <italic>L.</italic> <italic>pneumophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) hMDMs were infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain Paris (Lpp) wild-type (WT), a type 4 secretion system (T4SS)-deficient Δ<italic>dotA</italic> mutant, or left uninfected (noninfected).

Importantly, some of the respiratory parameters measured that are oligomycin-sensitive were reduced in Lpp-WT-infected hMDMs but not in Δ<italic>dotA</italic>-infected cells, suggesting that the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase activity may be altered during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection in a T4SS-dependent manner.</p><p>The transition of electrons across mitochondrial ETC complexes allows the extrusion of H<sup>+</sup> from the matrix to the IMS generating a H<sup>+</sup> circuit where the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is the dominant H<sup>+</sup> re-entry site during active ATP synthesis by OXPHOS. In cellular steady-state conditions, extrusion and re-entry H<sup>+</sup> fluxes across mitochondrial membranes are balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Nicholls, 2011</xref>). Therefore, any exogenous alteration of ATP turnover and/or F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase activity influences this H<sup>+</sup> circuit and might be reflected in Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> levels. Thus, we decided to quantify the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> in infected cells. We developed a miniaturized <italic>high-content</italic> assay based on kinetic measurements of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence in nonquenching conditions (10 nM), where TMRM fluorescence in mitochondria is proportional to the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connolly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duchen et al., 2003</xref>). This assay allowed to measure changes in the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> at the single-cell level and in thousands of living cells during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Image analysis showed that the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> slightly increased in Lpp-WT-, Lpp-Δ<italic>dotA</italic>-, and noninfected cell populations during the first hours of infection (1–3 hpi), and progressively decreased during the time course with no differences between the infection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Single-cell analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) showed that Lpp-WT-, Lpp-Δ<italic>dotA</italic>-, and noninfected single hMDMs showed a wide range of Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> values at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) with no significant differences between Lpp-WT- and Lpp-Δ<italic>dotA</italic>-infected hMDMs at 6 hpi.

This mechanism, which partially involves the T4SS effector <italic>Lp</italic>Spl, maintains the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and delays host cell death during infection, thus preserving bacterial replication niches in conditions where mitochondrial respiration is abruptly reduced. Indeed, not only <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, but also several other intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>, reduce mitochondrial OXPHOS during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siegl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoll and Buchrieser, 2019</xref>). OXPHOS reduction allows the pathogen to redirect cellular resources from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, which enhances glycolysis and biosynthetic pathways that can provide intracellular bacteria with resources needed for bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escoll and Buchrieser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, OXPHOS cessation in macrophages also enhances the biosynthetic pathways, leading to the synthesis of cytokines and antimicrobial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Neill and Pearce, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, OXPHOS reduction may trigger profound consequences for host cells, such as the collapse of Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> that may lead to subsequent cell death of infected cells. For macrophages, cell death is considered as a defense mechanism against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chow et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, pyroptosis of infected macrophages permits the spread of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β. Thus, for intracellular bacteria, many of which infect macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>), the death of their host cell is an obstacle as their cellular replication niche is destroyed. Therefore, while bacterial-induced reduction of OXPHOS might be beneficial for intracellular bacteria to obtain host cell resources, they need to counterbalance the consequences of OXPHOS cessation, that is, the collapse of the mitochondrial Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and subsequent cell death, to preserve their replication niches.</p><p>We have previously shown that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> T4SS effector MitF is implicated in fragmenting the mitochondrial networks of infected macrophages. These changes in the mitochondrial dynamics have a profound impact on OXPHOS that was severely impaired and accompanied by increased glycolysis in <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escoll et al., 2017b</xref>). Here, we show that, despite the impairment of mitochondrial respiration in infected cells, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> conserves the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> of host cells by inducing the ‘reverse mode’ of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase by a mechanism that is T4SS-dependent and partially mediated by the T4SS effector <italic>Lp</italic>Spl. When translocated into human cells, the S1P-lyase activity of <italic>L. pneumophila Lp</italic>Spl reduces S1P levels in infected cells and restrains autophagy, likely because S1P is involved in the initiation of autophagosome formation at MAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How <italic>Lp</italic>Spl may regulate the activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is an interesting question. Our previous analyses of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl function have shown that this protein encodes S1P lyase activity and alters the lipid profile of the host cell by decreasing sphingosine levels in infected THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rolando et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, phosphorylated lipids are critical regulators of mitochondrial functions and S1P is a potent lipid mediator that regulates various physiological processes as well as diverse mitochondrial functions such as mitochondrial respiration, ETC functioning, or mitochondrial-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernández-Corbacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nielson and Rutter, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it was reported that S1P interaction with Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) regulates ETC functioning and mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strub et al., 2011</xref>) and that a link between PHB2, ETC functioning and the activation of ‘mitoflashes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jian et al., 2017</xref>) exists, which are dynamic and transient uncouplings of mitochondrial respiration from ATP production that are partially dependent on the ‘reverse mode’ of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wei-LaPierre and Dirksen, 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible that <italic>Lp</italic>Spl modulates mitochondrial S1P levels helping the induction of the ‘reverse mode’ of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase by involving PHB2, ETC complex assembly, or the generation of mitoflashes, a fascinating possibility that we will further investigate.</p><p>The regulation of host cell death by intracellular bacteria is widely studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rudel et al., 2010</xref>).

Here, we have shown that bacterial replication occurs preferentially in those infected macrophages that are able to conserve the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> and delay cell death, a condition that is difficult to achieve in the absence of mitochondrial respiration. Thus, the manipulation of the activity of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, which allows this pathogen to use the ATP hydrolase activity to pump H<sup>+</sup> to the IMS to maintain the Δ<italic>ψ</italic><sub>m</sub> in infected cells, is a novel virulence strategy that might contribute to the fine-tuning of the timing of host cell death during bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human primary cell cultures</title><p>Human blood was collected from healthy volunteers under the ethical rules established by the French National Blood Service (EFS).

For the analysis, we first removed adapters from Illumina sequencing reads using Cutadapt software version 1.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin, 2011</xref>) and then used Sickle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">https://github.com/najoshi/sickle</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buffalo, 2021</xref>) with a quality threshold of 20 (Phred score) to trim bad quality extremities. Reads were assembled using Spades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nurk et al., 2013</xref>) and different K-mer values. The region corresponding to the gene of interest was identified by blastn, extracted, and compared to the homologous region in the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain Paris WT genome and to the antibiotic cassette sequence using blastn. The results were visually inspected with Artemis Comparison Tool (ATC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carver et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, we searched the entire genome whether off-target mutations had occurred using Bowtie 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) to perform a mapping against the genome sequence of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain Paris (NC_006368.1). SNPs and small indels were searched for with freebayes SNP caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>), and mutations and small indels were visualized in the Artemis genome viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carver et al., 2005</xref>) to analyze them (new amino acid, synonymous mutation, frameshifts, etc.). We used Samtools to find regions with no coverage (or close to zero) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Regions or positions with such anomalies were visualized and compared with the corresponding region of the assembly. This confirmed that no off-target mutations impacting the phenotype of the mutant had occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The two-sample Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, nonassumption of Gaussian distributions) was used in all data sets unless stated otherwise.

In spite of an overall reduction in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation following Legionella infection, host cell mitochondria interestingly maintain a normal mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The authors propose the effector protein, LpSpl is involved in the maintenance of Δψm by promoting &quot;reverse mode&quot; functioning of the FoF1-ATPase. It is suggested the maintenance of the membrane potential delays host death, ultimately supporting bacterial replication.</p><p>The theme of this paper is of high relevance and underscores exciting cell biology, involving aspects of host-pathogen interactions and mitochondrial biology. Over all the data is convincing, well controlled and utilised some nice methodologies. The key conclusion however needs supporting data.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>[1] The connection between LpSpl and FoF1-ATPase could simply be a coincidence. The authors suggest some viable options in the discussion, but it is hard to rationalise how this paper could be published in mid-range journal without exploring this functional aspect of LpSpl in more detail. Given the exogenously expressed LpSpl is localised to mitochondria, could some analysis be performed with this protein to ascertain the impact at mitochondria. For example, are cells expressing LpSPL more resistant to death? Does their lipid profile changed? Does the protein interact with FoF1-ATPase? This would be very challenging with the native bacterially-translocated protein (due to protein levels), but making use of the exogenous protein could greatly assist the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>To further validate the connection between LpSpl and the “reverse mode” of the mitochondrial ATPase, and in agreement with a similar comment from Reviewer #2, we have performed several of the experiments suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>First, we analyzed a complemented Δ<italic>spl</italic> mutant strain. In Figure 2H the results of the measurement of the forward/reverse mode using DCCD including the Δ<italic>spl</italic> mutant are shown. If the “reverse mode” of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is partially due to <italic>Lp</italic>Spl the decreased effect observed during infection with the Δ<italic>spl</italic> mutant should be recovered to the WT phenotype in the complemented strain (<italic>Lp</italic>Spl is expressed on a plasmid). Indeed, our experiments, performed in hMDMs isolated from 3 different donors, confirm that the complemented strain reverses the effect observed with the mutant strain (new Figure 2I).</p><p>These new results are added in Lines 233-247 it reads now:</p><p>“To confirm that LpSpl is indeed implicated in the induction of the “reverse mode” of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase we complemented the Lpp-∆spl mutant strain with a plasmid expressing LpSpl (Lpp ∆spl-spl) and infected hMDMs. […] We also found a very small but significant difference in the oxygen consumption levels exhibited by Lpp-WT- and Lpp ∆spl-infected hMDMs (p=0.0148, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), suggesting that the role of LpSpl in the induction of the “reverse mode” to maintain Δψ<sub>m</sub> during infection might partially involve the modulation of the functioning of the OXPHOS machinery.”</p><p>Secondly the reviewer suggested to analyze the lipid profile, of the Δ<italic>spl</italic> strain compared to the WT strain. Indeed, this is important<italic>,</italic> however we have already published the lipid profile of the Δ<italic>spl</italic> strain in our previous study (Rolando et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 113(7):11901-6). We showed that the levels of sphingosine were altered in infected THP1 macrophage-like cells in a <italic>Lp</italic>Spl-dependent manner (see Figure 3D in Rolando et al., 2016). As <italic>Lp</italic>Spl encodes sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase activity, <italic>Lp</italic>Spl indeed decreases sphingosine levels in the host cell. In our previous work, we have shown that sphingosine levels were decreased in Lpp-WT-infected cells compared to Lpp-Δ<italic>spl</italic>-infected cells, and this effect was reversed when we complemented the mutant strain with a plasmid expressing LpSpl. We have added our previous result now to the text. However, as discussed in the manuscript (Lines 381-384), alteration of S1P levels in mitochondria might alter in turn ETC functioning.</p><p>Lines 373-376 it reads now:</p><p>“How LpSpl may regulate the activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase is an interesting question. Our previous analyses of LpSpl function has shown that this protein indeed encodes S1P lyase activity and alters the lipid profile of the host cell by decreasing sphingosine levels in infected THP-1 cells (Rolando et al., 2016).”</p><p>Thirdly the reviewer proposed to exogenously express <italic>Lp</italic>Spl in human cells. As it is not possible to transfect hMDMs we have performed these experiments by transfecting <italic>Lp</italic>Spl in HEK-293 cells. However, for this we needed to test first if our results obtained using human primary macrophages (hMDMs) are also observed in HEK-293 cells. We thus measured the direction of the F<sub>O</sub>-F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase in these cells (forward, reverse) during infection (New Figure 2—figure supplement 1B to 1F S2B to S2F). For these experiments, we have used HEK-293 cells stably expressing the FcγRII receptor (kindly provided by Prof. Craig Roy, Traffic 11 (5): 587-600), which allow efficient internalization of IgG-opsonized <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (we opsonized bacteria using an antibody targeting <italic>Legionella</italic> flagellin). To validate Δ<italic>ψm</italic> measurements in HEK-293 cells, we monitored Δψm upon FCCP addition to non-infected cells, which decreased as expected (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and 1C). Then we measured the direction of the F<sub>O</sub>-F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase during infection using DCCD (as in Figure 2G, hMDMs). Our results showed that the Δ<italic>ψm</italic> decreased upon addition of DCCD in Lpp-WT-infected HEK-293 cells, confirming that the F<sub>O</sub>-F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase of WT-infected HEK-293 cells worked in the “reverse mode” (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). We also obtained results equivalent to those obtained in hMDMs when using the mutant strains. The results for the Δ<italic>ψm</italic> upon DCCD addition in <italic>ΔdotA</italic>-infected cells was similar to non-infected cells (meaning in “forward mode”), while results obtained in <italic>Δspl</italic>-infected HEK-293 cells showed an intermediate phenotype between the WT and the <italic>ΔdotA</italic> mutant, but significantly different to both strains (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and 1F, similar to our results obtained with hMDM cells shown in Figure 2H).</p><p>These experiments are added to the text. Lines 248-262 it reads now:</p><p>“To further analyze our results obtained in hMDMs in an easy to transfect cell model we used HEK-293 cells stably expressing the FcγRII receptor (Arasaki and Roy, 2010) as these cells allow efficient internalization of opsonized L. pneumophila. […] The change of the Δψ<sub>m</sub> upon DCCD addition in ΔdotA-infected cells were similar to those in non-infected cells, while results obtained in Δspl-infected HEK-293 cells showed an intermediate phenotype between the WT and the ΔdotA mutant, but significantly different to both strains (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and 1F).”</p><p>After we had validated our results in HEK-293 cells, we performed the experiments suggested by reviewer 1 and analyzed the resistance of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl-transfected cells to Staurosporine (STS)-induced cell death. We transfected HEK-293 cells with a plasmid expressing <italic>Lp</italic>Spl harboring a small epitope peptide, the Xpress tag (used in our previous study Rolando et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 113(7):11901-6), which allowed us to analyze by immunofluorescence exclusively those cells that were indeed transfected by using an anti-Xpress antibody. In parallel, we transfected a plasmid expressing a catalytic inactive form of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl (mutation *K366A, Rolando et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 113(7):11901-6), which also expresses the Xpress tag to exclusively analyze transfected cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). As immunofluorescence of the Xpress tag in cells transfected with a plasmid that only expresses this small epitope (without any other protein) gave extremely low intensity values, we were unable to use this plasmid as a control for our analyses. We thus decided to use a plasmid expressing GFP as control (control pMax-GFP, Lonza). Our results demonstrated that <italic>Lp</italic>Spl-WT-transfected HEK-293 cells were more resistant to STS-induced cell death compared to control plasmid-transfected cells, while cells transfected with mutated <italic>Lp</italic>Spl-*K366A showed and intermediate phenotype, at the level of % of Annexin V+ cells as well as at the level of Annexin-V fluorescence intensity, suggesting that although the K366 residue is important, is not the only site involved in the function of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl (new Figures S3F and S3G). These new results have been added as figures S3E, F and G and in the text.</p><p>Lines 309 – 322 it reads now:</p><p>“If the induction of the “reverse mode” in the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase prevents drops in Δψ<sub>m</sub>, and this delays cell death, transfection of LpSpl might protect cells from exogenously induced cell death. […] Thus, LpSpl induced “reverse mode” of the mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase might protect cells from infection-independent forms of cell death.”</p><p>Taken together, our new results shown in Figures S2 and S3 strengthen the manuscript by adding a new cell type that reproduces the model shown in hMDMs with respect to the role of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl in the functioning of the F<sub>O</sub>-F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase during infection and by showing the effects of transfected <italic>Lp</italic>Spl protein in the resistance of cells to exogenously-induced cell death. The new methods used and associated details have been added to the Methods section (Lines 444-458-546, 508-510).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>[1] Is the phenotype presented also apparent in JR32 (lines 113 and 114).

We have performed these experiments and have added the results as new Figure S2A (old Figure S2 is now Figure S3).

This is in line with our results that suggest that <italic>Lp</italic>SPL affects the hydrolase activity of the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase (reverse mode), which should be downstream of OCR inhibition. In our model, OXPHOS cessation is partially mediated by MitF-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation (Escoll et al. 2017). Therefore, mutating the <italic>spl</italic> gene in <italic>Legionella</italic> may not have an effect on the OCR of infected hMDMs. In addition, as shown in Figure 2H, the effect of <italic>Lp</italic>SPL in the induction of the “reverse mode” is partial, suggesting that also other effectors and/or mechanisms participate, further providing an explanation why hMDMs infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-WT and Δ<italic>spl</italic> mutant strain show similar OCR values.

Based on the assumption that the F0F1-ATPase activity can influence the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), they conducted the TMRM fluorescence-based kinetic measurement of the Δψm. The result of the analysis suggested that L. pneumophila can maintain the Δψm by manipulating the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) under the basal condition despite a significant reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). On these bases, they conducted the TMRM analysis combined with usage of the F0F1-ATPase inhibitors to identify which activity mode the F0F1-ATPase has (&quot;Forward&quot; or &quot;Reverse&quot;) when the cells are infected with L. pneumophila. The kinetics of the Δψm was consistent with their model that L. pneumophila infection induces the &quot;Reverse Mode&quot; of the ATPase, which can be partly mediated by a L. pneumophila effector LpSpl. They also utilized the &quot;Reverse Mode&quot; specific inhibitor, BTB, to further support the model. Finally, they conducted the detection of early apoptosis by measuring Annexin-V with or without BTB-treatment. From the data, they concluded that the biological significance of the L. pneumophila-induced &quot;Reverse Mode&quot; of mitochondrial ATPase was for prevention of early cell death to preserve the replication niche.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The involvement of LpSpl for maintaining the Δψm was supported by only one data (Figure 2H).

These results suggest that, even if basal respiration is highly reduced in WT-infected cells compared to Δ<italic>dotA</italic>- or non-infected hMDMs, the percentage of mitochondrial respiration allocated to produce ATP in WT-infected cells is not very different in all infection conditions. Accordingly, proton leak in WT-infected cells was minimal. Therefore, the results of coupling efficiency in WT-infected cells suggest that decreased ATP production observed in these WT-infected cells in our previous work (Escoll et al. Cell Host and Microbe 2017, Figure 5D) is caused by decreased basal respiration at 6 hpi (Escoll et al. Cell Host and Microbe 2017, Figure 5E, and this manuscript, Figure 1B), and not by a decreased efficiency in the coupling of mitochondrial respiration to ATP production in infected cells.

This study builds on important advances of the team on this subject, as they previously reported how L. pneumophila effector proteins fragment the mitochondrial network at early time points of infection. Mitochondrial fragmentation and the accompanying reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) normally lead to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. Surprisingly this is not observed in Lp-infected cells. Thus, the authors investigate whether Lp can interfere with these processes to preserve its replicative niche.</p><p>They indeed observe that Lp-induced mitochondrial fragmentation is accompanied by a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. However, Lp seems to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing the reverse mode of the mitochondrial FoF1 ATPase, by a mechanism that depends on the activity of the Type 4 Secretion System (T4SS), suggesting involvement of bacterial effectors. Indeed, by screening Lp effectors targeting mitochondria, the authors show that LpSpl is partially involved in this process. Importantly, inhibition of the reverse mode of the mitochondrial ATPase is detrimental for Lp infections and trigger cell death. Correlative analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell death and size of Legionella-containing vacuoles seems to indicate that Lp replicates preferentially in cells that preserve membrane potential and are thus protected from cell death.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors convincingly show how Lp induces the reverse mode of the mitochondrial FoF1 ATPase to preserve membrane potential during infection, which is a very important finding per se. However, the absence of a molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon dampens the impact that the manuscript might have on the community.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by Reviewers #1 and #2, we have performed experiments using the complemented strain (infection) and exogenously expressed <italic>Lp</italic>Spl effector (transfection) in order to strengthen the connection between <italic>Lp</italic>Spl and the effects observed in the F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase and cell death. These results are shown in new Figures 2I, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B to 1F, and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1E to 1G.</p><p>Thanks to these experiments performed during the review process of this manuscript we now have new tools to further investigate in detail the molecular mechanisms employed by LpSpl during infection. Indeed, we have provided first clues in new Figures S3F and S3G, where we showed that residue K366 is important for <italic>Lp</italic>Spl functions delaying host cell death. Transfection of a <italic>Lp</italic>Spl protein harboring a point mutation in this site (*K366A) had a reduced ability to protect transfected HEK-293 cells from STS-induced cell death compared to WT protein (new Figure S4B), highlighting the importance of this residue. We showed in a previous paper that the K366A mutation drastically decreased the activity of the enzyme (Rolando et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 113(7):11901-6). According to the <italic>Lp</italic>Spl structure, this residue is solvent-exposed in the active site and belongs to the same loop as K353, which forms a Schiff base with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the cofactor that SPL uses to irreversibly degrade S1P into phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal. In the human SPL structure, the equivalent residue to K366 (K359) is also solvent-exposed in the active site and is 7Å from the phosphate group of PLP. Due to its proximity to the PLP and putative substrate-binding region, it is thought that the <italic>Lp</italic>Spl K366A mutation affects interactions with the cofactor and/or substrate. Thus, our experiments revealed that the enzymatic activity of <italic>Lp</italic>Spl protein and its interaction with the PLP cofactor, which leads to the irreversible degradation of S1P, are imperative to protect transfected HEK-293 cells from STS-induced cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 1 The TMRM approach convincingly shows that there is no significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential between non-infected, WT Lp-infected and DdotA-infected cells. The charts presented in figure 1D and E would greatly benefit from the integration of an additional condition where mitochondrial fragmentation is induced in non-infected cells to demonstrate the efficiency of the TMRM approach in monitoring loss-of-potential.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have performed these experiments (also asked for by Reviewer #2) in hMDMs isolated from 3 different donors. They confirmed our results (new Figure 1E and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D). Our results in hMDMs isolated from Donor #2 using FCCP to completely depolarize mitochondria have been included in Figure 1E, and the entire single-cell dataset from the 3 donors used for these experiments has been added to the supplementary Figure S1 as new panel D.</p><p>We have updated the text in Lines 159-164, it reads now:</p><p>“Single-cell analyses (Figure 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) showed that Lpp-WT-, Lpp-∆dotA- and non-infected single hMDMs showed a wide range of Δψ<sub>m</sub> values at any time-point (Figure S1C) with no significant differences between Lpp-WT- and Lpp-∆dotA-infected hMDMs at 6 hpi. Infected cells with both strains showed a significantly higher Δψ<sub>m</sub> compared to non-infected cells (p&lt;0.0001, Figure 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On line 240 of page 8, the authors state that OXPHOS cessation and collapse of membrane potential can trigger cell death. Given that this is at the basis of the proposed model, it would be important to test this hypothesis in non-infected cells and compare the percentage of living cells with infected cells. This would also help the reader interpreting the data presented in chart 4A as the variations in living cells are minimal (albeit significant) among the conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed these experiments in non-infected cells by adding FCCP to fully collapse the Δ<italic>ψm</italic>, and then we have compared the % of living cells to non-treated cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Our results show that the FCCP-induced collapse of the Δ<italic>ψm</italic> decreased the % of living cells (Annexin-V <sup>neg</sup> cells), as expected. These results, shown in new Figure S3A, now provide reference values to interpret the data shown in Figure 4A, as the Reviewer suggested. Results of % of living cells obtained in infected cells (Figure 4A) can be now compared to intact non-infected cells as well as to non-infected cells with fully collapsed Δ<italic>ψm</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>These results are added in Line 281-284, it reads now:</p><p>“To test this hypothesis, we first measured the percentage of living cells after a FCCP treatment of 18 h. An FCCP-induced collapse of the Δψm reduced the percentage of living cells by 32% compared to non-treated hMDMs (p = 0.0094, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using the size of bacterial vacuole as a proxy for bacterial replication in charts 4F and G seems like an odd choice as vacuole size is not necessarily indicative of bacterial replication. Measuring the size of intracellular bacterial &quot;colonies&quot; or, even better, their fluorescence intensity using fluorescently-tagged Lp would be a far better option.</p></disp-quote><p>As we measured the area (μm<sup>2</sup>) of GFP bacteria inside infected cells in Figures 4F and 4G, in order to avoid confusion and in agreement with Reviewer’s suggestion, we changed the term “<italic>bacterial vacuole</italic>” by the term “the area of GFP expressing bacteria, a proxy for intracellular replication”, which was increased in infected cells when 12 hpi and 18 hpi were compared (Figures 4F and 4G). Accordingly, the main text and the legend of Figure 4 were changed as follows:</p><p>Line 332-338 now reads:</p><p>“Furthermore we correlated the area of GFP expressing bacteria, a proxy for intracellular replication, with the Δψm and cell death at the single-cell level (12 and 18 hpi, Figure 4F and 4G respectively).
