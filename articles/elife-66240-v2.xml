Loss of daylight vision typically occurs due to the dysfunction/loss of cone photoreceptors, the cell type that initiates our color and high-acuity vision. Currently, there is no effective treatment for RP, other than gene therapy for a limited number of specific disease genes. To develop a disease gene-agnostic therapy, we screened 20 genes for their ability to prolong cone photoreceptor survival in vivo. Here, we report an adeno-associated virus vector expressing Txnip, which prolongs the survival of cone photoreceptors and improves visual acuity in RP mouse models. A <italic>Txnip</italic> allele, C247S, which blocks the association of Txnip with thioredoxin, provides an even greater benefit. Additionally, the rescue effect of Txnip depends on lactate dehydrogenase b (Ldhb) and correlates with the presence of healthier mitochondria, suggesting that Txnip saves RP cones by enhancing their lactate catabolism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited eye disease affecting around one in every 4,000 people. It results from genetic defects in light sensitive cells of the retina, called photoreceptor cells, which line the back of the eye. Though vision loss can occur from birth, retinitis pigmentosa usually involves a gradual loss of vision, sometimes leading to blindness. Rod photoreceptors, which are responsible for vision in low light, are impacted first. The disease then affects cone photoreceptors, the cells that detect light during the day, providing both color and sharp vision.</p><p>Around 100 mutated genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa have been identified, but only a handful of families with one of these mutant genes have been treated with a gene therapy specific for their mutated gene. There are currently no therapies available to treat the vast number of people with this disease. The mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa directly affect the rod cells that detect dim light, leading to loss of night vision. There is also an indirect effect that causes cone photoreceptors to stop working and die. One theory to explain this two-step disease process relates to the fact that cone photoreceptors are very active cells, requiring a high level of energy, nutrients and oxygen. If surrounding rod cells die, cone photoreceptors may be deprived of some essential supplies, leading to cone cell death and daylight vision loss.</p><p>To examine this theory, Xue et al. tested a new gene therapy designed to alleviate the potential shortfall in nutrients. The experiments used three different strains of mice that had the same genetic mutations as humans with retinitis pigmentosa. The gene therapy used a virus, called adeno-associated virus (AAV), to deliver 20 different genes to cone cells. Each of the 20 genes tested plays a different role in cells’ processing of nutrients to provide energy. After administering the treatment, Xue et al. monitored the mice to see whether or not their vision was affected, and how cone cells responded.</p><p>Only one of the 20 genes, <italic>Txnip</italic>, delivered using gene therapy, had a beneficial effect, prolonging cone cell survival in all three mouse strains. The mice that received <italic>Txnip</italic> also retained their ability to discern moving stripes on vision tests. Further investigations demonstrated that activating <italic>Txnip</italic> forced the cones to start using a molecule called lactate as an energy source, which could be more available to them than glucose, their usual fuel. These cells also had healthier mitochondria – the compartments inside cells that produce and manage energy supplies. This dual effect on fuel use and mitochondrial health is thought to be the basis for the extended cone survival and function.</p><p>These experiments by Xue et al. have identified a good gene therapy candidate for treating retinitis pigmentosa independently of which genes are causing the disease. Further research will be required to test the safety of the gene therapy, and whether its beneficial effects translate to humans with retinitis pigmentosa, and potentially other diseases with unhealthy photoreceptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>cone photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>retinal metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY030951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Yunlu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01EY025497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cepko</surname><given-names>Constance L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007817</institution-id><institution>Alcon Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cepko</surname><given-names>Constance L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Astellas Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cepko</surname><given-names>Constance L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cepko</surname><given-names>Constance L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AAV-Txnip prolongs vision in mouse models of blindness, enhancing lactate catabolism, mitochondrial health, and ATP production in a condition that likely has a limited glucose supply.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most prevalent types of inherited retinal diseases affecting approximately 1 in ~4,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>). In RP, the rod photoreceptors, which initiate night vision, are primarily affected by the disease genes and degenerate first. The degeneration of cones, the photoreceptors that initiate daylight, color, and high-acuity vision, then follows, which greatly impacts the quality of life. Currently, one therapy that holds great promise for RP is gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maguire et al., 2019</xref>). This approach has proven successful for a small number of genes affecting a few disease families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cehajic-Kapetanovic et al., 2020</xref>). However, due to the number and functional heterogeneity of RP disease genes (≈100 genes that primarily affect rods, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/">https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/</ext-link>), gene therapy for each RP gene will be logistically and financially difficult. In addition, a considerable number of RP patients do not have an identified disease gene. A disease gene-agnostic treatment aimed at prolonging cone function/survival in the majority of RP patients could thus benefit many more patients. Given that the disease gene is typically not expressed in cones, and thus their death is due to non-autonomous mechanisms that may be in common across affected families, answers to the question of why cones die may provide an avenue to a widely applicable therapy for RP. To date, the suggested mechanisms of cone death include oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komeima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wellard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), and a shortage of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Punzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In 2009, we surveyed gene expression changes that occurred during retinal degeneration in four mouse models of RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>). Those data led us to suggest a model wherein cones starve and die due to a shortage of glucose, which is typically used for energy and anabolic needs in photoreceptors via glycolysis. Evidence of this ‘glucose shortage hypothesis’ was subsequently provided by orthogonal approaches from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These studies have inspired us to test 20 genes that might affect the uptake and/or utilization of glucose by cones in vivo in three mouse models of RP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Only one gene, <italic>Txnip</italic>, had a beneficial effect, prolonging cone survival and visual acuity in these models. <italic>Txnip</italic> encodes an α-arrestin family member protein with multiple functions, including binding to thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Junn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>), facilitating removal of the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), and promoting the use of non-glucose fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeBalsi et al., 2014</xref>). Because α-arrestins are structurally distinct from the visual or β-arrestins, such as ARR3, Txnip is unlikely to bind to opsins or to participate in phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Puca and Brou, 2014</xref>). We tested a number of <italic>Txnip</italic> alleles and found that one allele, C247S, which blocks the association of Txnip with thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patwari et al., 2006</xref>), provided the greatest benefit. Investigation of the mechanism of Txnip rescue revealed that it required lactate dehydrogenase b (Ldhb), which catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. Imaging of metabolic reporters demonstrated an enhanced intracellular ATP:ADP ratio when the retina was placed in lactate medium. Moreover, by several measures, mitochondria appeared to be healthier as a result of Txnip addition, but this improvement was not sufficient for cone rescue.</p><p>The above observations led to a model wherein Txnip shifts cones from their normal reliance on glucose to enhanced utilization of lactate, as well as marked improvement in mitochondrial structure and function. Analysis of the rescue activity of several additional genes predicted to affect glycolysis provided support for this model. Finally, as our goal is to rescue cones that suffer not only from metabolic challenges, but also from inflammation and oxidative damage, we tested Txnip in combination with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative damage genes, and found additive benefits for cones. These treatments may benefit cones not only in RP, but also in other ocular diseases where similar environmental stresses are present, such as in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Txnip prolongs RP cone survival and visual acuity</title><p>We delivered genes that might address a glucose shortage and/or mismanagement of metabolism in a potentially glucose-limited environment. To this end, 12 AAV vectors were constructed to test genes singly or in combination for an initial screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Subsequently, an additional set of AAV vectors were made based upon the initial screen results, as well as other rationales, to total 20 genes tested in all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Most of these vectors carried genes to augment the utilization of glucose, such as hexokinases, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Each AAV vector used a cone-specific promoter, which was previously found to be non-toxic at the doses used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). An initial screen was carried out in <italic>rd1</italic> mice, which harbor a null allele in the rod-specific gene, <italic>Pde6b</italic>. This strain has a rapid loss of rods, followed by cone death. The vectors were subretinally injected into the eyes of neonatal <italic>rd1</italic> mice, in combination with a vector using the human red opsin (RedO) promoter, to express a histone 2B-GFP fusion protein (AAV-RedO-H2BGFP). The H2BGFP provides a very bright cone-specific nuclear labeling, enabling automated quantification. As a control, eyes were injected with AAV-RedO-H2BGFP alone. <italic>Rd1</italic> cones begin to die at ≈postnatal day 20 (P20) after almost all rods have died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The number of <italic>rd1</italic> cones was quantified by counting the H2BGFP+ cells using a custom-made MATLAB program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because ~11,000 <italic>rd1</italic> cones were counted in the central ½ radius of retina before their death at P20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we estimated ~20% H2BGFP labeling efficiency using data for wildtype mice for comparison (i.e., ~50,000 cones within ½ radius of wildtype retina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeon et al., 1998</xref>), with this injection dose. Only cones within the central ½ radius region of the retina were counted since RP cones in the periphery die much later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>). Among the vectors with individual or combinations of genes, only Txnip preserved <italic>rd1</italic> cones at P50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The effects were likely on cone survival as it did not change the number of cones at P20 prior to their death, but did provide survival benefit by ~P30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). The level of Txnip rescue in P50 <italic>rd1</italic> cones was comparable to that seen using AAV with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to express a transcription factor, Nrf2, that regulates anti-oxidation pathways and reduces inflammation, as we found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

This promoter also led to prolonged cone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Cone survival was evaluated after the majority of central cones had died, with different ages for different strains, based upon our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>).

The rescue effect did not persist long term, however, as by P240 in the <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> strain it was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To determine if Txnip-transduced mice sustained greater visual performance than control RP mice, an optomotor assay was used to measure maximal visual threshold for spatial frequency (i.e., visual acuity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prusky et al., 2004</xref>). Under conditions that simulated daylight, Txnip-transduced eyes showed enhanced visual acuity compared to the control contralateral eyes in <italic>rd10</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>rd1</italic> strain degenerates so quickly that it could not be evaluated in this assay.

No effect was observed in <italic>rd10</italic> mice transduced with Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Txnip also was evaluated for effects on cones in wildtype (WT) mice using peanut agglutinin (PNA) staining, which stains the cone-specific extracellular matrix and reflects cone health. No effect was seen on PNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, retinas from both WT and P21 <italic>rd1</italic> mice were stained using anti-ARR3, which stains the entire cone. At P31, the approximate number and morphology of Txnip-transduced cones in WT retinas was similar to uninfected WT retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At P21 and P30, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ARR3 in <italic>rd1</italic> retinas did not show an obvious rescue of cone outer segments by Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evaluation of <italic>Txnip</italic> alleles for cone survival</title><p>Previous studies of Txnip provided a number of alleles that could potentially lead to a more effective cone rescue by Txnip and/or provide some insight into which of the Txnip functions are required for enhancing cone survival. A C247S mutation has been shown to block Txnip’s inhibitory interaction with thioredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patwari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patwari et al., 2006</xref>), which is an important component of a cell's ability to fight oxidative damage via thiol groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Junn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishinaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>). If cone rescue by Txnip required this function, the C247S allele should be less potent for cone rescue. Alternatively, if loss of thioredoxin binding freed Txnip for its other functions and made more thioredoxin available for oxidative damage control, this allele might more effectively promote cone survival. The C247S clearly provided more robust cone rescue than WT Txnip in all three RP mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). These results indicate that the therapeutic effect of Txnip does not require an inhibitory interaction with thioredoxins. This finding is in keeping with previous work, which showed that anti-oxidation strategies promoted cone survival in RP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komeima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). An additional mutation, S308A, which loses an AMPK/Akt-phosphorylation site on Txnip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waldhart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), was tested in the context of WT Txnip and in the context of the C247S allele. The S308A change did not benefit cone survival in either context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, the S308A allele was assayed for negative effects on cones by an assessment of <italic>rd1</italic> cone number prior to P20, that is, before the onset of cone death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It did not reduce the cone number at this early timepoint, indicating that Txnip.S308A was not toxic to cones. This finding suggests that the S308 residue is critical for the therapeutic function of Txnip through an unclear mechanism. One additional set of amino acid changes, LL351 and 352AA, was tested in the context of C247S. This allele eliminates a clathrin-binding site, and thus hampers Txnip’s ability to remove GLUT1 from cell surface through clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Txnip.C247S.LL351 and 352AA could still delay RP cone death compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the therapeutic effect of Txnip was unlikely to be only through the removal of GLUT1 from the cell surface. To further explore the role of GLUT1, an shRNA to <italic>Slc2a1</italic>, which encodes GLUT1, was tested. It did not prolong RP cone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The slight decrease of Txnip.C247S.LL351 and 352AA in cone rescue compared to Txnip.C247S might be due to other, currently unknown effects of LL351 and 352, or a less specific effect, for example, a protein conformational change.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Test of Txnip alleles on cone survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative P50 <italic>rd1</italic> flat-mounted retinas after P0 infection with one of five different Txnip alleles (AAV8-RedO-Txnip wildtype (WT)/.C247S/.S308A/.C247S.S308A/.C247S.LL351 and 352AA, ≈1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye, plus AAV8-RedO-H2BGFP, 2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> vg/eye), or control eyes infected with AAV8-RedO-H2BGFP, 2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> vg/eye alone.

This switch in fuel preference was proposed to benefit the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), leading to a greater production of ATP. As presented earlier, a problem for cones in the RP environment might be a shortage of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). A benefit of Txnip might then be to enable and/or force cells to switch from a preference for glucose to one or more alternative fuels. To test this hypothesis, we co-injected AAV-Txnip with shRNAs targeting the mRNAs for the rate-limiting enzymes for the catalysis of lactate, ketones, or lipids.

Because the fluorescence of GEFS may also be subject to environmental pH, we used a pH sensor, pHRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tantama et al., 2011</xref>), to determine if the changes of PercevalHR and iGlucoseSnFR were due to a change in pH, and found no significant pH change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We also found that lactate, but not pyruvate, utilization by Txnip-transduced cones was critically dependent upon Ldhb for ATP production as introduction of siLdhb abrogated the increase in ATP:ADP in Txnip-transduced cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, in correlation with improved cone survival by Txnip.C247S compared to WT Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), cones had a higher ATP:ADP ratio in lactate medium when Txnip.C247S was used relative to WT Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). Similarly, in correlation with no survival benefit when transduced with Txnip.S308A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), there was no difference in the ATP:ADP ratio when Txnip.S308A was used, relative to control, in lactate medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of Txnip on ATP:ADP levels in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) cones in media with different carbon sources.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative ex vivo live images of PercevalHR-labeled cones in P20 <italic>rd1</italic> retinas cultured with high-glucose, lactate-only, or pyruvate-only medium and transduced with Txnip (AAV8-RedO-Txnip, 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye, plus AAV8-RO1.7-PercevalHR, 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye) (RO1.7 is a shorter version of the red opsin [RedO] promoter with a similar expression pattern) or control (i.e., AAV8-RO1.7-PercevalHR, 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg/eye).

An additional experiment was carried out to investigate if there might be a shortage of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, which could limit the uptake of pyruvate into the mitochondria of photoreceptors for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grenell et al., 2019</xref>).

The combination of Txnip.C247S expression in cones, with expression of Nrf2, a gene with anti-oxidative damage and anti-inflammatory activity, in the RPE, provided an additive effect on cone survival relative to either gene alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). This combination also preserved a structure resembling cone outer segments. In WT cones, opsin protein is localized to the outer segment, where photon detection and phototransduction take place. During degeneration in RP, the cone outer segments collapse, and opsin is mislocalized to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Glucose appears to be supplied primarily from the circulation, via the RPE, which has a high level of GLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gospe et al., 2010</xref>). Photoreceptors, at least rods, carry out glycolysis to support anabolism, to replace their outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>), and contribute ATP, to run their ion pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okawa et al., 2008</xref>). If glucose becomes limited, as has been proposed to occur in RP, cones may have insufficient fuel for their needs. To explore whether we could develop a therapy to address some of these metabolic shortcomings in RP, we delivered many different types of genes that might alter metabolic programming. From these, Txnip had the strongest improvement on cone survival and vision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). This was surprising as Txnip has been shown to inhibit glucose uptake by binding to and aiding in the removal of GLUT1 from plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, it inhibits the anti-oxidation proteins, the thioredoxins, again by direct binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Junn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishinaka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>), so would have been predicted to increase oxidative damage and therefore decrease cone survival. The results with Txnip in its WT form, and from the study of several mutant alleles, provide some insight into how it might benefit cones. The Txnip.C247S allele prevents binding to thioredoxins and gave enhanced cone survival relative to WT Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that, by being free of this interaction, the C247S mutant protein may be more available for other Txnip-mediated activities. In addition, thioredoxin may be made more available for its role in fighting oxidative damage following transduction of the C247S mutant, rather than the WT Txnip allele.</p><p>The mechanisms by which Txnip might benefit cones are not fully known, but a study of Txnip’s function in skeletal muscle suggested that it plays a role in fuel selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeBalsi et al., 2014</xref>). If glucose is limited in RP, then cones may need to switch from a reliance on glucose and glycolysis to an alternative fuel(s), such as ketones, fatty acids, amino acids, or lactate. Cones express <italic>oOxct1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>), which encodes a critical enzyme for ketone catabolism, suggesting that cones are capable of ketolysis. In addition, a previous study showed that lipids might be an alternative energy source for cones by β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joyal et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that cones can use these alternative fuels to meet their intense energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the Txnip rescue did not depend on ketolysis or β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Due to the diversity of amino acid catabolic pathways, we did not study whether these pathways were required for Txnip’s rescue effect. However, we did discover that Ldhb, which converts lactate to pyruvate, was required. This is an interesting switch as photoreceptors normally have high levels of Ldha (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">Figure 5—source data 4</xref>) and produce lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanow et al., 2017</xref>). An important factor in the reliance on Ldhb could be the availability of lactate, which is highly available from serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hui et al., 2017</xref>). Lactate could be transported via the RPE and/or Müller glia, and/or the internal retinal vasculature that comes in closer proximity to cones after rod death. Ketones are usually only available during fasting, and lipids are hydrophobic molecules that are slow to be transported across the plasma membranes. Moreover, lipids are required to rebuild the membrane-rich outer segments, and thus might be somewhat limited. Ldhb is not sufficient, however, to delay RP cone degeneration as its overexpression did not promote RP cone survival.</p><p>Txnip-transduced RP cones also had larger mitochondria with a greater membrane potential and likely were able to use the pyruvate produced by Ldhb for greater ATP production via OXPHOS. Indeed, Txnip-transduced cones had an enhanced ATP:ADP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, healthier mitochondria were not sufficient to prolong RP cone survival. Txnip.S308A led to larger mitochondria than control mitochondria as seen by TEM, as well as brighter JC-1 staining and mitoRFP signals, which are indicators of better mitochondrial health, but this allele did not induce greater cone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, as Txnip has been shown to interact with Parp1, which can negatively affect mitochondria, we investigated if Parp1 knockout mice might have cones that survive longer in RP. Indeed, the Parp1 knockout mitochondria appeared to be healthier, but Parp1 knockout retinas did not have better RP cone survival than Parp1-WT <italic>rd1</italic> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, cone rescue by Txnip was not changed in the Parp1 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The well-described effects of Txnip on the removal of GLUT1 from the cell membrane might seem at odds with the promotion of cone survival. It could be that removal of GLUT1 from the plasma membrane of cones forces the cones to choose an alternative fuel, such as lactate, and perhaps others too. Interestingly, as GLUT1 knockdown was not sufficient for cone survival, Txnip must not only lead to a reduction in membrane-localized GLUT1, but also potentiate a fuel switch, via an unknown mechanism(s) that at least involves an increase of Ldhb activity. A reduction in glycolysis might also lead to a fuel switch. Introduction of dnHIF1α, which should reduce expression of glycolytic enzymes, also benefited cones, while introduction of WT HIF1α did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). HIF1α has many target genes and may alter pathways in addition to that of glycolysis, thus also potentiating a fuel switch once glycolysis is downregulated. An additional finding supporting the notion that the level of glycolysis is important for cone survival was the observation that AAV-Pfkm plus AAV-Hk1 led to a reduction in cone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Phosphorylation of glucose by Hk1 followed by phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate by the Pfkm complex commits glucose to glycolysis at the cost of ATP. These AAVs may have promoted the flux of glucose through glycolysis, which may have inhibited a fuel switch, and/or depleted the ATP pool, for example, if downstream glycolytic intermediates were used for anabolic needs so that ATP production by glycolysis did not occur, and pyruvate was not produced for conversion to acetyl CoA and ATP production by the mitochondria.</p><p>The observations described above suggest that at least two different pathways are required for the promotion of cone survival by Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). One pathway requires lactate utilization via Ldhb, but as Ldhb was not sufficient, another pathway is also required. As greater mitochondrial health was observed following Txnip transduction, a second pathway may include the effects on mitochondria. This notion is supported by the observation that the addition of Ldhb to <italic>Parp1<sup>-/-</sup> rd1</italic> cones, which have healthier mitochondria, led to improved cone survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Txnip alone may be able to promote cone health by impacting both lactate catabolism and mitochondrial health. There may be additional pathways required as well.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for the mechanism of Txnip-mediated cone rescue.</title><p>The data suggest that at least two pathways are required for Txnip rescue – Pathway I: enhancement of lactate catabolism, which requires the function of LDHB; and pathway II: improved mitochondrial health, possibly through mitochondrial Parp1 inhibition. An additional pathway, pathway III: inhibiting glycolysis by removing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) from cell surface, may partially contribute to rescue by working with improved lactate metabolism and improved mitochondrial health, and/or unidentified pathways. This diagram was created from a BioRender Template.

Lactate is normally produced at high levels by photoreceptors in the healthy retina. When rods, which are 97% of the photoreceptors, die, lactate production goes down dramatically. The RPE might then need to retain glucose for its own needs. Introduction of an allele of Txnip, C247S.LL351 and 352AA, to the RPE provided a rescue effect for cones, while introduction of the WT allele of Txnip to the RPE did not. The LL351 and 352AA mutations lead to a loss of efficiency of the removal of GLUT1 from the plasma membrane, while the C247S mutation might create a less glycolytic RPE. The combination of these mutations might then allow more glucose to flow to cones. The untreated RP cones seem to be able to use glucose at a high concentration for ATP production, at least in freshly explanted retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These findings are also consistent with the reported mechanism for cone survival promoted by RdCVF, a factor that is proposed to improve glucose uptake by RP cones, which might be important if glucose is present in low concentration due to retention by the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aït-Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As cones face multiple challenges in the degenerating RP retina, we tested Txnip in combination with genes that we have found to promote cone survival via other mechanisms. The combination of Txnip with vectors fighting oxidative stress and inflammation (AAV-Best1-Nrf2) supported greater cone survival than any of these treatments alone. These combinations utilize cell type-specific promoters, reducing the chances of side effects from global expression of these genes. Of note, the Nrf2 expression was limited to the RPE, which we recently showed leads to much improved RPE survival and morphology in RP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Best1-Nrf2 was additive to RedO-Txnip for cone survival. This finding is in keeping with the interdependence of photoreceptors and the RPE, which is undoubtedly important not only in a healthy retina, but in disease as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Pde6b<sup>rd1</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Charles River; Taconic</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 207; FVB/NTac. <break/>MGI: 1856373</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Pde6b<sup>rd10</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 004297 MGI:2388259</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">Janis Lem (Tufts University)</td><td valign="top">MGI:2680822</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9892703">9892703</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Parp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 002779.

After blocking, retinas were incubated with a mixture of 1:200 anti-s-opsin (OPN1MW) antibody (AB5407, EMD Millipore) and 1:600 anti-m-opsin (OPN1SW) antibody (AB5405, EMD Millipore) in the same blocking solution overnight at 4°C, followed by secondary donkey-anti-rabbit antibody staining (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 594) at room temperature for 2 hr, then flat-mounted on a glass slide and coverslip.</p><p>For frozen sections, whole eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 2 hr at room temperature, followed by removal of the cornea, lens, and iris. The eye cups then went through a 15% and 30% sucrose solution to dehydrate at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation in 1:1 30% sucrose and Tissue-Tek O.C.T. solution at 4°C. Eye cups were embedded in a plastic mold, frozen in a −80°C freezer, and cut into 20 or 12 μm thin radial cross sections that were placed on glass slides. Antibody staining was done similarly to whole-mounts as described above and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% normal donkey serum ,and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as the blocking solution, except for FLAG detection (10% donkey serum and 3% BSA). GLUT1 (encoded by <italic>Slc2a1</italic> gene) antibody (GT11-A, Alpha Diagnostics) was used at 1:300 dilution, PARP1 antibody (ab227244, Abcam) was used at 1:300 dilution, GFP antibody (ab13970, Abcam) was used at 1:1000 dilution to detect GFP-Txnip, ARR3 antibody (AB15282, Millipore Sigma) was used at 1:1000 dilution to detect cone arrestin (encoded ay the <italic>Arr3</italic> gene), and FLAG antibody (ab1257, Abcam) was used at 1:2000 based on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrando et al., 2015</xref>). If applicable, 1:1000 PNA (CY5 or rhodamine labeled) for cone extracellular matrix labeling and 1:1000 DAPI were used to co-stain with secondary antibodies. Stained sections were imaged with a confocal microscope (LSM710, Zeiss) using ×20 or ×63 objectives (Plan Apo 20x/0.8 Air DIC II, or Plan Apo 63X/1.4 Oil DIC III).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Automated cone counting</title><p>The cone-H2BGFP images of entire flat-mounted retinas were first analyzed in ImageJ to acquire the diameter and the center parameters of the sample. We used a custom MATLAB script to automatically count the number of H2BGFP-positive cones in the central ½ radius of the retina since RP cones degenerate faster in the central than the peripheral retina. The algorithm was based on a Gaussian model to identify the centers of labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). The threshold of peak intensity and the variance of distribution were initially determined using visual inspection, and a comparison to the number of manually counted cones from six retinas. The threshold of intensity and variance thus determined were then set at fixed values for all the experiments that used cone quantification. The background intensity did not interfere with the accurate counting on the raw images by this MATLAB script despite the observation that the intensity of some images looked different at low magnification. This method of cone counting was further verified using FACS analysis of cones in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live imaging of cones on ex vivo retinal explants</title><p>For JC-1 mitochondrial dye staining, the retina was quickly dissected in a solution of 50% Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mix (11765054, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 50% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; 11995065, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature. They were then incubated in a culture medium containing 50% Fluorobrite DMEM (A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 25% heat-inactivated horse serum (26050088, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 25% Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (14065056, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 2 μM JC-1 dye (M34152, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 20 min. The retinas were washed in 37°C in this medium without JC-1 three times, transferred to a glass-bottom culture dish (MatTek P50G-1.5-30F) with culture medium, and imaged using a confocal microscope (LSM710 Zeiss), which was equipped with a chamber pre-heated to 37°C with pre-filled 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Right before imaging, a cover slip (VWR 89015-725) was gently applied to flatten the retina. Regions of interest (with H2BGFP as an indicator of successful AAV infection and to set the correct focal plane on the cone layer) were selected under the eyepiece with a ×63 objective (Plan Apo 63X/1.4 Oil DIC III). Fluorescent images from the same region of interest were obtained with the excitation wavelength of 561 nm (for J-aggregates), 514 nm (for JC-1 monomer), and 488 nm (for H2BGFP). Four different regions of interest from the central part of the same retina were imaged before moving to the next retina.</p><p>For RH421 (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase dye) staining, similar steps were taken as for JC-1 staining, with the following modifications: (1) 0.83 μM RH421 dye (61017, Biotium) was added to the glass-bottom culture dishes just before imaging, but not during incubation in the incubator, due to the fast action of RH421. (2) Five regions of interest were imaged per retina from the central area. (3) The dissection and culture medium were lactate-only medium (see below). (4) Excitation wavelengths: 561 nm (RH421) and 488 nm (H2BGFP).</p><p>For imaging genetically encoded metabolic sensors (PercevalHR, iGlucoSnFR, and pHRed), retinas were placed in the incubator for 12 min and then taken to confocal imaging without any staining. For the high-glucose condition, the culture medium described above contains ≈15 mM glucose without lactate or pyruvate. For the lactate-only condition, the culture and dissection media were both glucose-pyruvate-free DMEM (A144300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were supplemented with 20 mM sodium L-lactate (71718, Sigma-Aldrich). For the pyruvate-only condition, the culture and dissection media were both glucose-pyruvate-free DMEM plus 10 or 20 mM sodium pyruvate (P2256, Sigma-Aldrich). No AAV-H2BGFP was co-injected with these sensors since the sensors themselves could be used to trace the area of infection. The excitation wavelengths for sensors were 488 and 405 nm (PercevalHR, ratiometric high and low ATP:ADP), 488 and 561 nm (iGlucoSnFR, glucose-sensing GFP and normalization mRuby), and 561 and 458 nm (pHRed, ratiometric low and high pH).</p><p>The fluorescent intensity of all acquired images was measured by ImageJ. The ratio of sensors/dye was normalized to averaged control results taken at the same condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>All flow cytometry and cell sorting were performed on MoFlo Astrios EQ equipment. Retinas were freshly dissected and dissociated using cysteine-activated papain followed by gentle pipetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). Before sorting, all samples were passed through a 35 μm filter with buffer containing Fluorobrite DMEM (A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.4% BSA. Cones labeled with AAV8-SynP136-H2BGFP (highly cone-specific) were sorted into the appropriate buffer for either ddPCR or RNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>RNA sequencing was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). 1000 H2BGFP-positive cones per retina were sorted into 10 μL of Buffer TCL (QIAGEN) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and immediately frozen in −80°C. On the day of sample submission, the frozen cone lysates were thawed on ice and loaded into a 96-well plate for cDNA library synthesis and sequencing. A modified Smart-Seq2 protocol was performed on samples by the Broad Institute Genomics Platform with ∼6 million reads per sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>). The reads were mapped to the GRCm38.p6 reference genome after quality control measures. Reads assigned to each gene were quantified using featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Count data were analyzed using DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes, with an adjusted p value less than 0.05 considered significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>).

Txnip appears to be switching the fuel source and enhancing lactate catabolism in cone photoreceptors, thus allowing cones to use alternative fuels more effectively. This study has the potential to become a therapeutic approach to treat retinal degeneration</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;AAV-Txnip prolongs cone survival and vision in mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, they also noted some weaknesses that must be addressed. These include missing controls and quantifications that would reinforce the data.</p><p>I am sure that you will do your best to address many of the comments from these very thorough reviews but there is a small number of points that must absolutely be addressed:</p><p>– You should demonstrate convincingly that the proteins, especially Txnip and GLUT1 are expressed and that the levels of their over-expression compared to endogenous expression are substantial.</p><p>– Although you do show a rescue of cone survival, you must address whether the structure and function of these cones are indeed maintained.

Injections of the Txnip gene from AAV with cone-specific promoters slows retinal degeneration. A control that is missing throughout this very interesting and significant report is direct evidence that Txnip actually is being overexpressed. My confidence in the conclusions would be stronger if the authors could show by immunoblot or by IHC that there is normally some endogenous expression of Txnip in cones and that when the eyes have in them AAV carrying a cone-specific promoter and the coding sequence for Txnip that Txnip expression in cones increases substantially. It would be very helpful if the level of over-expression could be quantified.</p><p>2. In theory when Txnip is over-expressed in cones there should be a decrease in GLUT1 expression in cones, but not in RPE cells. This report would be stronger if the authors could show by IHC that cone expression of GLIT1 is diminished in the Txnip cone OE retinas but GLUT1 would not be diminshed in the cones that express the mutant Txnip that is incapable of stimluating endocytosis of GLUT1.</p><p>3. Lines 259-261. The finding that expression of ldhb prolongs survival of cones in these and other experiments throughout the report is interesting. It implies that cones are using lactate. But I would expect when rods are gone there is not much lactate in the retina. Please check that – i.e. measure lactate levels in the WT and rd1 retinas. The assay could be done with a commercial kit. If the lactate levels are low in the rd1 retina then it is puzzling why enhanced ldhb expression prolongs survival. Please address this either here or in the discussion. Also, it would be helpful to confirm with an antibody that ldhb is being expressed (in the treated retinas at higher than normal levels).</p><p>4. I think readers would like to know what happens to the phosphorylation state of mTOR in cones in these experiments and I think it would be relatively simple to test. In some cells phosphorylation of mTOR in the absence of glucose can be harmful, I think because it is prepping cells for a metabolic state that does not exist in the tissue. The Cepko lab reported previously that mTOR phosphorylation in cones is diminished in rd mutants, consistent with a compromised supply of glucose to the retina. What effect does Txnip expression in cones have on mTOR phosphorylation (diminish, increase or no effect) and what effect does combined over-expression of HK1 and PFK1 expression have on mTOR phosphorylation?</p><p>5. Lines 277-286. Please confirm by IHC or immunoblot that the wt or dnHIF1 is over-expressed and, if possible, quantify by how much it is over-expressed.</p><p>6. Extended data 6a and lines 300-302. I would have expected GLUT1 to be on the basal and apical surfaces of the Txnip.CS.LLAA mutant overexpressor but it seems to be only on the apical surface. Please mention and discuss this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript includes extensive data. However, several points require clarification and the text and figures need consistency. Specific comments/suggestions are as follows:</p><p>The authors concluded previously that cone starvation and degeneration are due to shortage of glucose in four animal models of RP (Punzo et al., 2009). However, except rho-/-, which is not the focus in this manuscript, the rest three animal models were not used in this study. It is unclear whether rd1 and rd10 also have shortage of ATP and how severe the shortage is as compared to the WT, or it is simply more ATP can better maintain cone survival.</p><p>The authors claim the treatment &quot;correlates with the presence of a healthier mitochondria&quot;. As shown in Figure 5a, although the size of mitochondria was bigger in the treated groups compared to the control, those mitochondria did not seem to harbor a typical morphology. More transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of different magnitudes are needed to show the localization of these mitochondria as well as the morphology of more mitochondria. Without the images from WT, it is hard to evaluate whether it is due to strain of the mice or other factors, or how a healthy mitochondrion should look like. Likewise, a much higher membrane potential in mitochondria does not necessarily mean healthier mitochondria. Additionally, the authors should show the mitochondria morphology of P50 rd1 as well, as that's the end point of the whole experiments and can provide useful information on the duration of the treatment.</p><p>Although the flat mount images in this manuscript show the overall cell survival in the whole retina, immunostaining of retinal sections is needed to address important questions related to retinal functions such as the structure of the retina, the morphology of the survival cone photoreceptors and the subtypes of the surviving cones, i.e., whether Txnip can maintain both S- and M- cones. The authors mentioned &quot;this combination also preserved the RP cone outer segments&quot; (line 312); yet, it is hard to evaluate the outer segment by flat mount, although a slight difference may be noticeable between the two groups.</p><p>The automated method for cone quantification (1/2 radius cell count) that counts H2BGFP-positive cones in the central half of the retina (previous calculation of the diameter of flat mount retinas) raises some concerns. Is the area of the retina in the 1/2 radius the same between samples? Not all flat-mounted retinas look the same (differences due to retina dissection), and this can influence the area used to count cones. In addition, is this method counting all the cones present in the sample? Are all cones H2BGFP-positive? What is the viral transduction efficiency (alone and co-injecting two AAVs)? Is it the same between samples? Are authors using z-stack confocal images for quantification?</p><p>It is appropriate to quantify density of cones (number of cones/mm2) in defined areas of interest, which should be the same for all the samples. To achieve this, a proper orientation of the whole-mounted retina is necessary, and this information is lacking in the images included in the manuscript.</p><p>The authors could consider the quantification of &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;craters&quot; in the cone mosaic as an indicator of differential treatment effect.</p><p>The authors do not quantify the level of Txnip expression in transduced retinas. It would be important to know the level of overexpression they have achieved and compare it with the expression in untreated RP retinas. In addition, it would be relevant to know if treatment effects correlate with Txnip expression levels.</p><p>OMR (based on head movements of mice observed by a human observer) can't be directly equated to visual acuity (see PLoS ONE 8(11): e78058, 2013; J Neurophysiol 118: 300-316, 2017). One needs to interpret such data with caution. Is it possible to do multi-focal ERG?</p><p>The authors confirmed the effect of Txnip on cone survival using three different animal models. However, in some follow-up experiments, the authors used these models interchangeably and it leads to confusion. For example, while rd1 is the main focus of the manuscript, the authors did not show the rescued visual acuity of these mice. Even if there is no effect of Txnip on visual acuity in these mice, the authors should still mention this to provide some information of the effectiveness of the treatment on some fast-degenerating mouse models. In addition, the authors used rd10 and rho-/- as well in the manuscript. Did the authors test the mechanisms they found using rd1 on rd10 and rho-/-? These data would be helpful to discriminate whether the switch of energy source by Txnip in the survival of cone cells is specific to rd1.</p><p>Figure 8a and 8b described the effect of vector combinations on cone survival in rd1, whereas Figure 8c actually mentioned the effect on outer segment in rd10. The authors did not even mention this switch of animal models in the text. The effect on outer segment in rd10 mice does not mean it would surely give the same effect in rd1 mice. It is unclear whether there was no improvement of outer segment in treated rd1 mice, or the vector combination did not have any effect on cone survival in rd10 mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In order to strengthen this manuscript, the following suggestions should be addressed:</p><p>1. Did the authors observe the difference in mice with or without NNT deletion? Is there an NNT deletion in rd1, rd10, parp1-/-, and rho-/- mice?</p><p>2. Extended Data Figure 1b and 1d: to show AAV8-RO1.7-GFP expression in cone photoreceptors, the Arr3 antibody will be better than PNA since PNA could only express in the cone outer and inner segments. Extended Data Figure 1b showed some GFP in the cytoplasm, is this the H2B-EGFP?</p><p>3. Figure 1b: are these numbers within the 1/2 radius or within selected small boxes? If these numbers are from selected small boxes, how many small boxes from each were selected? The authors should explain how they selected the small boxes as there is some variation on the dorsal retina or ventral retina. For example, in P130 rd10, the cone cell densities are quite different in the four leaves of the inner circle. Same question for the P50 rd1, there is some area with a patchy absence of cone cells. If the numbers are within 1/2 radius, why use 1/2 radius rather than 2/3 or 1/3 radius?</p><p>4. It would be helpful if the authors explained the reason behind each time point, i.e., P50 for rd1, P130 for rd10, and P150 for Rho -/-.</p><p>5. Figure 5i: the number of cone cells at 1/2 radius in the whole mount retina looks quite similar, but it seems the number of cone cells in the periphery of control retina is more than the number in the +Ldhb retina.</p><p>6. Bracket &quot;[]&quot; in Figure 4, and curly bracket &quot;{}&quot; in Figure 5 indicate sample size. Are these the sample sizes of the image/retina or samples sizes of the mice?</p><p>7. Figure 5: it is unclear how reliable the Mt size is, because the EM images are not SBF-SEM. The shape and morphology of mitochondria is in 3D and the EM images are taken from a different orientation and thus may have different results.</p><p>8. Did the authors observe any difference in the number of mitochondria in Txnip-treated retina?</p><p>9. Does Txnip increase mitochondrial biogenesis?</p><p>10. It would be better if the authors could clarify the meaning of n.d. in &quot;Wu et al., n.d.&quot;.</p><p>11. Line 336-337: it remains unclear what the role of anti-oxidative stress is in the Txnip-mediated cone rescue effect. It would be helpful if the authors added an experiment to demonstrate the changes in ROS in Txnip (wt and C237S)-mediated activities.</p><p>12. Line 353: it would be helpful if the authors could explain why the Txnip rescue did not depend on ketolysis or ß-oxidation.</p><p>13. Line 487-488: &quot;The GFP fluorescence intensity served as a fast 488 and direct read out of the knockdown efficiency of these shRNAs.&quot; The GFP after IRES can sometimes too weak to produce a fast and direct readout. Do the authors have the image/a figure on this?</p><p>14. It is unclear whether the control group in this study refers to the non-injected eye or to saline injections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66240.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The three reviewers agree that the study is significant and might lead to potential clinical applications.

We had repeatedly tried IHC for Txnip with two commercially available antibodies at the early stage of this study. The best images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, but are not convincing. The best of the available Txnip antibodies (Thermo Fisher #40-3700) was able to detect Best1-Txnip overexpression in the RPE, where there is low staining in the uninfected tissue and high vector expression from the Best1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A,B</xref>). However, this antibody gave ambiguous staining in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C-F</xref>). There is almost no Txnip RNA in cones (new Figure 5—source data 3), almost none in rods (Drop-seq data from Shekhar et al., 2017), and a very low signal in a small fraction of Mueller glia (Dropseq data from Shekhar et al., 2017). Yet, quite a bit of IHC signal was detected in the outer nuclear layer and inner and outer segment layers in the uninfected retina, with no obvious greater IHC signal in the AAV-Txnip infected retina. Due to these problems, we made a fusion protein of GFP-Txnip and used AAV8-RedO1.7 to express it, in both RP and WT retinas (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, originally it was shown in Extended Data Figure 1b). We found that GFP-Txnip was excluded from cone outer segments, but was located in all other regions, including in the reported locations of a protein with which it is reported to interact (PARP1), in the inner segments and nucleus.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66240-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For GLUT1 IHC, the antibody was not the issue. We had shown significant removal of GLUT1 from the RPE by Best1-Txnip in the original submission (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, originally Extended Data Figure 6a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A,B</xref>). However, since GLUT1 is a membrane protein and cones are surrounded by the processes of neighboring cells (i.e. rods, Muller glia, ad RPE in WT retina; Muller glia and RPE processes in the RP retina after rods are gone), and because all of these other cell types express quite a bit of GLUT1, we had trouble distinguishing GLUT1 IHC signals within cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2C,D</xref> at the end of this letter). For this reason, we could not tell if there was any drop in cone GLUT1 IHC by RedO-Txnip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E,F</xref>). Moreover, the raw reads from our RNA-seq dataset suggested that the GLUT1 (i.e. <italic>Slc2a1</italic>) level was relatively low in cones (new Figure 5—source data 4). Therefore, we did not think that we would be able to observe a significant GLUT1 reduction in Txnip-treated cones, as was observed in the RPE.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66240-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We did not include these IHC results given that they were inconclusive. In addition to the RNA reads for GLUT1, we have included a table of Txnip raw reads from our cone RNAseq data (GEO depositions: GSE161622 and GSE168503) of Txnip-treated vs. control of four different strains (new Figure 5—source data 3). These numbers clearly demonstrate &gt;100 fold increase of Txnip mRNA through addition of RedO-Txnip in all strains. The Txnip ddPCR data confirmed this finding (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, originally Extended Data Figure 5b). As mentioned above, there is almost no Txnip mRNA in wildtype or RP control cones, so the fold amplification is huge. Although these data are for RNA, and not protein, (and we would have loved to be able to show protein), the only alternative hypothesis to protein expression leading to rescue is that the AAV DNA, encoding Txnip, or the mRNA for Txnip, caused the rescue. These are highly unlikely scenarios given that we made several alleles of Txnip that had only base pair changes (e.g. C247S, S308A). These base pair changes affected the rescue activity. The most likely hypothesis is that these base pair changes resulted in protein changes, as otherwise, we would have to conclude that base pair changes to the AAV DNA or mRNA could both increase (C247S) and decrease rescue (S308A). These base pair changes were chosen as the literature had shown that the corresponding amino acid changes changed the activity and binding partners for the Txnip protein.In addition to the efforts described above, we validated the DNA sequences of our AAV vectors. (Figure 1—source data 1, originally Supplementary Table 1, and Methods) using several methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although you do show a rescue of cone survival, you must address whether the structure and function of these cones are indeed maintained. You should present data about the shape of the outer segments and about the cone synapses (in P50 retina?). Histology, IHC or TEM if feasible</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any obvious structural changes to either RP or WT cones by Txnip, and we have not claimed any RP cone structural benefits in any part of our text. In fact, we have never seen nice outer segments or wildtype cone-like morphology for any of our rescue treatments, nor from those of other laboratories. We have seen more opsin protein, and a bit of an outer segment structure with Txnip C247S (Figure 6C). Our best guess is that, given the complete collapse of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), the cones are challenged by mechanical/physical changes in the architecture of the ONL/RPE interface. In addition, there are data from our lab and others that there are many problems for cones in the RP environment, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic challenges. Our lab has now assayed &gt;50 genes to address these challenges, and we have been publishing some of the successes (Punzo et al. 2009, Xiong et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2019, 2020, Chinchore et al. 2019, Wu et al. 2021). Our goal is to combine treatments to try to combat multiple problems for cones. Consistent with this hypothesis, we did achieve greater rescue by combining RedOTxnip (for cone metabolism) with Best1-Nrf2 (to combat oxidative damage and possibly inflammation in the RPE) (Figure 8A,B). We believe that the most important way to assess a benefit to cones is to show functional benefits, which is the point of the optomotor assay (Figure 1C), where we did see significant benefit due to Txnip.</p><p>However, to address the question of cone morphology, we have added a set of cone arrestin (ARR3) IHC and TEM images to show what we observed (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, Figure 5—figure supplement 2), as well as IHC for s- and m- opsin separately (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A), and updated the text to address this point. For cone function, we have added our ERG data as Figure 1—figure supplement 2E. The interpretation of this neutral result is in the corresponding point to Reviewer #2 in this letter below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is TXNIP's rescue mechanistically mediated through anti-oxidative stress or mitochondrial biogenesis? Checking the difference in the number of mitochondria in Txnip-treated retina would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Mitochondria are thought to be one continuous structure, although when seen in cross section they appear to be independent units. It is thus hard to quantify their numbers. The staining with mitoRFP is the best proxy we could come up with to quantify the Txnip effect on “numbers” of mitochondria, as we reported in the initial submission (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, originally Extended Data Figure 5d). It is also obvious from cross sections that the Txnip-treated cells have larger mitochondrial cross sections, as quantified in Figure 5B. The TEM images that we showed in the first submission, along with the quantification of the average size of the cross sections, show that Txnip increases the size. We added 22 more TEM images to share our observations on the mitochondrial morphology in the cones from both WT and RP retinas (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-D). We found it difficult to compare mitochondria in wildtype healthy inner segments/ OPL to those in degenerating cones due to the collapse of the normal cone morphology i.e. there are no organized inner segments in RP cones, which is where most mitochondria localize in wild type cones.</p><p>We observed that Txnip did not upregulate the mitochondrial ETC genes in WT cones as it did in RP cones. Txnip is thus unlikely to have as its constitutive role mitochondria biogenesis. We have added this information to the revised manuscript (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, and Figure 5—source data 2). This additional WT cone RNA-seq results have been recently deposited to GEO (accession number GSE168503). However, it is hard to know whether the benefits to RP cone mitochondria are due to increased biogenesis or other effects. Cone degeneration in the <italic>rd10</italic> strain has been reported to be accompanied by swollen and abnormal mitochondria, which are rescued by a RipK3 antagonist (Murakami et al., 2012, PNAS). As this drug can inhibit necrotic death due to oxidative stress, which is mediated by RipK3, we understand that this drug, as well as Txnip, might protect cones via inhibition of oxidative damage or death induced by oxidative stress. Of interest regarding this possibility is that the Txnip C247S allele does not bind thioredoxin, and it rescues better. It could be that by liberating thioredoxin, it allows thioredoxin to increase its anti-oxidation role. Alternatively, or additionally, it could be that Txnip is liberated from thioredoxin to better perform its other role(s) for cone rescue.</p><p>Regarding the role of Txnip in oxidative damage, it has been reported to inhibit the thioredoxins when it binds to them, making oxidative damage worse. This would predict that reduction or removal of Txnip would reduce oxidative damage, i.e. an effect in the opposite direction to the benefits that we observe. In keeping with this, Txnip KO Muller glial cells in culture have less mitophagy, in a condition used to model diabetes by culturing in a high glucose medium. Similarly, injection of Txnip shRNAs intravitreally leads to less mitophagy in Muller glia in a diabetic model. More work clearly needs to be done to investigate how Txnip might provide benefits to cone mitochondria, including investigation of the role of thioredoxins, Txnip, and mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: (Recommendations for the authors)</p><p>1. Injections of the Txnip gene from AAV with cone-specific promoters slows retinal degeneration. A control that is missing throughout this very interesting and significant report is direct evidence that Txnip actually is being overexpressed. My confidence in the conclusions would be stronger if the authors could show by immunoblot or by IHC that there is normally some endogenous expression of Txnip in cones and that when the eyes have in them AAV carrying a cone-specific promoter and the coding sequence for Txnip that Txnip expression in cones increases substantially. It would be very helpful if the level of over-expression could be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to the Editor (point #1) above.

Lines 259-261. The finding that expression of ldhb prolongs survival of cones in these and other experiments throughout the report is interesting. It implies that cones are using lactate. But I would expect when rods are gone there is not much lactate in the retina. Please check that – i.e. measure lactate levels in the WT and rd1 retinas. The assay could be done with a commercial kit. If the lactate levels are low in the rd1 retina then it is puzzling why enhanced ldhb expression prolongs survival. Please address this either here or in the discussion. (Also, it would be helpful to confirm with an antibody that ldhb is being expressed (in the treated retinas at higher than normal levels).</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggest that Txnip reprograms the cones via an unknown mechanism to use lactate more effectively than usual. This does not necessitate more Ldhb protein, but we too wondered if there might be more Ldhb protein in cones following Txnip overexpression. We tried LDHB antibodies from Sigma-Aldrich (SAB2108609) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (PA543141) for IHC, but neither worked well (i.e. low signal-to-noise ratio). This is the reason we created AAV8-RedO1.7-Ldhb-FLAG, and IHC stained against FLAG to test the effectiveness of the Ldhb shRNAs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, originally Extended Data Figure 3a). As we are not aware of any function of Ldhb beyond the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, our interpretation of the shRNA knockdown data is that lactate conversion to pyruvate via Ldhb, which is required for Txnip rescue. In support of this, overexpression of Ldha reduced the rescue by Txnip, which is consistent with the conversion of lactate to pyruvate as providing a benefit to cones (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E, originally Extended Data Figure 3d,e).Measurement of lactate levels in the retina would reveal the lactate level of the entire retina. As cones are a small fraction of total cells, and we do not know how much lactate is required or where, we do not think that measurements of total retinal lactate would be interpretable. Interestingly, the lactate level is lower than the glucose level in mouse serum, yet the turnover rate of lactate is much higher than it is for glucose in circulation, to feed the TCA cycle of non-CNS organs e.g. muscle (Hui S, 2017, Nature). As our manipulation is specific to a small percentage of cells, it would be challenging to measure the lactate consumption in Txnip treated cones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I think readers would like to know what happens to the phosphorylation state of mTOR in cones in these experiments and I think it would be relatively simple to test. In some cells phosphorylation of mTOR in the absence of glucose can be harmful, I think because it is prepping cells for a metabolic state that does not exist in the tissue. The Cepko lab reported previously that mTOR phosphorylation in cones is diminished in rd mutants, consistent with a compromised supply of glucose to the retina. What effect does Txnip expression in cones have on mTOR phosphorylation (diminish, increase or no effect) and what effect does combined over-expression of HK1 and PFK1 expression have on mTOR phosphorylation?</p></disp-quote><p>We would also like to know, but we have not been able to find an antibody that shows the mTOR phosphorylation state since our original publication of this observation. The antibody that we used in that study no longer exists, and though we and Claudio Punzo (who originally did that work) have tried to find another one that works, we have been unable to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

With Best1-Txnip addition, the apical surface of the RPE collapses onto the photoreceptors, which also have GLUT1. These structural changes make it hard to tell how much GLUT1 is present on the apical surface of the RPE, when they express the CS.LLAA mutant compared to the WT Txnip.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript includes extensive data. However, several points require clarification and the text and figures need consistency. Specific comments/suggestions are as follows:</p><p>The authors concluded previously that cone starvation and degeneration are due to shortage of glucose in four animal models of RP (Punzo et al., 2009). However, except rho-/-, which is not the focus in this manuscript, the rest three animal models were not used in this study. It is unclear whether rd1 and rd10 also have shortage of ATP and how severe the shortage is as compared to the WT, or it is simply more ATP can better maintain cone survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use Pde6γ<sup>-/-</sup> (as we did in Punzo et al. 2009), because its rod-cone degeneration rate is similar to that of Pde6β<sup>-/-</sup>, i.e. the <italic>rd1</italic> strain. We also did not use the transgenic P23H strain (as in Punzo et al.) or a more recent P23H knock-in strain from the Palczewski Lab, due to the extremely slow rod-cone degeneration rate. We used the <italic>rd10</italic> strain, which carries a Pde6β hypomorphic mutation instead of a null mutation. The rod-cone degeneration speed of <italic>rd10</italic> is intermediate between those of <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, originally Extended Data Figure 1a), thus allowing us to investigate mutant strains with 3 rates of degeneration. Given that all of these mutant strains have a rod-specific mutation, and cone degeneration is secondary, our hypothesis throughout all of this work is that we are dealing with a non-autonomous set of problems for genetically wildtype cones. In Punzo et al. 2009, as well as several other gene therapy publications from our lab (Xiong et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2019, 2020, Wu et al. 2021, Chinchore et al. 2019), any treatment that benefits <italic>rd1</italic> also benefits the <italic>rd10</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> strains. Also, as we showed in Punzo et al., the changes in cones across the original 4 strains that we used had the same hallmarks, which suggests that the mechanisms leading to cone death are common across the strains. The additional time and expense of carrying out the Txnip experiments on P23H did not seem worthwhile in light of these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim the treatment &quot;correlates with the presence of a healthier mitochondria&quot;. As shown in Figure 5a, although the size of mitochondria was bigger in the treated groups compared to the control, those mitochondria did not seem to harbor a typical morphology. More transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of different magnitudes are needed to show the localization of these mitochondria as well as the morphology of more mitochondria. Without the images from WT, it is hard to evaluate whether it is due to strain of the mice or other factors, or how a healthy mitochondrion should look like. Likewise, a much higher membrane potential in mitochondria does not necessarily mean healthier mitochondria. Additionally, the authors should show the mitochondria morphology of P50 rd1 as well, as that's the end point of the whole experiments and can provide useful information on the duration of the treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the Editor (point #2) above. We have supplied more TEM images to address the question of mitochondrial morphology (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-D). We are not claiming that Txnip-treated RP cones, or their mitochondria, look like wild type, only that they show several features of mitochondrial morphology and function that correlate with greater health. The TEM data show that they are larger in cross-section, the mitoRFP shows that they have a greater membrane potential and appear more “numerous”, the JC-1 dye aggregation shows greater membrane potential. All of these assays are standard assays used to investigate mitochondrial status. Furthermore, PercevalHR imaging showed that there is more ATP generated by Txnip treated cones, which is most likely due to better mitochondrial function, and that this is true when lactate is supplied, which is dependent upon Ldhb. In keeping with these data, Txnip C247S, provided for more cone survival, as well as had correlated benefits to cone mitochondria. Our RP cone RNA-seq data showed more ETC mRNAs, in correlation with the other assays of mitochondria. We did not rely only on TEM, but performed several independent assays to investigate the effects of Txnip on mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the flat mount images in this manuscript show the overall cell survival in the whole retina, immunostaining of retinal sections is needed to address important questions related to retinal functions such as the structure of the retina, the morphology of the survival cone photoreceptors and the subtypes of the surviving cones, i.e., whether Txnip can maintain both S- and M- cones. The authors mentioned &quot;this combination also preserved the RP cone outer segments&quot; (line 312); yet, it is hard to evaluate the outer segment by flat mount, although a slight difference may be noticeable between the two groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We recently harvested and sectioned some P122 rd10 eyes transduced with RedOTxnip or RedO-Txnip + Best1-Nrf2.

It showed that Txnip preserved expression of both S- and M- opsins, and Txnip + Best1-Nrf2 led to better cone outer segment structures with enriched S- and M- opsin (new Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). Again, we do not claim wildtype cone outer segment morphology, only that the combination of RedO-Txnip + Best1-Nrf2 gave the best outer segment morphology of degenerating cones that we have seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The automated method for cone quantification (1/2 radius cell count) that counts H2BGFP-positive cones in the central half of the retina (previous calculation of the diameter of flat mount retinas) raises some concerns. Is the area of the retina in the 1/2 radius the same between samples? Not all flat-mounted retinas look the same (differences due to retina dissection), and this can influence the area used to count cones.</p></disp-quote><p>When we began studies of RP cone rescue, and needed to quantify cones, we used multiple methods of IHC for cone markers (PNA, anti-opsin, anti-cone arrestin, cone lacZ transgene, cone RNA quantification). Due to lack of good morphology and a reduction in expression of cone genes in sick cones, we found all of these methods to be difficult and the IHC methods to be subjective. However, the H2BGFP protein seems to be quite stable, as predicted if it is localized within chromatin which is not turning over at an appreciable rate in cones. The fact that it shows bright nuclear staining made quantification, by eye or by an automated program, to be the most robust method that we have used. The specificity of expression by the RedO promoter, after rods are gone (some of which can express at a low level), made it possible to count from the flat mount. We bench marked this method to FACS quantification using anti-cone arrestin (see Wang et al. 2020). In addition, we provide data here showing the correlation with FACS quantification (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>However, to address the point of variability in dissections and flat mounting, each retina is outlined and then the approximately central point of the optic nerve, which is unambiguous, is used to draw the central 50%. We have not shown the best images in our figures, but have shown typical images. The dissections and flat mounting procedure are quite reproducible as we have become quite proficient with these methods. There is certainly some natural variation of area among the samples, which is why we use the ½ radius as a normalization of each retina’s area. In addition, please note that the number of retinas for each experiment is quite high, and we include controls from the same animal (e.g. one eye injected with control and the other eye with Txnip). The P50 FVB <italic>rd1</italic> control cone count is usually consistently around 4,000 in the central region using this method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, is this method counting all the cones present in the sample? Are all cones H2BGFP-positive? What is the viral transduction efficiency (alone and co-injecting two AAVs)? Is it the same between samples? Are authors using z-stack confocal images for quantification?</p></disp-quote><p>The injection of 2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> vg/eye RedO-H2BGFP labels 20% of cones by our own estimation using WT mouse cone counts from Jeon, Strettoi and Masland (1998, J Neurosci). We have added this information in the Results section, where we first describe this labeling.</p><p>Because there is no difference between control and Txnip in P20 <italic>rd1</italic> cone counting (Figure 1B, and new Figure 2—Figure supplement 1C), we do not think there is any difference in H2BGFP transduction rate alone vs. co-injection. We do not believe that we need to label every cone, but to reproducibly sample the existing cone population. It is also important to note that we may miss rescued cones with this method, when a cone is infected with Txnip but not H2BGFP. This is a loss that we are willing to take, as it deflates, rather than inflates, the rescue. The trade-off in the ease and confidence in scoring the H2BGFP nuclei is one we are quite willing to make.</p><p>As described in Methods-histology, we used a commercial fluorescence microscope with a 10x objective to capture and stich the images. By focusing on the residual ONL, which is only one cell layer thick, we do not need z-stacks to capture all the H2BGFP labeled cones in the RP retina. Overall, we believe the RedOpsin-H2BGFP counting method could become a useful method to assay RP cone survival for the field. We have deposited our MATLAB code for cone quantification on Github (https://github.com/sawyerxue/RP-cone-count), and it will be released to the public soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is appropriate to quantify density of cones (number of cones/mm2) in defined areas of interest, which should be the same for all the samples. To achieve this, a proper orientation of the whole-mounted retina is necessary, and this information is lacking in the images included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>By using a computer program to count all of the labeled cones within a ½ radius circle of the entire retina, we were able to screen many vectors and many retinas, which alleviates concerns of measuring cone rescue only in a specific, perhaps selected or biased, area. In another study in our lab, we are quantifying the survival of peripheral cones, where we do see a bias in survival of the dorsal cones. In the current study, by counting all of the cones in the central retina and using a fairly large sample size for all studies, we do not see the need to orient the retina. The reproducible number of cones in the central retina in the control group (approximately 4,000) again suggests that random orientations do not create biases or irreproducible counts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could consider the quantification of &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;craters&quot; in the cone mosaic as an indicator of differential treatment effect.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the text, craters are far more common in the FVB strain of the <italic>rd1</italic> mutant. We assayed craters in 4 other inbred strains of mice that carry the <italic>rd1</italic> allele and saw very few craters (Punzo and Cepko, unpublished). The cone counts do not correlate with the amount of these craters. Interestingly, we found that treatment of the RPE with AAV-Best1Nrf2 almost completely eliminated the FVB craters (Wu et al. 2021), without much benefit to cones. This suggests that the craters originate with problems in the RPE (oxidative damage, inflammation, perhaps metabolic problems) as Nrf2 may affect any or all of these problems. The lack of a benefit to cones is interesting, as we would have predicted an effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not quantify the level of Txnip expression in transduced retinas. It would be important to know the level of overexpression they have achieved and compare it with the expression in untreated RP retinas.

The RNA level of Txnip treated vs. control cones can be found in a new Figure 5— source data 3.

One needs to interpret such data with caution. Is it possible to do multi-focal ERG?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the OMR is sometimes not equal to visual acuity, because OMR can be used to measure different visual performances. However, visual acuity is one of them, and our use of it here did measure this parameter. A common visual performance that can be measured by OMR is contrast sensitivity, which we did not test here. By definition, visual acuity is equal to “spatial frequency threshold”, which is exactly the visual performance that we measured using OMR in this and previous studies (Xiong W et al., 2015; Wang SK et al., 2019, 2020). Based on these studies, we believe that the visual acuity measured by OMR reflects areas of improved cone function, which may reflect increased cone density and health in e.g. central retina.</p><p>We are not sure about the relevance of the two references provided by the Reviewer here, because both references support OMR as a reliable method of quantifying visual performance, including acuity. In PLoS ONE 8(11): e78058, 2013:</p><p>“Exemplary, we show that automatically measured visual response curves of mice match the results obtained by a human observer very well. The spatial acuity thresholds yielded by the automatic analysis are also consistent with the human observer approach and with published results. Hence, OMR-arena provides an affordable, convenient and objective way to measure mouse visual performance.”</p><p>J Neurophysiol 118: 300-316, 2017:</p><p>“We provide the first direct comparison of OMR and OKR gains (head or eye velocity/stimulus velocity) and find that the two reflexes have comparable dependencies on stimulus luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, and velocity.”</p><p>Multi-focal ERG is for animals with large eyes, including humans. For mice, which have tiny eyes, the Reviewer might be referring to focal ERG instead. Since we have the entire retina infected with P0 subretinal injection, i.e. not a partial infection as in human subretinal injections, we do not see the advantage of using focal ERG vs. full-field ERG. We observed no difference between control vs. Txnip in full-field ERG in the P40 rd10 mice (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2E). Because ERG reflects overall phototransduction across the entire retina (Xue Y… Kefalov VJ, 2015a,b, 2017, 2020), but not improved functional cone density, i.e. improved visual acuity where cone survival is improved in the center, this result of the ERG does not argue against the positive OMR visual acuity results. Because cone loss is greatest in the central retina at the ages measured, the OMR result likely supplies the most robust measure of an improvement. In addition, this ERG result at least suggests that Txnip does not make the RP cone phototransduction worse than the control, which is an important consideration for therapeutic applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors confirmed the effect of Txnip on cone survival using three different animal models. However, in some follow-up experiments, the authors used these models interchangeably and it leads to confusion. For example, while rd1 is the main focus of the manuscript, the authors did not show the rescued visual acuity of these mice. Even if there is no effect of Txnip on visual acuity in these mice, the authors should still mention this to provide some information of the effectiveness of the treatment on some fast-degenerating mouse models. In addition, the authors used rd10 and rho-/- as well in the manuscript. Did the authors test the mechanisms they found using rd1 on rd10 and rho-/-? These data would be helpful to discriminate whether the switch of energy source by Txnip in the survival of cone cells is specific to rd1.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence in Methods: “Optomotor tests were conducted on <italic>rd10</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not with <italic>rd1</italic> strain, which loses vision at a very early age before any meaningful test can be performed.”</p><p>We have done RNA-seq with P90 <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice treated with Txnip vs. control (Figure 5— figure supplement 1A, originally Extended Data Figure 5a), and found a shared upregulation of mitochondrial ETC gene upregulation with <italic>rd1</italic> cones (Figure 5—source data 1, originally Supplementary Table 2). As explained above to Reviewer #2 (first point), cone degeneration shares a similar pattern across strains (Punzo et al., 2009). Given the improvement in <italic>rd10</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> vision via the OMR assay, the RNA-seq results, and the common hallmarks of degeneration across all of the strains, we did not believe it necessary to perform more assays on the <italic>rd10</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic><sup>-/-</sup> strains. <italic>Rd1</italic> was the preferred strain as it is more rapid than the other strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8a and 8b described the effect of vector combinations on cone survival in rd1, whereas Figure 8c actually mentioned the effect on outer segment in rd10.

The shape and morphology of mitochondria is in 3D and the EM images are taken from a different orientation and thus may have different results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that SBF-SEM is a better technology for mitochondria morphology. However, when we obtained the TEM imaging from multiple samples, it was very striking that the larger mitochondrial cross sections were in WT Txnip and Txnip.C247S treated <italic>rd1</italic> cones rather than in controls, as reflected by the distribution of outliers in these group (Figure 5B). We have added a new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 showing more mitochondrial images from different conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Did the authors observe any difference in the number of mitochondria in Txnip-treated retina?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, we did not observe any obvious difference in mitochondria numbers (also see response to Reviewer #2). As the Reviewer pointed out, TEM might not be the best technology to answer this question. From our flatmount mitoRFP images (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D, originally Extended Data Figure 5c,d), there is an increase in mitoRFP density in the central retina by Txnip. This likely reflects an increase of mitochondrial density in this region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Line 353: it would be helpful if the authors could explain why the Txnip rescue did not depend on ketolysis or ß-oxidation.</p></disp-quote><p>While we cannot know the answer to this question, we did speculate, in the original Discussion: “An important factor in the reliance on Ldhb could be the availability of lactate, which is highly available from serum (Hui et al., 2017). Lactate could be transported via the RPE and/or Müller glia, and/or the internal retinal vasculature which comes in closer proximity to cones after rod death. Ketones are usually only available during fasting, and lipids are hydrophobic molecules which are slow to be transported across the plasma membranes. Moreover, lipids are required to rebuild the membrane-rich outer segments, and thus might be somewhat limited.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.
