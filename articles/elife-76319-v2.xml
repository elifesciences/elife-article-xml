NK cells are also capable of modulating immune responses. In particular, they regulate T cell functions. Small RNA next-generation sequencing of resting and activated human NK cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) led to the identification of a specific repertoire of NK-EV-associated microRNAs and their post-transcriptional modifications signature. Several microRNAs of NK-EVs, namely miR-10b-5p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-155-5p, specifically target molecules involved in Th1 responses. NK-EVs promote the downregulation of <italic>GATA3</italic> mRNA in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and subsequent <italic>TBX21</italic> de-repression that leads to Th1 polarization and IFN-γ and IL-2 production. NK-EVs also have an effect on monocyte and moDCs (monocyte-derived dendritic cells) function, driving their activation and increased presentation and costimulatory functions. Nanoparticle-delivered NK-EV microRNAs partially recapitulate NK-EV effects in mice. Our results provide new insights on the immunomodulatory roles of NK-EVs that may help to improve their use as immunotherapeutic tools.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular vesicles (EVs)</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>microRNAs (miRNAs)</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>Th1 responses</kwd><kwd>monocyte-derived dendritic cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD1-2020-120412RB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007406</institution-id><institution>Fundación BBVA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007170</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Economy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Madrid</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extracellular vesicles derived from natural killer cells contain a specific repertoire of microRNAs that promote Th1 responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of cell-to-cell communication and play a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Messina et al., 2015</xref>). EVs, for example exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, carry not only bioactive molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, but also genetic information, including microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>). These miRNAs can be transferred among cells and modulate gene expression in the recipient cell.</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill cells undergoing different types of stress, including aging, malignant transformation, and pathogenic infection. NK cells also modulate immune responses, particularly T cell function. NK cells promote T cell differentiation, proliferation, and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crouse et al., 2015</xref>). These effects are mediated by direct interactions between NK and T lymphocytes; but also indirectly through their effect on antigen-presenting cells and the secretion of soluble factors.</p><p>Every immune cell releases EVs, including NK cells. Recent evidence shows that NK-derived EVs (NK-EVs) can exert antitumoural functions. NK cell-derived exosomes mediate cytolytic effects on melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) and neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shoae-Hassani et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, NK cell-derived exosomes contain cytotoxic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), such as Fas-L and perforin, which induce tumour cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lugini et al., 2012</xref>); or DNAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Pace et al., 2020</xref>), which is also involved in exosome-mediated antitumoural responses, as revealed by experiments using blocking antibodies. Proteomic analyses of NK-EVs have identified additional effector candidates that may induce tumour cell death, including TRAIL, NKG2D, or fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>) . Thus, increasing evidence supports the potential use of cytotoxic cell-derived EVs, including NK cells and also cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Del Vecchio et al., 2021</xref>). Although most studies to date have highlighted the potential role of NK-EVs in cancer, they can be potentially used to modulate other biological processes and pathologies. In particular, NK-EVs have a beneficial effect in lung injury recovery after <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). NK-EVs curb CCL4-induced liver fibrosis in mice by inhibiting TGF-β1-induced hepatic stellate cells activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Also, miR-207-containing NK-EVs alleviate depression-like symptoms in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, recent studies have identified the role of biologically active NK-EV miRNAs, such as miR-186, which impaired neuroblastoma tumour growth and inhibited immune escape mechanisms by targeting the TGF-β pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neviani et al., 2019</xref>); or miR-3607-3p, which inhibited pancreatic cancer, presumably by targeting its putative target IL-26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). These reports suggest the modulatory role of NK-EV-miRNAs to inhibit cancer progression. However, little is known regarding the overall small RNA composition of human NK-EVs, and their impact on the regulation of immune responses remains far from being fully elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we have set up a model to study human primary NK-EVs. We have analysed the small RNA content of resting and in vitro-activated NK cells and their secreted EVs by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We show that NK-EVs have specific miRNA repertoire and post-transcriptional modification (PtM) patterns, which differ from that of their parental cells. Analyses of the NK-EV miRNA signature revealed an enrichment of Th1 function-related miRNAs that target key T cell mRNA molecules. One example is <italic>GATA3</italic>, as its downregulation leads to T-bet de-repression. Other identified miRNAs are involved in dendritic cell (DC) presentation and costimulatory functions. We further show that NK-EVs promote T cell activation followed by IFN-γ and IL-2 production and induce DC expression of MHC-II and CD86 in DCs. Finally, in vivo nanoparticle-based delivery of the NK-EV-enriched miRNAs miR-10b-5p<italic>,</italic> miR-92a-3p, and miR-155-5p partially reproduces the effects of NK-EV treatment in T cell responses, suggesting an involvement of these miRNAs in effector functions. These findings shed light on the antitumour effects of NK-EVs, that among other effects, skew the balance towards inflammatory Th1 T cells, reinvigorating antitumoural responses and, therefore, support their use as immunotherapeutic tools.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NK-EVs bear a specific miRNA signature different from their secreting cells</title><p>To identify the miRNA repertoire of resting- and in vitro-activated NK cells and their load into EVs, we set up the protocol shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Briefly, NK cells were enriched from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of human healthy donor’s buffy coats by adding a mixture of IL-12 and IL-18 together with irradiated feeder cells. Six days after, cells were kept in culture with IL-2 for a further 48 hr, in the absence of feeder cells, and NK cell expansion was tested by flow cytometry before and after NK cell isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). EVs accumulated for 72 hr from 15 × 10<sup>6</sup> NK cells were purified by serial centrifugation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashiru et al., 2010</xref>) and tracked (EV-TRACK ID: EV210234). RNA was isolated from resting NK cells (directly isolated without being cultured), in vitro-activated NK cells, and small EVs released from activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Vesicles isolated from activated NK cells were characterized using NanoSight showing a mode size ranging from 165 to 209 nm among donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). Also, biochemical analyses showed the NK-EV expression of the exosomal markers CD63 and Tsg101 and the absence of the EV-excluded marker Calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In line with this, electron microscopy of isolated NK-EVs confirmed the presence of nano-sized membranous vesicles with their typical cup-shaped morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Analyses of the small EVs released from either resting or activated NK cells showed increased EV release upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). Indeed, EVs released from resting NK cells were barely detected using nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) and dot blot techniques, for this reason they were not included in the study.</p><p>Small RNA sequencing analyses showed that resting and activated cells display a distinct miRNA profile that differs to that of cultured activated NK cells-secreted EVs, as shown in heatmap and principal component plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A total of 130 miRNAs were differentially expressed between activated NK cells and NK-EV released miRNAs; 96 miRNAs being enriched in NK-EVs and 34 miRNAs being more abundant in NK cells than in NK-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Such differential expression suggested the existence of mechanisms of specific miRNAs sorting into EVs derived from NK cells, in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mateescu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szostak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batagov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>). Also, the repertoire found in resting NK cells was different from that of in vitro-activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A total of 70 miRNAs were upregulated upon activation, while 98 miRNAs decreased their levels after cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Most PtMs appeared at the edges of the canonical sequence, particularly at the terminal nucleotide (position 0) and the two flanking nucleotide positions (–1 and +1).

Cytosine addition was the most common modification, followed by adenine terminal insertions. Upon NK cell activation, miRNAs displayed reduced adenylation (positions −1, +1) and cytosylation (positions −1, +1).

Remarkably, by analysing the percentage of reads with PtMs for the miRNAs specifically enriched in NK-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel), we found a significantly higher proportion of isomiRs in NK-EVs than in their secreting-activated NK cells. This suggests that miRNA molecules with PtMs are more likely to be included into EVs. In fact, five out of six of the most enriched NK-EV miRNAs show a higher number of reads with PtMs in NK-EVs compared to activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We next analysed the specific nucleotide mono-additions in miRNAs preferentially targeted into NK-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We found that both adenylation and cytosylation of canonical miRNA sequences accounted for the observed accumulation of PtMs in the NK-EV fraction. The levels of guanosylated miRNAs were very low in all samples, although more represented in resting NK cells, while no significant differences were observed in the levels of uridine additions, among the samples analysed.</p><p>Altogether, accumulation of PtMs in miRNAs enriched in NK-EVs suggests an active PtMs-dependent mechanism of specific miRNA sorting into EVs. However, the accumulation of modified miRNAs in NK-EVs was not observed in the case of the most expressed NK-EV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating additional layers of complexity in NK-EV-miRNA-specific packaging, for example passive sorting of the most abundant miRNAs.</p><p>Specific short sequence miRNA motifs are over-represented in EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Binding of these motifs to RNA binding proteins, for example heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2B1), promotes miRNA sorting into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, the short EV-associated motif identified in T cell-derived small EVs GGAG was over-represented in NK-EV-miRNAs, and the tetra-nucleotide motif UGCA was also identified as a ‘cell retention motif’ in T cells, pointing towards similar mechanisms of miRNA sorting in lymphocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Martin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses of NK-EV-enriched specific miRNAs suggest that specific miRNAs packaging into NK-EVs may involve different mechanisms, including non-templated nucleotide additions to miRNA canonical sequences and short-motif miRNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins.

Moreover, to confirm the involvement of NK-EV-miRNAs in GATA3 downregulation and subsequent T-bet de-repression and Th1 reprogramming in T cells, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) bearing a combination of miR-10b-5p and miR-92a-3p, that specifically target this molecule, were synthesized and incubated with isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Three days after incubation with miRNA-bearing nanoparticles, the effects of NK-EVs in T-BET and GATA3 expression were partially recapitulated, indicating the involvement of these miRNAs in the observed phenotype.</p><p>Since ultracentrifugation of cell culture supernatants does not allow to fully rule out the involvement of other molecules in the activated NK secretome that may account for the observed effects, for example effector proteins including IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), several additional experiments were performed. NK-EV T cell uptake blockade using Dynasore abolished NK-EV-driven increase of IFN-γ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), indicating the involvement of EV-uptake in promoting Th1-like responses. Moreover, small EVs were isolated from activated NK cells using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), to exclude the contamination of protein complexes, lipoparticles, etc. Briefly, supernatants were added onto a chromatography column and fractions recovered and analysed for small EV markers expression. Fractions containing the CD81 and Tsg101 exosomal markers and lacking most protein aggregates were pooled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), and the effects of SEC-isolated NK-EVs on T cells were addressed, as above. Despite a significant loss of NK-EV material during the SEC purification steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>), confirmed by a reduction of the exosomal markers CD81 and Tsg101 to around 20% of the levels obtained by ultracentrifugation, a similar impact for SEC-isolated NK-derived small EVs in IFN-γ expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G,H</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to rule out the non-specific effects of isolated EVs on T cell function, small EVs were isolated from two distinct human cell lines (namely the HEK-293, human epithelial kidney cells, and the Raji B lymphoblast cell lines), using our standard ultracentrifugation procedure. These vesicles showed no impact on IFN-γ secretion, that even decreased 6 days after incubation with Raji B cell-derived EVs, indicating the specificity of NK-EVs in skewing Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by NK-EVs was also evaluated. NK-EVs promoted T cell activation, as revealed by increased CD25 expression in non-polarizing conditions; whereas these effects were not further increased in a Th1 cytokine-polarized milieu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Increased IL-2 release upon incubation with NK-EVs was confirmed by ELISA, 3 days after culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since CD25 is also a hallmark of regulatory T cells (Treg), we next analysed the expression of <italic>FOXP3</italic> and <italic>IL10</italic> production in NK-EV-treated T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although no significant differences were found, increased <italic>FOXP3</italic> levels (p-value &lt; 0.1) in non-polarized NK-EV-treated cells were observed compared to non-EV-treated cells. However, <italic>IL10</italic> secretion was not affected by NK-EV treatment, and was even reduced 3 days after culture in polarizing conditions. These data suggest that additional levels of regulation participate in T cell responses, and that NK-EVs may limit suppressive Treg functions in Th1-skewing conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Natural killer-derived extracellular vesicles (NK-EVs) promote CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and IL-2 release but not regulatory T cell (Treg) responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells incubated under non-cytokine-polarizing (upper panel) and Th1 cytokine-polarizing (with a mixture of IL-2 and IL-12, lower panel) conditions.

Studies aimed at characterizing the biological effect of DC-derived EVs have indicated that they can boost NK and T cell effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sobo-Vujanovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Munich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radomski et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, DC-derived exosomes capabilities are being used in clinical trials for immune maintenance after chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse et al., 2016</xref>) and cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>NK-EVs can kill target cells directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lugini et al., 2012</xref>) due to the presence of cytotoxic proteins amongst the cargo, as shown using proteomics assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korenevskii et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, specific NK-EV miRNAs were shown to exert antitumoural effects in neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neviani et al., 2019</xref>) and pancreatic cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In particular miR-186-5p identified as a downmodulated miRNA in patients with a high risk of developing neuroblastoma was found to inhibit key components of the TGF-β pathway limiting tumour immune evasion. However, the specific NK-EV miRNA repertoire and the impact of NK-EV-miRNAs in the immune response remains far from being fully elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we identify a specific miRNA signature of human NK cells (resting and activated) and their secreted EVs by small RNA NGS. Also, we show that a distinct pattern of PtMs is found in resting NK cells, activated NK cells, and NK-EVs. Global analysis of miRNA PtMs also identified a higher proportion of reads with PtMs for the miRNAs more highly expressed in the NK-EV fraction compared to both the relative levels of PtMs in these miRNAs at their parental cells, and to the percentage of PtMs found in NK-EVs of activated NK-cell-enriched miRNAs. Also, in this context, activated NK cells miRNAs exhibited significantly decreased levels of PtMs compared to resting cells. Indeed, several miRNAs, for example miR-122-5p, miR-409-3p, and miR-451a, are highly modified in resting NK cells, and in activated NK cell-derived EVs, while absent in activated NK cells. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that upon activation, post-transcriptionally modified NK-EV-miRNAs are preferentially targeted to small EVs. These results strongly suggest a PtM-dependent mechanism of miRNA-specific shuttling into NK- EVs.</p><p>Analyses of the specific nucleotide additions to the canonical miRNA sequences at different positions also highlighted a different signature for miRNAs in resting and activated NK cells and their released EVs. The post-transcriptional addition of non-templated nucleotides, particularly to the 3′ends of RNA molecules, is the most frequent and conserved RNA PtM. Interestingly, these modifications have an impact on miRNA stability, and gene regulation, thus on its regulatory capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu and Kim, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, 3′uridylation is related to miRNA turnover during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutiérrez-Vázquez et al., 2017</xref>). Non-templated addition of nucleotides has been differentially detected in diverse body fluids. PtMs of miRNAs have been previously reported to determine RNA fate and 3′ adenylation has been found to be over-represented in cells, while uridylation in exosomes from B cells suggesting a PtM-dependent specific cargo of miRNAs into small EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In our human NK cell model, we observed that the fraction of both adenylated and cytosylated miRNAs was abundant in resting NK cells and decreased upon activation. Remarkably, a significant enrichment of miRNAs with non-templated 3′-end additions of adenines and cytosines was found in the NK-EV fraction. It is therefore conceivable that cytosylated and adenylated miRNAs are preferentially sorted into small EVs upon NK cell activation.</p><p>Moreover, over-represented short sequence motifs were found in NK-EV-miRNAs. In particular, the previously identified GGAG exosomal-sorting motif in T cell-derived small EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>) was also enriched in NK-EV-miRNAs, indicating that binding of sumoylated ribonucleoproteins may also be involved in the control of NK-EV-miRNAs sorting. Altogether, our data indicate that a complex regulation, including miRNA PtMs and short motif recognition patterns, may determine the inclusion of specific miRNAs with potential regulatory effects into NK-EVs.</p><p>Interestingly, NK-EVs are enriched in miRNAs with important functions in the regulation of immune responses, in particular related to Th1 responses. Other miRNAs with immunomodulatory functions are also abundantly expressed in NK cell-derived EVs, for example miR-20a-5p and miR-25-3p. These two miRNA are transferred through the immune synapse, with an impact on germinal centre reaction and antibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernández-Messina et al., 2020</xref>). Incubation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with NK-EVs induced an increase of IFN-γ secretion and T-bet expression. This effect correlated with increased levels of the NK-EV-associated miR-10b-5p and miR-92a-3p and reduced levels of the T-bet suppressor GATA3, which is a putative target for these miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu and Kim, 2020</xref>). Since NK-EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation may associate with other molecules from the secretome, such as IFN-γ, additional experiments blocking EV uptake and isolating NK-EVs by SEC confirmed that the observed effects were mediated by NK-EVs. Moreover, EVs from other cell types, including the lymphoblast B cell line Raji did not show any enhancing effect on T cell function, indicating the specificity of NK-EVs promoting the observed phenotype.</p><p>In addition, nanoparticle-based delivery of NK-EV-miRNAs miR-92a and miR-155 in vivo promoted IFN-γ production. Thus, NK-EV miRNAs miR-10b-5p and miR-92a-3p uptake may promote GATA3 downregulation and subsequent T-bet de-repression, reprogramming recipient T cells towards the Th1 phenotype. In addition, NK-EVs drive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, marked by increased CD25 expression and IL-2 production, but do not significantly affect the Treg compartment. Indeed, although slightly increased levels of Foxp3 were found in T cells after incubation with NK-EVs, no increase in IL-10 secretion was observed and a reduction of this cytokine was found in polarizing conditions, suggesting that NK-EVs may be limiting Treg anti-inflammatory functions in these conditions. A similar trend was observed in vivo after nanoparticle delivery of NK-EV-specific miRNAs. In this regard, we detected reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TGF-β in T cells upon NK-EV addition. However, the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α was found to be increased in T cells shortly after NK-EV addition, in agreement with its presence in the NK92 cell line-derived exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). It is important to highlight that EVs do not only contain miRNAs, but also lipids and proteins that also may contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of the NK-EVs. The presence of these non-miRNA bioactive molecules in NK-EVs may account for some of the differences observed between the effects of synthetic miRNAs and NK-EVs.</p><p>Our data also show that NK-EVs may impact on T cell responses indirectly by increasing the polarization of monocytes to moDCs, and enhancing their presentation and costimulatory capacities, upregulating MHC-II and CD86, respectively. Hence, NK-EVs promote Th1 responses, both by directly targeting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and by increasing APCs stimulating functions, necessary for the establishment of effective T cells responses. In this regard, many tumours dampen Th effector cell-mediated immunosurveillance, and many immunotherapeutic approaches have focused in restoring Th1 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knutson and Disis, 2005</xref>). Immune therapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer, however, long-lasting effects are only observed in about 15% of the patients. This might be due to the variety of cancer immune evasion mechanisms, including immune-suppressive mediators in the tumour microenvironment, impairment of CTL responses, promotion of T cell tolerance, and/or exhaustion and polarization from Th1 to Th2, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marron et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we propose that NK-EV-mediated immune deviation towards Th1 may be exploited and taken into account when designing EV-based therapies. Interestingly, although primary human NK-EVs isolation may be tedious and time-consuming, a large-scale NK-EV isolation protocol has been set up and may help translate into clinical therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, here, we provide new insights on the miRNA composition and impact of NK-EVs on immune responses, promoting both directly and indirectly (via APCs) Th1 responses. Unravelling the effects and mechanisms underlying NK-EV-mediated immune targeting, in particular Th2 to Th1 immune deviation, may help to improve therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vitro cell culture, antibodies, and reagents</title><p>Primary human NK cells were obtained from healthy donor’s buffy coats, using a protocol modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roda-Navarro et al., 2006</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michiel Pegtel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the authors have not performed size-exclusion or density gradient separation before applying their functional experiments with purified EVs, they cannot rule out that other molecules in the activated NK secretome are responsible for the observed effects. For example, NK-EVs contain several effector proteins including IFN-γ (Choi et al., Molecules, 2020;25(21)). The authors should therefore exclude the possibility of contamination of IFN-γ derived from NK-EVs in Figure 4. Blocking EV uptake with dynasore for example could rule out a major contribution from other soluble factors. Since differential ultracentrifugation only is prone to have contamination of protein complexes, lipoparticles etc, can the authors show EM data of their EVs? In addition, how do the authors exclude the presence of feeder cell EVs in their EV-preps?</p><p>2) The suppl data shows some Western blotting of EVs from activated NK cells. Apart from their DE miRNA analysis between EVs from resting vs activated NK cells, it is possible that resting NK cells secrete much less EVs, it would behove the authors to demonstrate this with Western and NTA or TPRS.</p><p>The authors validated selected miRNAs expression by qPCR in Figure 1E. However, no miRNAs were significantly enriched in NK-EVs compared with activated NK cells. To support the author's proposal, the statistical significance of their expression between activated NK cells and NK-EVs should be confirmed.</p><p>Maybe the authors can include a separate table of the miRNAs that change in the activated NKs cells? In addition, log fold changes (alone) can be deceiving. Maybe the authors can show (relative) abundance data of their EV-enriched miRNAs?</p><p>3) Because the authors have not used control EVs from other cell types it remains somewhat unclear whether all EVs or specifically EVs from (activated) NK cells have the polarizing effects on the recipient cells. Furthermore, the authors proposed that NK-EV-associated miRNAs promote Th1-like responses via T-bet de-repression by downregulating Gata3 mRNA. To support their proposal, double-staining of T-bet and GATA3 by flow cytometry should be conducted in Figure 4 and Figure 7. In Figure 8, the authors claimed that NK-EV-associated miRNAs promoted Th1-like responses. However, it seems to be an overestimation because they did not show the downregulation of GATA3 by NK-EV-associated miRNAs and T-bet de-repression as well as IFN-γ induction from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by treatment with NK-EV-associated miRNAs. This fails to support the story of this manuscript.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could use an irrelevant control cell type that does not express much less of their miRNAs. As the nanoparticle experiments strongly suggest the involvement of miRNAs (in vivo), the authors should use their nanogold particles with miRNAs as controls for some of the crucial in vitro NK-EVs experiments discussed above and to determine what candidate miRNAs have the effect.</p><p>4) Template-independent terminal ribonucleotide transferases (TENTs) catalyze the addition of nucleotide monophosphates to the 3′-end of RNA molecules. While their efforts in their pMT (isomiR may be better) analysis are appreciated, global analysis of all miRNAs are not very informative. It is surprising that so many cytosine additions are found whereas adenylation and uridylation are known to be caused by uridylases and adenylases. Is there evidence of 3' tagging of mature mammalian miRNAs by cytidylation. Obviously, it would be interesting if this type of modification is somehow NK cell function related.</p><p>5) Despite a large body of independent evidence, the biological relevance of many Isomirs as found in sequencing data has recently been scrutinized (Hu et al., Nature Biotech 2021). Perhaps the authors can comment in their paper why their results are unlikely the result of artifacts during library preparation?</p><p>6) Their analysis of the NTAs, though comprehensive, makes little sense to me. The authors state that they analyzed variations from position -4 to +4. If the average mature miRNA is 21nts long, they thus examined sequences of 17-25 nucleotides, yet in their methods, they stated that they 'filter' the reads from 20nts? Please clarify.</p><p>How is it possible that position 0 (the last nucleotide on the 3' end of the miRNA) has a nucleotide addition if anything it should be a substitution? The authors should show the percentage of fully mature (untagged) canonical miRNAs in their graphs. The first NTA should be position +1, etc.</p><p>7) Figure 3B is interesting in that some miRNAs such miR122-5p is for 50% modified in resting cells yet not at all in activated cells, yet the (activated) NK cell EVs do contain modified miRNAs. What are the absolute or relative levels of these miRNAs in the NK cells? Can the authors provide an explanation?</p><p>The authors demonstrated that NK-EV-associated miRNAs possessed unique post-transcriptional modifications and short motifs in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Since the conclusions from both figures are similar, it would be better to combine Figure 2 and Figure 3 together.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Because it is unclear that the features of NK-EVs described in this paper is specific to NK-EVs, I recommend that the authors include data showing how NK cell-derived EVs are characterized compared to EVs derived from other cells. The followings are specific points that may improve the paper.</p><p>1. Are there differences in the repertoire of miRNAs among different subsets of lymphocytes?</p><p>2. Is the promotion of Th1-like responses specific to NK-EVs?</p><p>3. Similarly, is the down-modulation of Gata-3 and T-bet specific to NK EVs?</p><p>4. EVs are produced by many cell types. Is it possible to estimate the proportion of NK-EVs in total EVs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors isolated EVs with differential ultracentrifugation only which is prone to contamination of protein complexes, lipoparticles etc. Can the authors show EM data of their EVs.</p><p>2) Because the authors have not performed size-exclusion nor density gradient separation before applying their functional experiments with purified EVs they cannot rule out that other molecules in the activated NK secretome are responsible for the observed effects?

I do appreciate that the nanoparticle experiments strongly suggest the involvement of miRNAs (in vivo). The authors should use their nanogold particles with miRNAs as controls for some of the crucial the in vitro NK-EVs experiments. Do their nanoparticles have similar effects on CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 polarization and what candidate miRNAs have this effect? Ideally, the authors would examine the effects of NK-EVs in mice but I find that not required.</p><p>6) Maybe the authors can include a separate table of the miRNAs that change in the activated NKs cells?</p><p>7) Log fold changes (alone) can be deceiving. Maybe the authors can show (relative) abundance data of their EV-enriched miRNAs?</p><p>8) Template-independent terminal ribonucleotide transferases (TENTs) catalyze the addition of nucleotide monophosphates to the 3′-end of RNA molecules. While I appreciate their efforts in their pMT (I prefer isomiR) analysis, global analysis of all miRNAs are in my view not very informative.

For example, NK-EVs contain several effector proteins including IFN-γ (Choi et al., Molecules, 2020;25(21)). The authors should therefore exclude the possibility of contamination of IFN-γ derived from NK-EVs in Figure 4. Blocking EV uptake with dynasore for example could rule out a major contribution from other soluble factors. Since differential ultracentrifugation only is prone to have contamination of protein complexes, lipoparticles etc, can the authors show EM data of their EVs? In addition, how do the authors exclude the presence of feeder cell EVs in their EV-preps?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that ultracentrifugation of cell culture supernatants does not allow to fully rule out the involvement of other molecules, such as IFN-γ in the observed effects. To address this issue we have performed additional experiments, using different approaches, as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>First, we analyzed the effects of NK-derived EVs on isolated T lymphocytes pre-treated with Dynasore to block EV uptake. As included in the new figure (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B), after dynamin-dependent endocytosis blockade, the upregulation of IFN-γ and CD25 and driven by NK-EVs were abolished, indicating that the observed effects on T cell function are mediated by NK-derived EVs. It is worthwhile mentioning, that since dynasore has been shown to enhance the formation of mitochondrial antiviral signalling aggregates and promote endocytosis-independent NF-κB activation, this may interfere with lymphocyte activation (1).</p><p>To further rule out the involvement of soluble factors co-precipitating with the small EV pellet after 100,000 g ultracentifugation, we isolated small EVs from NK cell culture supernatants, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-H and new Figure 4figure supplement 2C,D). Fractions 8-11, that expressed the exosomal markers CD81 and Tsg101 and low levels of protein aggregates (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D), were pooled and ultracentrifuged before functional analysis. Despite a significant loss of NK-EV material during the SEC purification steps (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F), confirmed by a reduction of the exosomal markers CD81 and Tsg101 to around 20% of the levels obtained by ultracentrifugation, a similar impact for SEC-isolated NK-derived small EVs on T cell function was observed, both in IFN-γ (Figure 3—figure supplement 2G,H) and more significantly in CD25 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D).</p><p>Altogether, experiments using either Dynasore or SEC, confirmed that NK-EVs account for the observed effects, although we cannot completely rule out that the presence of soluble factors may also play a partial role. These experiments have been added to the manuscript as supplementary materials, as indicated, and the main text, discussion and material methods have been modified accordingly, as highlighted in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, as suggested by the reviewers, we have performed Electron microscopy from NKEVs isolated from NK cell culture supernatants by differential ultracentrifugation, as described in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and methods. Electron microscopy confirmed the average size range of small EVs (between 50-200nm) and their typical cup-shape morphology and membranous structure by negative staining (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). The main text of the manuscript and the material and methods section have been modified accordingly.</p><p>Concerning the reviewer´s comment, we acknowledge that the presence of feeder cell-derived EVs in the vesicle preparation needs to be avoided. For this reason, our protocol rules out this possibility by isolating NK cells expanded in the presence of the cytokine cocktail and feeder cells, as described in methods, before small EV accumulation and isolation. After NK cell isolation, using the appropriate Miltenyi kit, following the manufacturer´s indications, the purity of isolated NK cells was checked by flow cytometry (CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup>), before incubating the cells in EV-depleted medium for small EV accumulation and further isolation by ultracentrifugation. This has been further clarified in the main text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The suppl data shows some Western blotting of EVs from activated NK cells.

However, no miRNAs were significantly enriched in NK-EVs compared with activated NK cells. To support the author's proposal, the statistical significance of their expression between activated NK cells and NK-EVs should be confirmed.</p><p>Maybe the authors can include a separate table of the miRNAs that change in the activated NKs cells? In addition, log fold changes (alone) can be deceiving. Maybe the authors can show (relative) abundance data of their EV-enriched miRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>Resting NK cells were isolated form healthy donor´s buffy coats and, in parallel, activated NK cells were generated using our standard procedure, as described in the methods section. Small EVs were isolated from both resting and activated NK cells by ultracentrifugation, as described in the manuscript. It is important to highlight that resting CD3<sup>-</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells are a small proportion of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, representing according to Angelo et al., 0.61 – 16.87% in healthy adults, with a mean of 6.47% (2). Thus, the number of resting NK cells that we could isolate from buffy coats were very limited (up to 5x10<sup>6</sup> total cells) and therefore the amounts of small EVs that we could isolate were very low, even from activated NK cells, and unfortunately below the limit of detection of our western blotting techniques.</p><p>Nevertheless, using Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA), we could detect small EVs derived from 5x10<sup>6</sup> either resting or in vitro activated NK cells, although at very low levels, and confirmed that activated NK cells release significantly more small EVs than their resting cell counterparts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I). Indeed, very few particles were detected in resting NK cell-derived small EVs. Moreover, dot blot analyses allowed to detect CD81 and Tsg101 exosomal markers in small EVs purified from activated NK cells, while EVs released by the same number of resting NK cells could not be detected (Figure 1—figure supplement 1J). Altogether our data confirm that resting NK cells release much less EVs than activated NK cells.</p><p>Following the reviewers comments we have included a separate table where we show the relative abundance of EV-miRNAs in secreting activated NK cells and their secreted EVs from small RNA sequencing data, and the corresponding plots, including statistics (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C). Also, we have re-analyzed the qPCR data and show Paired t-test analysis, comparing Resting vs Activated cells, Activated cells vs NK-EVs and Resting cells vs NK-EVs (Figure 1E,F). These analyses confirm the results from the sequencing data, showing differences between Activated NK cells and their released NK-EVs, that reach statistic significance in most cases. For hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-99a-5p validations by qPCR, comparing activated cells and their released EVs, t-tests yields p-values slightly above 0.1 (0.1656 and 0.1302, respectively), due to the variability among donors. However, the enrichment of these miRNAs in NK-EVs compared to their parental cells is consistent within individuals, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Because the authors have not used control EVs from other cell types it remains somewhat unclear whether all EVs or specifically EVs from (activated) NK cells have the polarizing effects on the recipient cells. Furthermore, the authors proposed that NK-EV-associated miRNAs promote Th1-like responses via T-bet de-repression by downregulating Gata3 mRNA. To support their proposal, double-staining of T-bet and GATA3 by flow cytometry should be conducted in Figure 4 and Figure 7. In Figure 8, the authors claimed that NK-EV-associated miRNAs promoted Th1-like responses. However, it seems to be an overestimation because they did not show the downregulation of GATA3 by NK-EV-associated miRNAs and T-bet de-repression as well as IFN-γ induction from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by treatment with NK-EV-associated miRNAs. This fails to support the story of this manuscript.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could use an irrelevant control cell type that does not express much less of their miRNAs. As the nanoparticle experiments strongly suggest the involvement of miRNAs (in vivo), the authors should use their nanogold particles with miRNAs as controls for some of the crucial in vitro NK-EVs experiments discussed above and to determine what candidate miRNAs have the effect.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this key point raised by the reviewers, several new experiments were performed.</p><p>First, small EVs from two distinct human cell lines (namely the HEK-293, human epithelial kidney cells and the Raji B lymphoblast cells) were isolated, following the differential ultracentrifugation protocol, as described in the methods section. Their effects in primary T cells isolated from human healthy donors showed no impact, neither in IFN-γ secretion (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3), nor in activation, measured by CD25 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E,F), that even decreased upon Raji B cell EV-treatment under Th1-polarizing conditions.</p><p>Also, three microRNAs that are preferentially excluded from the NK-EV fraction were selected, namely hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-3667 and hsa-miR-4158 and loaded onto gold-nanoparticles (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2), and their effects were evaluated in immunocompetent C57/BL6 mice after footpad injection. These experiments showed no effects of these nanoparticles, as observed for NK-EV enriched microRNAs, neither in activation, nor in IFN-γ secretion (new Figure 6H).</p><p>Furthermore, we have analyzed the effects of the addition of a mixture of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-10b-5p AuNPs to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, that putatively target GATA-3 (Supplementary Table 2). Three days after incubation, we found that, as observed for mRNA transcript levels (Figure 3E), GATA-3 protein levels were reduced while T-bet expression increased, compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells incubated with Control-AuNPs by western blot (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F) and a similar trend was observed by flow cytometry analyses after NK-EV incubation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).However, since it is well documented that miRNAs target several mRNAs, very likely other targets may contribute to the observed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Template-independent terminal ribonucleotide transferases (TENTs) catalyze the addition of nucleotide monophosphates to the 3′-end of RNA molecules.

It has thus been suggested that non-canonical “modification tails” may be an artifact due to the specific 3’ adaptor sequence and/or ligation chemistry used for library preparation.</p><p>In our case, the adaptor remains cannot contribute to the presence of non-templated &quot;C&quot; residues at the 3' end of miRNAs, as described in Rodríguez-Galan et al., (9). Briefly, in our experimental settings, adaptors used in the current experiments are standard Illumina TruSeq adaptors that start with the sequence &quot;AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT&quot;. Adaptor sequences were removed with cutadapt, using the following line of code, for each fastq file:</p><p>cutadapt -m 15-M35-O7-o trimmed.fq --untrimmed-output=untrimmed.fq --too-shortoutput=tooshort.fq -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC input.fq</p><p>Regarding the possibility of ligation bias, we are aware that this may affect any library preparation strategy. While it is true that some bias might exist in the absolute quantification of miRNAs with a specific nucleotide composition, in our manuscript, we focus on comparing this composition across different types of samples (resting NK cells, activated NK cells and NK-derived EVs). Thus, this bias would be affecting every sample and our comparisons would still be valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Their analysis of the NTAs, though comprehensive, makes little sense to me.

For the sake of clarity, we have modified the nomenclature in the main text and refer to each specific modification as either nucleotide “additions” or “substitutions”, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>The average size of mature miRNAs is 22 nt and more than 90% of those described in miRBAse21 have lengths equal to 20 nt and/or higher.

Can the authors provide an explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is interesting that certain miRNAs, namely miR-122-5p, but also miR-409-3p and miR-451a that follow a similar trend, are highly modified in resting NK cells, and in activated NK-derived EVs, while absent y activated NK cells. We believe, that a possible explanation for this observation is, that upon activation, modified miRNAs, e.g. miR-122-5p are more prone to be sorted into EVs. In this sense, it was described that uridylation may promote exosome loading, while adenylated miRNA isoforms were relatively enriched in B cells (10). Thus, a similar mechanism might be occurring in human activated NK cells for modified miRNAs, that could be tagged for EV packaging. This has been added to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Concerning the relative values of these miRNAs, for miR-122-5p, these levels are relatively low but very similar in both resting and activated NK cells, while high in NK-EVs (Relative Counts Per Million; REST: 0,57, ACT: 0,52 and NK-EVs: 313,94).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors demonstrated that NK-EV-associated miRNAs possessed unique post-transcriptional modifications and short motifs in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

These experiments showed no effects of these nanoparticles, as observed for NK-EV enriched microRNAs, neither in activation, nor in IFN-γ secretion (new Figure 6H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Maybe the authors can include a separate table of the miRNAs that change in the activated NKs cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer´s comment we have included a separate table where we show the relative abundance of EV-miRNAs in secreting activated NK cells and their secreted EVs from small RNA sequencing data, and the corresponding plots, including statistics (new Figure 1figure supplement 2B,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Log fold changes (alone) can be deceiving. Maybe the authors can show (relative) abundance data of their EV-enriched miRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>Besides the new figure mentioned above, individual values can be found in Supplementary Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Template-independent terminal ribonucleotide transferases (TENTs) catalyze the addition of nucleotide monophosphates to the 3′-end of RNA molecules. While I appreciate their efforts in their pMT (I prefer isomiR) analysis, global analysis of all miRNAs are in my view not very informative. It is surprising that so many cytosine additions are found whereas adenylation and uridylation are known to be caused by uridylases and adenylases. Is there evidence of 3' tagging of mature mammalian miRNAs by cytidylation. Obviously, it would be interesting if this type of modification is somehow NK cell function related.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer´s suggestion we have modified in the text to refer to modified miRNAs as isomiRs. As the reviewer points out, uridylation and adenylation are the most typical 3′ end modifications across animal miRNAs (3-6).</p><p>Several studies evaluating PtMs have found guanidinylation and cytosilation to be barely represented. However, cytosine addition was found to be the second most abundant 3´modification in mouse primordial germ cells and gonadal somatic cells at various embryonic stages (7) and was also described in Arabidopsis (8).</p><p>Moreover, in a recent paper from our group, cytosylation was found to be a significant posttranscriptional modification in human T cells (9), suggesting that cytosine additions may be relevant for human lymphocyte function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Despite a large body of independent evidence, the biological relevance of many Isomirs as found in sequencing data has recently been scrutinized (Hu et al., Nature Biotech 2021). Perhaps the authors can comment in their paper why their results are unlikely the result of artifacts during library preparation?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that ligation bias has been well documented in conventional small RNA-seq methods. It has thus been suggested that non-canonical “modification tails” may be an artifact due to the specific 3’ adaptor sequence and/or ligation chemistry used for library preparation.</p><p>In our case, the adaptor remains cannot contribute to the presence of non-templated &quot;C&quot; residues at the 3' end of miRNAs, as described in Rodríguez-Galan et al., (9). Briefly, in our experimental settings, adaptors used in the current experiments are standard Illumina TruSeq adaptors that start with the sequence &quot;AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT&quot;. Adaptor sequences were removed with cutadapt, using the following line of code, for each fastq file:</p><p>cutadapt -m 15 -M 35 -O 7-o trimmed.fq --untrimmed-output=untrimmed.fq --too-shortoutput=tooshort.fq -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC input.fq</p><p>Regarding the possibility of ligation bias, we are aware that this may affect any library preparation strategy. While it is true that some bias might exist in the absolute quantification of miRNAs with a specific nucleotide composition, in our manuscript, we focus on comparing this composition across different types of samples (resting NK cells, activated NK cells and NK-derived EVs). Thus, this bias would be affecting every sample and our comparisons would still be valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Their analysis of the NTAs, though comprehensive, makes little sense to me. The authors state that they analyzed variations from position -4 to +4. If the average mature miRNA is 21nts long, they thus examined sequences of 17-25 nucleotides, yet in their methods, they stated that they 'filter' the reads from 20nts? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our analysis is based on non-templated modifications, being either substitutions within the canonical sequence (mainly positions -1, 0), or additions, from position +1 onwards. For the sake of clarity, we have modified the nomenclature in the main text and refer to each specific modification as either nucleotide “additions” or “substitutions”, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>The average size of mature miRNAs is 22 nt and more than 90% of those described in miRBAse21 have lengths equal to 20 nt and/or higher. For the current study, read pre-processing was performed with a pipeline that used cutadapt and FastQC: the first to remove Illumina adapters and to select trimmed reads with lengths equal or larger than 20, and the second to perform quality checks on the reads.</p><p>To identify PtMs, we used Chimira to align pre-processed reads against miRNA hairpin sequences from the human component of miRBase, with the aim of identifying nucleotide sequences diverging from the reference sequence (modifications).</p><p>To provide a common, unified framework for visualization and PtM summarization, Chimira adjusts the alignments on the 3'end, mapping everything to a length of 23 nt, using a zero-based coordinate system.</p><p>In that context, the initial position (5'end) is referred as &quot;zero&quot;, and modification positions located before or after the 5'end are identified with negative and positive indices, respectively. The end position (3'end) is numbered as position &quot;22&quot;, independently of the real length of miRNAs. As it happened on the 5'ends, modification positions located before or after the 3'end are identified with negative and positive indices, respectively.</p><p>Therefore, by focusing on positions -4 to +4, we were searching for sequence variations, relative to each reference sequence in miRBAse, in a 9 nt long region that was centered on the 3'end of miRNAs, independently of their length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) How is it possible that position 0 (the last nucleotide on the 3' end of the miRNA) has a nucleotide addition if anything it should be a substitution? The authors should show the percentage of fully mature (untagged) canonical miRNAs in their graphs. The first NTA should be position +1, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the previous point. We have modified the nomenclature as suggested by the reviewer as highlighted in the main manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3B is interesting in that some miRNAs such miR122-5p is for 50% modified in resting cells yet not at all in activated cells, yet the (activated) NK cell EVs do contain modified miRNAs. What are the absolute or relative levels of these miRNAs in the NK cells? Can the authors provide an explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is interesting that certain miRNAs, namely miR-122-5p, but also miR-409-3p and miR-451a that follow a similar trend, are highly modified in resting NK cells, and in activated NK-derived EVs, while absent y activated NK cells. We believe, that a possible explanation for this observation is, that upon activation, modified miRNAs, e.g. miR-122-5p are more prone to be sorted into EVs. In this sense, it was described that uridylation may promote exosome loading, while adenylated miRNA isoforms were relatively enriched in B cells (10). Thus, a similar mechanism might be ocurrying in human activated NK cells for modified miRNAs, that could be tagged for EV packaging. This has been added to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Concerning the relative values of these miRNAs, for miR-122-5p, these levels are relatively low but very similar in both resting and activated NK cells, while high in NK-EVs (Relative Counts Per Million; REST: 0,57, ACT: 0,52 and NK-EVs: 313,94).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the report entitled &quot;Natural killer (NK) cell-derived extracellular-vesicle shuttled microRNAs control T cell responses&quot;, Dosil et al., identified NK-extracellular-vesicle (EV)-associated microRNAs and their post-transcriptional modifications signature by small RNA next-generation sequencing. They also found that NK-EVs promoted Th1 polarization and activation of monocyte and moDCs. They suggested that the identified NK-EV-associated microRNAs partially recapitulated NK-EV effects in T cells in vivo.</p><p>The study contains some interesting findings. However, the impacts of NK-EVs and NK-EV-associated microRNAs on Th1 differentiation are not impressive. In addition, their evidence is not sufficient to support their proposal that NK-EV-associated microRNAs promote Th1-like responses via T-bet de-repression by down-regulation of GATA3.</p><p>1. The authors validated selected microRNAs expression by qPCR in Figure 1E. However, no microRNAs were significantly enriched in NK-EVs compared with activated NK cells. To support the author's proposal, statistical significance of their expression between activated NK cells and NK-EVs should be confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We have now included a separate table where we show the relative abundance of EV-miRNAs in secreting activated NK cells and their secreted EVs from small RNA sequencing data, and the corresponding plots, including statistics (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C).</p><p>Also, we have re-analyzed the qPCR data and show Paired t-test analysis, comparing Resting vs Activated cells, Activated cells vs NK-EVs and Resting cells vs NK-EVs (Figure 1E,F). These analyses confirm the results from the sequencing data, showing differences between Activated NK cells and their released NK-EVs, that reach statistic significance in most cases. For hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-99a-5p validations by qPCR, comparing activated cells and their released EVs, t-tests yields p-values slightly above 0.1 (0.1656 and 0.1302, respectively), due to the variability among donors. However, the enrichment of these miRNAs in NK-EVs compared to their parental cells is consistent within individuals, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors demonstrated that NK-EV-associated microRNAs possessed unique post-transcriptional modifications and short motifs in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Since the conclusions from both figures are similar, it would be better to combine Figure 2 and Figure 3 together.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now merged these two figures as new Figure 2, and added the additional panels as figure supplements in the revised manuscript, and modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As mentioned above, the impact of NK-EVs on Th1 polarization was quite minor in Figure 4. Furthermore, the authors failed to induce IFN-γ production from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by administration of selected microRNAs in Figure 7F.</p><p>NK-EVs contain several effector proteins including IFN-γ (Choi et al., Molecules, 2020;25(21)). So, they should exclude the possibility of contamination of IFN-γ derived from NK-EVs in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, and since ultracentrifugation of cell culture supernatants does not allow to fully rule out the involvement of other molecules, such as IFN-<italic>γ</italic> in the observed effects, we have performed additional experiments, using different approaches.</p><p>First, we analyzed the effects of NK-derived EVs on isolated T lymphocytes pre-treated with Dynasore to block EV uptake. As included in the new figure (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B), after dynamin-dependent endocytosis blockade, the upregulation of IFN-γ and CD25 and driven by NK-EVs were abolished, indicating that the observed effects on T cell function are mediated by NK-derived EVs. It is worthwhile mentioning, that since dynasore has been shown to enhance the formation of mitochondrial antiviral signalling aggregates and promote endocytosis-independent NF-κB activation, this may interfere with lymphocyte activation (1).</p><p>To further rule out the involvement of soluble factors co-precipitating with the small EV pellet after 100,000 g ultracentifugation, we isolated small EVs from NK cell culture supernatants, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-H and new Figure 4figure supplement 2C,D). Fractions 8-11, that expressed the exosomal markers CD81 and Tsg101 and low levels of protein aggregates (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D), were pooled and ultracentrifuged before functional analysis. Despite a significant loss of NK-EV material during the SEC purification steps (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2E,F), confirmed by a reduction of the exosomal markers CD81 and Tsg101 to around 20% of the levels obtained by ultracentrifugation, a similar impact for SEC-isolated NK-derived small EVs on T cell function was observed, both in IFN-γ (Figure 3—figure supplement 2G,H) and more significantly in CD25 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D).</p><p>Altogether, experiments using either Dynasore or SEC, confirmed that NK-EVs account for the observed effects, although we cannot completely rule out that the presence of soluble factors may also play a partial role. These experiments have been added to the manuscript as supplementary materials, as indicated, and the main text, discussion and material methods have been modified accordingly, as highlighted in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors proposed that NK-EV-associated microRNAs promote Th1-like responses via T-bet de-repression by downregulating Gata3 mRNA. To ensure their proposal, double-staining of T-bet and GATA3 by flow cytometry should be conducted in Figure 4 and Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point raised by the reviewer two strategies have been carried out. First, we have analyzed the effects of the addition of a mixture of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-10b-5p AuNPs to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, that putatively target GATA-3 (Supplementary Table 2). Three days after incubation, we found that, as observed for mRNA transcript levels (Figure 3E), GATA-3 protein levels were reduced while T-bet expression increased, compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells incubated with Control-AuNPs by western blot (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Also, a similar trend was observed by flow cytometry analyses after NK-EV incubation (Figure 3figure supplement 1E), although GATA-3 levels were low. However, since it is well documented that miRNAs target several mRNAs, very likely other targets may contribute to the observed effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 8, the authors represent that NK-EV-associated microRNAs promote Th1-like responses. However, it seems to be an overestimation because they did not show the downregulation of GATA3 by NK-EV-associated microRNAs and T-bet de-repression as well as IFN-γ induction from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by treatment of NK-EV-associated microRNAs. This fails to support the story of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the previous point.</p><p>References</p><p>M. Ailenberg, C. Di Ciano-Oliveira, K. Szaszi, Q. Dan, M. Rozycki, A.
