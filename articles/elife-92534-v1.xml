The factors governing the transmissibility of viruses between susceptible hosts are incompletely understood. Bacteria serve as food for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and represent an integral part of the natural environment of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We determined the effects of bacteria isolated with <italic>C. elegans</italic> from its natural environment on the transmission of Orsay virus in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using quantitative virus transmission and host susceptibility assays.

We found that pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains PA01 and PA14 further attenuated virus transmission. We determined that the amount of Orsay virus required to infect 50% of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> population on <italic>P. lurida</italic> MYb11 compared with <italic>Ochrobactrum vermis</italic> MYb71 was dramatically increased, over three orders of magnitude.

Infection can have profound consequences for the health of an individual host. The ability of viruses to transmit from one individual to another can scale these consequences causing morbidity and mortality throughout whole populations. Many factors influence virus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pica and Bouvier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thangavel and Bouvier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vries et al., 2021</xref>). Abiotic factors such as temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowen et al., 2007</xref>) and humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schulman and Kilbourne, 1962</xref>) and biotic factors such as viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edenborough et al., 2012</xref>) and host immune status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2015</xref>) all interact to determine transmission rates. Despite these findings, the determinants of virus transmissibility remain incompletely understood.</p><p>The microbiota has emerged as a host-associated factor that modulates multiple aspects of virus infection and thereby alters transmission rates among host organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In general, the microbiota is critical for the proper development of the immune system and for the effective activation of antimicrobial immune responses even at sites distal to microbiota colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). More specifically, bacteria and bacterial surface structures such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan have been shown to stabilize poliovirus and reovirus in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2017</xref>). These observations likely explain why microbiota depletion by antibiotic treatment was sufficient to provide protection against the same viruses in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuss et al., 2011</xref>). The bacterial symbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protects numerous insect species from multiple viruses either by upregulating antiviral defenses or competing for intracellular nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hedges et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teixeira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pimentel et al., 2020</xref>). Individual bacteria have also been found to enhance viral infection; <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> promoted infection of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> by Dengue, Zika, and Sindbis viruses by secreting a protein, enhancin, that degrades the mucus layer covering epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a nematode often found in microbially rich environments such as rotting vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulenburg and Félix, 2017</xref>). The first naturally occurring virus capable of infecting the <italic>C. elegans</italic> was isolated from Orsay, France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Félix et al., 2011</xref>). Orsay virus is a part of a group of nematode infecting viruses closely related to the Nodaviridae family of viruses which infect arthropods and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Félix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Félix and Wang, 2019</xref>).

We sought to assess the impact of bacteria on Orsay virus transmission rates and utilized a collection of bacteria isolated from the environment with wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> to assemble a panel of Gram-negative bacteria for comparison with the standard laboratory bacterial food, <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dirksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dirksen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Troemel et al., 2008</xref>). All animals were raised to young adulthood on lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to eliminate differences in developmental rates caused by different bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dirksen, 2020</xref>). We set up a transmission assay by placing infected animals (‘spreaders’) together with uninfected animals on a monoaxenic lawn of each test bacterium. We quantified the incidence proportion, defined as the number of new infections produced after 24 hr as determined by detection of induction of the <italic>pals-5p::GFP</italic> reporter, which is induced by infection with Orsay virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakowski et al., 2014</xref>). We observed a wide range in the measured incidence proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Exposure to many of the naturally associated bacterial strains resulted in transmission that was comparable to the incidence proportion observed with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 with some prominent exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Two <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> species promoted virus infection in nearly all individuals in the transmission assay and increased the incidence proportion 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We confirmed that transmission from the initial spreader animals in the assay, and not multiple rounds of infection, was responsible for the increased incidence proportion observed in the presence of <italic>Ochrobactrum vermis</italic> MYb71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, the presence of <italic>Pseudomonas lurida</italic> MYb11 reduced the incidence proportion 4.1-fold compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and 11-fold compared to <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

They find that Ochrobactrum species increase infection rates, while Pseudomonas species decrease infection rates, and they identify regulators of quorum sensing and the gacA two-component system as genetic factors in the effects of Pseudomonas on infection. These findings provide important insights into the species-specific effects that bacteria can have on viral infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and they may have relevance for the impact of bacterial species on viral infection in other systems. Overall the manuscript has high rigor. However, a few minor concerns are listed below.</p><p>(1) The authors state that the amount of bacteria added to each plate was standardized by seeding plates with equivalent volumes of overnight culture. This approach does not account for differences in bacterial growth rate. A more rigorous approach would be to standardize based on OD600 measurements or CFU's. Alternatively, the authors could include bacterial growth curves to demonstrate that each strain/species has reached a similar growth phase (i.e. late log) at the time of plating, as bacterial physiology and virulence is dependent on the stage of growth. At the least, if it is not possible to perform these experiments, it would be useful to include a statement that potential differences in bacterial growth rate may influence their conclusions.</p><p>(2) Line 314-315: The claim &quot;We did not observe any potent effect on host susceptibility to infection by Orsay virus from any supernatant (Supp. Fig. 9)&quot; is not fully supported by the data, as the data in Fig S9 only show pals-5p::GFP levels. To confirm that host susceptibility is not affected, the authors would also measure the viral infection rate and/or viral load. Otherwise, the authors should rephrase the conclusion to increase accuracy.

The authors demonstrate that susceptibility to viral infection can change by several orders of magnitude based on the type of bacterial food that potential hosts consume. They go on to show that, for the bacterial food source that reduces susceptibility, the effect is modulated by quorum sensing molecules that the bacteria produce.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript shows convincingly that nematode susceptibility to viral infection changes by several orders of magnitude (i.e. doses must be increased by several orders of magnitude to infect the same fraction of the population) depending on the bacterial food source on which hosts are reared. The authors then focus on the bacteria that reduce host susceptibility to viral infection and demonstrate that certain bacterial quorum-sensing compounds are required to see this effect of reduced susceptibility. Overall, sample sizes are large, methods are generally rigorous, experiments are repeated, and patterns are clear.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the molecular correlate of reduced susceptibility is identified (i.e. quorum sensing compounds) the mechanisms underlying this effect are missing. For example, there are changes in susceptibility due to altered nutrition, host condition, the microbiome, feeding rate, mortality of infected hosts, etc. In addition, the authors focus almost entirely on the reduction in susceptibility even though I personally find the increased susceptibility generated when reared on Ochrobactrum to be much more exciting.</p><p>I was a bit surprised that there was no data on basic factors that could have led to reductions in susceptibility. In particular, data on feeding rates and mortality rates seem really important. I would expect that feeding rates are reduced in the presence of Pseudomonas. Reduced feeding rates would translate to lower consumed doses, and so even though the same concentration of virus is on a plate, it doesn't mean that the same quantity of virus is consumed. Likewise, if Pseudomonas is causing mortality of virus-infected hosts, it could give the impression of lower infection rates. Perhaps mortality rates are too small in the experimental setup to explain this pattern, but that isn't clear in the current version of the manuscript. Is mortality greatly impacted by knocking out quorum-sensing genes? Also, the authors explored susceptibility to infection, but completely ignored variation in virus shedding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data on feeding rates (Line numbers 141-148 and 176-182, Supplementary Figure 4). After six hours of exposure no differences in feeding rate were observed. After 24 hours minor differences emerged between <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 and each Pseudomonas species, however feeding rate inversely correlated with susceptibility to Orsay virus in that <italic>O. vermis</italic> MYb71 displayed the lowest feeding rate while <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 displayed the highest feeding rate.</p><p>We have also added data on mortality rates (Line numbers 183-200, Supplementary Figure 6). No significant mortality was observed within the 24-hour exposure period used for our Orsay infection and transmission assays. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence is dependent upon temperature and as our assays are done at 20°C rather than 25°C this may account for reduced mortality compared to other published results. Regardless, we noted that O. vermis MYb71 killed <italic>C. elegans</italic> as quickly as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 under these conditions and these two bacteria led to the shortest lifespan compared to the other tested bacteria. Interestingly, P. lurida MYb11 was observed to be more virulent than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 under these conditions. These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between mortality and susceptibility to Orsay virus, although it does not rule out that virulence effects unique to each bacterium could contribute to alterations in host susceptibility.</p><p>The reviewer is correct to assert that differences in viral shedding could exist. However, our susceptibility assays using exogenous Orsay virus remove this source of variation and yet we still observe the same trends such that O. vermis MYb71 promotes infection while P. lurida MYb11, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 attenuate infection. Further we measured the amount of virus shed into the lawns in the presence of different bacteria and did not observe differences in shed virus that could account for the differences we observe in incidence proportion (Line numbers 241-254, Fig. 3 F). Viral stability could be an issue in both the transmission and susceptibility assays. We therefore tested viral stability in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic>, P. lurida MYb11, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01, and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 and successfully recovered virus from all lawns, suggesting virus is not rapidly degraded in the presence of any bacterium (Fig. 3D and 3E). However, we noted that the recovery of Orsay virus from lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and P. lurida MYb11 within 30 minutes was decreased compared to a spike-in control suggesting recovery from each lawn is not equivalent. This complicates a comparison of viral stability and shedding rates between different bacteria, but our ability to recover substantial amounts of virus in the shedding assay from the three Pseudomonas strains we examined precludes a substantial decrease in shedding rates as an explanation for the robust attenuation of Orsay virus observed in transmission assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also curious why the authors did not further explore the mechanism behind the quorumsensing effect. Not sure whether this is possible, but would it be possible to add spent media to the infection plates where the spent media was from Pseudomonas that produce the quorum sensing compound but the plates contain OP50, Pseudomonas, or the quorum sensing knockout of Pseudomonas? That would reveal whether it is the compound itself vs. something that the compound does.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed that quorum sensing mutants suppressed the attenuation of Orsay virus infection and we agree that this could be a consequence of the compounds themselves, or more likely an effect of the downstream consequences of quorum signaling. We added culture supernatant from each bacterium to lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to assess the effect on host susceptibility and did not observe any potent effect (Line numbers 311-318, Supplementary Figure 9). This supports an interpretation that it is not the compound itself that is responsible, however we cannot rule out that the compounds themselves may be responsible if provided at a higher concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I was surprised by how much focus there was on the attenuation of infection and how little there was on the enhancement of infection. To me, enhancement seems like the more obvious thing to find a mechanism for -- is the bacteria suppressing immunity, preventing entry to gut cells, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>We are also intrigued by the enhancement of infection by Ochrobactrum spp, however we chose to focus on attenuation given the availability of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> genetic mutants for study. We have added data (Line numbers 371-402, Figure 7, and Supplemental Figure 12) that inform our current hypothesis regarding Ochrobactrum mediated enhancement of Orsay virus infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was a bit concerned about the &quot;arbitrary units&quot;, which were used without any effort to normalize them. David Wang and Hongbing Jiang have developed a method based on tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) that can be used to measure infectious doses in a somewhat repeatable way. Without some type of normalization, it is hard to imagine how this study could be repeated. The 24-hour time period between exposure and glowing suggests very high doses, but it is still unclear precisely how high. Also, it is clear that multiple batches of virus were used in this study, but it is entirely unclear how variable these batches were.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that we also measured the (TC)ID50 for every batch of virus used similar to the methods suggested by the Wang laboratory (Line numbers 107-119 and 499-506). We have added a figure showing the virus batch variability for all batches used in this study (Supp. Fig. 2). We have further clarified that the arbitrary units correspond to the actual microliters of viral filtrate used during infection and provided clear methods to replicate our viral batch production to assist with issues of reproducibility (Line numbers 107-119 and 499-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors in several places discuss high variability or low variability in incidence as though it is a feature of the virus or a feature of the host. It isn't. For infection data (or any type of binomial data) results are highly variable in the middle (close to 50% infection) and lowly variable at the ends (close to 0% or 100% infection). This is a result that is derived from a binomial distribution and it should not be taken as evidence that the bacteria or the host affect randomness. If you were to conduct dose-response experiments, on any of your bacterial food source treatments, you would find that variability is lowest at the extremely high and extremely low doses and it is most variable in the middle when you are at doses where about 50% of hosts are infected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have removed all reference to this throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary and Major Findings/Strengths:</p><p>Across diverse hosts, microbiota can influence viral infection and transmission. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is naturally infected by the Orsay virus, which infects intestinal cells and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Previous work has demonstrated that host immune defense pathways, such as antiviral RNAi and the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), can influence host susceptibility to virus infection. However, little is known about how bacteria modulate viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate how diverse bacterial species influence Orsay virus transmission and host susceptibility in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. When <italic>C. elegans</italic> is grown in the presence of two Ochrobactrum species, the authors find that animals exhibit increased viral transmission, as measured by the increased proportion of newly infected worms (relative to growth on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50). The presence of the two Ochrobactrum species also resulted in increased host susceptibility to the virus, which is reflected by the increased fraction of infected animals following exposure to the exogenous Orsay virus. In contrast, the presence of Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, as well as Pseudomonas PA01 or PA14, attenuates viral transmission and host susceptibility relative to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50. For growth in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and PA14, the attenuated transmission and susceptibility are suppressed by mutations in regulators of quorum sensing and the gacA two-component system. The authors also identify six virulence genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 that modulate host susceptibility to virus and viral transmission, albeit to a lesser extent. Based on the findings in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the authors further demonstrate that deletion of the gacA ortholog in <italic>P. lurida</italic> results in loss of the attenuation of viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p><p>Taken together, these findings provide important insights into the species-specific effects that bacteria can have on viral infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors also describe a role for Pseudomonas quorum sensing and virulence genes in influencing viral transmission and host susceptibility.</p><p>Major weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript has several issues that need to be addressed, such as insufficient rigor of the experiments performed and questions about the reproducibility of the data presented in some places. In addition, confounding variables complicate the interpretations that can be made from the authors' findings and weaken some of the conclusions that are stated in the manuscript.</p><p>(1) The authors sometimes use pals-5p::GFP expression to indicate infection, however, this is not necessarily an accurate measure of the infection rate. Specifically, in Figures 4-6, the authors should include measurements of viral RNA, either by FISH staining or qRT-PCR, to support the claims related to differences in infection rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers comment we have corroborated our pals-5::GFP data using FISH staining (Line numbers 291-292 and 357-359, Figure 4D &amp; 4E, and Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In several instances, the experimental setup and presentation of data lack sufficient rigor. For example, Fig 1D and Fig 2B only display data from one experimental replicate. The authors should include information from all 3 experimental replicates for more transparency. In Fig 3B, the authors should include a control that demonstrates how RNA1 levels change in the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 for comparison with the results showing replication in the presence of PA14. In order to support the claim that &quot;<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and P. lurida MYb11 do not eliminate Orsay virus infection&quot;, the authors should also measure RNA1 fold change in the presence of PA01 and P. lurida in the context of exogenous Orsay virus. Additionally, the authors should standardize the amount of bacteria added to the plate and specify how this was done in the Methods, as differing concentrations of bacteria could be the reason for species-specific effects on infection.</p></disp-quote><p>All experimental replicates are now included within the supplementary information.</p><p>We have also measured RNA1 fold change following infection in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 and P. lurida MYb11 (Line numbers Fig 3B and 3C) and found that these bacteria also do not eliminate Orsay virus replication.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment on controlling the amount of bacteria and have clarified our methods section to more clearly explain that we seed our plates with equivalent amounts (based on volume) of overnight bacterial culture before allowing the bacteria to grow on the plates for 48 hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should be more careful about conclusions that are made from experiments involving PA14, which is a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain (isolated from humans), that can rapidly kill <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To eliminate confounding factors that are introduced by the pathogenicity of PA14, the authors should address how PA14 affects the health of the worms in their assays. For example, the authors should perform bead-feeding assays to demonstrate that feeding rates are unaffected when worms are grown in the presence of PA14. Because Orsay virus infection occurs through feeding, a decrease in <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeding rates can influence the outcome of viral infection. The authors should also address whether or not the presence of PA14 affects the stability of viral particles because that could be another trivial reason for the attenuation of viral infection that occurs in the presence of PA14.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data on feeding rates (Line numbers 141-148 and 176-182, Supplementary Figure 4).

Second, while we could normalize to a control within each experiment and expect to see similar relative differences across experiments, we believe this makes it more difficult to interpret the underlying data. For example, an increase in the infection rate of 80% compared to 10% within a population has only a single interpretation while a relative increase in the infection rate by 8x within a population could have several underlying meanings (e.g. 80% vs 10%, 64%vs 8%, 24% vs 3%).

With regards to the underlying question of mechanism we believe that the genetic mutants (e.g. rhlR/gacA) are equally informative and that further comparison of these mutants’ interaction with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host as compared to wild-type may be informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The authors should include a discussion on the relative virulence potential of PA01, PA14, and P. lurida and the relationship between bacterial virulence potential and the outcome of viral infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also added data on mortality rates (Line numbers 183-200, Supplementary Figure 6). No significant mortality was observed within the 24-hour exposure period used for our Orsay infection and transmission assays. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence is dependent upon temperature and as our assays are done at 20°C rather than 25°C this may account for reduced mortality compared to other published results. Regardless, we noted that O. vermis MYb71 killed <italic>C. elegans</italic> as quickly as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 under these conditions and these two bacteria led to the shortest lifespan compared to the other tested bacteria. Interestingly, P. lurida MYb11 was observed to be more virulent than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 under these conditions. These results suggest that there is no direct correlation between mortality and susceptibility to Orsay virus, although it does not rule out that virulence effects unique to each bacterium could contribute to alterations in host susceptibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) More information is needed on strains listed in Supplementary Table 2, particularly when there is no reference listed and the strain is &quot;Gift of XXX lab&quot;. For example, the Troemel lab previously published about an Ochrobactrum strain in Troemel et al PLOS Biology 2008 PMID: 19071962 - is this the same strain? Please ensure that there is adequate information about each strain with as many published references as possible so that the work can be more easily reproduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional information and references to the strain table in Supplementary Table 2.
