proofreading to discriminate antigens by converting small changes in antigen-binding lifetime into large differences in cell activation, but where in the signaling cascade this computation is performed is unknown. Previously, we developed a light-gated immune receptor to probe the role of ligand kinetics in T cell antigen signaling. We found significant kinetic proofreading at the level of the signaling lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) but lacked the ability to determine where the multiple signaling steps required for kinetic discrimination originate in the upstream signaling cascade (Tiseher and Weiner, 2019). Here, we uncover where kinetic proofreading is executed by adapting our optogenetic system for robust activation of early signaling events. We find the strength of kinetic proofreading progressively increases from Zap70 recruitment to LAT clustering to downstream DAG generation. Leveraging the ability of our system to rapidly disengage ligand binding, we also measure slower reset rates for downstream signaling events. These data suggest a distributed kinetic proofreading mechanism, with proofreading steps both at the receptor and at slower resetting downstream signaling complexes that could help balance antigen sensitivity and discrimination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>kinetic proofreading</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>chimeric antigen receptor</kwd><kwd>antigen discrimination</kwd><kwd>LOV2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1548297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011747</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17OC0028176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Town</surname><given-names>Jason P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008227</institution-id><institution>Achievement Rewards for College Scientists Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Britain</surname><given-names>Derek M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A light-controllable ligand is used to probe where in the signaling cascade T cells discriminate self from non-self.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper antigen discrimination is a cornerstone of the adaptive immune system.

Kinetic proofreading postulates that antigen binding initiates a series of sequential biochemical events that are substantially slower than antigen-binding lifetimes and must progress to completion before activating the T cell. Only antigen that stays bound to the TCR long enough for the completion of all events is stimulatory to the T cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). If the antigen unbinds the TCR before all events are complete, the system resets back to the ground state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The number of proofreading steps sets the strength of a proofreading system, with stronger proofreading systems requiring a higher number of proofreading steps. Ten steps of kinetic proofreading would roughly amplify a twofold difference in ligand-binding lifetime into a 1000-fold difference in output. Kinetic proofreading allows T cells to ignore numerous shorter-lived self-antigen-binding events, while activating in response to rare longer-lived foreign antigen-binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gascoigne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Germain and StefanovÃ¡, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Previously, our group developed a light-gated immune receptor that we used to probe the role of ligand kinetics in T cell antigen signal transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The strength of proofreading measured at DAG generation indicated multiple upstream proofreading events. Our optogenetic system requires a light-insensitive mode of cell adhesion to ensure reliable measurement of signaling activity readouts. However, our previous adhesion method was not compatible with robust cellular activity readouts upstream of DAG generation, preventing us from identifying where the multiple upstream proofreading events originate.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ICAM-1 adhesion improves robustness of proximal signaling live-cell biosensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) With our optogenetic system, we can control the concentration and lifetime of ligand-receptor interactions with blue light.

With integrin adhesion, we now detect kinetic proofreading in receptor activation upstream of the recruitment of Zap70. We measure stronger upstream kinetic proofreading at the clustering of the scaffold protein LAT, suggesting proofreading steps between Zap70 recruitment and LAT cluster formation. Furthermore, we measure even stronger kinetic proofreading at DAG generation, suggesting additional proofreading steps after the initial formation of LAT clusters. We also find that LAT clusters reset slower than Zap70 recruitment upon unbinding antigen. Our results suggest a kinetic proofreading system that starts at the level of receptor activation and continues across multiple spatially segregated signaling complexes, with downstream signaling complexes resetting slower than receptor-level signaling complexes. Such a system would allow high concentration of antigens with intermediate binding lifetimes to activate T cells, while still responding to rare long binding antigens and filtering out short binding antigens, which is consistent with TCR cooperativity postulated in tissue homeostasis and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goyette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korem Kohanim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pettmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expanding suite of optogenetically controlled T cell biosensors by optimizing cell adhesion system</title><p>Previously, we developed a light-gated immune receptor (zdk-CAR) to probe T cell antigen signaling output as a function of both receptor occupancy and average ligand-binding half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tischer and Weiner, 2019</xref>).

If we provide LOV2 as the only means of cell interaction with the bilayer, cells unbind from the bilayer upon exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

To account for variability in biosensor expression, we normalize each cell to its baseline biosensor intensity measured in the absence of ligand engagement. The cell-to-cell variability in zdk-CAR expression has the benefit of expanding the receptor occupancies that we sample, as cells expressing more zdk-CAR receptors bind more LOV2 under all half-life conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle). If all cells expressed identical amounts of receptor, it would be laborious to generate and analyze the large number of independent CAR expressing clones needed to sample a wide range of receptor occupancies. Importantly, the variability in receptor expression is not unique to our CAR system; native T cells also vary in TCR expression level and can respond to antigen even at very low levels of TCR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Labrecque et al., 2001</xref>). Kinetic proofreading could enable cells to tolerate variability in receptor expression level, as it results in cells that are increasingly sensitive to ligand-binding half-life instead of receptor occupancy.</p><p>We are unable to control when binding events start since our optogenetic system is inhibited by blue light, as opposed to being activated by blue light. The initiation of binding after blue-light inhibition is a function of both the stochastic relaxation of inhibited LOV2 back into the binding state and the diffusion of binding-state LOV2 from outside the previously illuminated area. Without temporal control over the start of binding, it is difficult to measure the time delay between ligand binding and a downstream signaling event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Such studies typically require careful single-molecule imaging of numerous stochastic binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To overcome this technical limitation of our system, we chose instead to measure the steady-state output of the antigen signaling cascade achieved several minutes after ligand binding. Kinetic proofreading systems behave differently than non-proofreading systems at steady state. A non-proofreading systemâs steady-state output is set by the number of ligand-bound receptors and not the binding half-lives of those ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, a kinetic proofreading system can produce different steady-state outputs in response to ligands of different binding half-lives, even when ligand densities are adjusted to achieve equivalent occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Signaling events take varying amounts of time to occur after ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). However, the temporal delays between steps are on the order of tens of seconds. By imaging the cells after minutes of constant exposure to a set ligand-binding half-life, we measure the steady-state output achieved at a signaling event in the cascade on a longer timescale than these delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tischer and Weiner, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Next, we fit our data to a simple model of the expected output from a kinetic proofreading signaling system at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the model, signaling output is a function of receptor occupancy (R) multiplied by ligand-binding half-life (Ï) raised to the number of strong proofreading steps (n). The fit number of proofreading steps indicates how much a reporterâs steady-state output depends on binding half-life compared to receptor occupancy. In a system with no proofreading steps, the output only depends on receptor occupancy, and binding half-life becomes irrelevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left). A systemâs output with a moderate number of proofreading steps (e.g. five steps) depends on both receptor occupancy and the half-life of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, middle). A large number of proofreading steps (e.g. 10 steps) results in a system whose output is dominated by ligand-binding half-life and is relatively insensitive to receptor occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right).</p><p>Our model represents the expected output of a kinetic proofreading signaling network at steady state. It assumes a network of sequential and non-reversible biochemical events where the rate of progression to the next step is much slower than the rate of reset upon ligand unbinding. We cannot determine the exact number of proofreading steps in the network, as the output of many weak proofreading steps could behave the same as the output of a few strong proofreading steps. However, if we assume equivalent strength for all proofreading steps, we can estimate a lower limit of the number of steps. Our model captures the expected output of a saturable signaling step downstream of such a proofreading system. When we apply our model to a measured signaling event in our system, we assume that event is downstream of the proofreading cascade and ask how many upstream steps of equivalent proofreading best explain its output.</p><p>With the assumptions of the model, the fit value of n is unlikely to represent the absolute number of upstream biochemical proofreading steps. However, we can compare the measured values of n between signaling events to understand how the strength of proofreading changes as we progress through the cascade. A higher measured value of n at an event suggests a stronger degree of upstream kinetic proofreading. If we subtract the fit n value of a downstream event from an upstream event, we get the measured increase in proofreading strength between the two events. For example, if we have the network C<sub>0</sub> C<sub>x</sub> and measure n=3 at C<sub>0</sub> and n=5 at C<sub>x</sub>, subtracting C<sub>0</sub> from C<sub>x</sub> results in a proofreading strength increase of 2, indicating additional kinetic proofreading between C<sub>0</sub> and C<sub>x.</sub></p><p>Comparing the measured degree of proofreading at multiple known signaling events allows us to bracket where kinetic proofreading steps exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). If all proofreading steps occurred between ligand binding and Zap70 recruitment, we would measure the same degree of upstream proofreading at Zap70 recruitment, LAT clustering, and DAG generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left), as there would be no additional increase in proofreading strength beyond Zap70. If all proofreading steps occurred after LAT clustering and before DAG generation, we would measure no degree of upstream proofreading at Zap70 recruitment or at LAT clustering, and see a large jump in the degree of upstream proofreading at DAG generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, middle). If proofreading steps were distributed from before Zap70 recruitment to after LAT clustering, we would measure a non-zero degree of upstream proofreading at Zap70 recruitment with an increasing degree of upstream proofreading as we progress down the cascade to LAT clustering and DAG generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left).

LAT clustering showed an increased dependency on binding half-life (â´=0.54) and a decreased dependence on receptor occupancy (â´=0.21) compared to Zap70 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Our proofreading model fits our LAT clustering data with a higher degree of proofreading (n=7.8 Â±1.1) compared to Zap70 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The stronger degree of kinetic proofreading at LAT clustering versus Zap70 recruitment suggests additional steps of kinetic proofreading between the recruitment of Zap70 to phosphorylated ITAMs and the formation of LAT clusters. The generation of DAG also depended heavily on ligand half-life (â´=0.52), while depending the least on occupancy (â´=0.18) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Our model fits the highest degree of kinetic proofreading at DAG generation (n=11.3 Â± 1.5), suggesting further kinetic proofreading steps beyond initial LAT clustering and upstream of DAG generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The sequential increase in the degree of kinetic proofreading progressing down the antigen signaling cascade suggests steps contributing to kinetic proofreading exist throughout the cascade, at least up to the generation of DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>To assess our model fits, we evaluated the residuals of each model subtracted from their respective dataset. For Zap70 recruitment, our model underestimates the degree of activation at moderate binding half-lives and receptor occupancies, as indicated by the positive region in the center of the heatmap. It is possible that Zap70 recruitment reaches saturation at shorter ligand-binding half-lives than our model predicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). For both LAT clustering and DAG generation, our models performed poorest in the region of lowest occupancy and shortest half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B,C</xref>). In this region of our dataset, the fluorescent signal from bound LOV2 above the background fluorescence of unbound LOV2 is smallest. To compensate for fluorescence of unbound LOV2, we subtract off the local background fluorescence of unbound LOV2 around each cell. In doing so we may be underestimating the amount of LOV2 bound to each cell, leading to an underestimation of signaling output by the models. Future studies at LOV2 densities approaching single molecule would better capture this regime of receptor occupancy, but cell-to-cell variation in activation would be too high to be compatible with our current steady-state analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To globally assess how well our fit N values captured the datasets in comparison to other possible N values, we computed the average residual for models fit over a range of constant N values for each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). The residual landscape for Zap70 shows a significant minimum around models with four or five proofreading steps, suggesting that these models perform substantially better than models with greater or fewer steps. The residual landscapes for LAT and DAG are much flatter, suggesting models with a greater or fewer numbers of upstream proofreading steps perform only marginally worse than our best fit models of N=7.8 and N=11.3 for LAT and DAG, respectively.</p><p>In light of the flat residual landscapes for LAT clustering and DAG generation, we used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine if models where LAT and DAG have the same number of upstream proofreading steps (same N value) better explained our data than our current model where Zap70, LAT, and DAG all have unique N values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang, 2019</xref>). The AIC-based selection process aims to balance model complexity with model fit in order to avoid overfitting and find the simplest model that accurately describes the data. Models with unique N values for all three signaling steps have the lowest AIC, thus best explaining our data. However, models where LAT and DAG share the same N value (and Zap70 has a unique N value) have only marginally worse AIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). This is expected if the LAT and DAG N values are indeed different, but the difference is small in magnitude. As the number of upstream proofreading steps increases, the transition of a signaling step from off to on becomes increasingly switch-like as a function of average ligand-binding half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). Confidently delineating between signaling steps in this switch-like regime will likely require finer control of binding half-lives than our current systemâs control of the average binding half-life.</p><p>In our previous work our model fit fewer (N=2.7) steps to DAG generation. We now fit a higher number of steps (N=11.3) to DAG generation. This change could be due to the incorporation of ICAM into our current study, which has been shown to potentiate ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pettmann et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, our previous antibody-based adhesion may have short-circuited some proofreading steps by irreversibly holding the cell membrane close to the supported lipid bilayer. To evaluate if our higher value fits are indeed the best fit values for our datasets, we fit our model to each dataset while holding the value of N constant in the range of 0â14 steps, and evaluated the average residual value for each model fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). For all signaling steps, the fit value of N was near the minima of average residual and had a lower average residual value than a model with three proofreading steps.</p><p>To assess the plausibility of a larger number of proofreading steps, we implemented the steady-state kinetic proofreading model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganti et al., 2020</xref>. The model estimates the minimum number of proofreading steps required to discriminate between cognate-ligands and self-ligands with different binding half-lives present at a given concentration ratios at a given Hopfield error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hopfield, 1974</xref>). First, we evaluated what combinations of ligand half-lives and concentration ratios an 11-step kinetic proofreading network could discriminate at an error rate less than 10<sup>â3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). We chose the error rate of 10<sup>â3</sup>, as it is an order of magnitude less than the theorized 10<sup>â4</sup> upper limit error rate of the native TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganti et al., 2020</xref>). At moderate half-life ratios, an 11-step network can discriminate cognate peptides present in small concentrations (e.g. 1 cognate-ligand per 1000 self-ligands at a half-life ratio of 6).</p><p>In our optogenetic system, the ratio of the average ligand-binding half-life between the longest suppressive half-life and the shortest fully activated half-life is about 2. However, an 11-step network is insufficient to discriminate between ligands with a half-life ratio of 2, even at the high ligand ratio of 1 (equal concentrations of cognate- and self-ligand). This suggests that our cells are unlikely to be detecting the average ligand-binding half-life of each blue-light condition, but are more likely detecting longer-lived binding events from the underlying distribution of half-lives. Another possibility is that our in vitro washout measurements, which measure average ligand-binding half-lives of soluble ligands diffusing in three dimensions, differ from the half-lives of ligand-receptor interactions between the cellâs plasma membrane and the supported lipid bilayer diffusing in two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To better explore the kinetic proofreading model space, we generated heatmaps reporting the required number of steps to discriminate combinations of ligand and half-life ratios at an error rate of 10<sup>â3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). To discriminate between ligands with a half-life ratio of 2, at least 14 steps are needed when the ligands are at equal concentrations, and more than 25 steps are needed if cognate-ligands are 1 per 1000 self-ligands. The required number of proofreading steps decreases rapidly as the half-life ratio increases, reaching a minimum of eight steps needed for a concentration ratio of 1 per 1000 and a half-life ratio of 10, which is more in line with physiological half-life ratios between agonist and non-agonist peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>After comparing our results with the Ganti model, this analysis suggests that our number of fit proofreading steps may be somewhat inflated as a function of our uses the average ligand-binding half-lives of three-dimensional washout experiments in place of the two-dimensional single-molecule information T cells use to make activation decisions. However, the higher fit N values are more consistent with the required number of steps to discriminate ligands under more physiological conditions than our previous measurements of approximately three steps, which would not be expected to discriminate ligands with half-life ratio of 10 even at a ligand ratio of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LAT clusters reset more slowly than Zap70 clusters upon ligand disengagement</title><p>Kinetic proofreading requires all signaling intermediates to reset upon ligand unbinding.

Amplifying small changes in binding half-life requires a chain of multiple slow (relative to binding half-life) biochemical events that separate short binding events from long binding events. Where these events exist in the antigen signaling cascade is not fully understood.</p><p>In this study, we improved our optogenetic proofreading assay with ICAM-1 adhesion and measured the dependency of Zap70 recruitment, LAT clustering, and DAG generation on antigen-binding half-life and receptor occupancy. We now find evidence for kinetic proofreading in antigen signal transduction as early as Zap70 recruitment to phosphorylated receptor ITAMs. We measured greater kinetic proofreading at the clustering of the scaffold protein LAT, and the highest degree of kinetic proofreading at the generation of the signaling lipid DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also measure the reset rate of Zap70 and LAT upon ligand unbinding. Our findings suggest that the kinetic proofreading underlying T cell antigen discrimination spans multiple membrane-associated signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>After a receptor binds an antigen, many events must occur before Zap70 is recruited to the receptorâs ITAMs. Many strong candidates exist for the mediators of this kinetic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</xref>).

Finally, Zap70 must overcome autoinhibition before binding the phosphorylated receptor with both of its tandem SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deindl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). Additional proofreading steps may also contribute that are not captured in our system such as CD4/8 coreceptor scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepanek et al., 2014</xref>) and CD3Îµ ITAM allostery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borroto et al., 2014</xref>).

This result implies that additional kinetic proofreading steps exist separate from the receptor. The additional proofreading steps measured at LAT clustering could include the full activation of Zap70 through phosphorylation and the many phosphorylation and binding events on LAT required to initiate clustering. Hyperactive Zap70 mutants biased toward the active conformation increase T cell response to normally weak agonists, suggesting that pre-activation of Zap70 short-circuits one or more proofreading steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While our models are less confident about additional kinetic proofreading in DAG generation, many potential kinetic proofreading steps exist beyond the initial clustering of LAT. LAT does not require the phosphorylation of all its tyrosine residues, or binding of all known associated proteins, to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Further phosphorylation and protein recruitment events may be required for an existing LAT cluster to mature into a fully signaling-competent complex. A strong candidate for an additional proofreading step is phosphorylation of LAT Y132. Y132 is an evolutionarily conserved poor substrate for its kinase Zap70, and this phosphorylation site is required for PLCÎ³ recruitment, DAG generation, and Ca<sup>++</sup> mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreotti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>). Mutation of the residues around Y132 to a better Zap70 substrate that is more rapidly phosphorylated resulted in decreased T cell antigen discrimination (i.e. strong activation to weak agonists; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherman et al., 2011</xref> found that PLCÎ³ is recruited to only a subset of LAT clusters, suggesting that only a subset of LAT clusters reach a fully signaling-competent state.</p><p>The kinetic proofreading model requires all intermediate steps to reset upon unbinding of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This means that information about the receptorâs binding state must be communicated to all proofreading steps. If kinetic proofreading steps exist beyond the T cell receptor, how is unbinding information conveyed to these effectors? Importantly, there is evidence of physical proximity of LAT with the receptor. While TCR/Zap70 and LAT/PLCÎ³ microclusters form spatially segregated domains, these domains remain adjacent to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lo et al., 2018</xref>, demonstrated that the protein Lck binds Zap70 with its SH2 domain and LAT with its SH3 domain, potentially bridging the two signaling domains together and propagating binding information.</p><p>An attractive reset mechanism is the segregation of CD45 away from bound receptors, creating spatial regions in which TCR- and LAT-associated activating events can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Razvag et al., 2018</xref> measured TCR/CD45 segregated regions within seconds of antigen contact at the tips of T cell microvilli. Upon unbinding, these regions of phosphatase exclusion collapse, allowing CD45 to dephosphorylate receptor ITAMs and LAT clusters. However, the rate of dephosphorylation for LAT and receptor ITAMs could differ. LAT clusters exclude CD45 in reconstituted bilayer systems, potentially limiting the dephosphorylation to LAT molecules at the edges of the cluster thus slowing reset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su et al., 2016</xref>). The kinetics of multivalent protein-protein interactions within TCR and LAT clusters can also influence dephosphorylation and dissociation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goyette et al., 2022</xref>). A CD45-based mechanism could also reset other proofreading signaling pathways occurring in the phosphatase excluded zone, such as the activation of SOS which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2019</xref>, recently showed exhibits kinetic proofreading behavior.</p><p>What are the advantages of distributing kinetic proofreading beyond the receptor? Having subsequent proofreading steps separate from the receptor potentially allows cooperativity between multiple receptors in activating downstream signaling steps (e.g. multiple activated receptors contributing to the creation and maturation of a single LAT cluster). Consistent with this idea, larger TCR cluster size increases the probability of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manz et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2019</xref>, also observed cooperativity between single TCR/pMHC-binding events, where shorter binding events that overlapped in space and time activated NFAT translocation similar to long-lived single binding events in primary murine T cells.</p><p>Work on kinetic proofreading often assumes that the reset rate after ligand binding is uniform across all signaling intermediates (k<sub>off</sub><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in his seminal work applying the mathematical framework of kinetic proofreading to TCR activation, Timothy McKeithan postulated that a kinetic proofreading system with slower reset rates for downstream events compared to upstream signaling events would respond to true cognate-antigen-binding events a higher percentage of the time while still ignoring weak self-antigen-binding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKeithan, 1995</xref>). Recently, Pettman et al. modeled how slower resetting of terminal signaling complexes could account for fractional steps in their measurements of the number of proofreading steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pettmann et al., 2021</xref>). We measured slower dissociation of downstream LAT clusters through a slow multistep process compared to the upstream events of ligand binding and Zap70 recruitment which followed a more rapid single-step reset process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Our data opens the possibility that LAT clusters could survive transient unbinding events that deactivate an active receptor by being rescued by other transiently active receptors, resulting in a fully mature signaling complex created by the integration of multiple shorter binding events and potentially improving ligand discrimination as McKeithan proposed. It remains to be seen if individual LAT clusters can be rescued after ligand unbinding, or if a LAT cluster is destined to be fully reset once the binding event that led to its creation ends.</p><p>Recently, Harris et al. quantified the reset rate of the downstream signaling events Ca<sup>++</sup> release and ERK phosphorylation upon signal inhibition to be 29 s and 3 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2021</xref>). They showed both Ca<sup>++</sup> and ERK levels can persist across short inhibitions of signaling. What makes LAT clusters different than these persistent downstream events? The dissolution of LAT clusters is directly triggered by the unbinding of ligand from the TCR, and both the TCR and LAT are de-phosphorylated by CD45. To our knowledge, the rate of ERK dephosphorylation or cytosolic Ca<sup>++</sup> depletion is not accelerated by TCR unbinding, and is turned over through constant rather than agonist-gated degradation. A useful future line of inquiry would be to quantify the reset rate for signaling steps throughout the cascade upon ligand unbinding versus orthogonal signal inhibition (e.g. kinase inhibition).</p><p>Cooperativity between active receptors to complete downstream proofreading steps could explain observations of T cell activation in response to intermediate affinity self- and tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). Intermediate lifetime-binding events could last long enough to complete all necessary steps for receptor activation but not long enough to finish proofreading steps downstream of the receptor. If enough intermediate binding events overlapped in space and time, they could cooperate in accomplishing downstream proofreading events, either through the acceleration of signal propagation through the cascade or through mutual prevention of system reset upon unbinding of a subset of ligands. Such a cooperativity mechanism has been implicated in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korem Kohanim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and immunotherapy off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Methods were adapted from our labâs previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tischer and Weiner, 2019</xref>) with modified sections highlighted below.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>We used standard molecular biology protocols for all cloning.

Blue light for optogenetic stimulation was from a 470 nm LED (Lightspeed Technologies Inc, #HPLS-36), controlled with custom micromanager scripts. For most timepoints, only RICM and TIRF561 images were collected. During and in-between these timepoints, a TIRF488 long-pass dichroic mirror remained permanently in the top dichroic turret, ensuring the blue-light illumination of the cells was never interrupted. The top TIRF488 dichroic passed the longer wavelengths used for RICM and TIRF561. Only when LOV2 localization was imaged with TIRF488 at the end of a 3 min stimulation was the top dichroic removed to allow the shorter fluorescence excitation light to pass.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image processing</title><p>After each day of imaging, we captured TIRF488, TIRF561, and RICM images of slides with concentrated solutions of fluorescein, Rose Bengal, or dPBS, respectively. To flat field correct, we subtracted the camera offset from both the experimental and dye images. By dividing the experimental image by the median dye slide image, we acquired the final flat field corrected image used in analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Model, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Time course overview</title><p>We exposed cells to 5 min blocks of constant blue-light stimulation. Each block consisted of an initial 2 min hold in strong blue light followed by a 3 min stimulation at a fixed intensity of intermediate blue light. To measure the reporter output, we averaged the final four timeframes of each condition. We measured CAR occupancy from a long exposure TIRF488 image taken at the end of the 3 min stimulation, after the last biosensor output measurement made in TIRF561. As fluorescence excitation light from TIRF488 potently stimulates LOV2, the TIRF488 channel could only be imaged once at the very end of a 3 min stimulation. We repeated 5 min blocks over the course of an hour experiment with a variety of blue-light intensities to sample different ligand-binding half-lives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>LOV2-binding half-life measurements</title><p>We calculated the average Zdk-binding half-life for each blue-light condition as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tischer and Weiner, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>CAR occupancy measurements</title><p>We background subtracted and thresholded RICM images at each timeframe to create a mask of cell footprints. The thresholded image was labeled using Python skimage watershed algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). A second local background mask was made by labeling pixels surrounding an expanded perimeter of each labeled cell in the cell mask. At steady state, free LOV2 should be homogeneously distributed on the SLB. The mean TIRF488 pixel intensity of a cell footprint is the sum of free LOV2 and LOV2 bound to the CAR. The mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the background mask reflects free LOV2. Therefore, we calculated CAR occupancy as the mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the cell mask minus the mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the background mask.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Biosensor measurements</title><p>To calculate biosensor output levels at steady state, we averaged the TIRF561 pixel intensity within each labeled cell mask over the last four timeframes (equivalent to the last 40 s) of a 3 min hold in blue light. To account for differences in biosensor expression level, we normalized cells to their average biosensor intensity in the absence of signaling (taken as the average of the last two TIRF561 images of each 2 min reset pulse of intense blue light). We sometimes observed drift in a cellâs basal activity over time. To correct for this drift, we subtracted the mean TIRF561 pixel intensity of each preceding 2 min reset pulse of intense blue light from the mean value of the proceeding 3 min stimulation of blue light. Thus, the reported biosensor output value is the fold-change from the cellâs average basal activity minus the fold-change from resent basal activity.</p><p>Prior to model fitting, the biosensor output values of a biological replicate dataset (consisting of multiple wells acquired on the same day) were normalized by the 90th percentile output value in the dataset to properly normalize the data to the model, and to allow comparison between biosensors of variable dynamic ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Kinetic proofreading model fitting</title><p>We fit each biological replicate dataset to the simple model of kinetic proofreading described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tischer and Weiner, 2019</xref>). Each datapoint consists of an average ligand-binding half-life, a CAR occupancy measurement, and a biosensor output measurement (see above). With those three measured values, we fit the remaining three parameters of our model n, K, and Î² (number of proofreading steps, input for half-max biosensor output, and basal signaling output, respectively) using the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares algorithm as implemented by the curve_fit function from the Python SciPy library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Akaike information criterion</title><p>Assuming errors are identically and normally distributed, AIC was calculated as 2K+n*ln(RSS/n) for several nested models where various conditions of equality were set on the N parameters in the equilibrium model across the data. K is the total number of parameters used to describe the outcomes, n is the total number of measurements across the system, and RSS is the sum of squared residual from the fit. The model with the lowest AIC score (three unique values for N) was chosen as the best model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Criteria for including or excluding cells in analysis</title><p>We restricted our analysis to cells that were present for the full-time course. Cells that detached partway through the time course or arrived after the experiment began were excluded. Each replicate began with a no-light (maximal half-life) condition to identify non-responding cells. Cells that did not exhibit at least a 10% increase in reporter output above their basal output were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Biological and technical replicates</title><p>Kinetic proofreading datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) â A biological replicate consisted of two time courses of stimulating cells with blue light on SLBs with different concentrations of LOV2, all on the same day (to ensure the light path did not change). We conducted each biological replicate on different days, with new preparations of cells, SLBs, and LOV2. Each time course within a biological replicate contained approximately 30 cells, whose biosensor output levels and receptor occupancy were measured in all half-life conditions. As the microscopy experiments could not be done in parallel and each biological replicate took an entire day, we could not conduct technical replicates. Data underlying each replicate included in the supplement.</p><p>Signaling reset datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) â A biological replicate consisted of four cycles of acutely terminating signaling and measuring the respective reporter lifetimes for approximately 30 cells.

At T=0, we illuminated the cell with intense blue light to unbind receptor-bound LOV2 ligands while imaging LOV2 and either Zap70 or LAT biosensors every 3 s. We manually segmented cells in ImageJ before tracking clusters of LOV2 and Zap70/LAT biosensors using the TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). We selected all tracks that persisted for at least two frames prior to blue-light illumination and plotted the lifetime distribution of the resulting tracks.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There is a consensus that your work is an advance on your prior study looking at ontogenetic control of T cell activation. The addition of the adhesion system enables a better analysis of how the kinetics of the light driven receptor-ligand interactions impact receptor proximal and distal signals. The work reinforces that early events fit within a framework of a kinetic proofreading (KP) model. Reviewers are concerned that later events are too slow in relation to receptor-ligand binding to support a kinetic KP process, unless the proofreading process incorporated down stream transcriptional and epigenetic steps in the model where early signals influenced by the receptor-ligand binding kinetic through KP controlled slower immune synapse levels on and off rates that then feed forward on the slower downstream events. This might be an interesting thing to discuss, but seems beyond the scope of the current modelling related to receptor-ligand binding processes and KP. The most obvious revision path would be to moderate claims as suggested by reviewers or to propose a set of plausible alternative models to KP as to how the later steps relate to the receptor-ligand binding kinetics and determine if KP is really the best model or if other models fit equally well or better at later stages.</p><p>1) An estimate of the goodness-of-fit is important to provide some confidence that the model used to fit the experimental data is sound. Alternative models might be fit just as well and might provide very different conclusions otherwise; the data fits to KP 'by default'. It would also be helpful to be more explicit in the methods about how this fitting was done. Could the authors model the data assuming a series of reversible reactions (ie not KP), with the rate constant for each being sufficiently low to still fit the delay observed between receptor engagement and downstream output. How would this compare to the KP model?</p><p>2) In the paragraph beginning with line 144: It should be noted that the kinetic proofreading model that the authors use is very simplified. The scaling with the power of steps, n, is only correct under certain approximations (see Hopfield's original PNAS paper). While the authors' note one of these approximations later (line 155), this is not the only one, and so mentioning the approximate nature of the analyses earlier on would be good.</p><p>3) As Figure 3 shows, there is quite a bit of cell-to-cell variability.

We have incorporated the following paragraph on page 10 line 206 to better communicate the features of our simple kinetic proofreading model:</p><p>âOur model represents the expected output of a kinetic proofreading signaling network at steady-state. It assumes a network of sequential and non-reversible biochemical events where the rate of progression to the next step is much slower than the rate of reset upon ligand unbinding. We cannot determine the exact number of proofreading steps in the network, as the output of many weak proofreading steps could behave the same as the output of a few strong proofreading steps. However, if we assume equivalent strength for all proofreading steps, we can estimate a lower limit of the number of steps. Our model captures the expected output of a saturable signaling step downstream of such a proofreading system. When we apply our model to a measured signaling event in our system, we assume that event is downstream of the proofreading cascade and ask how many upstream steps of equivalent proofreading best explain its output.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As Figure 3 shows, there is quite a bit of cell-to-cell variability. Can this variability data be quantified to provide insights into this &quot;noise&quot;, which is important in determining the response of the population of cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this feature of our dataset. We have included the following paragraph on page 7 line 153 discussing the sources of the cell-to-cell variability and how we leverage it to better explore the occupancy axis of our model.</p><p>âThe lentiviral vectors we used to express our zdk-CAR and live-cell biosensors result in cell-to-cell variability in the expression level of each construct, even after sorting for cells with CAR expression levels similar to native TCR expression in T cells (Tischer and Weiner, 2019). To account for variability in biosensor expression, we normalize each cell to its baseline biosensor intensity measured in the absence of ligand engagement. The cell-to-cell variability in zdk-CAR expression has the benefit of expanding the receptor occupancies that we sample, as cells expressing more zdk-CAR receptors bind more LOV2 under all half-life conditions (Figure 3A, middle). If all cells expressed identical amounts of receptor, it would be laborious to generate and analyze the large number of independent CAR expressing clones needed to sample a wide range of receptor occupancies. Importantly, the variability in receptor expression is not unique to our CAR system; native T cells also vary in TCR expression level and can respond to antigen even at very low levels of TCR expression (Labrecque et al., 2001). Kinetic proofreading could enable cells to tolerate variability in receptor expression level, as it results in cells that are increasingly sensitive to ligand binding half-life instead of receptor occupancy.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors may be interested in a paper by R. Ganti et al., (PNAS, 2020), which studies related issues using computational modeling, information theory, and experiments. In that paper, the consequences of &quot;distributed&quot; kinetic proofreading, a model for the reset steps along the pathway, and experiments considering some spatial aspects of kinetic proofreading are considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for calling this paper to our attention. In light of this suggestion, we have implemented the steady-state model from Ganti et al., to explore the plausibility of the number of proofreading steps our model fits to our datasets. From this work we have uploaded a new supplementary figure (Figure 4, figure supplement 4) with the figure caption on page 52. We discuss our exploration the model from Ganti beginning on page 14 line 314.</p><p>âTo assess the plausibility of a larger number of proofreading steps, we implemented the steady state kinetic proofreading model from Ganti et al., (Ganti et al., 2020). The model estimates the minimum number of proofreading steps required to discriminate between cognate-ligands and self-ligands with different binding half-lives present at a given concentration ratios at a given Hopfield error-rate (Hopfield, 1974). First, we evaluated what combinations of ligand half-lives and concentration ratios an 11-step kinetic proofreading network could discriminate at an error rate less than 10<sup>-3</sup> (Figure 4, figure supplement 4A). We chose the error rate of 10<sup>-3</sup>, as it is an order of magnitude less than the theorized 10<sup>-4</sup> upper limit error rate of the native TCR (Ganti et al., 2020). At moderate half-life ratios, an 11-step network can discriminate cognate peptides present in small concentrations (e.g. 1 cognate-ligand per 1000 self-ligands at a half-life ratio of 6).</p><p>In our optogenetic system, the ratio of the average ligand binding half-life between the longest suppressive half-life and the shortest fully activated half-life is about 2. However, an 11-step network is insufficient to discriminate between ligands with a half-life ratio of 2, even at the high ligand ratio of 1 (equal concentrations of cognate- and self-ligand). This suggests our cells are unlikely to be detecting the average ligand binding half-life of each blue-light condition, but are more likely detecting longer-lived binding events from the underlying distribution of half-lives. Another possibility is that our in vitro washout measurements, which measure average ligand binding half-lives of soluble ligands diffusing in three dimensions, differ from the half-lives of ligand-receptor interactions between the cellâs plasma membrane and the supported lipid bilayer diffusing in two dimensions (J. Huang et al., 2010).</p><p>To better explore the kinetic proofreading model space, we generated heatmaps reporting the required number of steps to discriminate combinations of ligand and half-life ratios at an error rate of 10<sup>-3</sup> (Figure 4, figure supplement 4B). To discriminate between ligands with a half-life ratio of two, at least 14 steps are needed when the ligands are at equal concentrations, and more than 25 steps are needed if cognate-ligands are 1 per 1000 self-ligands. The required number of proofreading steps decreases rapidly as the half-life ratio increases, reaching a minimum of 8-steps needed for a concentration ratio of 1/1000 and a half-life ratio of 10, which is more in line with physiological half-life ratios between agonist and non-agonist peptides (M. M. Davis et al., 1998).</p><p>After comparing our results with the Ganti model, this analysis suggest that our number of fit proofreading steps may be somewhat inflated as a function of our use the average ligand binding half-lives of three dimensional washout experiments in place of the two dimensional single molecule information T cells use to make activation decisions. However, the higher fit N values are more consistent with the required number of steps to discriminate ligands under more physiological conditions than our previous measurements of ~3 steps, which would not be expected to discriminate ligands with half-life ratio of 10 even at a ligand ratio of 1 (Figure 4, figure supplement 4B, right).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think it would be appropriate to cite the original kinetic proofreading papers by Hopfield and Ninio.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting these key works.

We also moved this section to succeed relevant sections describing the data acquisition and processing methods for our occupancy and biosensor output measurements used before fitting the data.</p><p>âWe fit each biological replicate dataset to the simple model of kinetic proofreading described previously (Figure 3D) (Tischer and Weiner, 2019). Each datapoint consists of an average ligand-binding half-life, a CAR occupancy measurement, and a biosensor output measurement (see above). With those three measured values, we fit the remaining three parameters of our model n, K, and Î² (number of proofreading steps, input for half-max biosensor output, and basal signaling output respectively) using the LevenbergâMarquardt least-squares algorithm as implemented by the curve_fit function from the python SciPy library (Virtanen et al., 2020).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors model the data assuming a series of reversible reactions (ie not KP), with the rate constant for each being sufficiently low to still fit the delay observed between receptor engagement and downstream output. How would this compare to the KP model?</p></disp-quote><p>Importantly, our analysis is for the effects of different half-lives for signal outputs at stead-state and does not rely on the analysis of delays between steps. A series of reversible reactions would not be able to capture the dependance of signaling output we measured on ligand-binding half-life at steady state. Such a systemâs output at steady state would depend on the steady-state receptor occupancy, with the reaction rate constants influencing how long it took the system to reach steady state, regardless of the number of reversible steps. We apologize for not emphasizing that our measurements are at steady state as opposed being based on temporal delays between steps following ligand binding. We thank the reviewers for suggesting that we compare with other models, as discussing the differences between kinetic proofreading systems and linear systems of reversible reactions has made our manuscript stronger. This discussion has been included on page 8 line 179, and reproduced below.</p><p>âTo overcome this technical limitation of our system, we chose instead to measure the steady-state output of the antigen signaling cascade achieved several minutes after ligand binding. Kinetic proofreading systems behave differently than non-proofreading systems at steady-state. A non-proofreading systemâs steady-state output is set by the number of ligand-bound receptors and not the binding half-lives of those ligands (Figure 3D, left). In contrast, a kinetic proofreading system can produce different steady-state outputs in response to ligands of different binding half-lives, even when ligand densities are adjusted to achieve equivalent occupancy (Daniels et al., 2006) (Figure 3D, right). Signaling events take varying amounts of time to occur after ligand binding (Lin et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2019). However, the temporal delays between steps are on the order of tens of seconds. By imaging the cells after minutes of constant exposure to a set ligand binding half-life, we measure the steady state output achieved at a signaling event in the cascade on a longer timescale than these delays (Tischer and Weiner, 2019).</p></body></sub-article></article>
