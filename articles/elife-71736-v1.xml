Here, we investigate how the brain makes a fundamental prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgments of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in frontoparietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intuitive physics</kwd><kwd>physical stability</kwd><kwd>deep convolutional neural networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1HD091947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanwisher</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MURI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tenenbaum</surname><given-names>Joshua B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanwisher</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF-1231216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tenenbaum</surname><given-names>Joshua B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanwisher</surname><given-names>Nancy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Scenario-invariant representation of physical stability is found in the frontoparietal regions but not the ventral visual pathway (and ImageNet-trained convolutional neural networks), consistent with the hypothesis that computations underlying physical stability may entail forward simulations of what will happen next.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual percepts are imbued with possibility. We see not just a dog pointing motionless at a rabbit, but a dog about to give chase; not just a wineglass near the edge of a table but a wineglass about to smash on the floor; not just a cup filled to the brim with coffee, but a cup at risk of staining the white tablecloth beneath. This ability to see not only the current situation in front of us, but what might happen next, is essential for planning any action. Although some of our predictions concern other people and what they will think and do, many of our predictions concern the physical world around us. A fundamental prediction we make about the physical world is whether it is stable, and hence unlikely to change in the near future, or unstable, and likely to change. Here, we ask whether the brain computes physical stability via simple pattern classification, such as that thought to be conducted in the ventral visual pathway, or whether instead we determine stability by running a kind of simulation in our head to determine what, if anything, will happen next.</p><p>What kind of representations might be required for determining the physical stability of a scene? Computational work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet learn powerful representations that support not only object recognition, but multiple other tasks like object detection, segmentation, and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golub et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Razavian et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, several studies have claimed that these networks can accurately predict scene stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>). But CNNs have so far been tested only within very narrow domains (e.g., block towers with several cubes of different colors, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left column) and it is not clear they would successfully predict future states of complex natural images (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle two columns). A <italic>general</italic> ability to predict what will happen next in physical scenarios may instead require a richer representational of the physical properties of the scene that support forward simulations like those in the physics engines of video games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>). Behavioral evidence from humans is conflicting here. On the one hand, human observers can perceive the stability extremely rapidly and preattentively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firestone and Scholl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang and Wolfe, 2020</xref>), and these findings have been taken to argue for a simple feedforward rather than a simulation process. On the other hand, human judgments of the stability of a tower of blocks are well modeled by approximate probabilistic simulation in game-style physics engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstenberg et al., 2017</xref>), which better fit the human pattern of errors than CNNs do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, humans can easily judge the physical stability of a wide variety of novel real-world images, which is likely to require a more abstract and generalizable representation of physical properties of the scene. Here, we test whether representations that support fast feedforward visual object and scene recognition in machines (i.e., CNNs trained on ImageNet) and brains (i.e., the ventral visual pathway) can support discrimination of the physical stability of complex natural scenes, or whether different kinds of computations â in particular, those that explicitly model dynamic physical properties of the scene, perhaps through a kind of simulation mechanism â may be required to determine physical stability in both machines and brains.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of studies conducted on machines and brains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image sets depicting (1) unstable versus stable block towers (<italic>left</italic>), (2) objects in unstable versus stable configurations (<italic>middle left</italic>, <italic>the Physical-Objects set</italic>), (3) people in physically unstable versus stable situations (<italic>middle right</italic>, <italic>the Physical-People set</italic>), and (4) people in perilous (âunstableâ) versus relatively safe (âstableâ) situations with respect to animals (<italic>right</italic>, the <italic>Animals-People</italic> set). Note that by âphysically unstableâ we refer to situations that are currently unchanging, but that would likely change dramatically after a small perturbation like a nudge or a puff of wind. The former three scenarios were used to study the generalizability of feature representations in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the latter three scenarios were used in the human fMRI experiment. (<bold>B</bold>) Accuracy of a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained to distinguish between CNN feature patterns for unstable versus stable conditions, as a function of Test Set. Accuracy within a scenario (i.e., train and test on the same scenario) was computed using a fourfold cross-validation procedure. (<bold>C</bold>) A functional localizer task contrasted physical versus nonphysical judgments on visually identical movie stimuli (adapted from Figure 2A from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). During the localizer task, subjects viewed movies of block towers from a camera viewpoint that panned 360Â° around the tower, and either answered âwhere will it fall?â (physical) or âdoes the tower have more blue or yellow blocks?â (nonphysical).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71736-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To investigate this question, we first curated a set of natural images depicting real-world scenarios of objects in physically stable versus unstable configurations (the âPhysical-Objectsâ set, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as well as a generalization set of images of people in physically stable versus unstable situations (the âPhysical-Peopleâ set, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then presented these stimuli to CNNs pretrained on ImageNet classification and asked if the resulting representations are sufficient to discriminate the physical stability of the scene in a fashion that generalizes across image sets. Next, we presented the same to human participants being scanned with fMRI and asked the same question of the resulting neural responses in two key brain regions. One such region is the ventral visual pathway, which is widely thought to conduct the core computations underlying visual object recognition, and which is well modeled by CNNs trained on ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte, 2014</xref>). Thus, if representations optimized for object recognition suffice for determining the physical stability of novel scenes, we would expect to find this ability in the ventral visual pathway. However, an alternative hypothesis is that this information will be found instead in a set of parietal and frontal regions that have been shown to be engaged when people predict what will happen next in physical (more than social) scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), and hold information about physical variables such as mass, invariant to the scenario that revealed that mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>). We have hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>) that these regions (referred to here as the âPhysics Networkâ) may contain a generative model of dynamic physical scenes capable of forward simulation, which can be used for prediction, planning, and many other tasks. Thus, if determining the stability of a scene requires an abstract representation of the physical properties of the scene and the ability run forward simulations on those representations, then the Physics Network would be a more likely locus of these representations than the ventral visual pathway.</p><p>Finally, we further conjectured that if perception of physical stability is determined by the operation of a forward simulation mechanism akin to a generative physics engine, then we might find higher neural activity in the Physics Network for physically unstable than stable situations because there is more to simulate in an unstable situation. That is, simulations of unstable scenes where objects are expected to move require the construction and updating of dynamic representations that unfold over time, whereas simulations of stable scenes, where objects are expected to remain stationary, do not require such dynamically updated representations. Thus, a higher univariate response to unstable than stable scenes would provide preliminary (albeit not definitive) evidence for forward simulation. Importantly, participants were never asked to judge or think about the physical stability of the scenario they were viewing, which enabled us to ask whether this information is extracted even when not required by the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestone and Scholl, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Feedforward CNNs trained on ImageNet do not have a generalizable representation of physical stability</title><p>Previous studies have shown that visual features extracted by feedforward deep CNNs (like AlexNet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrari et al., 2018</xref>; VGG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>; and ResNet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>) can distinguish between stable and unstable towers. Although these features produced above chance classification performance within a scenario (i.e., train on towers with two blocks and test on towers with four blocks), they have not been tested on very different scenarios and hence their ability to represent an abstract and generalizable notion of physical stability remains unknown. Significant generalizability of these features to novel image sets would provide some evidence that physical stability can be inferred from a simpler mechanism of visual feature extraction in pattern classification systems rather than running forward simulations of the kind used in game physics engines.</p><p>To test this question, we extracted features for our stable and unstable images from the final fully connected layer (<italic>fc1000</italic>, the layer immediately preceding the SoftMax probability layer) of ResNet-50 â a feedforward deep CNN trained on ImageNet dataset for object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2016</xref>). A shallower variant of this network has been previously used for stability classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the complex real-world scenarios (âPhysical-Objectsâ and âPhysical-Peopleâ), we also chose Block Towers to replicate previous findings. Within each scenario (Block Towers, Physical-Objects, and Physical-People, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between feature patterns for stable and unstable images and tested it on held-out images using fourfold cross-validation. These analyses replicated previous results by showing above chance classification accuracy within the Block Towers scenario and further found higher classification performance within our two new natural image sets (60.1%, 75%, and 71.4% for Block Towers, Physical-Objects, and Physical-People scenarios, respectively; diagonal cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p &lt; 0.05 for a bootstrap test with <italic>n</italic> = 10,000). However, this performance did not generalize across scenarios: accuracy was near chance for all cross-validation tests in which the SVM classifier was trained on one scenario and tested on a different scenario (i.e., off-diagonal cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p &gt; 0.15 for a bootstrap test with <italic>n</italic> = 10,000). Thus, visual features from this feedforward deep CNN do not carry abstract and generalizable information about physical stability. We also found similar results with a VGG-16 network trained on ImageNet. The fact that these CNN features can distinguish stability within a scenario but not across scenarios suggests that the discriminative features underlying this discrimination might be related to incidental properties that are indicative of stability only within a particular scenario (e.g., the displacement of each block from the centroid of the block below).</p><p>These results indicate that the ImageNet-trained CNNs previously claimed to support judgments of stability cannot do so in a fashion that generalizes to novel image sets. This result further suggests that brain regions thought to be optimized (through development and/or evolution) for similar tasks (ventral temporal cortex) might similarly fail to contain scenario-invariant information about physical stability, and that the human ability to perform this task may result from different kinds of representations elsewhere in the brain, such as the frontoparietal cortical regions previously implicated in physical inference. We test these hypotheses next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A generalizable representation of physical stability in cortical regions previously implicated in intuitive physical inference, but not in the ventral temporal cortex</title><p>We first identified functional regions of interest (fROI) in each participant individually, including ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and the candidate Physics Network in the frontal and parietal lobes, by intersecting anatomical constraint parcels for these regions with the relevant functional activations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and Methods). All participants had significant voxels within both VTC and physics parcels (number of voxels per participant, mean Â± standard error of the mean [SEM] =350.5 Â± 68.7 for VTC ROIs and mean Â± SEM =311.3 Â± 69.8 for physics ROIs). We further collected fMRI responses in these regions to stable and unstable photos of real-world scenarios (Physical-Objects and Physical-People) as well as an additional scenario type, âAnimals-Peopleâ, depicting people in either perilous (âunstableâ) or nonperilous (âstableâ) conditions due to an animal rather than a physical object. We used the Animals-People scenarios as a control for potential confounds of peril, arousal or attention.

However, we found no significant interaction of stability with scenario type for any of the eye movement quantities using separate ANOVAs (p &gt; 0.1).

Second, analysis of subjective ratings by a separate set of subjects (see Methods) of â<italic>interestingness</italic>â of our stimuli (which we used as a proxy for how attention-grabbing the stimuli were) revealed significantly higher ratings for unstable over stable conditions in all three scenarios (p &lt; 0.001 for a paired <italic>t</italic>-test on average ratings across subjects; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, last column).

In both regions, we found significant decoding of stability only in Physical-Objects scenario but no cross-decoding of stability across physical scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the interaction of this cross-decoding effect with fROI was significant in separate ANOVAs contrasting the Physics Network with V1 (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> = 6.31, p = 0.027) and LOC (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,12</sub> = 5.63, p = 0.035).

Do the candidate physics regions in our brain perform this forward simulation of what will happen next? Some evidence for this idea comes from the higher response of these regions during physical prediction than color-judgment tasks used in our localizer and in the original fMRI study that used this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). However, neural activity in that contrast could simply reflect the process of building a mental model of the physical scene (including object properties and relationships), not predicting or simulating what would happen next. Here, we reasoned that if the candidate physics regions are engaged automatically in simulating what will happen next, they should show a higher mean response when viewing physically unstable scenes (because there is more to simulate) than stable scenes (where nothing is predicted to happen).</p><p>We tested this prediction by comparing the average fMRI response for unstable and stable conditions in each of the three scenario types, in the Physics Network (defined in the same way as in the previous analysis).

Indeed, that is exactly what we saw. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> (last column), we found significantly higher responses in MT for unstable/perilous than stable/safe scenes for all three types of scenarios without any significant stability information in the pattern activations. This increased response to conditions with predicted motion is reminiscent of previous reports showing greater response in MT for static images with implied motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2000</xref>). The critical difference, however, is that whereas the earlier study reported higher responses in MT for static images depicting motion events happening at the moment the photograph was taken (implied motion) the current study shows activation of MT for motion that is only <italic>predicted</italic> (in the Physical-Objects and Physical-People scenarios). Most importantly, the lack of this univariate difference for the Animals-People scenario in the Physics ROI suggests that the Physics Network is not merely responding to general âlikeliness to changeâ or predicted motion.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report that frontoparietal cortical regions previously implicated in intuitive physical inference contain abstract information about physical stability, but representations in the ventral visual object recognition pathway, and those in feedforward CNNs trained on object recognition, do not. Our results indicate that representations in systems that are highly effective at invariant object recognition do not automatically support the general ability to distinguish physically stable from unstable scenes. Instead, this ability in humans is supported by a different system in the dorsal visual pathway that has been previously implicated in intuitive physical inference. This Physics Network (but not the ventral pathway) further shows a higher univariate response to unstable than stable scenes, as predicted if it performs forward simulations of what will happen next. Control analyses confirmed that neither pattern nor univariate information about physical stability in the Physics Network can be straightforwardly accounted for by low-level visual features, differential eye movements or attention. Taken together, these results suggest that the human brain represents the physical world not via simple pattern classification but instead by building a model of the physical world that supports prediction via forward simulation.</p><p>Our study builds upon earlier work that has implicated regions in the parietal and frontal lobes in intuitive physical inference. Across multiple studies, similar frontoparietal regions have been shown to (1) respond more during physics-based tasks compared to color-based or social prediction tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), (2) represent physical concepts in verbal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mason and Just, 2016</xref>), and (3) contain scenario-invariant representations of object mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, the regions activated during physical inference overlap with regions shown previously to be engaged during visually guided action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodale and Westwood, 2004</xref>) and tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valyear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mruczek et al., 2013</xref>), perhaps because these tasks also require a representation of the physical world. Indeed physical simulation has been proposed as a crucial component in models for human-like robotic action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Toussaint et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toussaint et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mordatch et al., 2012</xref>) and flexible tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osiurak and Badets, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osiurak et al., 2020</xref>); plausibly the same brain mechanisms could have arisen or adapted to support all of these computations. Note however that these same regions also overlap with the âmultiple demandâ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), and are unlikely to be selectively engaged in <italic>only</italic> physical inference. In the present study, we strengthen evidence that these regions are engaged in intuitive physical inference by showing that they carry a new kind of physical information: the dynamic physical stability of objects and people in a scene. Interestingly, this information is present when participants simply view images of physical scenes, even though they are not asked to judge stability.</p><p>More importantly, our work speaks not only to which brain regions are implicated in intuitive physical inference, but what kinds of computations these inferences entail in both minds and machines. In particular, it is a matter of active current debate in AI whether features extracted by feedforward computations in networks trained on visual object classification will suffice for physical inference, or whether richer internal models that support forward simulation are required. Some work has shown that CNNs can learn from extensive labeled datasets to infer the stability of block towers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>) and predict future outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2016</xref>). But these CNNs have so far been tested only on specific tasks and stimuli, and we show here that they do not generalize across scenarios for the task of determining physical stability. Instead, it has been proposed that a general ability to predict what will happen next in physical scenarios will require a more structured representation of the physical world that will support forward simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>). A parallel debate is raging in cognitive science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conwell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firestone and Scholl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestone and Scholl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ludwin-Peery et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Marcus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chater and Oaksford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwin-Peery et al., 2020</xref>), between those who argue that because human physical inferences occur rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firestone and Scholl, 2017</xref>) and preattentively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firestone and Scholl, 2017</xref>) they are computed by something like a pattern recognition process, versus those who argue that human and primate physical inference behavior is best accounted for by mental simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajalingham et al., 2021</xref>). Three lines of evidence from the present study indicate that pattern recognition alone â as instantiated in feedforward CNNs and the ventral visual pathway â is unlikely to explain physical inference in humans, at least for the case of physical stability. First, we find generalizable representations of physical stability in the brain that we do not find in CNNs. Second, these abstract representations of stability are not found in the ventral visual pathway, which is thought to conduct pattern classification and is well modeled by CNNs, but rather in the dorsal pathway, previously implicated in intuitive physical inference. Third, we find a higher univariate response in this Physics Network for unstable scenes, where there is more to simulate, than the stable scenes, where nothing is predicted to happen next. However, note that our hypothesis pertains only to feedforward CNNs trained on object recognition (on ImageNet dataset); It remains an open question whether a feedforward CNN extensively trained on naturalistic images of stability may learn generalizable representations of physical stability.</p><p>We therefore hypothesize that visual information represented in the ventral visual cortex is used by the Physics Network for efficient inference of physical properties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref> for the cases of tool processing and visuospatial reasoning), and this representation is in turn used for forward simulation of what will happen next. This idea has been recently proposed as an integrated computational model that uses visual representations from a deep-learning-based inverse graphics model to initialize simulations in a physics-engine-based generative model of object dynamics, which then can be used to perceive, predict, reason about, and plan with physical objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). This class of models with flexible, object-centric representations and the ability to learn from realistic visual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bear, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mrowca, 2018</xref>) should be able to make predictions of physical stability on the realistic stimuli used in our experiment and also form the basis for neurally mappable encoding models of the candidate physics regions. The question of how such a model is instantiated, if at all, in the brain remains unanswered and provides a fertile avenue for future exploration.</p><p>Many questions remain. First, physical stability is just one of many aspects of physical scene understanding. Future investigations can explore whether the Physics Network also represents other physical properties of objects (like friction and elasticity), relational attributes (like support, containment, attachment), and physical forces and events. Second, if indeed the Physics Network is conducting forward simulations, when exactly does it run and how detailed are its simulations? According to one hypothesis, our mental physics engine compresses the rich details in our visual world into a relatively small number of individual objects and associated events in order to efficiently generate a reasonable approximation of the scene at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to human perception and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullman et al., 2017</xref>). These abstractions may also enable us to run simulations faster than real time with compressed timescales (like hippocampal replay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>), enabling us to make rapid and accurate predictions of the consequences of multiple actions under consideration, including our ability to make fast and automatic physical inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Firestone and Scholl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestone and Scholl, 2016</xref>). Third, is the same neural machinery underlying simulation of the external physical world also recruited when we consider the consequences of our own actions? Answering this question would help elucidate how action planning and tool use are related to the neural system for physical inference, given that much of the Physics Network lies adjacent to or overlaps with brain regions engaged in action planning and tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valyear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mruczek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallivan and Culham, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirteen subjects (ages 21â34; 6 females and 7 males) participated in the experiment which was cut short due to COVID-19 pandemic.

In this task, subjects viewed short movies (~6 s) depicting unstable towers made of blue, yellow and white blocks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) created using Blender 2.70 (Blender Foundation). The tower was centered on a floor that was colored green on one half and red on the other half such that it would topple toward one of the halves if gravity were to take effect. Throughout the movie, the tower remained stationary while the camera panned 360Â° to reveal different views of the tower. Subjects viewed these movies and were instructed to report whether more blocks would come to rest on the red or green half of the floor (âphysicsâ task), or whether there are more blue or yellow blocks in the tower (âcolorâ task).</p><p>Each run of this localizer task consisted of 23 18 s blocks: 3 fixation-only blocks, 10 blocks each of the physics and the color task. Each 6 s movie was preceded by a text instruction displayed on the screen for 1 s which read either âwhere will it fall?â (âphysicsâ task) or âmore blue or yellow?â (âcolorâ task) and was followed by a 2-s response period with a blank screen. This sequence was repeated twice within a block with the same task cue but different movies. The subjects responded by pressing one of two buttons on a response box for each alternative in a task. The mapping of the buttons to the response was switched for the second run to rule out the effects of specific motor responses on the observed neural activations. We used a <italic>physics task</italic> &gt; <italic>color task</italic> contrast to functionally identify the frontoparietal physics regions in each subject individually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Stability experiment</title><p>In addition to the physics ROI localizer, each participant also performed four runs of the main experiment. In this experiment, subjects viewed a sequence of images while maintaining fixation on a red dot at the center of the image and performed a 1-back task.</p><p>Each run of this experiment contained 3 rest/fixation blocks and 12 20-s stimulus blocks (2 blocks for each of the 6 experimental conditions). Each run began with a fixation-only block followed by a random ordering of the blocks corresponding to the six experimental conditions. This was followed by another fixation-only block and the six experimental condition blocks shown in the reverse order. Each run ended with another fixation-only block. Each image block contained 10 trials including 2 1-back trials. In each trial, an image was shown for 1.8 s followed by 0.2 s of fixation-only interval. Subjects were instructed to maintain fixation (confirmed using eye-tracker for 6 out of the 13 subjects) and respond by pressing a button on the response box whenever the same image repeated one after the other in the sequence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CNN analysis</title><p>Activations from the fc1000 layer (fully connected layer just preceding the softmax layer) of a Resnet-50 model trained on ImageNet object recognition challenge were extracted for both stable and unstable conditions across Block Towers, Physical-Objects, and Physical-People scenarios. The Physical-Objects and Physical-People scenarios are exactly the same as in the fMRI experiment, and the Block Towers set (<italic>n</italic> = 258 each for stable and unstable conditions) was used to replicate and extend earlier findings. A linear Support Vector Classifier (SVM) was trained to distinguish between stable and unstable conditions within each scenario using fourfold cross-validation. To test the generalizability of the learned classifier to other scenarios, the SVM classifier was tested on stability detection in the remaining two scenarios. We replicated the results using fc8 layer activations in an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 network. The statistical significance of classification accuracy was estimated by comparing it to a null distribution of accuracies computed by randomly shuffling the training labels 10,000 times and measuring the test accuracy each time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>All imaging was performed on a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM Tim Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at MIT. For each subject, a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image (MPRAGE: TR = 2.53 s; TE = 1.64, 3.44, 5.24, 7.04 ms; <italic>Î±</italic> = 7Â°; FOV = 220 mm; matrix = 220 Ã 220; slice thickness = 1 mm; 176 slices; acceleration factor = 3; 32 reference lines) was collected in addition to whole-brain functional data using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging pulse sequence (TR = 2 s; TE = 30 ms; <italic>Î±</italic> = 90Â°; FOV = 216 mm; matrix = 108 Ã 108; slice thickness = 2 mm; voxel size = 2 Ã 2 mm in-plane; slice gap = 0 mm; 69 slices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Eye movement recordings</title><p>Eye movement data were recorded from 6 of the 13 subjects during both the physics ROI localizer task and the stability experiment using the EyeLink 1,000 Eye-Tracker (SR Research) inside the scanner. We could not collect eye movement data from other subjects due to technical difficulties. Eye tracking data were preprocessed and analyzed to confirm that eye movements could not explain differences in BOLD activity for various experimental conditions. For each trial in both the localizer and stability tasks, we computed the average abscissa and ordinate of the eye position, the number of saccades, average duration, and amplitude of saccades for the duration of the trial. We then performed <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare the average values of the aforementioned eye movement variables for stable and unstable conditions in each scenario across subjects.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>fMRI data preprocessing</title><p>Preprocessing was done using FreeSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://freesurfer.net/">https://freesurfer.net/</ext-link>). All other analyses were performed in MATLAB 2015B (The Mathworks). fMRI data preprocessing included motion correction, slice time correction, linear fit to detrend the time series, and spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 5 mm). Before smoothing the functional data, all functional runs were coregistered to the subjectâs T1-weighted anatomical image. All analyses were performed in each subjectâs native volume and in some cases the results were plotted on the subjectâs native inflated cortical surface only for better visualization (using FreeSurferâs mri_vol2surf function). The general linear model included the experimental conditions and 6 nuisance regressors based on the motion estimates (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> translation; roll, pitch, and yaw of rotation).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Group-level physics parcel</title><p>We derived group-level physics parcels from the localizer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>) in 27 subjects using the Group-constrained Subject-Specific method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julian et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, individual subjectsâ binary activation maps (p &lt; 0.005 uncorrected) were overlaid on top of each other in MNI space. This overlap map was spatially smoothed with a Gaussian filter (FWHM = 8 mm) and then thresholded so that the map contained only those voxels with at least 10% overlap across subjects. Then, the overlap map was divided into group-level parcels using a water-shed image segmentation algorithm (<italic>watershed</italic> function in MATLAB). Finally, we selected a subset of parcels in which at least 16 out of the 27 (~60%) subjects show some activated voxels. This resulted in seven group-level parcels spanning frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We rejected two of the seven parcels in the occipital cortex since they were shown to respond to both physical and social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). The remaining parcels correspond coarsely to previously described physics regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>), however, we believe that the new parcels are probably more stable because they are derived from a larger subject pool. These five parcels were then combined to get one group-level parcel each in left and right hemispheres. We will make the parcels publicly available.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>fROI definition</title><p>We defined fROI in each individual subject as the intersection of subject-specific localizer contrast map and group-level (or anatomical) parcels. Specifically, we used the physics localizer to identify brain regions in each individual subject that responded more to the physics task compared to the color task (uncorrected p value &lt;0.001 for the physics &gt; color contrast). This contrast map was then intersected with the group-level physics parcels created from the physics localizer data collected in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the individual subject fROI contained only those voxels that showed significantly stronger activations for the physics task compared to the color task and fell within the group-level physics parcel. This allowed the fROI locations and sizes to vary across subjects but restricted them to a common general region across subjects. In addition to the physics fROI, we also defined fROIs for the primary visual cortex (V1), LOC, and VTC in each subject. As before, we used data from the physics localizer to identify brain regions that responded to visual stimuli compared to fixation (uncorrected p value &lt;0.001 for physics + color &gt; fixation contrast). We then intersected this contrast map with masks derived from anatomical parcellation and considered only those significant voxels from the contrast map lying within the anatomical mask for further analyses. In addition, we also localized area MT using a standard localizer (coherent vs. random dot motion contrast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tootell et al., 1995</xref>) and included significant voxels within an anatomically defined mask (taken from Destrieux atlas in FreeSurfer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multivoxel pattern correlation analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Within category separability</title><p>To assess if the candidate physics fROI holds information about physical stability, we used the multivoxel pattern correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haxby et al., 2001</xref>). In an fROI, we computed <italic>within</italic> condition pattern correlations (correlation between voxel activation patterns for even and odd runs, computed separately for unstable and stable conditions within a scenario) and <italic>between</italic> conditions pattern correlations (correlation between voxel activation patterns for even runs of unstable condition and odd runs of stable condition within a scenario, and vice versa). We computed the <italic>within</italic> and <italic>between</italic> condition pattern correlations for each scenario in each hemisphere in each subject and compared the magnitudes of correlations using appropriate statistical tests after transforming the correlations using Fisher transform (<italic>atanh</italic> function in MATLAB). A significantly higher <italic>within</italic> condition pattern correlation compared to <italic>between</italic> condition pattern correlation indicates that unstable and stable conditions evoke distinctive voxel activation patterns in a given fROI. Note that by always comparing data across even and odd runs we avoid obscuring pattern information from temporal pattern drifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alink et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Across category similarity</title><p>To explore the generalizability of neural representation of physical stability in a given fROI, we computed multivoxel pattern correlations computed across scenarios. Specifically, in a given fROI, we extracted activation patterns for unstable and stable conditions from the two scenarios under consideration (say, âPhysical-Objectsâ and 'Physical-Peopleâ scenarios). We then computed pattern correlations between unstable (or stable) conditions across scenarios (<italic>within</italic> condition), and pattern correlations between unstable and stable conditions across scenarios (<italic>between</italic> condition). In this way, we computed the four pairwise pattern correlations for each pair of categories within a given fROI in each hemisphere of each individual subject and transformed them using Fisher transformation. We compared the magnitudes of <italic>within</italic> and <italic>between</italic> condition correlations for each pair of categories across subjects using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All subjects gave informed consent to the experimental protocol approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (#0403000096).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Peter Kok as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jaqueline Snow (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and agreed that the study is of interest, but they had serious concerns about the interpretation of the main results. Several alternative explanations of the results will need to be ruled out conclusively, likely requiring new (behavioural) data, in order for the paper to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Note that given the seriousness of the concerns, simply acknowledging them will not be sufficient. The reviewing editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission, should you feel that you are able to resolve these issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. One major concern with the interpretation of the findings is that while the stimuli in the Animals-People condition seem to be relatively straightforward to understand whether they are &quot;unstable&quot; or &quot;stable&quot; scenes, the stimuli in the Physical-People condition seem more difficult to comprehend when they are &quot;unstable&quot; versus &quot;stable&quot;, perhaps due to their unusual scene composition. For instance, it can take a moment to understand what is going on in the scene depicting a man precariously perched atop a ladder, with the ladder balanced on one leg over a stairwell (Figure 2A). This leaves open the possibility that the elevated activity observed in the fronto-parietal areas may not reflect forward simulation of unstable (over stable) scenes involving physical objects and people, but instead, the requirements of parsing difficult-to-comprehend scenes (which happen to be unstable and physical) over straightforward scenes (which are either stable or involve animals). Put simply, the fMRI responses recorded in fronto-parietal cortex may have more to do with scene comprehension than with physical stability. This confound will need to be ruled out conclusively. This will likely require collecting and analysing new data. For instance, the authors could collect behavioral questionnaire data to gauge for each stimulus ease of comprehension, as well as anticipated motion and likelihood of change (see point 2). The behavioral data could then be correlated with the fMRI responses, and it can be tested whether fMRI results are explained better by physical stability or one or more of these other factors. Of course, the authors may have a different approach in mind, which is perfectly fine, as long as the confounds are resolved convincingly.</p><p>2. Can the effects of physical stability reported here be dissociated from effects of implied motion, or likeliness-to-change? In the current study, a higher response to unstable vs stable scenes in reported in motion area MT, which the authors describe in terms of implied motion. It therefore seems possible to describe the results in the &quot;Physics Network&quot; in terms of implied motion, rather than physical stability, as well. As for the first point, this alternative explanation will need to be ruled out conclusively.</p><p>3. The perilous-vs-non-perilous (Animals-People) condition is a crucial control for attention. However, it seems the relevant interaction, i.e. more generalization for stable-to-stable than stable-to-perilous, is not statistically tested. This test seems crucial to demonstrate that generalization is specific to physical stability.</p><p>4. The current study, and its findings, should be situated more deeply in the context of what has been done before. Fischer et al., (2016) showed that specific regions of frontal and parietal cortex responded more strongly when observers performed a physical reasoning task about which direction a tower of blocks would fall (versus a control task). Schwettmann et al., (2019) examined how object mass is represented in these same dorsal areas, and in the ventral visual pathway. The differential pattern of results, including the finding of generalizability across scenarios, was the same as with the present findings, but for object mass, rather than scene stability. Yet Schwettmann et al., (2019) is only briefly mentioned despite its many methodological and conceptual similarities to the present study. The authors should more effectively situate the present findings relative to their previous work (in the Introduction), as well as explain what is novel and surprising about these most recent findings (in the Discussion).</p><p>5. Can the authors clarify why they used block towers, Physical-People scenes, and Physical-Objects scenes with the CNN, but used Physical-People scenes, Physical-Objects scenes, and Animals-People scenes with the human observers? Because the comparison of the CNN to human observers is central to the paper, it is worth explaining why different stimulus sets were used between the two.</p><p>6. It seems that the CNNs simply didnât do a great job classifying physical stability in the first place (60% classification accuracy). In that case, how generalisable should we expect their representations to be anyway? It could be that a CNN that does achieve high accuracy on physical stability judgments (90%?) would actually show this kind of general transfer; but we donât know that from the data presented here, because itâs possible that the lack of generality arises from poor performance to begin with.</p><p>7. The Animals-People results in Table 1, third row, seem quite puzzling. Is it right that there is a far higher between- than within-correlation in all ROIs, especially the visual ones? How can this be explained?</p><p>8. Overall, the generalization effects reported in Table 1 seem quite subtle, and there are of course many statistical tests reported in this Table; have these been corrected for multiple comparisons?</p><p>9. Could the authors explain why they chose to split even and odd runs in the within-scenario analysis but not in the between-scenario analysis. As acknowledged in the caption for Figure 2, this prevents direct comparison of the correlation values between the two analyses, so the justification for the difference should be made explicit.</p><p>10. The brief discussion of the generalization effect (Animals-People to Physical-People) in LOC is not very satisfactory. For instance, what kind of similar shape information could be driving this effect that is not present in the other generalization effects? Also, from Table 1 there seems to be a significantly negative generalization effect in V1 for Physical-Objects to Animals-People, but this is not discussed at all.</p><p>11. âWe reasoned that if the candidate physics regions are engaged automatically in simulating what will happen next, they should show a higher mean response when viewing physically unstable scenes (because there is more to simulate) than stable scenes (where nothing is predicted to happen).â It seems true enough that, once one knows that a scene is stable, one doesnât then need a dynamically updated representation of its unfolding. But the question that this paper is about is how we determine, in the first place, that a scene is stable or not. The simulations at issue are simulations one runs before one knows their outcome. Stable scenes may well have a lot to simulate, even if we determine after those hefty simulations that the scene is stable after all. And of course unstable scenes might well have very little to simulate, if the scene is simple and the instability is straightforwardly evident. Can the authors say more about why itâs easier to determine that a stable scene is stable than that an unstable scene is unstable?</p><p>12. âInterestingnessâ ratings seem like a not-quite-adequate approach for evaluating how attention-grabbing the towers were. Why not a measure like how much they distract from another task? The authors could add a new measure of attention-grabbing-ness with a sounder basis in the visual psychophysics literature, or a stronger justification for why âinterestingnessâ ratings are up for the job.</p><p>13. More examples of the stimuli used in each scenario should be provided, either as a supplemental figure or in a hyperlink, to help readers evaluate the stimuli.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled âInvariant representation of physical stability in the human brainâ for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript has been significantly improved. There are a couple of remaining issues to be addressed before the paper can be accepted, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The response to previous point 6, regarding the generalization of the CNN classification, is not completely satisfactory. Itâs still a worry that the paper is conflating (1) whether CNNs can learn to discriminate stable from unstable with (2) whether whatever it is CNNs do learn is generalizable. The issue raised earlier was that CNN performance was so low that, for all we know, better performance would have revealed that the CNNsâ generalizability wasnât so bad after all. To say that the poor performance âreinforces our point that pattern recognition systems are not very good at discerning physical stabilityâ still feels a bit off-target. There are multiple ways to not be good at something, and the authors here are claiming that one of those ways is a lack of generalizability per se. But our previous point was that we canât tell the difference between bad generalizability and bad overall performance. If the authors themselves are making this distinction (and they are in the paper), it seems crucial to separate those claims and support them independently. If they cannot be supported directly from the data, it would be appropriate to discuss this as a limitation of the study.</p><p>2. The response to previous point 3, regarding the specificity of decoding of representations in the Physics network, did not fully address the issue raised. The authors infer specificity from a null effect in âdecodingâ stability/peril in the Animal-People condition, but of course a null effect is not evidence for absence. It would be more appropriate to test whether the decoding in the Physical-Object and Physical-People conditions is statistically better than in the Animal-People condition. E.g. in an ANOVA with two factors: Physical stability vs Animate stability and Within vs. Between. In other words, in their reply the authors cited two findings, (a) a null effect in the Animals-People condition and (b) a significant effect in the Physics condition, but to support their claims it would be useful to test whether b is significantly larger than a. Otherwise, the findings could for instance be due to the Animals-People null effect being based on very noisy measurements, i.e. a non-informative null effect, which does not constitute evidence for the specificity of the physical stability effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71736.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

To test whether images in the three scenarios systematically differed in ease of understanding, we ran a behavioral task where we asked subjects (n = 16) to categorize the stability of each image (unstable/peril vs stable/non-peril). We found that reaction times differed significantly between stable and unstable conditions within each scenario, but the direction of the effect was not consistent across the scenarios (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>) and â most importantly â the overall pattern of RT and accuracy is not consistent with an account of our fMRI findings in terms of difficulty. Specifically, although the reviewer is correct that the Animals-People condition was easier overall than the Physical-People condition both in terms of accuracy (p = 0.047 for signrank test on avg accuracy across subjects) and reaction time (p = 0.004 for signrank test on avg RT across subjects), it is the difference in difficulty between the unstable/perilous conditions versus the stable/nonperilous conditions that is important because it is this comparison that our fMRI results are based on. And here, we find that in fact subjects were <italic>faster</italic> (p = 0.002) and <italic>more accurate</italic> (p = 0.08; tending towards significance) on the unstable than stable conditions in the Physical-People scenarios, an effect that goes in the opposite direction from the difficulty hypothesis. Further, although participants did take more time to categorize the unstable than stable stimuli in the Physical-Objects condition (p = 0.05), this effect was smaller in magnitude than that found for the Animals-People control scenario (p = 0.033 for interaction between scenario and stability in an ANOVA) where we did not find similarly higher activations for unstable/perilous than stable/nonperilous conditions. Thus, our behavioral data are not consistent with the hypothesis that any of our important fMRI findings (either univariate or multivariate) reflect difficulty confounds.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Physical-Objects</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Physical-People</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Animals-People</th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="bottom">Stable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Unstable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Stable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Unstable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Non-Peril</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Peril</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">% Accuracy (mean Â± std across subjects)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">94.4 Â± 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">93.1 Â± 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">88.5 Â± 3.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">95.7 Â± 1.4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">93.5 Â± 1.4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">99.5 Â± 0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">p-value (signrank test on avg. accuracy across subjects)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">p = 0.67</td><td align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">p = 0.008</td><td align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">p = 0.002</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Physical-Objects</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Physical-People</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Animals-People</th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="bottom">Stable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Unstable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Stable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Unstable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Non-Peril</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Peril</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reaction Time, ms<break/>(mean Â± std)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">862.1 Â± 43.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">943.2 Â± 45.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1088.2 Â± 48.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">958.1 Â± 46.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1003.2 Â± 60.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">881.5 Â± 29.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">p-value<break/>(signrank test on avg.

Certainly, the prior work from our lab by Fischer et al., (2016) and Schwettmann et al., (2019) is highly relevant and these studies are accordingly cited in the introduction, and in detail in the Discussion. We could have framed this study as primarily a question about the âPhysics Networkâ that was investigated in those studies, in which case they would have figured more prominently in the introduction. However, we felt the broader and more interesting theoretical framing of this work was not simply to functionally characterize a region of the brain, but to ask more fundamentally about the computations that in principle could, and that in practice <italic>actually</italic> do, enable humans to reason about the physical world. To this end we start our introduction with the importance to human survival of discerning whether the current situation is stable and hence likely to remain the same, or unstable and hence likely to change in the near future, and the question of whether this information can be extracted via pattern classification systems or requires simulations in a model of the world. We then conduct a preliminary test of that idea using CNN modeling, which leads to our predictions about where we will find this information in the brain. We think this framework is deeper and more interesting than beginning with an extensive review of our own prior fMRI studies.</p><p>We do however prominently discuss the relevant prior fMRI work in detail in the second paragraph of the discussion:</p><p>âOur study builds upon earlier work that has implicated regions in the parietal and frontal lobes in intuitive physical inference. Across multiple studies, similar fronto-parietal regions have been shown to (a) respond more during physics-based tasks compared to color-based or social prediction tasks<sup>16</sup>, (b) represent physical concepts in verbal stimul<sup>23</sup>, and (c) contain scenario-invariant representations of object mass<sup>17</sup>. Intriguingly, the regions activated during physical inference overlap with regions shown previously to be engaged during visually-guided action<sup>24</sup> and tool use<sup>25â27</sup>, perhaps because these tasks also require a representation of the physical world. Indeed physical simulation has been proposed as a crucial component in models for human-like robotic action planning<sup>28â30</sup> and flexible tool use<sup>31â33</sup>; plausibly the same brain mechanisms could have arisen or adapted to support all of these computations. Note however that these same regions also overlap with the âmultiple demandâ system<sup>16</sup>, and are unlikely to be selectively engaged in only physical inference.â</p><p>And we then go on to say exactly what our study contributes, that goes beyond that earlier work:</p><p>âIn the present study, we strengthen evidence that these regions are engaged in intuitive physical inference by showing that they carry a new kind of physical information: the dynamic physical stability of objects and people in a sceneâ¦ our work speaks not only to which brain regions are implicated in intuitive physical inference, but what kinds of computations these inferences entail in both minds and machines. In particular, it is a matter of active current debate in AI whether features extracted by feedforward computations in networks trained on visual object classification will suffice for physical inference, or whether richer internal models that support forward simulation are required. â¦ Three lines of evidence from the present study indicate that pattern recognition alone â as instantiated in feedforward CNNs and the ventral visual pathway â is unlikely to explain physical inference in humans, at least for the case of physical stability. First, we find generalizable representations of physical stability in the brain that we do not find in CNNs. Second, these abstract representations of stability are not found in the ventral visual pathway, which is thought to conduct pattern classification and is well modeled by CNNs, but rather in the dorsal pathway, previously implicated in intuitive physical inference. Third, we find a higher univariate response in this Physics Network for unstable scenes, where there is more to simulate, than the stable scenes, where nothing is predicted to happen next.â</p><p>We think this is the strongest framing for our work, that it does justice to the prior fMRI work, and that it explains how our findings go beyond the earlier work. However, we welcome suggestions from the reviewer if they think we have left out important information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the authors clarify why they used block towers, Physical-People scenes, and Physical-Objects scenes with the CNN, but used Physical-People scenes, Physical-Objects scenes, and Animals-People scenes with the human observers? Because the comparison of the CNN to human observers is central to the paper, it is worth explaining why different stimulus sets were used between the two.</p></disp-quote><p>Block towers have been used in previous computational modeling studies, and hence we also included them in our CNN studies here. However stable and unstable block towers usually differ in their low-level visual properties (stable towers are short and wide whereas unstable towers are narrow and tall, and they can be decoded from early layers of a pre-trained CNN), which is a confound we wanted to avoid in the fMRI experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It seems that the CNNs simply didn't do a great job classifying physical stability in the first place (60% classification accuracy). In that case, how generalisable should we expect their representations to be anyway? It could be that a CNN that does achieve high accuracy on physical stability judgments (90%?) would actually show this kind of general transfer; but we don't know that from the data presented here, because it's possible that the lack of generality arises from poor performance to begin with.</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct in noting that CNNs donât do a great job in classifying physical stability, which reinforces our point that pattern recognition systems are not very good at discerning physical stability. In fact, the classification accuracy that we have reported is close to the baseline performance in literature (Lerer et al., 2016). Interestingly, training on the block tower dataset itself could only bring up the stability classification accuracy to 68.8% on the real-world block tower images. While this is true of the current best model of stability detection, we think that CNNs trained on large-scale datasets of stability under varying scenarios may in future be able to potentially generalize to other natural scenarios. However, to our knowledge no such datasets exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The Animals-People results in Table 1, third row, seem quite puzzling. Is it right that there is a far higher between- than within-correlation in all ROIs, especially the visual ones? How can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing this issue! We should have noticed it ourselves, since the much higher correlations for between than within made no sense. Upon further checking the analysis code, we discovered that only the variable for within condition correlations in the Animals-People scenario was not being updated after computing the fisher z-transform. We have now fixed this issue and updated the corresponding table and figure, and the nonsensical finding is gone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Overall, the generalization effects reported in Table 1 seem quite subtle, and there are of course many statistical tests reported in this Table; have these been corrected for multiple comparisons?</p></disp-quote><p>The generalization effects are indeed quite subtle in effect size, as is typical for MVPA analyses, but they are statistically robust. Correction for multiple comparisons would be required if we were performing multiple statistical tests for a hypothesis and a significant effect on <italic>any one</italic> of those tests would be considered as evidence for the hypothesis. However, in our case, our primary hypothesis is concerned with the Physics ROI and this hypothesis is accepted only if <italic>all</italic> six statistical tests came out as they did. That is, our hypothesis would not be accepted if only one of those tests came out significant. Thus, correcting for multiple comparisons is not required in this case. Moreover, the outcome of statistical tests in other ROIs have no bearing on our primary hypothesis about the Physics ROI, so they do not count as multiple comparisons for the tests performed on the Physics ROI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Could the authors explain why they chose to split even and odd runs in the within-scenario analysis but not in the between-scenario analysis. As acknowledged in the caption for Figure 2, this prevents direct comparison of the correlation values between the two analyses, so the justification for the difference should be made explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation-based decoding approach that we have used rests on the idea that if a brain region carries information about the two experimental conditions under consideration, then it should produce repeatable responses within condition, and repeatably <italic>different</italic> responses between conditions. To test this within a scenario, we must inevitably divide the data into even and odd runs to check for repeatability. However, for comparisons across scenarios, we are checking if similar conditions evoke similar response patterns and hence, we do not have to split the data into even and odd runs. Our hypothesis makes no prediction about the average magnitude of the correlations in the within-scenario (Figure 2B) versus between-scenario (Figure 2D) conditions. Thus, in both cases, we used the available data in a way that gave us maximum statistical power to make our inferences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The brief discussion of the generalization effect (Animals-People to Physical-People) in LOC is not very satisfactory. For instance, what kind of similar shape information could be driving this effect that is not present in the other generalization effects? Also, from Table 1 there seems to be a significantly negative generalization effect in V1 for Physical-Objects to Animals-People, but this is not discussed at all.</p></disp-quote><p>The pattern of responses correlations in LOC is not crazy and might reflect shape features shared between the two scenarios and/or a general representation of peril. Because the particular features that apparently support this generalization are not critical for any of the hypotheses in this paper, and the effect was not predicted and is only marginally significant, we prefer not to speculate further about them.</p><p>On the other hand, the higher correlation for between than within stability in V1 across Physical Objects to the Animals people condition simply makes no sense on any story. We have shown results for all comparisons in all ROIs in the Table, and with 30 such comparisons it is not that surprising that one of them would be a fluke.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. &quot;We reasoned that if the candidate physics regions are engaged automatically in simulating what will happen next, they should show a higher mean response when viewing physically unstable scenes (because there is more to simulate) than stable scenes (where nothing is predicted to happen).&quot; It seems true enough that, once one knows that a scene is stable, one doesn't then need a dynamically updated representation of its unfolding. But the question that this paper is about is how we determine, in the first place, that a scene is stable or not. The simulations at issue are simulations one runs before one knows their outcome. Stable scenes may well have a lot to simulate, even if we determine after those hefty simulations that the scene is stable after all. And of course unstable scenes might well have very little to simulate, if the scene is simple and the instability is straightforwardly evident. Can the authors say more about why it's easier to determine that a stable scene is stable than that an unstable scene is unstable?</p></disp-quote><p>The idea here is that forward simulation happens in all cases but stops if no change has occurred since the last frame. That stopping, both represents the stability of the configuration and produces less activity. This idea is akin to the âsleep stateâ used for nonmoving objects in a physics engine: they do not need to be re-simulated or re-rendered if they have not moved since the last frame (Ullman et al., 2017 TICS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. &quot;Interestingness&quot; ratings seem like a not-quite-adequate approach for evaluating how attention-grabbing the towers were. Why not a measure like how much they distract from another task? The authors could add a new measure of attention-grabbing-ness with a sounder basis in the visual psychophysics literature, or a stronger justification for why &quot;interestingness&quot; ratings are up for the job.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that it would be useful to obtain such measures, so we spent considerable time and effort to devise a paradigm to measure the distracting effect of attentionally engaging natural images on another task. For these efforts we used the high-arousal and low arousal stimuli from the well validated emotionally arousing âIAPSâ stimulus set. None of the many paradigms we tried showed any difference in reaction time when high arousal versus low arousal stimuli were presented during the (orthogonal) main task. We tried placing the task stimuli (Landolt Cs, letters, etc) overlapping on top of the IAPS stimuli, or in the periphery with the IAPS stimuli at the fovea. None of it produced an effect. In looking into the literature, we were unable to find any paradigms that measure effects of the interest level of naturalistic images on secondary tasks. We assume others have tried this before, so the apparent absence of such reports in the literature suggests it simply does not work, presumably because it requires some degree of attention to the stimulus to process its valence.</p><p>We note however that we believe our interestingness ratings because they show the predicted ratings for high arousal and low arousal images from IAPS images (which serve as a positive control for these ratings). Thus, we are confident that our interestingness rating paradigm can capture the degree of arousal/attentiveness elicited by images in our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. More examples of the stimuli used in each scenario should be provided, either as a supplemental figure or in a hyperlink, to help readers evaluate the stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. All stimuli will be shared publicly along with the fMRI data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The response to previous point 6, regarding the generalization of the CNN classification, is not completely satisfactory. It's still a worry that the paper is conflating (1) whether CNNs can learn to discriminate stable from unstable with (2) whether whatever it is CNNs do learn is generalizable. The issue raised earlier was that CNN performance was so low that, for all we know, better performance would have revealed that the CNNs' generalizability wasn't so bad after all. To say that the poor performance &quot;reinforces our point that pattern recognition systems are not very good at discerning physical stability&quot; still feels a bit off-target. There are multiple ways to not be good at something, and the authors here are claiming that one of those ways is a lack of generalizability per se. But our previous point was that we can't tell the difference between bad generalizability and bad overall performance. If the authors themselves are making this distinction (and they are in the paper), it seems crucial to separate those claims and support them independently. If they cannot be supported directly from the data, it would be appropriate to discuss this as a limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Our hypothesis was not that <italic>no</italic> CNN could discriminate stable from unstable stimuli, but rather that CNNs trained specifically on object recognition (using ImageNet) could not do this. To test that hypothesis, we asked whether CNN representations that are useful for object recognition can also support discrimination of physical stability in natural scenes. We found low performance both within a scenario type, and a lack of generalizable representation of physical stability in these CNNs. This indicated to us that regions in the brain that are âoptimizedâ for object recognition (i.e., the ventral visual pathway) may also fail to represent physical stability in a generalizable manner. We then tested this hypothesis using fMRI.</p><p>We tried to make it clear in multiple places in the manuscript (detailed next) that our hypothesis concerns representations supporting feedforward visual object recognition both in machines (CNNs trained on ImageNet) and brains (ventral visual pathway). But if the reviewer would like to advise us where the confusion arose, we would be happy to try to make it yet clearer.</p><p>â [Introduction] âHere we test whether representations that support fast feedforward visual object and scene recognition in machines (i.e., CNNs trained on ImageNet) and brains (i.e., the ventral visual pathway) can support discrimination of the physical stability of complex natural scenes,â¦â</p><p>â [Discussion] âHere we report that fronto-parietal cortical regions previously implicated in intuitive physical inference contain abstract information about physical stability, but representations in the ventral visual object recognition pathway, and those in feedforward convolutional neural networks trained on object recognition, do not. These results indicate that representations in systems that are highly effective at invariant object recognition do not automatically support the general ability to distinguish physically stable from unstable scenes.â</p><p>As we now note in the manuscript (Discussion), we do not address here the question of whether a feedforward CNN extensively trained on naturalistic images of stability may learn representations that could discriminate physical stability across multiple scenarios. This is an important question but one we cannot satisfactorily test currently due to lack of large-scale naturalistic datasets of physical stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The response to previous point 3, regarding the specificity of decoding of representations in the Physics network, did not fully address the issue raised. The authors infer specificity from a null effect in 'decoding' stability/peril in the Animal-People condition, but of course a null effect is not evidence for absence. It would be more appropriate to test whether the decoding in the Physical-Object and Physical-People conditions is statistically better than in the Animal-People condition. E.g. in an ANOVA with two factors: Physical stability vs Animate stability and Within vs. Between. In other words, in their reply the authors cited two findings, (a) a null effect in the Animals-People condition and (b) a significant effect in the Physics condition, but to support their claims it would be useful to test whether b is significantly larger than a. Otherwise, the findings could for instance be due to the Animals-People null effect being based on very noisy measurements, i.e. a non-informative null effect, which does not constitute evidence for the specificity of the physical stability effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the clarification. We did in fact report the suggested ANOVA results â</p><p>âThe Physics Network showed the same pattern of results (Figure 2B and Table 1), with significantly higher correlations within than between stability for both the Physical-Object and Physical-People scenarios but not the Animals-People scenarios, and a significant ANOVA interaction between scenario type and within versus between correlations (F<sub>1,12</sub> = 22.9, p = 0.0004).â</p></body></sub-article></article>
