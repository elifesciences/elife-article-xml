resultant oxidative damage. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a well-characterized physiological meiotic inhibitor that has been successfully used to improve immature oocyte quality during in vitro maturation. However, the underlying roles of CNP in maternally aged oocytes have not been reported. Here, we found that the age-related reduction in the serum CNP concentration was highly correlated with decreased oocyte quality. Treatment with exogenous CNP promoted follicle growth and ovulation in aged mice and enhanced meiotic competency and fertilization ability. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic maturation of aged oocytes was thoroughly improved by CNP treatment, as assessed by spindle/chromosome morphology and redistribution of organelles (mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, cortical granules, and the Golgi apparatus). CNP treatment also ameliorated DNA damage and apoptosis caused by ROS accumulation in aged oocytes. Importantly, oocyte RNA-seq revealed that the beneficial effect of CNP on aged oocytes was mediated by restoration of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, eliminating excessive mitophagy. CNP reversed the defective phenotypes in aged oocytes by alleviating oxidative damage and suppressing excessive PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Mechanistically, CNP functioned as a cAMP/PKA pathway modulator to decrease PINK1 stability and inhibit Parkin recruitment. In summary, our results demonstrated that CNP supplementation constitutes an alternative therapeutic approach for advanced maternal age-related oocyte deterioration and may improve the overall success rates of clinically assisted reproduction in older women.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>C-natriuretic peptide</kwd><kwd>reproductive aging</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>embryonic development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Baohua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023BSHYDZZ89</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro and in vivo data show that C-natriuretic peptide is significant for increasing mitochondrial bioenergetics by cAMP-PKA pathway and improving cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation of maternally aged oocyte.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During growth, oocytes gradually acquire the capacity to resume meiosis, complete maturation, undergo successful fertilization, and achieve subsequent embryo developmental competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gandolfi and Gandolfi, 2001</xref>). However, ovarian involution precedes that of any other organ in female mammals, and in humans, the oocyte fertilization rate decreases rapidly after 35 years of age. Indeed, infertility associated with a decline in oocyte quality with increasing maternal age is a significant challenge.</p><p>Recently, with the development of cultural and social trends, many women have delayed childbearing, and ovarian senescence has become a public health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartimaeus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broekmans et al., 2009</xref>). Ovarian aging is accompanied by abnormalities in organelle distribution, morphology, and functions, leading to inadequate oocyte growth, maturation, fertilization, and subsequent embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reader et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such as in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) have become promising options for infertility treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). However, further studies are needed to improve the subsequent developmental competence of maternally aged oocytes.</p><p>Oocyte maturation has two steps: nuclear maturation, which mainly involves germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and chromosomal segregation, and cytoplasmic maturation, which involves redistribution of organelles (mitochondria, cortical granules [CGs], and the endoplasmic reticulum [ER]), changes in the intracellular ATP and antioxidant contents, and the accumulation of fertilization-related transcripts and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McClatchie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson, 2007</xref>). The quality and developmental potential of aged oocytes are lower than those of oocytes derived from young females, primarily because aged oocytes exhibit negative consequences of cytoplasmic maturation, such as abnormal mitochondria and an aberrant CG distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miao et al., 2020</xref>), deteriorated organelle and antioxidant system function, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Excessive ROS generation leads to destructive effects on cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zarkovic, 2020</xref>). Notably, recent studies have indicated that increased oxidative damage is closely correlated with the occurrence of mitochondrial damage and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>), which is accompanied by blockade of oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The endogenous C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) produced by follicular mural granulosa cells as a ligand of natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2), which is expressed primarily in cumulus cells, plays a crucial role in maintaining meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that CNP, an inhibitor of oocyte maturation, provides adequate time for cytoplasmic maturation, offering a new strategy to optimize the synchronization of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and improve the quality of immature oocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, CNP has been reported to enhance the antioxidant defense ability and developmental competence of oocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhenwei and Xianhua, 2019</xref>). Therefore, CNP may constitute a new alternative means to enhance antioxidant system function and protect against oxidative damage by eliminating excess ROS in aged oocytes. Although CNP has been suggested to contribute to improving the maturation and subsequent development of immature mouse oocytes in vitro, the effect of CNP on maternally aged oocytes remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the redistribution and function of organelles (mitochondria, CGs, and the ER), the ATP content, and the intracellular GSH level in CNP-treated maternally aged oocytes. The results showed that CNP improves the cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence of maternally aged oocytes by optimizing organelle distribution and function and inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. The findings of this study will contribute to understanding the mechanism of CNP in increasing the fertilization capacity and developmental ability of aged oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CNP supplementation improves the quality of aged oocytes</title><p>To explore the effect of CNP on oocyte quality in aged mice, we first investigated whether intraperitoneal injection of CNP can affect oocyte quality. Young and aged mice were hormonally superovulated after 14 d of consecutive PBS or CNP daily injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> , body weights were higher but ovary weight and the ratios of ovary to body weight were lower in the aged mice compared with their young counterparts. However, ovary weight and the ratios of ovary to body weight of the CNP-treated mice were significantly recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Serum CNP concentrations were measured in young, aged, and aged + CNP-injected mice. The endogenous CNP content in serum from aged mice was markedly lower than that in serum from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, administration of CNP to aged mice significantly elevated the CNP content in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To further determine whether the elevated CNP content in serum can improve oocyte quality, we evaluated the number, first polar body (PB1) extrusion rate, and fragmentation rate. As the mice aged, the number of ovulations and the PB1 extrusion rate decreased significantly, but the incidence of fragmented oocytes increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). Conversely, CNP supplementation apparently ameliorated the aging-induced defects in the number and morphology of the ovulated oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). In addition, assessment of follicle development in the ovary sections by HE staining showed severe deterioration of follicles at different developmental stages in aged mice; however, CNP supplementation significantly increased the number of secondary follicles and antral follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). Young, untreated aged, and CNP-treated aged mice were naturally mated with 12-week-old male mice, and consistent with the increased number of ovulated oocytes with a normal morphology, the litter size of aged mice was also increased by CNP administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) supplementation on the oocyte quality and female fertility in aged mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A timeline diagram of CNP administration and superovulation.

In the control (conventional IVM) group, only 35.36 ± 2.74% of the oocytes exhibited PB1 extrusion. After temporary meiotic arrest induced by treatment with 10 nM CNP, the maturation rate increased to 71.12 ± 3.02% (n = 104), significantly higher than that in the control group (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in in vitro-matured oocytes were also evaluated. The percentage of oocytes with abnormal spindle-chromosome complexes was significantly decreased in the group with 10 nM CNP-induced temporary meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that CNP administration increased the serum CNP content, restored the number and morphology of aged oocytes, and improved the fertility of aged female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CNP supplementation restores cytoplasmic maturation events in maternally aged mouse oocytes</title><p>Pregnancy failure and fetal miscarriage increase with maternal age and, importantly, are associated with oocyte aneuploidy and spindle/chromosomal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we determined the rate of spindle/chromosomal abnormalities in oocytes of young, untreated aged, and CNP-treated aged mice by immunofluorescence staining and found that CNP treatment greatly improved the spindle/chromosomal abnormalities in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To determine whether, in addition to affecting spindles/chromosomes, CNP supplementation affects other organelles during the maturation of aged oocytes, we examined the distribution of the Golgi apparatus, ER, and CGs in oocytes from young, untreated aged, and CNP-treated aged mice. The Golgi-Tracker results showed that in aged mouse oocytes the Golgi apparatus was distributed in agglutinated and clustered patterns, and CNP supplementation significantly reduced the rate of abnormal Golgi distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Since the ER plays an essential role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal-mediated oocyte fertilization and subsequent embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyazaki and Ito, 2006</xref>), we then examined the distribution pattern of the ER in oocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the ER was accumulated at the chromosome periphery and was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm; however, the ER abnormally agglomerated in the cytoplasm and the chromosome periphery in a disorganized pattern in aged oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Statistical analysis showed that the rate of abnormal ER distribution was significantly decreased in CNP-supplemented oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The distribution of CGs is one of the most important indicators of oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and is related to the blockade of polyspermy following fertilization. We assessed whether CNP supplementation affects the distribution dynamics of CGs in aged oocytes. Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA)-FITC staining showed that in young oocytes CGs were distributed evenly in the oocyte subcortical region, leaving a CG-free domain (CGFD) near chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, maternally aged oocytes showed an abnormal CG distribution, including increased migration of CGs towards the oocyte chromosomes or oocyte subcortical region, without leaving a CGFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistent with this finding, statistical analysis of the fluorescence intensity of CG signals in aged oocytes showed a significant reduction compared with that in young oocytes, and CNP supplementation improved the mislocalization and decrease in the number of oocyte CGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Taken together, these data imply that CNP is a potent agent for improving cytoplasmic maturation events in maternally aged mouse oocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) supplementation recovers cytoplasmic maturation events of maternally aged mouse oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of the spindle morphology and chromosome alignment at metaphase II in young, aged, and aged + CNP mice.

In young oocytes, mitochondria exhibited a homogeneous distribution in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the periphery of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). However, in aged oocytes, most mitochondria were aggregated in the cytoplasm and partially or completely failed to accumulate around chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we carried out dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) staining to measure ROS levels in each group of oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity showed that ROS signals were markedly enhanced in aged oocytes compared with young oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, CNP supplementation effectively reduced the ROS accumulation observed in aged oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In addition to being caused by ROS accumulation, age-associated oxidative stress damage can be caused by reduced antioxidant defense system function. We therefore investigated whether CNP contributes to improving the antioxidant defense ability in aged oocytes. Quantification of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG ratio) in oocytes showed that NADPH levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio were decreased in oocytes from aged mice compared with those from young mice and that CNP treatment significantly increased NADPH levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio in oocytes from aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Because a high level of ROS not only results in the accumulation of DNA damage but also causes oocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miao et al., 2020</xref>), we next evaluated DNA damage and apoptosis in oocytes by γ-H2A.X and Annexin-V staining, respectively.

Taken together, these observations suggested that the rates of DNA damage and apoptosis are higher in aged oocytes, possibly because of maternal aging-induced excessive accumulation of ROS.

The concentrations of cAMP in GV oocytes derived from young, untreated aged, and CNP-treated aged mice were determined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, the cAMP concentration in aged oocytes was significantly lower than that in young oocytes, but administration of CNP resulted in a substantial increase in intraoocyte cAMP concentrations. This increase in cAMP significantly reduced mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin and mitophagy, which were dependent on PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lobo et al., 2020</xref>). Next, we applied a PKA inhibitor, H89, to determine whether PKA is directly involved in CNP-mediated oocyte mitophagy. We isolated preantral follicles (80–100 µm diameter) from the ovaries of aged mice and treated them with 100 nM CNP or 100 nM CNP + 10 µM H89 during in vitro culture. Monitoring of follicle growth dynamics showed that treatment with 100 nM CNP significantly increased the follicle diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>), whereas H89 treatment inhibited the effect of CNP on promoting preantral follicle growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that CNP supplementation significantly decreased PINK1 and Parkin expression levels, but H89 treatment abrogated these expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–O</xref>). The cAMP-PKA pathway plays an important role in inhibiting Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akabane et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether PKA inhibition regulates Parkin recruitment. The effects of CNP on mitochondria were examined by double staining for Parkin and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20). CNP clearly inhibited the mitochondrial localization of Parkin, but inhibition of PKA with H89 resulted in Parkin translocation to mitochondria, as shown by the overlap of the two staining signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P and Q</xref>). Collectively, these data suggested that the suppression of Parkin recruitment through the cAMP-PKA axis is an important mechanism underlying the protective effect of CNP against oxidative injury in maternally aged mouse oocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In mammals, the endogenous peptide CNP is expressed by endothelial cells in many tissues and has diverse physiological functions in mediating cardioprotective effects, bone growth, oocyte meiotic progression, and follicle growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moyes and Hobbs, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xi et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond the role of CNP as an oocyte meiotic arrest factor, previous studies by our group and others confirmed that adding CNP to the pre-IVM system significantly improved oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo developmental potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richani and Gilchrist, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soto-Heras et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). The synchronization of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation is essential for oocyte quality and supporting early embryonic preimplantation development. However, the underlying molecular mechanism and whether CNP has any beneficial effect on the maternal age-induced decline in oocyte quality are incompletely understood. In this study, we showed that CNP levels declined with age and demonstrated that CNP supplementation increased the number of antral follicles and the ovulation rate and enhanced oocyte quality and fertility. Furthermore, supplementation of CNP in pre-IVM oocyte culture medium reversed the adverse effects of age on immature oocytes, offering a potentially effective approach for ARTs to acquire a greater number of high-quality oocytes and improve the fertility of older women.</p><p>Many factors affect the adverse effects on the oocyte maturation process and embryonic development associated with advanced maternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mikwar et al., 2020</xref>). ARTs are an efficient scheme to resolve infertility as maternal fertility declines with aging. However, the low success rate of IVM oocytes, which is especially pronounced in maternally aged oocytes, limits fertilization outcomes. Our in vivo results showed that CNP supplementation results in multiple improvements, including reductions in oxidative damage, spindle defects, and abnormal organelle distributions and functions, in maternally aged oocytes. Thus, we further investigated the use of CNP in the IVM system, especially in improving the quality of oocytes derived from aged mice. The results indicated that CNP-induced temporary meiotic arrest improved the maturation and fertilization rate of maternally aged oocytes and increased their subsequent embryo developmental competence. Specifically, our results confirmed an advanced role for CNP in preventing the development of mitochondrial structure abnormalities and the typical dysfunctional processes in aged oocytes. Furthermore, these data showed that CNP apparently improved the antioxidant defense system impairment accompanying oocyte aging and alleviated oxidative stress. In addition, the findings demonstrated that CNP improved cytoplasmic maturation events by maintaining normal CG, ER, and Golgi apparatus distribution and mitochondria function in aged oocytes.</p><p>The asynchronous nature of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation is a major challenge in improving the quality of IVM oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coticchio et al., 2015</xref>). Age-related aberrant chromosome alignment prior to cytoplasmic maturation may result in poor oocyte quality and subsequent reduced reproductive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russ et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, after COCs were induced, the temporary meiotic arrest resulting from CNP treatment significantly increased the maturation rate, which may synchronize oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Organelle distribution is a necessary feature of oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and subsequent development. Dramatic ER reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">FitzHarris et al., 2007</xref>), CG translocation to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), and the Golgi apparatus distribution and function are commonly regarded as indicators of cytoplasmic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, our results demonstrate that CNP supplementation restored cytoplasmic maturation in maternally aged oocytes by ensuring normal organelle distribution dynamics and organelle function, increasing the fertilization capacity and developmental competence of aged oocytes. It is reasonable to assume that CNP is a potential option to prevent abnormal organelle distribution and functions in oocytes that could be triggered by ubiquitous environmental endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A and citrinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). CGs are oocyte-specific vesicles located under the subcortex. Fusion of CGs with the oocyte plasma membrane is the most important event needed to prevent polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). The distribution of CGs is usually regarded as one of the most important indicators of oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. The contents of the CGs are normally discharged by exocytosis when the egg is stimulated by the fertilizing spermatozoon; this process is called the cortical reaction, and it prevents polyspermy and protects the embryo from a hostile environment during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuel, 1978</xref>).</p><p>One of the major known causes of oocyte oxidative damage and apoptosis arises from excessive ROS accumulation with aging, especially in IVM oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Combelles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soto-Heras and Paramio, 2020</xref>).Excessive ROS accumulation occurs as a result of two processes, namely, constant generation in the mitochondria or scavenging by antioxidant defense systems, both of which involve age-related quality decreases in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). Thus, maintaining the balance between the production and scavenging of ROS could help to alleviate age-related oxidative damage and fertility decreases. Some antioxidative factor(s) within oocytes might deteriorate as the potential mother ages, compromising the ability for ROS scavenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwarzer et al., 2014</xref>). GSH serves as one of the antioxidants in oocytes to combat ROS-mediated oxidative stress, which is highly correlated with oocyte developmental competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furnus et al., 2008</xref>). The present results suggested that CNP-induced temporary meiotic arrest increased the GSH/GSSG ratio, which is involved in the enhancement of oocyte antioxidant defense and may contribute to improving oocyte developmental competence. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miao et al., 2020</xref>), our findings validated that maternal aging results in excessive accumulation of ROS and DNA damage, which severely impairs follicle development, ovulation, oocyte quality and subsequent embryo developmental potential.</p><p>Defects in chromosome separation and decondensation as well as chromosomal misalignment caused by spindle detachment are the major contributing factors responsible for the decline in oocyte quality with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichenlaub-Ritter et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, mitochondrial function is a key indicator of oocyte quality and successful fertilization in ARTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mikwar et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondrial metabolic activity and mitochondrial DNA replication dramatically decrease in oocytes with maternal age, which reduces ATP production; leads to meiotic spindle damage, chromosome misalignment, and aneuploidy; and largely impairs oocyte maturation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichenlaub-Ritter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">May-Panloup et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that CNP reverses mitochondrial dysfunction induced by aeing in oocytes by analyzing the mitochondrial distribution, ATP content, and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm).</p><p>Notably, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential is a potent trigger of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>). Our single-cell transcriptome profiling data showed that the expression of genes related to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and the mitophagy pathway was considerably upregulated in aged oocytes but restored to normal levels following CNP supplementation. We also observed by TEM that CNP supplementation suppressed the accumulation of autophagic vesicles containing mitochondria. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed degradation of the autophagy biomarker p62 and accumulation of LC3-II in aged oocytes, events that were markedly suppressed in CNP-treated oocytes. In general, excessive activation of mitophagy and mitochondrial damage in aged oocytes may be involved in the deterioration of oocyte quality, while CNP can ameliorate this process.</p><p>The PINK1/Parkin pathway is one of the most studied ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy processes and is crucial for the equilibrium between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial removal via selective recognition and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vernucci et al., 2019</xref>). In healthy mitochondria, the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 is usually expressed at low levels, but it rapidly accumulates on damaged or aged mitochondria that exhibit loss of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Narendra and Youle, 2011</xref>). The decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential abolishes translocation across the outer and inner membranes and confines PINK1 in the mitochondrial matrix, stabilizing it on the mitochondrial outer membrane in a complex with the translocase TOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Gaetano et al., 2021</xref>). Stabilized PINK1 recruits the cytosolic E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin from the cytosol to damaged mitochondria, an event followed by mitophagy. The effects of CNP on meiotic arrest depend on the maintenance of cAMP levels in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Recent findings revealed that cAMP-dependent activation of PKA reduced the PINK1 protein level due to its rapid degradation via the proteasome and severely inhibited Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lobo et al., 2020</xref>). Our data confirmed that PINK1 expression was decreased in CNP-treated oocytes, thus leading to a reduction in Parkin recruitment. However, these effects were disrupted by the inhibition of PKA pathway activity, indicating that cAMP indeed mediates the ameliorating effects of CNP on aged oocyte quality. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKA-mediated inhibition of Parkin recruitment may contribute to protecting mitochondria with a low membrane potential from mitophagy in aged oocytes.</p><p>Collectively, our studies demonstrated that CNP improves the fertilization and developmental competence of maternally aged mouse oocytes by preventing age-related antioxidant defects and excessive mitophagy. Considering its known contributions as a physiological meiotic inhibitor, CNP provides an alternative to prevent maternal age-related oocyte quality defects and improve developmental competence. Although ARTs have been widely used to treat infertility, their overall success rates in women of advanced maternal age remain low. Our data may provide a new theoretical basis for the use of CNP in improving subfertility in older women or the application of clinically assisted reproduction. Out of caution, however, randomized controlled clinical trials should be conducted to further study the efficacy of CNP in women who wish to become pregnant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethics statement</title><p>The young (6–8-week-old) and aged (58–60-week-old) C57BL/6J female mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of the Xi'an Jiaotong University and housed in a temperature- (20–25°C) and light-controlled environment (12 hr light–12 hr dark cycle) and provided with food and water ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vivo treatment with CNP</title><p>Aged mice (58-week-old) were intraperitoneally injected daily with CNP (120 μg/kg body weight; Cat#B5441, ApexBio) for 14 d.

It has also been shown that C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) regulates oocyte meiotic arrest and that its use during in vitro oocyte maturation can improve parameters associated with decreased oocyte quality. Here the authors tested whether use of CNP treatment in vivo could improve oocyte quality and fertility of aged mice, for which they provided convincing evidence. They also attempted to determine how CNP improves oocyte developmental competence. They showed a correlation between CNP use in vivo and the appearance (and some functional qualities) of cytoplasmic organelles more closely approximating those of oocytes from young mice. However, this correlation could not be interpreted to imply causation. Additional experiments performed using CNP during in vitro maturation were not properly controlled and so are not possible to interpret.</p><p>A strength of the manuscript is that the authors use an in vivo treatment to improve oocyte quality rather than just using CNP during oocyte maturation in vitro as has been done previously. This strategy provides more potential for improving oocyte quality - over the course of oocyte growth and maturation - rather than just the final few hours of maturation alone. This strategy also has the potential to be translated into a more generally useful clinical therapeutic method that using CNP during in vitro maturation. However, it is difficult to glean information regarding how CNP might have its effects in vivo. A range of models are used in the manuscript with a mix of in vivo studies with in vitro experiments, which results in some disconnect between systemic CNP and its reported intrafollicular action as well as in the short-term versus longer-term actions of CNP on oocyte quality. Specifically, CNP was shown to be reduced in the plasma of aged mice, but this was not shown in the granulosa cells, which are the reported source of CNP that acts on oocytes. Whether the ovarian source of CNP is reduced in aged females was not demonstrated, and CNP is not known to act on oocytes through an endocrine effect. In vivo treatments with CNP by i.p. injection were performed, but the dose (120 ug/kg) and time (14 days) of treatment were not validated by any prior experiments to give them physiological relevance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The Results section is not always clear regarding what CNP treatment was done - in vivo injections or in vitro maturation. For example, what is the difference, if any, between Figures 2C-D and Figures S2A-B?</p><p>This remains unclear in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. Immature oocytes from aged females (~1 year) were treated with a two-step culture system with a pre-IVM step with CNP. Controls included oocytes from young (6-8 weeks) females or oocytes from aged females treated by conventional IVM. The description of these methods suggests that control oocytes did not receive an equivalent pre-IVM culture, hence the relevance of comparisons of CNP-treated versus control oocyte is questionable. This concern has not been addressed in the revised manuscript. It was observed that aged oocytes pre-cultured in CNP improved polar body extrusion rates and meiotic spindle morphology compared to oocytes in conventional IVM, as has been well established. The description of statistical methods does not make clear whether the PBE rate in CNP-treated old oocytes remained significantly lower than young controls.</p><p>This concern has not been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3. The main effect of the CNP 2-week treatment appears to be increasing the number of follicles that grow into secondary and antral stages, but there is no attempt made to discover the mechanism by which this occurs and therefore to understand why there might be an increase in the number of ovulated eggs, quality of the eggs, and litter size. It is also not clear how an intraperitoneal injection can guarantee its effectiveness because the half-life of CNP is very short, only a few minutes.</p><p>This concern has not been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>4. Meiotic spindle morphology, as well as a number of putative markers of cytoplasmic maturation are also suggested to be improved after pre-culture with CNP. In each case a subjective interpretation of &quot;normal&quot; morphology of these markers is derived from observations of the young controls and the proportions of oocytes with normal or abnormal appearance is evaluated. However, parameters that define abnormal patterns of these markers appear to be subjective judgements, and whether these morphological patterns can be mechanistically attributed to the differences in developmental potential cannot be concluded.</p><p>This concern has not been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>5. In addition to the localization patterns of mitochondria, the mitochondrial membrane potential, oocyte ATP content and ROS levels were assessed through more objective quantitative methods. These are well known to be defective in oocytes of aged females and CNP treatment improved these measures. Mitochondrial dysfunction is the most obvious link between oocyte apoptosis, autophagy, cytoplasmic organelle miss-localization and aberrant spindle morphology. Among the most intriguing results is the finding that CNP mediated a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) dependent reduction in mitochondrial autophagy mediators PINK and Parkin and reduced the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria in oocytes. However, it may not be possible to directly link this observation to the improvements in IVM oocyte quality, since PINK/Parkin assessments were performed in oocytes from cultured follicles treated with CNP for 6 days.</p><p>This weakness has not been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>6. The gold standard assay for oocyte quality is embryo transfer and live birth. The authors assessed the impact of maturing oocytes in vitro in the presence of CNP on oocyte quality by less robust assays (e.g., preimplantation embryo development in vitro), so the impact on oocyte quality is less certain.</p><p>This weakness has not been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>7. The numbers of embryos should have been corrected for the number of eggs fertilized as a starting point so that the percentage that developed to each stage could be expressed as a percentage of successfully fertilized eggs rather than overall percentages. As currently shown in the Figures and described in the Legend, there is no information regarding what the percentage on the y-axis means. For example, does Figure 4B show the number of 2C embryos divided by the number of eggs inseminated? Or is it divided by the number of successfully fertilized eggs, and if so, how was that assessed?</p><p>There is no additional information provided in the revised manuscript to address these concerns.</p><p>8. When fewer eggs are fertilized, the numbers of embryos per group are lower and so the impact of culturing multiple embryos together is lost. As a result, it is possible that culture conditions rather than oocyte quality drove the differences in the numbers of embryos that achieved each stage of development.</p><p>This concern has not been addressed in the revised manuscript. Similar numbers of oocytes were cultured together, but not similar numbers of fertilized oocytes, or embryos.</p><p>9. Not all claims in the Discussion are supported by the evidence provided.

It has also been shown that C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) regulates oocyte meiotic arrest and that its use during in vitro oocyte maturation can improve parameters associated with decreased oocyte quality. Here the authors tested whether use of CNP treatment in vivo could improve oocyte quality and fertility of aged mice, for which they provided convincing evidence. They also attempted to determine how CNP improves oocyte developmental competence. They showed a correlation between CNP use in vivo and the appearance (and some functional qualities) of cytoplasmic organelles more closely approximating those of oocytes from young mice. However, this correlation could not be interpreted to imply causation. Additional experiments performed using CNP during in vitro maturation were not properly controlled and so are not possible to interpret.</p><p>A strength of the manuscript is that the authors use an in vivo treatment to improve oocyte quality rather than just using CNP during oocyte maturation in vitro as has been done previously. This strategy provides more potential for improving oocyte quality - over the course of oocyte growth and maturation - rather than just the final few hours of maturation alone. This strategy also has the potential to be translated into a more generally useful clinical therapeutic method that using CNP during in vitro maturation. However, it is difficult to glean information regarding how CNP might have its effects in vivo. A range of models are used in the manuscript with a mix of in vivo studies with in vitro experiments, which results in some disconnect between systemic CNP and its reported intrafollicular action as well as in the short-term versus longer-term actions of CNP on oocyte quality. Specifically, CNP was shown to be reduced in the plasma of aged mice, but this was not shown in the granulosa cells, which are the reported source of CNP that acts on oocytes. Whether the ovarian source of CNP is reduced in aged females was not demonstrated, and CNP is not known to act on oocytes through an endocrine effect. In vivo treatments with CNP by i.p. injection were performed, but the dose (120 ug/kg) and time (14 days) of treatment were not validated by any prior experiments to give them physiological relevance.</p><p>Thank you for the summary and for highlighting our manuscript’s strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. There are errors in the manuscript writing that make the Results difficult to follow. Reference to the Figures in the Results section does not match what is shown in the Figure panels. For example, the Results text reports differences in CNP levels in aged and young mice shown in Figure 1C, but the relevant panel is actually shown in Figure 1F. Other Figures have the same problem.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestion. All the mistakes have been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In the revised manuscript, we have included additional explanations to clarify that Figures 2C-D represent in vivo injections, while Figures S2A-B depict in vitro maturation. In brief, the results presented in the Supplementary Material (Figures S1-S7) are derived from in vitro CNP treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Previous studies (references: 10.1530/REP-18-0470; 10.1210/me.2012-1027) have demonstrated the crucial role of CNP as an upstream regulator in stimulating preantral follicle growth and promoting the ovulation rate. These studies have also identified the influence of CNP on the expression of key ovarian genes involved in cell growth and steroidogenic enzymes. Consistent with these findings, our study provides further evidence supporting CNP as a critical regulator of preantral follicle growth and oocyte quality. Furthermore, it is important to note that oocyte-derived paracrine factors play essential roles in follicular development. CNP may regulate the communication between oocytes and somatic cells, contributing to folliculogenesis and follicular development. We are considering this aspect for further investigation in another ongoing study.</p><p>To ensure the effectiveness of CNP, given its short half-life (a few minutes), aged mice (58 weeks old) received daily intraperitoneal injections of CNP (120 μg/kg body weight; Cat#B5441, ApexBio) for a duration of 14 days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

This dynamic process occurs during the transitions from the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stage to the metaphase I (MI), polar body extrusion (PBE), and metaphase II (MII) stages (reference: 10.1093/humupd/dmx040). In our study, we observed that CNP treatment partially rescued cytoplasmic maturation events in aged oocytes by maintaining normal distribution patterns of cortical granules (CG), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus. However, further experiments are needed to investigate the specific action of CNP on the function of CG, ER, and Golgi apparatus. These experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript, but we acknowledge the importance of this aspect and will consider it for future research. In this study, our main focus was to examine the effects of CNP on mitochondria distribution and function. Therefore, we analyzed the localization patterns of mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane potential, oocyte ATP content, and ROS levels. These experiments were aimed at elucidating the impact of CNP on mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism, which are crucial for oocyte quality and development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In this study, our primary focus is to analyze the signaling pathway and mechanism by which CNP inhibits mitophagy in oocytes. Previous studies have highlighted the significant role of cAMP-PKA activity in reducing mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin and mitophagy (reference: 10.1038/s42003-020-01311-7). Consistent with these findings, our study revealed that aged oocytes exhibited lower concentrations of cAMP compared to young oocytes. However, upon administration of CNP, we observed a substantial increase in intraoocyte cAMP levels. To investigate the involvement of PKA in CNP-mediated oocyte mitophagy, we conducted further experiments. We isolated preantral follicles (80-100 µm diameter) from the ovaries of aged mice and subjected them to in vitro culture with either 100 nM CNP or a combination of 100 nM CNP and 10 µM H89, a PKA inhibitor. Monitoring the growth dynamics of the follicles revealed that treatment with 100 nM CNP significantly increased follicle diameter, while H89 treatment inhibited the promotive effect of CNP on preantral follicle growth (Figure 6 K and L). Western blot analysis demonstrated that CNP supplementation led to a significant decrease in PINK1 and Parkin expression levels, which were abrogated by H89 treatment (Figure 6 M-O). It is well-established that the cAMP-PKA pathway plays a crucial role in inhibiting Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria (Akabane et al., 2016). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether PKA inhibition regulates Parkin recruitment. To assess the effects of CNP on mitochondria, we performed double staining for Parkin and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20). The results clearly demonstrated that CNP inhibited the mitochondrial localization of Parkin, while PKA inhibition with H89 led to Parkin translocation to mitochondria, as indicated by the overlap of the two staining signals (Figure 6 P and Q). Collectively, our data suggest that the suppression of Parkin recruitment through the cAMP-PKA axis represents an important mechanism underlying the protective effect of CNP against oxidative injury in maternally aged mouse oocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
