Several neurodevelopmental disorders can be traced back to dysregulated migration. Although substantial efforts have been placed in identifying molecular signals that stimulate migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that restrict migration. These restrictive mechanisms are essential for proper development since it helps coordinate the timing for each neuronal population to arrive and establish proper connections. Moreover, preventing migration away from a proliferative niche is necessary in maintaining a pool of proliferating cells until the proper number of neuronal progenitors is attained. Here, using mice and rats, we identify an anti-migratory role for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cerebellar development. Our results show that granule cell precursors (GCPs) robustly express p75NTR in the external granule layer (EGL) when they are proliferating during postnatal development, however, they do not express p75NTR when they migrate either from the rhombic lip during embryonic development or from the EGL during postnatal development. We show that p75NTR prevented GCP migration by maintaining elevated levels of active RhoA. The expression of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of the granule cells even in the presence of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a well-established chemotactic signal for this cell population. Our findings suggest that the expression of p75NTR might be a critical signal that stops and maintains the GCPs in the proliferative niche of the EGL, by promoting the clonal expansion of cerebellar granule neurons.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain contains billions of neurons that form vast networks to relay information around the brain and to the rest of the body.

Several neurological disorders can be traced back to defects in migration during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchsbaum and Cappello, 2019</xref>). In mammals, a highly coordinated series of neuronal migration events are essential for the establishment of the layered structure of the brain, while bringing neurons into the correct location to assemble the proper neuronal connections.</p><p>The cerebellum is well known for its role in motor control, yet it is also involved in non-motor functions such as decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deverett et al., 2018</xref>), reward anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>), and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carta et al., 2019</xref>). Cerebellar granule cells are a unique neuronal population since they undergo two rounds of proliferation/migration cycle during development. In the first round, starting at E10.5 in rats, cells proliferate in the rhombic lip, and around E12.5 the granule cell precursors (GCPs) begin to migrate tangentially on the surface of the future cerebellum, where they will stop migrating and establish a transient proliferative zone, the external granule layer (EGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Bayer, 1996</xref>). In the EGL, the GCPs start the second round of proliferation, undergoing clonal expansion during the first 2–3 postnatal weeks. During this entire period, waves of GCPs exit the cell cycle and start the second migratory stage. Using the Bergman glia as a track together with molecular cues, the GCPs pass through the Purkinje cell layer and colonize the internal granule layer (IGL), their final destination. Although several studies have identified signals that stimulate and guide granule cell migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that prevent the onset of migration. These restrictive mechanisms are critical for proper development since they help to coordinate the proper timing of cell migration away from a proliferative niche such as the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Bayer, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) can mediate a broad array of functions depending on the cellular context, including stimulation or inhibition of cell migration. For instance, p75NTR can stimulate the chemotactic migration of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zanin et al., 2013</xref>). P75NTR stimulates the migration of neuroblasts from the subventricular zone into the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Snapyan et al., 2009</xref>). This receptor also promotes cell migration in certain types of cancers, such as glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berghoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shonukan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Truzzi et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the receptor has also been implicated in the inhibition of Schwann cell migration in a mechanism dependent on RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamauchi et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, p75NTR has been implicated in preventing the aberrant migration of granule cells into the white matter of the IGL in the cerebellum by triggering apoptosis, in a mechanism involving myelin-associated glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Suárez et al., 2019</xref>). These contradictory results emphasize the complexity of p75NTR signaling and functions, re-enforcing the necessity of studying the role of this receptor in specific cell contexts to fully understand its biological functions. During cerebellar development, p75NTR is highly expressed in the proliferating GCPs located in the outer EGL and is downregulated before the GCPs start migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zanin et al., 2016</xref>). Among the multiple signaling proteins that are regulated by p75NTR, RhoA regulation is particularly interesting, since p75NTR can maintain elevated levels of active RhoA in a ligand-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). RhoA is a member of the small sub-family of Rho-GTPases that cycle between a GTP-bound (active) and a GDP-bound (inactive) form. Through this mechanism, these molecules can coordinate multiple aspects of cellular responses. In particular, due to their regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, these GTPases are involved in different aspects of neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Govek et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Govek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, disruption of Rho-GTPase activity has been associated with migration defects leading to several behavioral and developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boettner and Van Aelst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govek et al., 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Govek et al., 2018</xref>). Regulation of this signaling pathway suggests the possibility that p75NTR can influence neuronal migration via the regulation of RhoA activity.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of p75NTR in regulating cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) migration. We found that this receptor exerts an anti-migratory effect on the granule cells, both during embryonic and postnatal development, and must be downregulated to allow the CGNs to migrate away from the EGL. Ex vivo analysis showed that overexpression of either p75NTR or activated RhoA blocks the migration of granule cells. Our findings reveal a novel role for p75NTR in preventing neuronal migration by maintaining RhoA activation in the developing cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>P75NTR is expressed in mitotic, non-migrating GCPs</title><p>During early embryonic development (E13.5) the precursors of the granule cells, indicated by the expression of PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, magenta), begin to disperse rostrally from the rhombic lip. Interestingly, these precursor cells do not express the neuronal migratory marker DCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, white), suggesting these cells did not yet acquire a neuronal fate. During this period, no expression of p75NTR was observed in the migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, green). At later stages (E15.5) the majority of the precursor cells still migrate tangentially to complete the formation of the EGL. However, a subpopulation of cells begins to emerge, located in the internal part of the migratory stream, these cells express PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, magenta) and the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, green). At the final stages of embryonic development (E17.5), there is an enlargement of the EGL, which is accompanied by an increase in the number of p75NTR expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, green), which continues throughout postnatal development until the EGL disappears between 2 and 3 weeks after birth. During postnatal development, p75NTR is expressed in the GCPs throughout the entire EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>, green). Moreover, the expression of p75NTR closely correlates with the proliferation levels in the EGL, with a peak of p75NTR expression during the maximal proliferation stage of the GCPs, which in mice occurs around P5–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Postmitotic GCPs, located mostly in the internal part of the EGL, begin to express neuronal differentiation and migratory markers such as TAG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, magenta) or DCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, magenta) in preparation for the radial migratory phase toward the IGL. In contrast to the expression of p75NTR in proliferating cells, postmitotic cells downregulate the expression of p75NTR, and no overlap between p75NTR and the migratory markers was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). This well-defined boundary between the proliferating cells expressing p75NTR and the migrating TAG1 or DCX positive cells indicates that exiting the cell cycle is accompanied by a reduction in p75NTR expression in GCPs as they leave the cell cycle. The negative correlation between the cells that express p75NTR and the migratory cells observed at embryonic as well as postnatal stages suggests that the expression of the receptor could be a signal that stops the migration of cells coming from the rhombic lip, and retains the cells in the EGL until they are ready to migrate radially toward the IGL.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developmental expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in mouse cerebellum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mouse developmental expression of p75NTR (green), Pax6 (magenta), DCX (white), and Dapi (blue) at the indicated ages.

For instance, it is unclear whether p75NTR is required to keep the GCPs in the cell cycle, or whether the cells maintain the expression of p75NTR because they are in the cell cycle.</p><p>To address this question, we took advantage of the spontaneous differentiation that the GCPs undergo in the absence of a mitogen in culture. In the presence of Shh, a well-known mitogen for GCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kenney and Rowitch, 2000</xref>), these cells are maintained in a proliferative and undifferentiated state with high expression levels of the proliferation marker PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). However, as early as 24 hr in culture without Shh, there is a significant reduction in the level of PCNA. We also observed that p75NTR expression significantly decreased in conditions without Shh, but remained elevated in the proliferative environment induced by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). To further explore this positive correlation between proliferation levels and p75NTR expression, we exposed GCP cultures to different concentrations of Shh for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–K</xref>). Shh induced a dose-dependent increase in proliferation, estimated by the number of Ki67+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> top panels, 2H) and the relative increase in PCNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). At the same time, Shh maintained high expression levels of p75NTR in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> middle panels, 2D, F, J). Consistent with the observations in the EGL during cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the number of double-labeled cells expressing p75 and Ki67 also increased in response to Shh in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

To determine whether other signals that promote cell cycle withdrawal of GCPs also trigger a decrease in p75NTR expression, we treated granule cells with PACAP, a known anti-mitogenic ligand for GCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicot et al., 2002</xref>). We cultured GCPs for 48 hr in the presence of SAG with and without PACAP and quantified their proliferation either by Ki67 staining or PCNA levels using Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To directly test whether the expression of p75NTR is sufficient to maintain the GCPs in a state permissive for proliferation even after withdrawal of Shh, which would allow the cells to re-enter the cell cycle upon re-addition of Shh, we transfected GCPs with a p75-GFP construct to maintain expression of the receptor even after Shh was withdrawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The Shh analog SAG was then added for 24 hr and the proliferation levels were evaluated after the total 48 hr in culture. If p75NTR expression was sufficient to maintain the cells in a permissive proliferative state, we would expect to see an increase in proliferation with the re-exposure to Shh.

Considering the sharp downregulation of p75NTR observed in migratory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), an alternative explanation would be that the presence of p75NTR in proliferating GCPs prevents the onset of migration of this cell population. To assess whether the expression of p75NTR prevents granule cell migration, we used a transwell migration assay and compared the intrinsic migratory activity of dissociated granule cells obtained from P7 WT and p75NTR-/- rat pups. In this assay, the same number of cells were plated on top of the filter and the number of migrating cells toward the bottom of the filter was evaluated after 24 hr.</p><p>To evaluate the intrinsic migratory properties of each of the genotypes, no ligand was added to the transwell compartments. The p75NTR-/- cells showed a twofold increase in the number of migrating cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). The previous data demonstrated that mitotic GCPs maintain high levels of p75NTR, while postmitotic cells expressing neuronal differentiation markers such as DCX or βIII-tubulin completely downregulate p75NTR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that p75NTR may serve to retain the proliferating progenitors in the mitogenic environment of the EGL. To test the possibility, using the transwell assay we exposed the cells to Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> bottom panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) to maintain them in a proliferative state expressing high levels of p75NTR, and stimulated migration using brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> right panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), a well-known chemoattractant for the postmitotic CGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghesani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of Shh, BDNF stimulated the migration of CGN in agreement with the previously mentioned reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>), whereas, in the presence of Shh, which promotes proliferation and maintains elevated levels of p75NTR, BDNF did not induce migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>), indicating that only the postmitotic CGNs that have downregulated p75NTR responded to BDNF with increased migration. An alternative explanation for these findings could be that Shh maintains cells in a proliferative state, and restricts CGN migration independent of p75NTR. To test this possibility, we transfected CGNs to overexpress p75NTR and exposed the cells to BDNF in a transwell assay. Our results showed an increase in migration in response to BDNF in the CGN transfected with a control GFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), similar to the CGN response to BDNF in WT non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).

Therefore, to test the involvement of RhoA in CGN migration, we used the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, to block the RhoA signaling pathway and analyzed CGN migration using the transwell assay. Even in the absence of a chemoattractant, inhibition of the RhoA pathway significantly increased the number of migrating cells compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, black bars), similar to the p75NTR knockout CGNs. Moreover, the inhibition of Rho kinase did not affect the ability of BDNF to promote migration, suggesting that RhoA is not required for CGN migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, gray bars). Since inhibition of RhoA signaling promoted migration, we assessed whether RhoA must be downregulated for CGN migration to occur.

We have previously demonstrated that active RhoA was necessary for the GCPs to remain in the cell cycle, and inhibition of RhoA elicited cell cycle exit of GCPs, which was correlated with a downregulation of p75NTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zanin et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, GCPs obtained from p75KO rats showed a significant reduction in the levels of active RhoA compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results suggest that the elevated levels of p75NTR present in the proliferating GCPs might prevent cell migration via RhoA activation and retain the GCPs in the mitogenic environment of the EGL. To address this possibility, we transfected cerebellar slices with a p75-GFP construct and added the RhoA inhibitor Y27632 directly into the bath. Our results showed that inhibiting RhoA was sufficient to induce migration of the CGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">Figure 7—video 3</xref>).

Defects in neuronal migration often result in neuronal cell death or misplacement of a neuronal population, leading to a variety of disorders including epilepsy, mental retardation, and cortical dysplasia, among other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Copp and Harding, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pilz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moffat et al., 2015</xref>). Although there is considerable emphasis on understanding the mechanisms that promote neuronal migration, as well as identifying potential signals that support cell guidance, little is known about the mechanisms that restrict migration and regulate the timing of the onset of migration. The balance between promoting and preventing migration is critical for the timely coordination of the developing nervous system since it positions the correct neuronal types at a precise time for the establishment of functional neuronal connections. In the cerebellum, it has been proposed that the EGL represents a mitogenic niche permissive for granule cell proliferation, and migration away from this niche results in granule cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, in the present work, we identify a novel function for p75NTR in restricting the initiation of migration of cerebellar GCPs, providing a mechanism that explains how GCPs are retained in the EGL.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>P75NTR is necessary to maintain CGPs undifferentiated but is not sufficient to keep them in a proliferative state</title><p>P75NTR is highly expressed during development in both neuronal and non-neuronal precursors. Embryonic expression of P75NTR starts as early as the blastocyst stage and continues throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moscatelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vandamme and Berx, 2019</xref>). In addition, p75NTR is expressed in a wide variety of adult stem cells, such as the subventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giuliani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petratos et al., 2004</xref>) and the hair follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Botchkareva et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botchkarev et al., 2000</xref>) although its function in these cell populations is not clear. Due to the early expression pattern and the presence of the receptor in embryonic and adult stem cell populations, it has been suggested that p75NTR might contribute to maintaining cells in an undifferentiated state. This hypothesis is further supported by findings in the cancer field where p75NTR regulates key features of cancer cells such as stem cell-like phenotypes and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vidal and Redmer, 2020</xref>). Our results further support this possibility since the morphogen Shh induces (or at least maintains) the expression of p75NTR in GCPs. Shh is secreted by Purkinje cells and is a well-established mitogen for GCPs in the EGL during early cerebellar development. p75NTR is expressed in all the proliferating GCPs in the external EGL and is downregulated in postmitotic CGNs. The same expression pattern is observed in vitro, where in the presence of Shh the cells continued to proliferate and express p75NTR. Moreover, stimulation of GCP cell cycle exit using proNT-3 or PACAP induced a reduction in p75NTR expression together with the cessation of proliferation and increased differentiation. ProNT-3 and PACAP both induced cell cycle exit even in the presence of Shh, suggesting that GCP cell cycle exit is an active mechanism depending on the proper signals and not just the absence of the mitogen. Altogether, our results suggest a potential role of p75NTR in preventing cell differentiation, and it might contribute to maintaining a pool of undifferentiated granule cells during cerebellar development.</p><p>In our previous work we showed that p75NTR regulates the timely exit of the cell cycle in GCPs by controlling the speed of proliferation, and since p75NTR is highly expressed in all the proliferating GCPs, an open question still is whether the expression of this receptor maintains the cells in a permissive state for proliferation. In this study, we confirmed that continued expression of p75NTR was not sufficient to maintain the GCPs in a proliferative state, once the mitogen was absent for at least 24 hr and the cells had begun to differentiate, since re-addition of Shh did not evoke cell cycle re-entry in cells that continued to express p75NTR. Although this result argues against the possible role of p75NTR in maintaining cells in an undifferentiated state, these data must be interpreted with caution since Shh also activates other signaling pathways that might act alone or in concert with other factors to maintain cells in a proliferative state. Thus, removing Shh for 24 hr might induce the activation (or inhibition) of other signaling pathways also required to maintain cells in the cell cycle. Further experiments are needed to elucidate these potential pathways, and more important, whether they interact with the neurotrophin signaling to maintain cells undifferentiated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>P75NTR prevents granule cell migration</title><p>The well-defined boundary between the migrating granule cells expressing DCX and the proliferating GCPs expressing p75NTR suggested that the receptor might be involved in regulating the onset of GCP migration. In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of GCPs. Using a transwell assay we observed that cells obtained from p75KO rats have an intrinsically higher rate of migration compared to WT cells. Moreover, cells that were grown in the presence of Shh, which induces proliferation of the GCPs while maintaining elevated expression levels of p75NTR, were sufficient to reduce the migration of GCPs, even in the presence of BDNF, a known chemotactic signal for these cells. Although maintaining the cells in the cell cycle may prevent the onset of migration by a variety of mechanisms, we demonstrated that the overexpression of p75NTR in CGNs was sufficient to block migration even in the presence of BDNF. These observations raise the possibility that the high expression of p75NTR in the presence of Shh serves to keep the cells in the proliferative environment of the EGL.</p><p>To further test this possibility, we used time-lapse microscopy in cerebellar organotypic cultures, maintaining the cells in the proper tissue environment and in the presence of the molecular signals that regulate GCP proliferation and migration. Overexpression of p75NTR was sufficient to block GCP migration from the EGL. Interestingly, these cells maintained a rounded shape and no process was observed in any direction, unlike the cells in the control conditions where a clear leading process was observed in the cell edge facing the IGL. Since the elaboration of the leading process is critical for the onset of GCP migration, the continued expression of p75NTR may prevent the changes in cytoskeletal dynamics required for migration to occur. Although our results suggest that p75NTR might act independent of a ligand, we cannot completely rule out the autocrine or paracrine release of a ligand that blocks GCP migration. Granule cells can synthesize BDNF, and its precursor form proBDNF has been proposed as a potential anti-migratory signal for GCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). It has been reported that proBDNF acting via p75NTR is a negative regulator of GCP migration. Surprisingly the authors showed using p75KO animals that the absence of the receptor significantly reduces GCP migration, which is not expected if proBDNF/p75NTR signaling is anti-migratory.</p><p>During cerebellar development, p75NTR is expressed in the GCPs throughout the entire EGL surface, including every lobe of the vermis and the hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rahimi Balaei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zanin et al., 2016</xref>). Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the absence of p75NTR was sufficient to increase GCP migration in both the anterior and posterior lobes, suggesting a common mechanism regulating the onset of migration throughout the entire cerebellum. These findings are particularly interesting since different areas and lobes of the cerebellum are associated with different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckner, 2013</xref>). Since the absence of the receptor affected the entire cerebellum, our findings reveal an important role for p75NTR, dysregulated migration in the absence of this receptor can potentially impact a wide range of behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rho A is required to prevent GCP migration</title><p>RhoA has been associated both positively and negatively with cell migration via cytoskeletal regulation in different cell populations including cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2010</xref>) and Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamauchi et al., 2004</xref>). In CGNs, p75NTR can constitutively maintain elevated levels of active RhoA in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). In our previous study, we demonstrated that proNT-3 induced cell cycle exit of the CGPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zanin et al., 2016</xref>) and at the same time it induced a reduction in the levels of active RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zanin et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with these results, we showed that p75NTR-/- cells have a reduced level of active RhoA compared to WT cells, and inhibition of RhoA was sufficient to promote the migration of GCPs. Moreover, overexpressing a constitutively active form of RhoA prevented the migration of GCPs, while blocking RhoA activity in organotypic cultures did not affect GCP migration. Taking into consideration our previous and current findings, the inhibition of migration induced by p75NTR might be due to the maintenance of active RhoA observed in the presence of the receptor. Upon cell differentiation, the levels of p75NTR are reduced inducing a reduction in the activity of RhoA, allowing the cells to migrate.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrate an anti-migratory effect of p75NTR in GCPs. Although we do not discard the involvement of an endogenously produced neurotrophin ligand to regulate migration, our results suggest that an un-liganded p75NTR is responsible for preventing CGN migration. Our discovery emphasizes the multiple roles of p75NTR, depending on the nature of the ligand, the receptor complex involved, and now the possibility of the activation of intracellular signals in a ligand-independent manner. All these possibilities highlight the complexity of p75NTR signaling and the urgent necessity to address them in a cell-specific context, as they could provide an understanding of normal embryonic development and adult brain function while providing new targets for potential novel therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals used</title><p>All animal studies were conducted using the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals with the approval of the Rutgers Animal Care and Facilities Committee.</p><p><italic>P75<sup>FL/FL</sup>; Atoh1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice were generated by crossing mice with homozygous floxed alleles of <italic>p75NTR (p75<sup>FL/FL</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogenmann et al., 2011</xref>) with <italic>Atoh1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (Jackson Laboratory, Cat# 011104.

After electroporation, the cerebellum was sliced into 280 μm sections using a tissue chopper machine (McIlwain Tissue Chopper 800 series Vibratome). The sliced cerebellum was placed in a 10 cm Petri dish with 6 ml of media and gently rocked to fully separate all the sections. Three to four slices were transferred to a filter insert (Millipore, Millicell Cat# PICM0RG50) with 1 ml SFM in the bottom well. Sections were incubated ON at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The next day the insert was transferred to a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (Mat Tek Cat# P35G-0–10C) for live image recording for 15 hr, using a Zeiss 510 META microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Transfection constructs</title><p>The RhoA constitutively active constructs were purchased from Addgene (pcDNA3-EGFP-RhoA-Q63L; Plasmid #12968). The ctrl-GFP construct was purchased from Lonza (pmaxGFP Vector). P75NTR-GFP construct was a kind gift from Dr Moses Chao.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Transwell migration assay</title><p>Transwell assay was performed following the manufacturer’s guidance (Costar Cat# 3422). Briefly, granule cells were plated in the top of the transwell insert 8 µm pore size (Costar Cat# 3422), at a final density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/insert. The total number of cells added in the top of the filter was the same for all conditions. The final volume for the top chamber was 100 and 600 μl for the bottom chamber. For control treatments, no ligand was added to the bottom chamber, for chemotactic analysis, BDNF was added to the bottom chamber to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. The insert was incubated for 24 hr at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were fixed using 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed three times with PBS. Using a Q-tip, the cells on the top of the filter were removed by scraping the surface. Cells at the bottom of the filter were stained using 1 μg/ml of Dapi for 3 min at RT; 90% of the filter surface was imaged using a Nikon E1000 with a ×4 magnification. The total number of cells migrated was quantified using ImageJ version 1.51.</p><p>For the inhibition experiments, the specific inhibitor was added to the bottom and top compartments. All the inhibitors were added from the time of plating the cells and maintained for 24 hr. For RhoA inhibition, we use Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (Calbiochem Cat# 688000) to a final concentration of 1, 10, and 50 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vivo migration assay</title><p>P7 mouse pups were injected with 50 mg/kg EdU intraperitoneally. After 24 or 48 hr, animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused with 4% PFA/PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA/PBS overnight at 4°C, then cryopreserved with 30% sucrose. Sections (12 µm) were cut using a Leica cryostat and mounted onto charged slides. EdU stained was developed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# C10337). Stained for PAX6 was started immediately after finishing EdU staining, as described above. Sliced sections were imaged using a Nikon E1000 with a ×10 magnification. The total number of EdU+ and PAX6+ cells was quantified using ImageJ version 1.51.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>GTPase activation analysis</title><p>Cells were obtained from P7 WT and p75KO rat pups and cultured as described above for 48 hr.

Proteins were quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad 500-0006) and equal amounts of protein were run on SDS gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. To ensure equal protein levels, blots were stained with Ponceau before incubation with antibodies. The blots were then rinsed and blocked in 5% nonfat dried skim milk in TBS-T for 1 hr at RT. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in TBS buffer overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used: anti-p75 (R&amp;D AF367, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2152638">AB_2152638</ext-link>, 1:500), PCNA (BD Bioscience 610664, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_397991">AB_397991</ext-link>). The blots were washed with TBS-T three times 10 min each and incubated with Licor secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. All secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:10,000. Membranes were washed three times 10 min each in TBS-T. The membranes were analyzed using Licor Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR Bioscience). To confirm equal protein levels, blots were reprobed for actin. All analyses were performed at least three times in independent experiments. Bands were quantified using ImageJ version 1.51s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Tissue clarification</title><p>The clarification of cerebellar slices was done following the iDISCO protocol (version 2016). Briefly, after the time-lapse experiment was finished, the membrane filter that contained the slice was cut using a scalpel blade.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;p75NTR prevents the onset of cerebellar granule cell migration via RhoA activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Victor V Chizhikov (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is general agreement among the reviewers that the mechanism of cerebellar granule neuron migration and its experimental support is considered to be rigorous and well done. The manuscript is of interest and the examination of the roles of p75 and RhoA in cell migration and cell cycle exit is appropriate.</p><p>However, several reservations were raised.</p><p>1) Given prior studies on this topic on neural progenitors such as granule cells, it is particularly important that the current results are discussed in the context of previously published roles of p75NTR to emphasize the significance and interpretation of the present findings. As an example, a discussion of these results with the role of p75NTR in programming and maintenance of a stem-like phenotype in mesenchymal stem cells and cancer cells may be informative (Vidal and Redmer, 2020).</p><p>2) In addition, there is a need to clearly address the reviewers' technical and conceptual concerns brought up in the reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find the color choices in Figures 1, 2, and 3 problematic – in Figure 1A, the authors indicate that p75NTR staining is white, Ki67 is red, and Pax6 is green. Two issues – I find the white staining difficult to assess and the authors do not identify the source of the blue stain. Panel 1B, with p75NTR shown as red, provides considerably better contrast and resolution of the p75NTR expression pattern. Second, the blue nuclear staining is not identified in the panels or figure legends.</p><p>The fact that migratory rates differ between wild-type and p75NTR-/- CGPs in the absence of added ligand (Figure 5) and the earlier Yamashita results do not, on their own, indicate that p75NTR in this context is functioning in a ligand-independent manner. I agree that this should be put forward as a possibility but with the caveat that autocrine or paracrine ligands could have a role in either setting.</p><p>In the last paragraph – the authors state that 'A previous study proposed that proBDNF negatively regulates the migration of granule cell precursors and this effect is mediated by p75NTR. In that work, the author described that p75NTR-/- mice have reduced CGNs migration from the EGL'. A citation is required here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) This reviewer is having a hard time differentiating parts of the present manuscript from the group's previously published work where they already demonstrated the increased P75NTR expression in the proliferating granule cell progenitors. Furthermore, given the function of P75NTR (and RhoA) in the cell cycle exit, wouldn't some of the phenotypes observed here be secondary to that? The manuscript would greatly benefit from a thorough discussion on the context-dependent function of the P75NTR in the cell cycle exit and migration of the granule cells in the cerebellum.</p><p>2) As the authors mentioned in the parts of the manuscript, neurotrophin signalling and P75NTR have been implicated in neural migration as a pro-migratory que before. A detailed introduction and discussion of these findings and how they compare to the present study would be highly valuable. This brings me back to my first point; Could some of the present phenotypes be secondary to their effect on the cell cycle rather than directly on migration?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Lines 215-219 and Figure 5A, B. For clarity, I recommend explaining (in either the text or the figure legend) that the same number of granule cells was placed on the top of each insert. Thus, differences in cell density at the bottom filter reflect differences in migration.</p><p>2. The authors conclude that exogenous p75NTR prevents granule cell migration even in the presence of chemotactic signal BDNF. Shh stimulates the expression of p75NTR (Figure 2A, D). It would be interesting to test whether BDNF suppresses the expression of endogenous p75NTR. This experiment could provide an additional mechanism of how BDNF promotes the exit of GCs from the EGL.</p><p>3. Lines 289-290, 308. The rationale for conditionally deleting p75NTR in granule cell precursors is not clearly explained, likely because several lines were accidentally deleted in the manuscript. Can you please, check this paragraph? Contrary to what was stated, Figure 1 does not test for expression of p75NTR in Purkinje cells.</p><p>4. Figure 6E. The genotype of the mouse shown in this panel should be provided. Line 319. Should it be Figure 6E rather than Figure 6D? Contrary to what was stated, Figure 6E has no dotted line.</p><p>5. Lines 327-329. Based on the lack of EdU/Ki67+ cells in the IGL of Atoh1-Cre;p75f/f mice, the authors conclude: &quot;indicating that no premature cell migration of proliferating GCPs was observed when we removed p75NTR, therefore cells still exited the cell cycle before migration.&quot; I found this conclusion somewhat misleading. If granule cells do not migrate prematurely, how can the increased number of labeled GCs in the IGL of Atoh1-Cre;p75f/f mice be explained? Do these cells migrate faster in the conditional mutant? I recommend modifying the original conclusion by simply stating that &quot;loss of p75NTR does not prevent normal differentiation of GCs as they exit their proliferative niche in the EGL&quot;.</p><p>6. A control panel (a p75-GFP transfected slice without Y27632) is needed to appreciate the phenotype in panel 7F.</p><p>7. Lines 379-393. Cdc42 data are not well integrated into the main story of the paper, beyond showing that &quot;After blocking Cdc42, the majority of GFP+ cells remained in the EGL and almost no radial migration towards the IGL was observed (Figure S2B, video 5), similar to the results observed after overexpressing p75NTR-GFP (see Figure 5E). I recommend that the authors either better link their Cdc42 data with the rest of their data (for example, by manipulating Cdc42 activity in p75NTR mutants and evaluating and discussing resulting migratory phenotypes) or delete the Cdc42 section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79934.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I find the color choices in Figures 1, 2, and 3 problematic – in Figure 1A, the authors indicate that p75NTR staining is white, Ki67 is red, and Pax6 is green.

However, the mentioned paper has some contradictory results. In that paper the author suggests that proBDNF via p75NTR prevents the migration of the CGN. However, when they inhibited proBDNF they observed more migration.

The reviewer raises a very interesting question, what is the connection between cell cycle (proliferation) and differentiation? We believe that the presence of p75NTR in the GCP contributes to maintaining the cells in the EGL, upon cell cycle exit, induced by different ligands, one of them being proNT-3, the differentiation process will start, reducing the expression of the receptor in this cell population. One of the open questions we are still persuing is how the exit of the cells from cell cycle will reduce the expression of p75NTR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As the authors mentioned in the parts of the manuscript, neurotrophin signalling and P75NTR have been implicated in neural migration as a pro-migratory que before.

Although we did not test whether BDNF suppresses the expression of p75NTR, BDNF was not able to induce cell cycle exit of the GCP in culture, for which we speculate that BDNF might not reduce p75NTR expression levels. The reviewer raises an interesting point about the dynamic cellular changes between these three cellular stages during development, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, although further studies are needed to dissect the specific changes the cell must undergo to transition between these stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
