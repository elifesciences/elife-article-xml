Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased in the liver by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Huntington's disease</kwd><kwd>duplicated interruption</kwd><kwd>uninterrupted repeat</kwd><kwd>base editing</kwd><kwd>CAG-to-CAA conversion</kwd><kwd>CAG repeat instability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jong-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS119471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jong-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS049206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>Vanessa C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005725</institution-id><institution>CHDI Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleinstiver</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jong-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uninterrupted CAG repeat length determines onset age in Huntington's disease, and therefore, base editing strategies to generate CAA interruption offer new therapeutic opportunities as they diminish the disease-causing mutation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Huntington’s disease (HD; MIM #143100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huntington, 1872</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macdonald, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) is one of many trinucleotide repeat disorders caused by expansions of CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Prospero and Fischbeck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orr and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depienne and Mandel, 2021</xref>).

To explain this striking genotype-phenotype correlation that is common to many trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, a universal mechanism in which length-dependent somatic repeat expansion occurs toward a pathological threshold has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaplan et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism provides a good explanation of the relationship between CAG repeat length and age-at-onset in HD very well as (1) the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat shows increased repeat length mosaicism in the target brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Telenius et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shelbourne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mouro Pinto et al., 2020</xref>), (2) somatic instability is repeat length-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mouro Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>), and (3) the levels of repeat instability shows correlations with cell type-specific vulnerability and age-at-onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shelbourne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mouro Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Swami et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, somatic repeat instability of an expanded <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat appears to play a major role in modifying HD since our genome-wide association (GWA) studies have revealed that the majority of onset modification signals represent instability-related DNA repair genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s DiseaseConsortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these data support the critical importance of CAG repeat length and somatic instability in determining the timing of HD onset.</p><p>Recent large-scale genetic analyses of HD subjects have revealed that different DNA repeat sequence polymorphisms have an impact on age-at-onset. Most HD subjects carry an uninterrupted glutamine-encoding CAG repeat followed by a glutamine-encoding CAA-CAG codon doublet (referred to as a canonical repeat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). However, expanded CAG repeats lacking the CAA interruption (loss of interruption) or carrying two consecutive CAA-CAG (duplicated interruption) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>) also exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying loss of interruption or duplicated interruption is best explained by the length of their uninterrupted CAG repeat, not the encoded polyglutamine length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). Still, age-at-onset of loss of interruption and duplicated interruption was not fully accounted for by uninterrupted CAG repeat, suggesting additional effects of non-canonical repeats. Nevertheless, these human genetics data indicate that introducing CAA interruption(s) into the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat to reduce the length of the uninterrupted repeat is a potential therapeutic avenue to delay the onset of HD. Importantly, a genome engineering technology called base editing (BE) was recently developed, permitting the C-to-T conversion (cytosine base editor) or A-to-G conversion (adenine base editor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nishida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levy et al., 2020</xref>), where cytosine base editor could in principle be applied to convert CAG codons to CAA to shorten the uninterrupted CAG repeat without altering polyglutamine length or introducing different amino acids. In view of the strong human genetic evidence for the role of the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in determining HD onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>), we have conceived BE strategies of converting CAG codons to CAA within the repeat and evaluated their feasibility in HD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of CAG-CAG interruption on age-at-onset in HD patients</title><p>Previously, we and others reported that most HD subjects carry canonical repeats comprising an uninterrupted expanded CAG repeat followed by CAA-CAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). Although infrequent, uninterrupted CAG repeats followed by (1) no CAA-CAG (loss of interruption; 0.23% in our previous GWA data) and (2) two CAA-CAG codon doublets (duplicated interruption; 0.76% in our previous GWA data) also exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>). In HD subjects carrying loss of interruption, the length of the CAG repeat and polyglutamine segment are identical. However, the polyglutamine length is greater by 2 and 4, respectively, compared to the CAG repeats in canonical repeat and duplicated interruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since canonical repeat, loss of interruption, and duplicated interruption with the same uninterrupted CAG repeat lengths have different polyglutamine sizes, they have provided a powerful tool to investigate the relative importance of the CAG repeat in DNA vs. polyglutamine in protein in determining onset age. For example, if polyglutamine length played an important role in determining age-at-onset, onset of loss of interruption and duplicated interruption carriers, who respectively have two fewer and two more glutamines compared to canonical repeat carriers, would be significantly later and earlier compared to canonical repeat carriers with the same uninterrupted CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In stark contrast to these predictions, the onset ages of loss of interruption or duplicated interruption carriers are best explained by their respective CAG repeat sizes, not polyglutamine length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, age-at-onset of duplicated interruption carriers is significantly delayed compared to that of loss of interruption carriers with the same uninterrupted CAG repeat size even though duplicated interruption encode four more glutamines than loss of interruption (Student’s t-test p-value, 1.007E-12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data indicate that age-at-onset in HD is determined primarily by the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, but there may also be additional effects of different CAA interruption structures since the CAG repeat length does not fully explain age-at-onset in loss of interruption and duplicated interruption carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McAllister et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we performed least square approximation to calculate the magnitudes of the additional effects of loss of interruption and duplicated interruption on age-at-onset. Briefly, we varied the individual CAG repeat length to identify the repeat size that best explained the observed age-at-onset of carriers of these loss of interruption and duplicated interruption relative to canonical repeats. The age-at-onset of the loss of interruption carriers (n=21) was best explained when three CAGs were added to the true CAG repeat length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) while the duplicated interruption carriers (n=69) behaved with respect to age-at-onset as if they had one less CAG than their true CAG repeat length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggested that switching a canonical repeat to a duplicated interruption would delay onset by (1) shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat by two CAG repeats and (2) conferring an additional effect equivalent to removing one CAG. For example, if a duplicated interruption is generated from a canonical repeat with 43 uninterrupted CAGs by converting the 42nd CAG to CAA using BE strategies, the age-at-onset is predicted to be delayed by approximately 12 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), illustrating the robustness of therapeutic BE strategies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of CAA interruption on Huntington’s disease (HD) age-at-onset.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Least square approximation was performed to estimate the additional effects of loss of interruption (red circles in panels A and B; n=21) and duplicated interruption on age-at-onset (green circles in panels B and C; n=69). We varied the CAG length of HD participants carrying loss of interruption or duplicated interruption, and subsequently calculated sum of square to identify the CAG repeat that explained the maximum variance in age-at-onset of these allele carriers. Y-axis and X-axis represent age-at-onset and CAG repeat length, respectively. Gray circles and black trend lines respectively represent HD participants with canonical repeats and their onset-CAG relationship. SS means sum of square. (<bold>D</bold>) To illustrate the magnitude of the impact of a therapeutic base editing (BE) strategy of converting a canonical repeat to duplicated interruption by changing CAG to CAA, an example of a canonical repeat of 43 CAG (45 glutamine) with a mean observed onset of 48 years is displayed (n=564). In this example, therapeutic conversion of the 42nd CAG to CAA by BE would produce a duplicated interruption of 41 CAG (45 glutamine). Considering the additional effect of duplicated interruption in HD patients, a 41 CAG / 45 glutamine duplicated interruption would produce an onset similar to a canonical repeat allele of 40 CAG/42 glutamine, with a mean onset age of 60. Therefore, CAG-to-CAA conversion in HD subjects with 43 canonical repeat repeats could delay onset by 12 years.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89782-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>The canonical repeat, loss of interruption, and duplicated interruption.</title><p>Three naturally occurring <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat alleles and their estimated frequencies are summarized. The canonical repeat consists of an uninterrupted CAG repeat followed by a CAA-CAG codon doublet; this repeat sequence is the most frequent accounting for approximately 99% of the disease chromosomes in our previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. For canonical repeat, the size of the polyglutamine stretch is longer by two than the length of the uninterrupted CAG repeat since CAA and CAG both specify glutamine (<bold>Q</bold>). Loss of interruption alleles lack the CAA interruption. This repeat is infrequent in Huntington’s disease (HD) subjects (0.23% in our GWAS data); the lengths of the polyglutamine stretch and uninterrupted CAG repeat are the same.

In principle, canonical repeat can be converted to duplicated interruption if cytosine base editors target the non-coding strand of the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In this study, we tested four cytosine base editors comprised of various cytosine deaminases and SpCas9 enzymes with different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificities to explore the feasibility of CAG-to-CAA conversion as a putative treatment strategy for HD. BE4 is the fourth-generation base editor which was engineered from BE3 to increase the editing efficiencies and decrease the frequency of undesired by-products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komor et al., 2017</xref>). BE4 exhibited high levels of C-to-T editing activity on the target sites harboring NGG PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komor et al., 2017</xref>). The activity window of BE4 is positions 4–8, counting from the PAM distal end of the spacer (where the PAM is positions 21–23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). We tested the BE4max (Addgene #112093) in this study, which is a codon-optimized version of BE4 with improved nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the sparsity and lack of NGG PAM sites near and within the CAG repeat, CAG-to-CAA conversion using BE4 was expected to be somewhat limited. Therefore, we also explored engineered cytosine base editors containing SpCas9 variants that target an expanded range of PAM sequences, including SpCas9-NG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimasu et al., 2018</xref>) and SpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since these variants are capable of targeting sites with NGN PAMs, they might permit higher density targeting near or within the CAG repeat. The nucleotide preceding the target cytosine also affects the C-to-T conversion efficiency in cytosine base editors, especially when a G precedes the C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gehrke et al., 2018</xref>).

We first determined whether BE strategies for HD produced indels. Since low BE efficiencies might result in proportionally low levels of indels leading to an underestimation of their frequencies, we used HEK293 cells, which showed high levels of BE efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Our MiSeq sequence analyses revealed that HEK293 cells carry two canonical repeats (16 and 17 CAGs) and showed approximately 10% of basal levels of indel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which reflects errors due to the difficulty in sequencing the CAG repeat. Nevertheless, transfection of plasmids for BE strategies did not significantly increase the levels of indels compared to cells without any treatment (Cell) or cells treated with empty vector (EV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lack of significant indel formation was quite expected because the cytosine base editors that we tested use nickases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koblan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Since most sequence reads containing indels might be sequencing errors, we focused on sequence reads without indels to determine the types of base conversions. HEK293 cells without any treatment (Cell) or cells treated with EV showed low but detectable levels of CAG-to-CAA and CAG-to-TAG conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), also reflecting sequencing errors. However, the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion were significantly increased over baseline sequencing errors in cells treated with some BE strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, BE4max in combination with gRNAs 1, 2, 5, and 7 resulted in efficient CAG-to-CAA conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Given the availability of the NGG PAMs, robust CAG-to-CAA conversion by gRNAs 1, 2, and 5 was somewhat anticipated for BE4max. However, high levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion by the BE4max-gRNA 7 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) were unexpected because the anticipated hybridization site is not flanked by the NGG PAM that is required for the optimal activity of BE4max. The BE4-NG robustly produced CAG-to-CAA conversions with gRNAs 1, 2, and 3; although not significant, gRNAs 5 and 7 also generated high levels of CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). BE4-SpG with the combinations with gRNAs 1 and 2 resulted in significant levels of CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These data indicated that our BE strategies primarily generated CAG-to-CAA conversion without significant indel formation.

These results suggest that one PAM distal mismatch might be tolerated by base editors in favor of targets sites harboring more robust PAMs. Also, our data revealed that as expected, BE4max is highly dependent on the NGG PAM, resulting in CAG-to-CAA conversion at specific CAG sites, while evo-SpG is more efficient in conversion leading to broader targeting due to its relaxed PAM requirement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Generation of duplicated interruption by BE strategies</title><p>Next, we determined the levels of duplicated interruption in the same HEK293 cell MiSeq data. BE4max and evo-SpG did not produce significant amounts of the duplicated interruption that is found in humans. However, BE4-NG and BE4-SpG produced modest but significant levels of duplicated interruption in combinations with gRNAs 5 and 7 (0.5–1% increase over the basal levels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Modest levels of duplicated interruption compared to conversions at other sites might be due to the lack of NGG PAM at the specific site (approximately 18 nucleotides upstream of CAA-CAG interruption). We also observed that gRNAs 5 and 7 relatively increased the number of sequence reads containing both duplicated interruption and CAG-to-CAA conversions at other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that CTG trinucleotides on the non-coding strand of the repeat contributed to modest but widespread CAG-to-CAA conversion throughout the repeat. Similarly, CAG-to-CAA conversion was not confined to specific sites in evo-SpG in combination with gRNAs 3–8 as duplicated interruption generated by these strategies also contained CAG-to-CAA conversions at other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since increased conversion efficiency in evo-SpG could not be explained by the transfection efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), these data indicate that evo-SpG has a significantly wider conversion window. In agreement with this, the most frequent number of conversions in a given sequence read by evo-SpG was greater than that of other base editors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Evaluation of off-target effects</title><p>We then evaluated the levels of off-target conversions using Off-Spotter. The gRNAs 1 and 2 showed relatively smaller numbers of predicted off-targets due to unique sequences near the PAMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). As expected, gRNAs that were designed to hybridize throughout the CAG repeat showed increased numbers of predicted off-targets. Similarly, gRNAs to convert CAG at the back-end of the repeat showed larger numbers of predicted off-targets, potentially due to the fact that unique sequences are distal to the PAMs. Subsequently, we performed two sets of follow-up off-target validations. For gRNAs 1 and 2, we experimentally evaluated predicted off-targets focusing on protein-encoding genes; one and four genes were predicted off-target sites for gRNA 1 and gRNA 2, respectively, and all showed low levels of conversion compared to on-target (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We also characterized the levels of off-target conversion in other CAG repeat-containing genes focusing on eight polyglutamine disease genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

Although very modest, conversion was significantly higher in the non-expanded repeat (uncorrected p-value, 0.04996), which can be explained by slightly reduced conversion on the mutant <italic>HTT</italic> due to higher GC content in the expanded CAG repeat. However, the candidate BE strategies did not alter huntingtin protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) at the time of treatment, supporting the safety of candidate BE strategies.

As expected, somatic CAG repeat expansion index in the liver of HD knock-in mice carrying around 110 CAGs showed a positive correlation with the inherited CAG repeat length (as represented in tail DNA) and the age of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mouro Pinto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wheeler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kacher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy and Shelbourne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, we could not determine the modified sequence in the treated mice by sequencing because of (1) very long CAG repeats in these mice, (2) modest levels of base conversion, and (3) high levels of errors when sequencing the CAG repeat. However, when the effects of the tail CAG repeat size and age of mice were corrected, retro-orbital injection of AAV9 for split cytosine base editor and gRNA 2 significantly decreased the levels of repeat expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; p-value, 1.78E-6). Nevertheless, the expansion index in treated and control mice was largely overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that the effects of BE treatment were very modest.

For example, CRISPR-Cas9-based editing approaches have revolutionized the investigation of genes of interest and also have begun to be applied to humans to treat diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stadtmauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillmore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). BE, which can convert a single nucleotide to another, represents a newly developed and highly versatile genome engineering technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>). BE has advantages over other genome engineering approaches with respect to safety and clinical applicability. BE employing nickase Cas9 does not intentionally create double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>), minimizing potential adverse effects. Also, BE with low off-targeting is being actively developed to increase safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neugebauer et al., 2023</xref>). The majority of well-characterized disease-causing mutations are point mutations, and therefore many genetic disorders can be addressed by BE strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref>). The robustness of BE has been demonstrated in models of genetic disorders caused by point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Villiger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koblan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newby et al., 2021</xref>), and the first human trial employing BE has already been started (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kingwell, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenstein, 2022</xref>). However, many human disorders are caused by other types of mutations, such as expansions of DNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orr and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McMurray, 2010</xref>) for which BE may not seem like an ideal tool. In contrast to this commonly held notion, we show that BE strategies could also address diseases that are caused by expanded repeats, broadening their target space and applicability.</p><p>In HD, multiple studies have shown that the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in the <italic>HTT</italic> gene<italic>,</italic> not the polyglutamine length in huntingtin protein, determines age-at-onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s DiseaseConsortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). Age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying duplicated interruption not only supports this notion directly, but also points to novel therapeutic strategies. For example, converting CAG to CAA would decrease the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat without changing the length of polyglutamine or altering huntingtin protein. Indeed, our candidate BE strategies could shorten the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat by converting CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without producing significant indels or off-target effects. In support, our candidate BE strategy modestly but significantly reduced the levels of CAG repeat expansion in mice, and HD knock-in mice carrying the CAA-interrupted repeats showed virtually zero repeat expansion. Given the role of the uninterrupted CAG repeat length as the most important disease determinant and a pivotal role for repeat instability in the modification of HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s DiseaseConsortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>), our data support the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion BE strategies in HD.</p><p>Our data are relevant for a number of reasons. First, genetically supported targets significantly increase the success rate in clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hingorani et al., 2019</xref>); our BE strategies were derived directly from human genetic observations in HD individuals, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciosi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Genetic Modifiers of Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright et al., 2019</xref>) pointing to the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in <italic>HTT</italic> as the most direct therapeutic target in HD. Based on these human data, CAG-to-CAA conversion even near the 5'-end of the expanded CAG repeat may produce robust onset-delaying effects. In addition, if BE strategies are applied to fully penetrant 40 or 41 CAG canonical repeats, the repeats can become reduced penetrant (i.e. 36–39). Similarly, BE strategies may be able to convert some of the reduced penetrant CAG repeats (e.g. 36 and 37 CAG) to non-pathogenic (CAG&lt;36), which can prevent the manifestation of the disease. Second, lessons from the recent huntingtin-lowering clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Relations, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheridan, 2021</xref>) implied the importance of allele-specific approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shin et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shin et al., 2022b</xref>). Although CAG-to-CAA conversions in our experiments occurred on both mutant and normal <italic>HTT</italic>, our candidate BE strategies are expected to produce mutant allele<italic>-</italic>specific consequences. The amino acid sequence and levels of huntingtin were not altered, while the length of the uninterrupted CAG repeat was decreased. On the mutant allele, this shortening is expected to reduce the somatic instability, lowering its disease-producing potential. On the normal allele, inherited variation in the length of the CAG repeat has not been associated with an abnormal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), so the shortening of the CAG repeat is expected to be benign. Importantly, the mutant allele-specific consequences can be achieved without relying on individual genetic variations beyond the CAG repeat. Various SNP-targeting allele-specific approaches have been proposed, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shin et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shin et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Monteys et al., 2017</xref>) but most of these can be applied only to a subset of the HD population depending on heterozygosity at the target site. Our BE strategies can achieve allele-specific consequences without targeting SNPs, and, therefore, can be applied to all HD subjects, representing a huge advantage over SNP-targeting allele-specific strategies. Lastly, BE with relaxed PAM requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref> has increased the applicability of BE, and our study has further expanded the target space of this powerful technology. BE is appropriately viewed as a tool to correct disease-causing point mutations or to modify gene expression by introducing early stop codons or altering splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuscu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017b</xref>). However, our study demonstrates that base conversion can address disease-causing repeat expansion mutations without involving DSB. The ramifications apply not only to HD but also to numerous other diseases that are caused by expansions of repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gusella and MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Prospero and Fischbeck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orr and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Depienne and Mandel, 2021</xref>), offering alternative therapeutic approaches for the repeat expansion disorders.</p><p>Although promising, hurdles must be overcome before CAG-to-CAA conversion BE strategies are applied to humans. The BE strategies that we evaluated did not robustly generate duplicated interruption that are found in humans, potentially due to the possibility that PAM at specific sites that are required to generate duplicated interruption did not sufficiently support the activity of cytosine base editors that we tested. Therefore, new cytosine base editors that can efficiently generate duplicated interruption will greatly facilitate the development of rational treatments for HD. Also, the inability to directly target putative toxic species such as RAN translation or exon 1A huntingtin fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neueder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bañez-Coronel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sathasivam et al., 2013</xref>) may represent one of the limitations of our BE strategies for HD. Still, if the levels of those alternative toxic species are dependent on the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies may be able to ameliorate toxic species-mediated HD pathogenesis. Although BE strategies can address the primary disease driver in principle, they may not produce any significant clinical benefits if they are applied too late in the disease. As we previously speculated, the timing of treatment might have negatively impacted the outcomes of the first ASO <italic>HTT</italic>-lowering trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shin et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shin et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Relations, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sheridan, 2021</xref>). Considering the evidence for significant levels of neurodegeneration at the onset of characteristic clinical manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paulsen et al., 2008</xref>), CAG-to-CAA conversion treatments may not produce any clinical improvements if applied late. With the expectation of mutant-specific consequences, we reason that BE strategies can be applied quite early without involving deficiency-related adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lopes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rodan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) because CAG-to-CAA conversion is predicted to neither alter the amino acid sequence nor changes the expression levels of <italic>HTT</italic>. Regardless, these temporal aspects and safety features have to be determined. Finally, like other gene-targeting strategies, the development of effective delivery methods is critical for applying BE therapeutically. The expansion-decreasing effects of our initial AAV injection experiments, while significant, may have been limited compared to cell culture systems by inefficient delivery and difficulty in targeting the repeat sequence. For the successful application of BE strategies to human HD, efficient delivery methods will be critical.</p><p>Given the lack of effective treatments for HD and the premature terminations of highly anticipated <italic>HTT</italic>-lowering clinical trials such as GENERATION-HD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Relations, 2021</xref>) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hdsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Novartis-VIBRANT-HD-Community-Letter-FINAL-PDF.pdf">VIBRANT-HD</ext-link>, aiming at the most relevant target is becoming increasingly important. Our data reveal relevant strategies for addressing the target strongly supported by human HD genetic data, the uninterrupted CAG repeat in <italic>HTT</italic>, therefore offer new opportunities for blocking the disorder at its cause. Currently, the ideal levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion that produce significant clinical benefits are unknown. A series of preclinical studies using relevant model systems may generate data that may shed light on the optimal conversion rate levels that are required to produce significant clinical benefits. In addition, developing base editors with high levels on-target gene specificity and minimal off-target effects is a critical aspect to address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Also, adverse effects due to immunogenicity are issues that may hamper the application of BE strategies to humans. Thorough assessments of immune responses against BE strategies (e.g. development of antibody, B cell, and T cell-specific immune responses) and subsequent modification (e.g. immunosilencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewaisha and Anderson, 2023</xref>) will be critical to address immune response-associated safety issues of BE strategies. Although both great promise and significant hurdles exist for the clinical application of BE strategies, our data illustrating genetic rationale and demonstrating the proof-of-concept of this technology may contribute to developing a rational treatment for HD and, potentially, for other repeat expansion disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study approval</title><p>This study analyzed only data from human subjects, not involving new recruitment.

We also determined the levels of multiple CAG-to-CAA conversion for each BE strategy.

Similar to HEK293 cells, HEK293-51CAG cells were treated with BE4max and candidate gRNAs (i.e. gRNA 1 and gRNA 2) to determine the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion and the total HTT protein levels. For gRNA 1, we determined the levels of in-frame insertion and deletion right after treatment using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>AAV treatment for a candidate BE strategy and CAG repeat instability in mice</title><p>For AAV injection experiments, we used split-intein base editor (v5 AAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levy et al., 2020</xref>). Forward and reverse oligos (<named-content content-type="sequence">CACCGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGGA</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">AAACTCCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGC</named-content>) (IDT) for gRNA 2 were cloned into the BSmBI site of pCbh_v5 AAV-cytosine base editor C-terminal (Addgene, # 137176) and pCbh_v5 AAV-cytosine base editor N-terminal (Addgene, # 137175). Cloned vectors were validated by Sanger sequencing, and subsequently packed into AAV9 serotype by UMass Viral Vector Core. HttQ111 HD knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wheeler et al., 1999</xref>) were maintained on an FVB/N background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lloret et al., 2006</xref>); AAV9 injections were performed in heterozygous HttQ111/+mice at 6–11 weeks. Animal husbandry was performed under controlled temperature and light/dark cycles. After anesthesia was induced using isoflurane, an insulin syringe was inserted into the medial canthus with the bevel of the needle facing down from the eyeball, advanced until the needle tip was at the base of the eye. We injected HD knock-in mice with AAV9 mix (200 μl containing C-terminal and N-terminal split-intein base editor, 1×10<sup>12</sup> viral genome for each) (experimental group) or PBS (200 μl, control group) by retro-orbital injection. Twelve weeks later, liver and tail samples were collected for instability analysis. Briefly, DNA samples were amplified using primer set (6'FAM-ATGAAGGCC <named-content content-type="sequence">TTCGAGTCCCTCAAGTCCTTC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">GGCGGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGA</named-content>) and analyzed by ABI3730 to determine the sizes of fragments. Quantification of repeat expansion was based on the expansion index method that we developed previously. The expansion index method robustly quantifies the levels of repeat instability by eliminating potential noise in the fragment analysis results based on the relative peak height threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neugebauer et al., 2023</xref>). To quantify expansion index in control and mice treated with BE, we applied 10% threshold, and expansion index was calculated based on the highest peak in the tail DNA. Since significantly lower delivery/targeting efficiency was expected in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levy et al., 2020</xref>), we focused on analyzing liver instability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Repeat instability in HD knock-in mice carrying interrupted CAG repeat</title><p>To determine the maximal effects of CAG-to-CAA interruption, we analyzed HD knock-in mice carrying interrupted CAG repeat (namely interrupted repeat mice; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/027418">https://www.jax.org/strain/027418</ext-link>) to HD knock-in mice carrying uninterrupted repeat (namely, pure repeat mice; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/027417">https://www.jax.org/strain/027417</ext-link>).

Our genetic investigation focused on understanding observations in HD patients to develop genetic-based treatment strategies and test their feasibility. We agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of data from relevant cell types. Unfortunately, the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion in the patient-derived neurons were modest, as described in our manuscript (approximately 2%). In addition, AAV did not produce detectable conversions in the brain of HD knock-in mice (data not shown), which was somewhat expected from the literature (PMID: 31937940). We believe some technical hurdles can be overcome by developing efficient delivery methods. Nonetheless, it will be an important follow-up study to perform preclinical studies employing optimized base editing strategies and efficient brain delivery methods to fully demonstrate the therapeutic potential of BE strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In a proof-of-concept study with the aspiration of developing a treatment to delay HD onset, Choi et al. design and test an A&gt;G DNA base editing strategy to exploit the recently established inverse relationship between the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats in polyglutamine repeat expansions and the age-of-onset of Huntington's Disease (HD).

Consequently, individual cells may carry different genotypes, some harboring CAA and others CAG at the same genomic location. Therefore, using a standard genotype format for DNA to present base editing outcomes may not be ideal. Instead, we presented the resulting genotype data in a quantitative fashion to provide the percentage of conversion at each site. This approach allows for an intuitive interpretation of both the extent of repeat length reduction and the proportion of such modifications.</p><p>Currently, genetically precise HD mouse models with robust motor and behavioral phenotypes are unavailable. While some HD mouse models, such as the BAC and YAC models, feature pronounced behavioral phenotypes, they consist of interrupted CAG repeat sequences, making them unsuitable for base conversion studies due to their inherently short uninterrupted repeats. Although genetically precise HD knockin mouse models exist, they do not manifest motor symptom-like phenotypes. Given that CAG repeat expansion is the primary driver of the disease and knock-in mice recapitulate such phenomenon, our genetic investigation focused on assessing the effects of base conversion on CAG repeat instability in knock-in mice. However, as emphasized by the reviewer, subsequent preclinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies using mouse models harboring uninterrupted adult-onset CAG repeats and robust HD-like phenotypes remain crucial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In human patients with Huntington's disease (HD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation, the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats at the genomic level influences age-at-onset of clinical signs independent of the number of polyglutamine repeats at the protein level.

However, GWAS findings did not quantify the magnitude of the unexplained remaining variance in age at onset in duplicated interruption and loss of interruption. Our study further investigated to gain insights into the amount of additional impact of duplicated interruption to estimate the maximum clinical benefits of base editing strategies for CAG-to-CAA conversion. Since the purpose of this genetic analysis is described in the result section already, we added the following sentence in the introduction section to bring up what is unknown.</p><p>&quot;Still, age at onset of loss of interruption and duplicated interruption was not fully accounted for by uninterrupted CAG repeat, suggesting additional effects of non-canonical repeats.&quot;</p><p>We added sample size for the least square approximation analysis in the text and corresponding figure legend. Sample sizes for molecular and animal experiments can be found in the corresponding figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What do they think an ideal conversion rate would be, and how that could be achieved?</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very important question. However, speculating the ideal conversion levels is out of the scope of this genetic investigation. A series of preclinical studies using relevant models may generate data that may shed light on the conversion rate levels that are required to produce meaningful clinical benefits. In the discussion section, we added the following sentence.</p><p>&quot;Currently, the ideal levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion that produce significant clinical benefits are unknown. A series of preclinical studies using relevant model systems may generate data that may shed light on the optimal conversion rate levels that are required to produce significant clinical benefits.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is there a dose-effect relationship for base editing, and would it be realistic to achieve the ideal conversion rate in target cells, given the difficulties described by the authors in differentiated neurons from stem cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed a clear dose-response relationship between the amount of BE reagents and the levels of conversion in non-neuronal cells. Unfortunately, the conversion rate was low in neuronal cells, potentially due to limited delivery, as speculated in the result section. As described in the discussion sections, we predict that efficient delivery methods will be crucial to produce significant CAG-to-CAA conversion to achieve therapeutic benefits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The liver is a good tool for in-vivo experiments examining repeat instability in mouse models. However, the authors could comment on why they did not examine the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on liver instability because of (1) the expectation that delivery/targeting efficiency is significantly lower in the brain (PMID: 31937940) and (2) shared underlying mechanisms between the brain and liver (described in the result section). The following sentence was added in the method section to provide a rationale for liver analysis.</p><p>&quot;Since significantly lower delivery/targeting efficiency was expected in the brain 34, we focused on analyzing liver instability.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is there a limit to judging the effects of base editing on somatic instability with longer repeats, given the difficulties in measuring long CAG repeat expansions?</p></disp-quote><p>Determining the levels of base conversion using sequencing technologies gets harder as repeats become longer. Fragment analysis can overcome such technical difficulty if conversion efficiency is high. As pointed out, the repeat expansion measure is also challenging because amplification is biased toward shorter alleles. However, if repeat sizes are relatively similar, the levels of repeat expansion as a function of base conversion can be determined relatively precisely without a significant bias by a standard fragment analysis approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Given the methodological challenges for assessing HTT fragments, are there other ways to measure the downstream effects of base editing rather than extrapolate what it will likely be?</p></disp-quote><p>Our CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies are not expected to directly generate fragments of huntingtin DNA, RNA, or protein. In contrast, immediate downstream effects of CAG-to-CAA conversion include sequence changes (DNA and RNA) and alteration of repeat instability, which are presented in the manuscript. If repeat instability is associated with HTT exon 1A fragment, base conversion strategies may indirectly alter the levels of such putative toxic species, which remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Sequencing errors could mask low-level, but biologically still relevant, off-target effects (such as gRNAdependent and gRNA-independent DNA, Off-targets, RNA off-targets, bystander editing). How likely is that?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that increased editing efficiency is expected to increase the levels of off-target editing. However, the field is actively developing base editors with minimal off-target effect (PMID: 35941130), which will increase the safety aspects of this technology for clinical use. We added the following sentence. &quot;In addition, developing base editors with high level on-target gene specificity and minimal off-target effects is a critical aspect to address 100.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How worried are the authors about immune responses following base editing? How could this be assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentence in the discussion section as the reviewer raised an important safety issue.</p><p>&quot;Thorough assessments of immune responses against base editing strategies (e.g., development of antibody, B cell, and T cell-specific immune responses) and subsequent modification (e.g., immunosilencing) 101 will be critical to address immune response-associated safety issues of BE strategies.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The following points could be considered to improve the overall quality of the manuscript:</p><p>(1) The authors mentioned that the reason for checking repeat instability in the nonneuronal cells was due to the availability of specific types of AAV; there are other subtypes of AAVs available to infect neurons and iPSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our pilot experiments testing several AAV serotypes in patient-derived iPSC and HD knock-in mice showed that only AAV9 converted CAG to CAA at detectable levels in the liver, not in the brain or neurons. We also speculate that difficulties in targeting the CAG repeat region due to GC-rich sequence contributed to low conversion efficiency. Therefore, subsequent optimization of base editor and delivery may improve BE strategies for HD, permitting robust conversion at the challenging locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Despite its bold nature, minimal data in the manuscript demonstrate that this gene editing strategy is disease-modifying.</p></disp-quote><p>Resources required to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies are not fully available. Especially, relevant HD mouse models that carry uninterrupted adult onset CAG repeat and that permit measuring the levels of disease-modifying are lacking, as described in our response to the second reviewer. Given that CAG repeat expansion is the primary driver of the disease, this genetic investigation focused on determining the impacts of base editing strategies on CAG repeat expansion. Still, as indicated by the reviewer, follow-up preclinical studies to evaluate the levels of disease-modifying of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies using relevant mouse models represent important next steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Off-target analysis at the DNA level was limited to &quot;predicted&quot; off-target sites. What about possible translocations that can result from co-nicking on different chromosomes, as a large number of potential targets exist?</p></disp-quote><p>Among gRNAs we tested, we focused on gRNAs 1 and 2, which predicted small numbers of off-target. Therefore, our off-target analysis at the DNA level was focused on validating those predicted off-targets. As pointed out, thoroughly evaluating off-target effects will be necessary when candidate BE strategies take the next steps for therapeutic development.</p><p>Genomic translocation caused by double-strand breaks can produce negative consequences, such as cancer. Importantly, although paired nicks efficiently induced translocations, translocations were not detected when a single nick was introduced on each chromosome (PMID: 25201414). Therefore, it is predicted that BE strategies using nickase confers little risk of translocation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For in vivo work, somatic repeat expansion was analyzed only in peripheral tissue samples. Since the main affected cellular population in HD is the brain, the outcome of this treatment on a disease-relevant organ still needs to be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>Challenges in delivery to the brain made us determine instability in the liver since many mechanistic components of somatic CAG repeat instability are shared between the liver and striatum, as rationalized in the manuscript. However, we agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of determining the effects of base conversion on brain instability. We added the following sentence in the method section to provide a rationale. &quot;Since significantly lower delivery/targeting efficiency was expected in brain 34, we focused on analyzing liver instability.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors apologize for techniques that do not work when workarounds seem readily apparent to an expert in the field. In its current form, the manuscript reads verbose, speculative, apologetic, and preliminary.</p></disp-quote><p>Drug development programs that are supported by human genetics data show increased success rates in clinical trials (PMID: 26121088, 31827124, 31830040). This is why this genetic study focused on (1) investigating observations in HD subjects and (2) subsequently developing treatment strategies that are supported by patient genetics. As the first illustration of base editing in HD, the main scope of our manuscript is to justify the genetic rationale of CAG-to-CAA conversion and demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic strategies rooted in patient genetics. As our study was not aimed at entirely demonstrating the clinical benefits of base editing strategies in HD, some of our data were based on tools and approaches that were not fully optimal. We agree with the reviewer that it will be an important next step to employ optimized approaches to evaluate the efficacy of base editing strategies in model systems. Nevertheless, our novel base conversion strategies derived from HD patient genetics represent a significant advancement as they may contribute to developing effective treatments for this devastating disorder.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer#3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It would make for an easier read if abbreviations were kept to a minimum.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we decreased the use of abbreviations. The following has been spelled out throughout the manuscript: CR (canonical repeat), LI (loss of interruption), DI (duplicated interruption), and CBE (cytosine base editor). Other abbreviations with infrequent usage (e.g., ABE, SS, QC) were also spelled out in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
