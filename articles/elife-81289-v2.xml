Therefore, knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels and how cancer cells cope with such nutrition is critical to understand the metabolism underpinning cancer cell biology. Previously, we performed quantitative metabolomics of the interstitial fluid (the local perfusate) of murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors to comprehensively characterize nutrient availability in the microenvironment of these tumors. Here, we develop <underline>T</underline>umor <underline>I</underline>nterstitial <underline>F</underline>luid <underline>M</underline>edium (TIFM), a cell culture medium that contains nutrient levels representative of the PDAC microenvironment, enabling us to study PDAC metabolism ex vivo under physiological nutrient conditions. We show that PDAC cells cultured in TIFM adopt a cellular state closer to that of PDAC cells present in tumors compared to standard culture models. Further, using the TIFM model, we found arginine biosynthesis is active in PDAC and allows PDAC cells to maintain levels of this amino acid despite microenvironmental arginine depletion. We also show that myeloid derived arginase activity is largely responsible for the low levels of arginine in PDAC tumors. Altogether, these data indicate that nutrient availability in tumors is an important determinant of cancer cell metabolism and behavior, and cell culture models that incorporate physiological nutrient availability have improved fidelity to in vivo systems and enable the discovery of novel cancer metabolic phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016</xref>) and enables many pathological features of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Faubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017</xref>). This has led to substantial interest in determining the metabolic properties of tumor cells, both for understanding the basic biochemistry underlying these diseases and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Recent work has led to the understanding that tumor metabolic phenotypes are driven both by cancer cell-intrinsic factors, such as oncogenic lesions and cellular epigenetic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nagarajan et al., 2016</xref>), and by cell-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altea-Manzano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gouirand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lyssiotis and Kimmelman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Muir et al., 2018</xref>). While we have a relatively extensive understanding of cell-intrinsic regulation of cancer metabolism, we know comparatively little about TME regulation of cancer metabolism and the contributions of such TME-driven metabolic phenotypes to tumor biology.</p><p>Nutrient availability is a key cell-extrinsic factor that influences cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elia and Fendt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Muir et al., 2018</xref>). Many solid tumors have abnormal vasculature that limits tumor perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olive et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Provenzano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wiig and Swartz, 2012</xref>), which leads to abnormal nutrient availability in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gullino et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vecchio et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, perturbed nutrient availability in the TME has been postulated to be a critical driver of cancer metabolic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martínez-Reyes and Chandel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reid and Kong, 2013</xref>). However, the precise metabolic changes driven by TME-nutrient cues are largely unknown due to a dearth of information on the nutrient milieu of tumors and a lack of experimentally tractable model systems to study cellular metabolism under such constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann and Tardito, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cantor, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To determine how nutrient availability in the TME influences cancer cell metabolism, we recently performed quantitative metabolite profiling of &gt;118 major nutrients and vitamins in the interstitial fluid (the local perfusate of tissues and tumors; IF) in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), providing comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of how TME-nutrient availability is altered in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, we sought to build upon these findings by determining how the abnormal nutrient availability of the PDAC TME drives metabolic phenotypes in PDAC. To do so, we leveraged our knowledge of PDAC IF metabolite concentrations and recent techniques for generating cell culture media with physiological concentrations of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vande Voorde et al., 2019</xref>) to formulate a novel cell culture media termed <underline>T</underline>umor <underline>I</underline>nterstitial <underline>F</underline>luid <underline>M</underline>edium (TIFM) that recapitulates the nutrient composition of the PDAC TME. TIFM provides an experimentally tractable ex vivo model to study PDAC cells while they metabolize substrates at physiological concentrations.</p><p>To determine how TME nutrients influence PDAC cells, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of murine PDAC cells growing in TIFM, standard culture, and orthotopic tumors. Through this analysis, we found that many transcriptional features of PDAC cells growing in vivo are better recapitulated in TIFM culture compared to standard culture models. This suggests that altered nutrient availability is a major regulator of the cancer cell state in the TME. Thus, ex vivo models incorporating physiological nutrition could improve the fidelity of cell culture models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Horvath et al., 2016</xref>). A major metabolic signature we found in PDAC cells in TIFM and in vivo was activation of the amino acid starvation transcriptional signature, including increased expression of the de novo arginine synthesis pathway. We find that the de novo arginine synthesis pathway enables PDAC cells in TIFM and in tumors to acquire the arginine needed for amino acid homeostasis despite TME arginine starvation. Further, we show that myeloid-driven arginase activity is responsible for arginine deprivation in the PDAC TME. Collectively, this work identifies TME-nutrient availability as a key regulator of the in vivo cancer cell phenotype and demonstrates that analysis of cancer cells under physiological nutrient conditions can identify <italic>bona fide</italic> metabolic features of tumors, such as de novo arginine synthesis in PDAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDAC cells grown in tumor IF-based culture medium recapitulate the transcriptomic behavior of PDAC cells growing in vivo</title><p>To study how the nutrient composition of the PDAC TME influences cancer cell biology, we developed a cell culture medium termed <underline>T</underline>umor <underline>I</underline>nterstitial <underline>F</underline>luid <underline>M</underline>edium (TIFM) based on metabolite concentrations in PDAC IF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). To do so, we used an approach similar to those described for the generation of media with plasma levels of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vande Voorde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These metabolites were selected on the following bases: (1) commercial availability at high purity, (2) stability in aqueous solution, and (3) presence in PDAC IF at a concentration &gt;0.5 µM. To enable rapid identification of bio-active nutrients, TIFM is composed of ten pools of metabolites that are separately compounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vande Voorde et al., 2019</xref>). To generate the complete medium, the individual metabolite powders are reconstituted in water along with salts at RPMI-1640 (RPMI) concentrations and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) to provide lipids, growth factors, and any other macromolecules necessary for cell growth. Sodium bicarbonate is also added at RPMI concentrations to maintain physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Michl et al., 2019</xref>). The complete TIFM formulation is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Importantly, quantitative metabolite profiling by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) of TIFM confirmed that TIFM contained metabolites at expected concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This PDAC model is the same mouse model used for TIF metabolomics analyses and which formed the basis of TIFM composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). We then split the cells isolated from each tumor into two populations, which were cultured either in TIFM or standard culture conditions (RPMI-1640) to generate paired mPDAC cell lines termed mPDAC-RPMI or mPDAC-TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). mPDAC-TIFM cells readily proliferate in TIFM culture, albeit at a slower rate than in RPMI-1640 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that TIFM has the necessary nutrients to sustain PDAC cell proliferation. Interestingly, while mPDAC-TIFM cells continue proliferating when transitioned directly from culture in TIFM to RPMI-1640, transferring mPDAC-RPMI cells directly to TIFM results in near-complete arrest of cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that long-term growth of mPDAC cells in standard cell culture media results in loss of key adaptations to grow under TME-nutrient stress. Thus, analysis of PDAC cell metabolism in TIFM could identify novel metabolic adaptations required for growth under TME conditions that would not be apparent from studying PDAC cells under standard culture conditions.</p><p>To identify such adaptations, we performed transcriptomic profiling comparing gene expression patterns of the same mPDAC cells (mPDAC3-TIFM) isolated by FACS: (1) after culture in TIFM, (2) after culture in RPMI-1640, and (3) after growing as syngeneic orthotopic murine tumors to provide an in vivo reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This experimental design allowed us to identify transcriptionally driven metabolic adaptations in TIFM and confirm these were operative in vivo. Further, the in vivo transcriptomic data allow us to assess how the transcriptional state of PDAC cells in different ex vivo models compares to the <italic>bona fide</italic> in vivo cell state. This analysis has recently been suggested to be a critical benchmark for assessing ex vivo model fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raghavan et al., 2021</xref>). We first established that compared to standard culture conditions, mPDAC cells in orthotopic tumors substantially alter their transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The majority of detected transcripts (12,066/16,378) are differentially expressed in the same mPDAC cells when grown in vivo compared to standard culture conditions. Next, using this differential expression data, we generated gene sets of the most significantly up- and downregulated genes in mPDAC cells growing in vivo compared to RPMI (‘top 500 genes up in vivo’ and ‘top 500 genes down in vivo’, respectively). We then performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) using the transcriptomic data of mPDAC3-TIFM cells growing in TIFM and RPMI using the ‘top 500 genes up in vivo’ and ‘top 500 genes down in vivo’ gene sets. Compared to mPDAC cells cultured in RPMI, mPDAC cells in TIFM show a strong enrichment for in vivo upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and negative enrichment for genes downregulated in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). While limiting these gene sets to 500 genes ensures there is no enrichment score inflation due to the large gene set size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), using gene sets comprised of all 5000+ genes significantly up- or downregulated for each set generates the same enrichment patterns with similar enrichment scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also found a strong correlation between gene expression changes induced by culture in TIFM and growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Lastly, among the top 20 up- and downregulated curated gene signatures from MSigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells compared to RPMI, most were similarly up- or downregulated in vivo compared to RPMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Altogether, this analysis demonstrates that gene expression in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells more closely aligns with the gene expression pattern of mPDAC cells in vivo.</p><p>We also sought to understand which aspects of the in vivo mPDAC cell state were not recapitulated in TIFM. To identify the cellular processes that are differentially regulated between cells growing in TIFM and cells in vivo, we performed GSEA using Gene ontology (GO)-based gene sets on transcriptomic data from mPDAC3-TIFM cells in vivo and in TIFM. The main cellular processes differentiating PDAC cells growing in vivo from cells growing in TIFM are cell–cell communication, response to biotic stimuli, cell surface receptor-activated pathways, and regulation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). These differences are likely due to the presence of the immune compartment and other neighboring cell populations in PDAC tumors, an aspect of the TME not modeled in TIFM. On the other hand, the main cellular processes positively enriched in PDAC cells in TIFM relative to in vivo are ribosome complex biogenesis, rRNA processing, and mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>), suggesting that, although the slower proliferation of mPDAC cells in TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is more reminiscent of cells in vivo, cell cycle progression and translation are nevertheless still higher in TIFM than in vivo. Altogether, these results show that mPDAC cells grown in TIFM more closely recapitulate the transcriptomic profile of cells growing directly in the TME, suggesting that TIFM is a useful system for the discovery and characterization of cancer cell adaptations to physiological tumor nutrient stress in PDAC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arginine biosynthesis supports PDAC cell growth under TME-nutrient stress</title><p>We next sought to identify metabolic adaptations cancer cells exhibit in response to tumor nutrient stress using the transcriptional profiles of mPDAC cells in TIFM and in vivo. We focused on adaptation to amino acid deprivation, as this gene signature is highly enriched in TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and is similarly enriched in mPDAC cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Leading edge analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) identified <italic>Ass1</italic> as the most differentially expressed gene in this signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We further confirmed the upregulation of Argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) at the protein level by immunoblotting for ASS1 in protein extracts from TIFM and RPMI cultured mPDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Immunohistological analysis of murine and human PDAC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>) shows similarly robust expression of ASS1, especially compared to the lack of expression in the untransformed exocrine pancreas. These data suggest that mPDAC cells express ASS1 in the TME or when exposed to TME-nutrient stress.</p><p>ASS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the non-essential amino acid arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haines et al., 2011</xref>). ASS1 catalyzes the synthesis of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate, which can then be converted to arginine and fumarate by argininosuccinate lyase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, expression of ASS1 enables PDAC cells to synthesize arginine de novo.

To do so, we used quantitative LC–MS metabolite profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>) to perform an analysis of 108 metabolites that mPDAC1-TIFM and mPDAC1-RPMI cells consume or release in their respective media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hosios et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we found that mPDAC1-TIFM cells selectively consume citrulline, but not ornithine, at a rate similar to that of arginine uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Citrulline uptake by mPDAC cells in TIFM is consistent with active arginine synthesis in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells contributing substantially to intracellular arginine levels. To determine if citrulline consumption by PDAC cells enables arginine synthesis, we cultured mPDAC cells in TIFM with isotopically labeled <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-citrulline and measured steady-state incorporation of citrulline carbon into arginine and its precursor argininosuccinate by LC–MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). 100% of intracellular argininosuccinate and almost half of total intracellular arginine was labeled by <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-citrulline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Thus, de novo synthesis contributes a substantial fraction of cellular arginine in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells, a finding consistent across multiple mPDAC cell lines in TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Consistent with this, inhibiting arginine synthesis by deprivation of citrulline and ornithine from TIFM results in a 10-fold decrease of intracellular arginine in mPDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This decrease in intracellular arginine is accompanied by a significant decrease in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, consistent with the consumption/release (Co/Re) analysis by LC–MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), individual depletion of either citrulline or ornithine further shows that depletion of citrulline, but not ornithine, is the key substrate mPDAC cells require for arginine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). To confirm the finding that de novo arginine synthesis is critical for mPDAC proliferation in TIFM, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout (KO) <italic>Ass1</italic> in mPDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Consistent with decreased mPDAC proliferation upon de novo arginine synthesis inhibition by citrulline withdrawal, <italic>Ass1</italic> KO decreases mPDAC proliferation and this affect can be rescued by supplying additional exogenous arginine in TIFM or by re-expression of <italic>Ass1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that de novo arginine synthesis is important to maintain intracellular arginine levels and mPDAC cell proliferation in TIFM.</p><p>Next, we asked if limited ability to synthesize arginine due to decreased Ass1 expression could explain the inability of mPDAC-RPMI cells to grow robustly in TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test this, we first asked if increasing the arginine concentration in TIFM to 100 μM could enable mPDAC-RPMI cells to grow in TIFM. We found arginine addition almost completely rescues the inhibition of cell growth observed when transferring mPDAC-RPMI cells directly to TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, mPDAC-RPMI cells lose the ability to grow under arginine-deprived conditions, leading to their inability to grow in TIFM.</p><p>We next asked if arginine biosynthesis contributes to arginine homeostasis in murine PDAC tumors. To assess intratumoral PDAC arginine synthesis, we performed <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine isotope tracing by multiple bolus intravenous injections of <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine into mPDAC orthotopic tumor-bearing mice and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine tracing can be used to monitor arginine synthesis and urea cycle activity in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zaytouni et al., 2017</xref>) by monitoring the incorporation of labeled glutamine derived nitrogen into arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). After glutamine injection, healthy pancreas, tumor tissue, and plasma samples were collected, and <sup>15</sup>N enrichment in arginine and arginine biosynthetic precursors was measured by LC–MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Glutamine in plasma is also quickly metabolized by multiple organs, which can then release labeled arginine and other metabolites into the circulation, which contribute to arginine labeling in other organs and the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grima-Reyes et al., 2021</xref>). One of the main examples of these interorgan exchange fluxes is the intestinal–renal axis, where glutamine metabolized by the small intestine is released as citrulline, which is then used by the kidneys to produce arginine for other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boelens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grima-Reyes et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with systemic production of arginine from isotopically labeled glutamine, we observed an enrichment of ~14% <sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-arginine and ~7% <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-arginine in the circulation of healthy and tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). For tissues whose sole source of arginine is uptake from the circulation, we expect the relative abundance of labeled arginine in the tissue would resemble that of the circulation. In line with this, the labeling pattern of arginine in non-ASS1 expressing healthy pancreas resembles the arginine labeling distribution found in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In contrast, there is a greater amount of labeled arginine in PDAC tumor tissue compared to plasma, with ~17% <sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub>-arginine and ~9% <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-arginine in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). While these non-steady-state isotope labeling experiments cannot allow us to infer the fraction of intratumoral arginine that arises from de novo synthesis in PDAC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buescher et al., 2015</xref>), the appearance of additional <sup>15</sup>N enrichment in intratumoral arginine that cannot be explained by circulating labeled arginine confirms active synthesis of arginine in PDAC tumors, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that PDAC tumors highly express ASS1. Lastly, we compared the concentration of amino acids including arginine in the IF of orthotopic murine PDAC tumors to the intratumoral arginine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). We observed that for most amino acids the intratumoral concentration was similar to the IF concentration. However, PDAC tumors had higher concentrations of free arginine than what is present in the TIF. Thus, we conclude that PDAC tumors accumulate higher levels of arginine than available from the local perfusate and that this is at least in part driven by de novo synthesis.</p><p>Lastly, given the importance of de novo arginine synthesis for arginine homeostasis of both mPDAC cells in TIFM and in orthotopic tumors, we asked if inhibiting de novo synthesis would impair PDAC tumor growth as loss of this pathway impairs mPDAC cell growth in TIFM. To test this, we generated orthotopic PDAC tumors with mPDAC3-TIFM <italic>Ass1</italic> KO cells and control cells where <italic>Ass1</italic> was re-expressed (<italic>Ass1</italic>KO; mASS1). We found that loss of <italic>Ass1</italic> did not affect tumor growth despite low levels of arginine in the TME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). These results suggest that, although arginine biosynthesis is active and upregulated in PDAC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2L</xref>), inhibiting this pathway is not detrimental for PDAC tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Enhanced uptake of environmental arginine allows PDAC cells to cope with inhibition of de novo arginine synthesis</title><p>Given that mPDAC cell proliferation in TIFM is not completely abrogated by inhibiting arginine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and that PDAC tumor growth is not significantly impaired by inhibition of this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>), we sought to understand how mPDAC cells adapt to the loss of arginine synthesis in arginine-deprived environments. We hypothesized that PDAC cells must compensate with other mechanisms to acquire arginine when synthesis is inhibited. In addition to de novo synthesis, there are two other known pathways for arginine acquisition by PDAC cells: macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Palm, 2019</xref>) and cationic amino acid transporter-mediated uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Closs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine how these pathways contribute to arginine homeostasis in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells.</p><p>To test if macropinocytosis is important for arginine homeostasis in mPDAC cells in TIFM, we generated mPDAC1-TIFM cells with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeting glycoprotein syndecan-1 (SDC1), an important mediator of macropinocytosis in PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Sdc1</italic> effectively reduced mPDAC1-TIFM macropinocytosis rate as measured by uptake and catabolism of fluorogenic bovine serum albumin (DQ-BSA), a model macropinocytosis substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>Sdc1</italic> knockdown did not affect intracellular arginine pools nor cell proliferation in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal protein breakdown with hydroxychloroquine similarly impairs mPDAC1-TIFM macropinocytosis rate without disrupting cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Sdc1</italic> did not further impair mPDAC cell proliferation upon inhibition of arginine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting macropinocytosis is also not critical for mPDAC cells upon inhibition of de novo arginine synthesis. Thus, we conclude that macropinocytosis does not contribute to mPDAC arginine homeostasis in TIFM, even as an adaptive mechanism upon de novo arginine synthesis inhibition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Enhanced uptake of environmental arginine allows pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells to cope with inhibition of de novo arginine synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative intracellular arginine levels of mPDAC1-TIFM cells infected with lentiviruses encoding a doxycycline-inducible <italic>Sdc1</italic> targeting shRNA or a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase targeting control shRNA (shRen) treated with 1 µg/ml doxycycline or vehicle (<italic>n</italic> = 6).

Thus, as with macropinocytosis, arginine uptake is not critical for mPDAC arginine homeostasis in TIFM conditions. We next tested if depriving mPDAC cells of the available microenvironmental arginine after de novo biosynthesis is impaired would affect mPDAC arginine homeostasis and growth. We found that inhibition of arginine synthesis in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells leads to increased transcription of arginine transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and leads to an increased rate of arginine uptake by mPDAC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

However, many biological findings and drug targets that arise from these cell-based studies fail to translate to cancer cells in vivo or in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Horvath et al., 2016</xref>). That cancer cells behave so differently in in vitro culture systems than when growing in tumors suggests that cancer cell behavior is not only cell-intrinsically encoded. Rather, cell-extrinsic cues in the TME are capable of dramatically influencing the cancer cell state and impacting many aspects of cancer cell biology, including therapy response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirata and Sahai, 2017</xref>). The importance of TME cues in regulating cancer cell behavior has prompted new efforts to develop cell-based models that incorporate key microenvironmental influences to both improve their disease relevance and fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Horvath et al., 2016</xref>) and enable mechanistic studies delineating how the microenvironment influences cancer cell biology.</p><p>We directly assessed the impact of the TME on the cellular state of murine PDAC cells by transcriptomic analysis. We found that the TME does indeed induce substantial changes in the transcriptional state of PDAC cells compared to PDAC cells in standard culture, consistent with the microenvironment being an important regulator of cancer cell biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Given that metabolism is highly interconnected with epigenetic regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chisolm and Weinmann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diehl and Muir, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Reid et al., 2017</xref>) and that cellular metabolism is intricately tied to nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elia and Fendt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Muir et al., 2018</xref>), we reasoned that physiological nutrient availability could have dramatic influences on cellular state and be a key microenvironmental factor influencing cancer cell biology. Indeed, we found that growth of PDAC cells in physiological nutrition caused substantial transcriptional reprogramming, pushing PDAC cells toward a more in vivo-like transcriptional state compared to non-physiological standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Thus, consistent with recent studies that have incorporated physiological nutrient levels into cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann and Tardito, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vande Voorde et al., 2019</xref>), we have found that modeling physiological nutrient availability substantially improves cell culture model fidelity. Thus, along with other efforts to improve the fidelity of cell culture models by incorporating microenvironmental factors such as bio-scaffolds enabling three-dimensional growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jensen and Teng, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pampaloni et al., 2007</xref>), we anticipate ensuring proper nutrient availability will be critical in the development of more physiologically relevant ex vivo cancer models, which will expand our ability to target cancer by enabling exploitation of microenvironmentally driven therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Metcalf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sela et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Arginine is a limiting nutrient in the PDAC microenvironment</title><p>Use of the TIFM model uncovered arginine biosynthesis as a metabolic pathway that PDAC cells use under TME nutrient conditions. Arginine biosynthesis is a metabolically costly process that utilizes intracellular aspartate, a limiting nutrient for tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>). Aspartate limitation that arises from arginine synthesis slows nucleotide production and, ultimately tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rabinovich et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, ASS1 acts as a metabolic tumor suppressor and is silenced in many tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), making the finding of PDAC cells synthesizing arginine initially surprising. Why would this tumor suppressive metabolic pathway be activated in PDAC?</p><p>Multiple studies have also shown that cancer cells reactivate ASS1 expression and arginine biosynthesis when extracellular arginine becomes limited to support tumor growth. For example, ASS1-silenced tumors treated with arginine deiminase to eliminate extracellular arginine acquire resistance to such therapy by reactivating ASS1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rogers and Van Tine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rogers et al., 2021</xref>). In another example, reactivation of arginine biosynthesis was shown to be necessary to support metastasis of clear cell renal cancers to the arginine limited lung environment, whereas arginine biosynthesis was not necessary and inactive in the arginine-replete primary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sciacovelli et al., 2022</xref>). Lastly, ATF4-CEBPβ-mediated upregulation of ASS1 upon amino acid stress has been shown to allow AML cells to adapt to low levels of microenvironmental arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crump et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that the tumor suppressive role of arginine biosynthesis is context dependent. In the context of microenvironmental arginine deprivation, ASS1 and arginine biosynthesis can switch their role to become tumor supportive. One of the most depleted nutrients in the PDAC TME is the amino acid arginine, which we previously observed was depleted ~20- to 50-fold from circulatory concentrations to only 2–5 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). Thus, we initially hypothesized that: (1) arginine deprivation in the PDAC TME would activate arginine biosynthesis, which (2) would be tumor promoting rather than tumor suppressive by enabling PDAC cells to maintain cellular arginine levels despite TME constraints.</p><p>However, our results suggest that the above model of arginine synthesis regulation and homeostasis in PDAC is far from complete. First, arginine deprivation is not the sole microenvironmental signal that leads to upregulation of arginine synthesis in PDAC tumors. Raising TME arginine levels by inhibiting myeloid arginase expression does not appear to modulate ASS1 expression or tumor arginine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). This strongly suggests that other TME cues aside from arginine deprivation drive expression of the arginine synthesis pathway. The fact that cells cultured in TIFM maintain expression of the arginine synthesis pathway suggests that other nutrient cue(s) may regulate expression of arginine synthesis genes. More work will be required to understand the TME cues that lead to arginine synthesis in vivo.</p><p>Second, in TIFM and in vivo, we found that PDAC cells synthesize arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1M, N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D, E, K</xref>), and that arginine synthesis is critical for PDAC arginine homeostasis and growth in TIFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). However, this pathway is dispensable for PDAC growth in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, PDAC tumors in vivo can adapt to loss of this pathway while PDAC cells in TIFM cannot. It remains unclear how PDAC tumors metabolically compensate for loss of arginine synthesis. We speculate PDAC tumors could adapt to arginine synthesis inhibition by some combination of the following metabolic mechanisms. In TIFM, we identified compensatory arginine uptake upon synthesis inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–H</xref>). Arginine uptake could not fully compensate for the lack of arginine synthesis but still allowed PDAC cells to survive and grow at diminished rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). It is possible that, in vivo, arginine uptake is further enhanced or is otherwise sufficient to enable PDAC tumors to grow unperturbed. In TIFM, we did not identify a role for macropinocytosis in arginine acquisition or maintaining PDAC viability and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This is in contrast to other studies that have identified a role for macropinocytosis in PDAC amino acid acquisition and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kamphorst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Palm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). However, other TME factors not included in the TIFM model such as hypoxia, activate macropinocytosis and render it more essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, macropinocytosis could play a more active role in maintaining arginine homeostasis and PDAC growth in vivo, enabling PDAC tumors to compensate for the lack of arginine synthesis. Lastly, the TIFM model lacks stromal cells, which have been shown to exchange macromolecules and nutrients with cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francescone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monterisi et al., 2022</xref>). Stromal-cancer cell metabolic exchange in vivo could potentially buffer the lack of arginine synthesis. More analysis will be required to understand the metabolic mechanisms that PDAC uses to maintain arginine homeostasis in the TME.</p><p>The lack of arginine in the TME can further have major impacts on stromal cells that may not have the adaptive capabilities of PDAC cells. For example, anti-tumor lymphocytes require arginine for functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geiger et al., 2016</xref>), but are not able to upregulate arginine biosynthesis upon arginine starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crump et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, microenvironmental arginine availability is known to limit immune responses in a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Murray, 2016</xref>). This has led to many recent efforts to develop pharmacological tools to increase TME arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canale et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Steggerda et al., 2017</xref>), which have improved immunotherapeutic outcomes in a variety of murine tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canale et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miret et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sosnowska et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Steggerda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the severe arginine restriction in the PDAC TME could be a major barrier to immunotherapy in this disease, which is refractory to most immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hilmi et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, low arginine availability does impair anti-tumor immunity in PDAC and raising TME arginine levels can improve tumor immune surveillance and response to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canè et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menjivar et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, arginine starvation is a key nutrient limitation that both PDAC and stromal cells face in the TME. De novo arginine synthesis and other adaptive mechanisms PDAC cells allow cancer cells to cope with such arginine starvation. However, other cell types without such adaptive capacity, such as lymphocytes, face dysfunction in the arginine-deprived TME. Future studies delineating how different cellular populations are affected by TME arginine starvation will prove critical to better understanding how tumor physiology impacts cancer and stromal cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Stromal control of microenvironmental nutrient conditions</title><p>We previously found that the TME is arginine depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). However, what drove arginine depletion in the TME was unknown. Here, we find that the arginase-1 expressing myeloid compartment in PDAC tumors is largely responsible for TME arginine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Menjivar et al. also found PDAC-associated myeloid cells are critical for mediating TME arginine depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menjivar et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the most striking nutrient perturbation in the TME is not driven by abnormal cancer cell metabolism, but is instead driven by stromal metabolic activity. This finding aligns with recent studies documenting the critical role of stromal cells in influencing nutrient availability in the TME. For example, in addition to the role we have found for myeloid cells in limiting TME arginine, myeloid cells were also found to be the major glucose consuming cell type in a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reinfeld et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, stromal myeloid cells may be key regulators of glucose availability in the TME. Fibroblasts have been shown to also regulate levels of key metabolites in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sherman et al., 2017</xref>), such as amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francescone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sousa et al., 2016</xref>) and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auciello et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, tumor innervating neurons were also shown to regulate availability of amino acids in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banh et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, future studies delineating the complex metabolic interactions among tumor and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li and Simon, 2020</xref>) will be critical to understanding how nutrient availability is regulated in the tumor ecosystem and how the resulting nutrient milieu impacts cancer and stromal cell metabolism and biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Formulation of TIFM</title><p>TIFM is composed of 115 nutrients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) at levels that match the average measurements in the IF of murine <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D/+</sup>; Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup> Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> PDAC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>).

To isolate cancer cells from these tumors, the tumors were chopped finely and digested with 30 mg/ml dipase II (Roche 28405100), 10 mg/ml collagenase I (Worthington LS004194), and 10 mg/ml DNase by constant rotation at 37°C for 30 min. Digestion was quenched with 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and cells were passed through a 70-µM filter and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before platting in RPMI-1640 (Corning 50-020-PC) or TIFM. YFP+ cancer cells from each tumor were sorted twice on a BD FACSAria II Cell Sorter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Use of cancer cell lines was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC no. 1560). All cell lines were tested quarterly for mycoplasma using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza LT07-318). All cells were cultured in Heracell vios 160i incubators (Thermo Fisher) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell lines were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 or TIFM supplemented with 10% diaFBS (Gibco, #26400-044, Lot#2244935P).</p><p>All cell culture was performed in static culture conditions. TIFM contains substantially lower levels of nutrients than most standard media formulations. Therefore, to ensure that there was not nutrient deprivation in static cultures, the following modifications to standard tissue culture practices were made. Cells were cultured in larger volumes of media (8 ml/35 mm diameter well) to prevent depletion of nutrients during the culture. Additionally, media were replaced every 24 hr. We routinely measured the concentration of the most rapidly consumed nutrient, glucose, using a GlucCell glucometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bechard et al., 2020</xref>) to ensure that cultures used in experiments did not experience a greater than 30% drop in glucose availability, which is within the range of mouse PDAC TIF glucose concentration measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sullivan et al., 2019a</xref>). Lastly, passaging TIFM maintained cells using standard trypsin (0.025%)/EDTA solution to detach cells leads to loss of viability upon replating of cells. Therefore, cells were detached with a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% trypsin–EDTA (Thermo Fisher) and serum-free RPMI-1640 media (Thermo Fisher). This allowed routine passaging and plating of cells with less loss of viability. These modifications were followed for both TIFM and RPMI cultured cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Determining cellular proliferation rate</title><p>Quantification of cellular proliferation rate was performed by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lien et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, 10,000–15,000 cells were plated in 12-well plates in triplicates for each condition and allowed to attach overnight. After attachment, one set of triplicate wells was fixed by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to the media and incubating plates in 4°C to provide an ‘initial day’ value. Media was changed on remaining cultures and were allowed to grow for the indicated number of days. At the end of the growth period, cells were fixed by adding 10% TCA to the media and incubating plates in 4°C for at least 1 hr. All wells were washed with deionized water, air-dried at room temperature, and stained with SRB in 1% acetic acid for 30 min. After, cells were washed with 1% acetic acid three times and dried at 30°C for 15 min. SRB dye was solubilized with 10 mM Tris pH 10.5 by gentle horizontal shaking for 5 min. Absorbance (abs) was measured at 510 nm in a clear 96-well plate using a BioTek Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader.

Staining coverage and intensity in the annotated regions were quantified using the Aperio Positive Pixel Count Algorithm (Leica Biosystems Imaging, Inc), unmodified. Briefly, to calculate staining coverage for each annotated region, the total amount of stain positive pixels (as defined by the algorithm) was counted and classified for Low, Medium or High Intensity. Each intensity group was assigned a relative numeric value (Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 3). The stain intensity value was then multiplied by the total number of positive pixels in each group, for each annotated region. The resulting values were then normalized to the total number of pixels in the analyzed region. These normalized staining intensity values were then averages for all analyzed regions in each histological sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received consulting fees from Astellas Pharmaceuticals, Odyssey Therapeutics, and T-Knife Therapeutics, and is an inventor on patents pertaining to Kras regulated metabolic pathways, redox control pathways in pancreatic cancer, and targeting the GOT1-pathway as a therapeutic approach (US Patent No: 2015126580-A1, 05/07/2015;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Gina M DeNicola as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ana Gomes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please improve the statistical analyses as indicated, and add relevant descriptions to figures for which they are missing. Please increase sample numbers if needed to support claims (e.g. where N &lt; 3).</p><p>2) Please improve clarity in the labeling of various graphs and the labeling patterns observed in various experiments, and other points re: clarity below.</p><p>3) Please provide ASS1 IHC staining on the KPC (flox) model you are using (rather than the Hingorani [R172H] model), and quantify IHC presented throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) Please modify title and claims or show causality between myeloid arginine depletion and arginine biosynthesis in the cancer cell compartment in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• In figure 1M the authors nicely show ASS1 staining in the human and mouse tumors. And in Figure 4 they show that depletion or inhibition of myeloid arginase can recover arginine within the microenvironment. Does this reduce ASS1 staining within the epithelial compartment? This experiment would nicely connect these two points in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the manuscript is well-written and reinforces a timely message that has previously been provided by other groups under different contexts, several concerns remain that could be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) The myeloid part does not seem to be the focus of this manuscript but rather that of the accompanying co-submitted manuscript (Apiz-Saab et al.). No evidence is provided for decreased arginine biosynthesis in tumors with myeloid-specific depletion of Arg1 where arginine levels are increased in the TME. To leave &quot;myeloid-driven&quot; in the title would require deeper analysis to robustly connect the mechanism i.e. arginine biosynthesis with the proposed cause that is myeloid cells. The authors could demonstrate that compared to KPC mice, PDAC tumors in LysM-Cre;Arg1fl/fl mice have decreased arginine biosynthesis, using an in vivo metabolic tracing assay and metabolic profiling similar to the ones conducted in Figure 2I-K.</p><p>2) Statistical significance is only shown for a few selected figure panels and is lacking in the vast majority of figures. All data plots should include statistics. For example: Figure 1D shows no stats; in Figure 2, stats are only shown for panel J. They are lacking in panels B, D, E, F, H, K. Same for Figure 2 Supplement 1; Figure 3 and Figure 3 Supplement 1. One-way or two-way ANOVA (for one or two variables, respectively) followed by a post-hoc test (e.g. Tukey or Bonferroni) should be conducted for plots including more than 2 groups. Two-way ANOVA should be conducted for Figure 3 Supplement 1B, C and E where 2 variables are involved: time and fluorescence.</p><p>3) Figure 1F x-axis title is confusing: the red data points represent genes upregulated in tumors (in vivo) and blue data points represent genes downregulated in tumors, as depicted; however, the minus sign before log2 would indicate the reverse. Was the sign added by mistake? Also, it would be helpful to write in Figure 1 Source Data 1 Excel file that the Fold Change is for Tumor over RPMI and not the reverse. Same comment for Figure 1 Source Data 3: please indicate in the legend that changes are TIFM over tumor.</p><p>4) Figure 1G and Figure 1 Supplement 2 are confusing; moreover, the legends do not clearly explain them (most legends in the manuscript should more specific); For example: For Figure 1G legend: &quot;GSEA of transcriptional differences between mPDAC3-TIFM cells cultured in TIFM or RPMI using custom gene sets from Figure 1F of those genes up and down in vivo&quot;.</p><p>The enriched gene sets, whether in Red (Up in vivo) or in Blue (Down in vivo) should align with enrichment in TIFM rather than RPMI. However, mPDAC3 cells in TIFM are listed on the left, only aligning with positively enriched gene sets but not aligning with negatively enriched gene sets (blue dip is on the right), where it seems that the RPMI condition is more similar to in vivo. The authors need to explain clearly what exactly the dual arrow at the bottom and the respective left and right positioning of TIFM and RPMI indicate. The red and blue bars at the bottom with gene lines are equally confusing in both figures.</p><p>5) Figure 1M: the authors should perform IHC on the mouse model (KPC) they are using and ideally also stain human samples (if possible). It is unusual to include other groups' previously published data in an original manuscript's main figures (murine top panels). This is especially relevant as the referenced article (Hingorani et al., 2003) used a different model than the one used by the authors: mutant p53 (LSL-KRasG12D; LSL-p53R172H) rather than p53 loss (LSL-KRasG12D; p53fl/fl). It is unclear why the authors did not stain samples from the KPC model.</p><p>6) Figure 2B: as mentioned above, statistical significance is lacking; Thus to claim on line 211 that &quot;TIFM cells consumed citrulline and ornithine at levels higher than their uptake of arginine&quot;, statistical significance needs to be shown; ANOVA followed by post-hoc test would need to be performed here given that 3 groups are represented. With the very high variability in uptake of ornithine, a difference is unlikely to be detected.</p><p>7) Throughout the manuscript, most assays are performed with a low n number (n = 3), making it hard to assess significance. Increasing sample number (for ex. in point 6 above) would make the data more rigorous.</p><p>8) Figure 1C is incorrect with regards to tracing 15N2 glutamine into aspartate and should be corrected (remove the TCA here, does not apply). Aspartate does not get its nitrogen from glutamine through the TCA cycle (it can only potentially get its carbons via the TCA).</p><p>The only 2 ways that arginine can get its nitrogens from glutamine are:</p><p>I- via aspartate transamination (catalyzed by GOT<sub>1/2</sub>), where the glutamate nitrogen is transferred to oxaloacetate (OAA) to generate aspartate and α-ketoglutatate (a-KG); The carbon backbone of aspartate comes from OAA (Not glutamine/glutamate) and glutamate carbons go to a-KG.</p><p>II- Ammonia generated from glutaminolysis and/or from glutamate deamination can integrate into carbamoyl phosphate (CPS1 reaction) and condense with ornithine to generate citrulline (OTC reaction) in the urea cycle. Thus unlabeled or labelled aspartate (from transamination) can condense with unlabeled or labeled citrulline (from 15N-Ammonia) to generate arginine M0, M1 (most abundant labelled species); M2 (less abundant to have both simultaneous events); or through subsequent cycles, M3 (even less abundant) or M4 arginine (most rare), as depicted in Figure 2J.</p><p>9) Figure 2D and Figure 2 Supplement 1A: the reader is left at odds trying to understand why the labeling patterns are different for M+2 to M+6 in the different PDAC cell lines; especially for mPDAC3 where significant labeling is detected with only 2, 3, 4 (in addition to 6) carbons, as compared to the expected M+5. The authors should explain/clarify at least in the figure legends, if not in the text. This is puzzling because the ornithine produced from the catabolism of the labeled arginine (following its synthesis from labeled 13C5-citrulline) would retain all 5 labeled carbons, while losing the unlabeled carbon to urea. So a second cycle of arginine synthesis from the C5 labeled ornithine would not lead to a M4 arginine and so on and so forth (M3, M3, M1) for following cycles.</p><p>10) Figure 3 Supplement 1G, x-axis labels: are cit/orn and arg labels swapped here? If these panels are similar to Figure 3H but the assay is performed in different mPDAC cell lines, then they must be swapped…Otherwise, this brings up many questions as to why arginine deprivation affects cell growth in mPDAC2 and 3 but not in mPDAC1 (Figure 3E).</p><p>11) It is also confusing why arginine deprivation does not affect the growth of mPDAC1 cells in Figure 3E but it does affect their growth even when the cells express ASS1 in Figure 2H?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As noted above, there are some weaknesses in the manuscript that could be addressed experimentally to strengthen the impact and conclusions of this body of work. Specifically:</p><p>1) The experiments evaluating growth rate in TIFM versus RPMI are interesting, especially when cells are switched from one media to another. It would also strengthen the manuscript if similar experiments are performed in TIFM where arginine concentration is increased to RPMI levels and where arginine in RPMI levels has been decreased to TIFM levels. Similarly, can cells that overexpress ASS1 bypass the growth defect when moved from RPMI to TIFM?</p><p>2) Isotope tracing analysis in vivo would be strengthened if also done with citrulline directly, considering that authors conclude from in vitro experiments that citrulline is the rate-limiting substrate for arginine production by the cancer cells.</p><p>3) Evaluation of tumor burden in vivo in orthotopic tumors in cells with ASS1 KO should be provided to assert arginine production as a metabolic liability of pancreatic cancer. Similarly, arginine concentration in TIF versus tumors with ASS1 KO should be measured.</p><p>4) Western blot for SDC1 should be provided to evaluate knockdown efficiency as mRNA levels do not faithfully recapitulate the effects of shRNA at the protein level.</p><p>5) If strong conclusions are to be made about the contribution of macropinocytosis to arginine levels in pancreatic tumor cells, in vivo evaluation is required.</p><p>6) In Figure 3 supplement 1F citrulline/ornithine addition can rescue arginine levels, but it leads to suppression of growth rate in the absence of external arginine in Figure 3 supplement 1G. It is unclear why this is the case and a more thorough discussion should be provided to reconcile these findings. Could this be because of co-transport of arginine with other amino acids?

To determine if arginine deprivation in the PDAC TME <italic>causes</italic> PDAC arginine synthesis, we performed two experiments suggested by reviewers.

And in Figure 4 they show that depletion or inhibition of myeloid arginase can recover arginine within the microenvironment. Does this reduce ASS1 staining within the epithelial compartment? This experiment would nicely connect these two points in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. As noted in the response to essential revision 4, we assessed ASS1 expression by IHC staining in the orthotopic tumors from <italic>LysM-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (high TME arginine) and <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (control, low TME arginine) hosts.

In light of this finding, we have modified our text to avoid any claims of myeloid arginine stress <italic>causing</italic> PDAC arginine biosynthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the manuscript is well-written and reinforces a timely message that has previously been provided by other groups under different contexts, several concerns remain that could be addressed by the authors:</p><p>1) The myeloid part does not seem to be the focus of this manuscript but rather that of the accompanying co-submitted manuscript (Apiz-Saab et al.). No evidence is provided for decreased arginine biosynthesis in tumors with myeloid-specific depletion of Arg1 where arginine levels are increased in the TME. To leave &quot;myeloid-driven&quot; in the title would require deeper analysis to robustly connect the mechanism i.e. arginine biosynthesis with the proposed cause that is myeloid cells. The authors could demonstrate that compared to KPC mice, PDAC tumors in LysM-Cre;Arg1fl/fl mice have decreased arginine biosynthesis, using an in vivo metabolic tracing assay and metabolic profiling similar to the ones conducted in Figure 2I-K.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. To address this, as explained in detail in essential revision 4, we performed <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine tracing in orthotopic PDAC tumor bearing <italic>LysM-Cre<sup>+/+-</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. We did not observe significant differences in argininosuccinate or arginine labeling in PDAC tumors from these two different hosts (Figure 4 Supplement 3).

All data plots should include statistics. For example: Figure 1D shows no stats; in Figure 2, stats are only shown for panel J. They are lacking in panels B, D, E, F, H, K. Same for Figure 2 Supplement 1; Figure 3 and Figure 3 Supplement 1. One-way or two-way ANOVA (for one or two variables, respectively) followed by a post-hoc test (e.g. Tukey or Bonferroni) should be conducted for plots including more than 2 groups. Two-way ANOVA should be conducted for Figure 3 Supplement 1B, C and E where 2 variables are involved: time and fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and the specific suggestions for statistical analyses. We have included statistical analysis for all figures where two or more conditions are compared, including those suggested by the reviewer. The statistical tests employed and sample size are now clearly described in each figured legend as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F x-axis title is confusing: the red data points represent genes upregulated in tumors (in vivo) and blue data points represent genes downregulated in tumors, as depicted; however, the minus sign before log2 would indicate the reverse. Was the sign added by mistake? Also, it would be helpful to write in Figure 1 Source Data 1 Excel file that the Fold Change is for Tumor over RPMI and not the reverse. Same comment for Figure 1 Source Data 3: please indicate in the legend that changes are TIFM over tumor.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for pointing out this error. Indeed, the Figure 1F x-title was mistakenly labelled as -log2. This has now been corrected in the figure. The relevant comparisons for Figure 1 Source Data 1 and Figure 1 Source Data 3 have also been clarified in the Supplementary files and corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1G and Figure 1 Supplement 2 are confusing; moreover, the legends do not clearly explain them (most legends in the manuscript should more specific); For example: For Figure 1G legend: &quot;GSEA of transcriptional differences between mPDAC3-TIFM cells cultured in TIFM or RPMI using custom gene sets from Figure 1F of those genes up and down in vivo&quot;.</p><p>The enriched gene sets, whether in Red (Up in vivo) or in Blue (Down in vivo) should align with enrichment in TIFM rather than RPMI. However, mPDAC3 cells in TIFM are listed on the left, only aligning with positively enriched gene sets but not aligning with negatively enriched gene sets (blue dip is on the right), where it seems that the RPMI condition is more similar to in vivo. The authors need to explain clearly what exactly the dual arrow at the bottom and the respective left and right positioning of TIFM and RPMI indicate. The red and blue bars at the bottom with gene lines are equally confusing in both figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Below we address each point the reviewer brings up:</p><p>– “The authors need to explain clearly what exactly the dual arrow at the bottom and the respective left and right positioning of TIFM and RPMI indicate”.</p><p>The x-axis in Figure 1G is a gene list ranked using the t-statistic metric for differential expression calculated with limma for the differential expression analysis of mPDAC3TIFM cells growing in TIFM versus in RPMI (TIFM/RPMI). Those genes with lowest rank are those most significantly overexpressed in TIFM and are on the left. Those genes on the right are those that are most significantly overexpressed in RPMI. To indicate this clearly, we have relabeled the axis appropriately and described the ranking system in the figure legend in both Figure 1G-H and Figure 1 Supplement 2. We also split Figure 1G into two panels to make this figure easier to read.</p><p>– “The enriched gene sets, whether in Red (Up in vivo) or in Blue (Down in vivo) should align with enrichment in TIFM rather than RPMI. However, mPDAC3 cells in TIFM are listed on the left, only aligning with positively enriched gene sets but not aligning with negatively enriched gene sets (blue dip is on the right), where it seems that the RPMI condition is more similar to in vivo.”</p><p>As described above, the x-axis for Figure 1G was ranked based on t-statistic for gene expression of TIFM versus RPMI cultured mPDAC3 cells (TIFM/RPMI). So, the negative NES of the ‘down in vivo gene set’ suggests TIFM cultured cells downregulate the same genes that mPDAC cells suppress in vivo, that is they are more similar to in vivo. We believe that including both the positive enrichment for ‘up in vivo genes’ and negative enrichment for ‘down in vivo genes’ in the same panel for the comparison of TIFM versus RPMI cultured cells is confusing this important point. So, we have separated Figure 1G into two new panels. Figure 1G now shows positive enrichment of ‘up in vivo’ genes in TIFM compared to RPMI cultured cells, while Figure 1H now shows negative enrichment of ‘up in vivo’ genes in TIFM compared to RPMI cultured cells. We similarly separated Figure 1 Supplement 2 into two separate plots. We hope these changes improve the clarity of the figure and more effectively communicate that with regard to genes both upregulated and downregulated in vivo, mPDAC cells in TIFM better recapitulate those transcriptional behaviors that cells in RPMI.</p><p>– “The red and blue bars at the bottom with gene lines are equally confusing in both figures.”</p><p>The bar plots in the bottom of the figure show where individual members of the indicated gene set appear in the ranking of TIFM/RPMI differentially expressed genes. To make this clearer, we have explained this in detail in the figure legends of both Figure 1G-H and Figure 1 Supplement 2.</p><p>– “(most legends in the manuscript should more specific)”</p><p>We have updated all legends in the manuscript to be more specific in regard to experimental conditions and statistical analyses performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1M: the authors should perform IHC on the mouse model (KPC) they are using and ideally also stain human samples (if possible). It is unusual to include other groups' previously published data in an original manuscript's main figures (murine top panels). This is especially relevant as the referenced article (Hingorani et al., 2003) used a different model than the one used by the authors: mutant p53 (LSL-KRasG12D; LSL-p53R172H) rather than p53 loss (LSL-KRasG12D; p53fl/fl). It is unclear why the authors did not stain samples from the KPC model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation and apologize for any confusion regarding the origin of the data. The murine samples in Figure 1M were generated by our group and the reference in the figure legend was only to provide a reference for that detailed the particular PDAC animal model we were analyzing in Figure 1M. Still, as addressed in essential revision 3, we have now analyzed ASS1 expression by IHC staining for PDAC tumors from <italic>Kras<sup>LSL</sup>G12D flox/flox CreER ;Trp53;Ptf1a</italic> mice. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s request to provide ASS1 staining in a more relevant animal model.</p><p>Additionally, in our previous submission, we used ASS1 IHC data from human PDAC and pancreas samples from the Human Protein Atlas, which is is allowed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 International License (https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/licence). Nevertheless, we have also obtained human PDAC and untransformed pancreas specimens and performed ASS1 IHC staining and quantification of these samples (Figure 1N). Our own findings confirm the increased ASS1 expression we previously observed in the Human Protein Atlas data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2B: as mentioned above, statistical significance is lacking; Thus to claim on line 211 that &quot;TIFM cells consumed citrulline and ornithine at levels higher than their uptake of arginine&quot;, statistical significance needs to be shown; ANOVA followed by post-hoc test would need to be performed here given that 3 groups are represented. With the very high variability in uptake of ornithine, a difference is unlikely to be detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. To address this point as well as point 7 raised by the reviewer below, we have repeated this experiment with an increased sample size (n of 6 instead of n of 3). With this increased sample size, we have substantially improved the precision of our measurements and confirmed that citrulline and arginine are taken up by TIFM cultured cells. The increased precision also let us determine that ornithine is released rather than consumed by PDAC cells in TIFM, which aligns with other results that suggest that extracellular citrulline, and not ornithine is the main substrate for arginine biosynthesis (Figure 2 Supplement 1 E-F). We have also included appropriate statistical analysis, which is described in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Throughout the manuscript, most assays are performed with a low n number (n = 3), making it hard to assess significance. Increasing sample number (for ex. in point 6 above) would make the data more rigorous.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased sample numbers for the following experiments with a small sample sizes: Figure 1B, Figure 2B, Figure 2 S1B and Figure 2 S1C. We have also increased sample sizes in experiments in which minor trends could be observed but the difference between conditions was found to not be statistically significant (Figure 3A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1C is incorrect with regards to tracing 15N2 glutamine into aspartate and should be corrected (remove the TCA here, does not apply). Aspartate does not get its nitrogen from glutamine through the TCA cycle (it can only potentially get its carbons via the TCA).</p><p>The only 2 ways that arginine can get its nitrogens from glutamine are:</p><p>I- via aspartate transamination (catalyzed by GOT<sub>1/2</sub>), where the glutamate nitrogen is transferred to oxaloacetate (OAA) to generate aspartate and α-ketoglutatate (a-KG); The carbon backbone of aspartate comes from OAA (Not glutamine/glutamate) and glutamate carbons go to a-KG.</p><p>II- Ammonia generated from glutaminolysis and/or from glutamate deamination can integrate into carbamoyl phosphate (CPS1 reaction) and condense with ornithine to generate citrulline (OTC reaction) in the urea cycle. Thus unlabeled or labelled aspartate (from transamination) can condense with unlabeled or labeled citrulline (from 15N-Ammonia) to generate arginine M0, M1 (most abundant labelled species); M2 (less abundant to have both simultaneous events); or through subsequent cycles, M3 (even less abundant) or M4 arginine (most rare), as depicted in Figure 2J.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify presentation of our tracing schematics, we have divided Figure 1C into two panels. One panel (Figure 1C) depicts <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-citrulline carbon tracing into arginine. The other panel now depicts the pathways the reviewer describes above for how nitrogen from <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine is incorporated into arginine (Figure 1J). We thank the reviewer for correcting this error in our schematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 2D and Figure 2 Supplement 1A: the reader is left at odds trying to understand why the labeling patterns are different for M+2 to M+6 in the different PDAC cell lines; especially for mPDAC3 where significant labeling is detected with only 2, 3, 4 (in addition to 6) carbons, as compared to the expected M+5. The authors should explain/clarify at least in the figure legends, if not in the text. This is puzzling because the ornithine produced from the catabolism of the labeled arginine (following its synthesis from labeled 13C5-citrulline) would retain all 5 labeled carbons, while losing the unlabeled carbon to urea. So a second cycle of arginine synthesis from the C5 labeled ornithine would not lead to a M4 arginine and so on and so forth (M3, M3, M1) for following cycles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, there no known metabolic route by which citrulline carbon could generate arginine isotopomers of M+2, M+3, M+4, M+6. Due to limited sensitivity and low mass accuracy of our GC-MS method to detect arginine, we speculated that these our detection of these isotopomers could arise from analytical artifacts. To address this, we repeated these isotope tracing experiments on a high resolution LC-MS instrument and scaling up the number of cells per sample to increase the amount of analyte for these measurements. With this new analytical approach, we now only find significant enrichment for the expected M+0 and M+5 arginine isotopomers for intracellular arginine. This suggests that the labelling patterns included in the previous results were likely an artifact of GC-MS analysis of arginine isotopomers. We have replaced Figure 2D and Figure 2 Supplement 1A in the manuscript with the new LC-MS data. LC-MS analysis also enabled us to detect argininosuccinate, whose labeling pattern we also now describe in (Figure 2 D-E and Figure 2 Supplement 1 A-B), which is consistent with arginine biosynthesis being active in these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 3 Supplement 1G, x-axis labels: are cit/orn and arg labels swapped here? If these panels are similar to Figure 3H but the assay is performed in different mPDAC cell lines, then they must be swapped…Otherwise, this brings up many questions as to why arginine deprivation affects cell growth in mPDAC2 and 3 but not in mPDAC1 (Figure 3E).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out this mistake. The x-axis labels in Figure 3 Supplement 1G were indeed swapped. We have corrected these labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It is also confusing why arginine deprivation does not affect the growth of mPDAC1 cells in Figure 3E but it does affect their growth even when the cells express ASS1 in Figure 2H?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the difference in growth rate between mPDAC1 cells in Figure 3E and the mPDAC1-ASS1KO;mASS1 in Figure 2 are intriguing. We speculate that the difference in cellular growth rate in response to arginine deprivation arises from the single cell cloning process that ASS1KO cells underwent to ensure that ASS1 is homogenously knocked out across the cell population. Such single cell cloning procedures can lead to differences between the clonal and parental cell line (Panda et al. 2022), which could potentially explain this difference in response to arginine depletion from TIFM. For this reason, we have generated an ASS1 re-expression cell line from the ASS1KO clonal line for comparison, rather than comparing to the parental mPDAC1 cell line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As noted above, there are some weaknesses in the manuscript that could be addressed experimentally to strengthen the impact and conclusions of this body of work. Specifically:</p><p>1) The experiments evaluating growth rate in TIFM versus RPMI are interesting, especially when cells are switched from one media to another. It would also strengthen the manuscript if similar experiments are performed in TIFM where arginine concentration is increased to RPMI levels and where arginine in RPMI levels has been decreased to TIFM levels. Similarly, can cells that overexpress ASS1 bypass the growth defect when moved from RPMI to TIFM?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these experiments would be interesting and help determine if ability to synthesize arginine is a metabolic adaptation to TME nutrient stress that is lost in standard culture conditions. We measured the growth rate of mPDAC1-RPMI cells after changing their media to TIFM, TIFM + 100uM arginine or RPMI. We again find that switching mPDAC1-RPMI cells to TIFM detrimentally affects cell growth. Interestingly, supplementation with arginine alone results in a near complete rescue of cell growth. This suggests that arginine deprivation at least partially explains the inability of mPDAC-RPMI cells to grow in TIFM. These results are now included in Figure 2 Supplement 2.</p><p>Additionally, we tried to lentivirally express ASS1 in mPDAC-RPMI cells with the same CMVdriven vector system for ASS1 expression used to express ASS1 in mPDAC-TIFM cells in Figure 2H-I. Unfortunately, lentivirally transformed mPDAC-RPMI cells grew extremely slowly and the cells we did eventually isolate did not express detectable levels of ASS1. This is consistent with results demonstrating that ASS1 acts as a tumor suppressor of cancer cells grown in standard media whose expression impairs cell growth (Rabinovich et al. 2015). Thus, we were not able to perform these experiments. Nevertheless, on the basis of arginine supplementation experiments now described in Figure 2 Supplement 2, we believe that mPDAC-RPMI cells cannot grow in TIFM due to limited arginine in this media. We speculate may be due to selection for loss of ASS1 expression. These results and interpretation are now described in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Isotope tracing analysis in vivo would be strengthened if also done with citrulline directly, considering that authors conclude from in vitro experiments that citrulline is the rate-limiting substrate for arginine production by the cancer cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that such citrulline tracing experiments would be quite interesting. However, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-citrulline isotope tracing has not been widely used to study arginine metabolism in animal models of cancer. Therefore, such experiments would require substantial preliminary investigation to optimize the tracing parameters to enable arginine tracing while not impacting physiological metabolism. We think developing such a method would be an interesting line of investigation and a valuable resource for the field, but believe developing such a method is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Evaluation of tumor burden in vivo in orthotopic tumors in cells with ASS1 KO should be provided to assert arginine production as a metabolic liability of pancreatic cancer. Similarly, arginine concentration in TIF versus tumors with ASS1 KO should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We generated orthotopic PDAC tumors with mPDAC3-TIFM <italic>Ass1</italic>KO cells and <italic>Ass1</italic> expressing controls (<italic>Ass1</italic>KO; mASS1). We found that KO of <italic>Ass1</italic> had no effect on tumor growth despite low levels of arginine in the TME (Figure 2 Supplement 1G-H). Given these results, we have removed any assertions in the manuscript that arginine production is a metabolic requirement of pancreatic cancers. We have now also included in the Discussion commentary on 2 potential reasons why PDAC tumors can overcome inhibition of arginine synthesis: adaptation to enhance arginine scavenging by uptake or macropinocytosis or interactions in the TME (such as cellular metabolic crosstalk) that we do not model in TIFM that can buffer loss of arginine synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Western blot for SDC1 should be provided to evaluate knockdown efficiency as mRNA levels do not faithfully recapitulate the effects of shRNA at the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that shRNA knockdown evaluation by qPCR does not always faithfully recapitulate the effects of the shRNA at the protein level. However, evaluating the knockdown efficiency of SDC1 through immunoblotting is challenging due to substantial glycosylation of this protein that makes resolution by SDS-PAGE difficult. Therefore, we have assessed SDC1 knockdown both by qPCR and functionally by monitoring DQ-BSA catabolism. Given the concordance between the qPCR and functional assay, we believe there is sufficient evidence that SDC1 expression is being impaired by the shRNA in mPDAC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) If strong conclusions are to be made about the contribution of macropinocytosis to arginine levels in pancreatic tumor cells, in vivo evaluation is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, recent findings by GarciaBermudez et al. (Garcia-Bermudez et al. 2022) show that hypoxia activates macropinocytosis in PDAC. These findings suggest that we may not have a key microenvironmental trigger of macropinocytosis in our TIFM model and thus could underestimate the role that process could play in arginine homeostasis in PDAC. Therefore, we have edited the text to make it clear that we have only demonstrated that macropinocytosis does not play a role in TIFM but that other TME cues could activate this pathway and lead it to play a larger role in PDAC arginine homeostasis in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3 supplement 1F citrulline/ornithine addition can rescue arginine levels, but it leads to suppression of growth rate in the absence of external arginine in Figure 3 supplement 1G. It is unclear why this is the case and a more thorough discussion should be provided to reconcile these findings. Could this be because of co-transport of arginine with other amino acids? In addition, these two measurements are performed in different cell lines, which can influence the results. It would be good if the authors perform both measurements (intracellular arginine concentration and growth rate) in mPDAC1, mPDAC2 and mPDAC3 for direct comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this discrepancy. As noted above, the x-axis in Figure 3 Supplement 1G was mistakenly labelled. We have corrected these labels to reflect the appropriate conditions. Thus, in all three mPDAC cell lines test, citrulline and ornithine removal lowers mPDAC arginine levels and growth rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Statistical analysis should be done in every data set and reported for each panel in each figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this recommendation. As noted above in our response to essential revision 2, we have included statistical analyses for all figures with a detailed explanation of the statistical analysis provided in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Quantification of IHC staining should also be provided in addition to the representative image shown in the current version of the manuscript and ASS1 IHC provided in figure 4D to evaluate if depletion of myeloid cells and increase in TIF arginine suppresses ASS1 induction in PDAC.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response above to essential revision 3, we have updated and quantified all IHC analysis across the manuscript. Similarly, as noted above in our response to essential revision 4<bold>,</bold> we have performed ASS1 IHC staining in the orthotopic tumors from <italic>LysM-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>;Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and control (<italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) mice. We found no difference in ASS1 expression between conditions (Figure 4 Supplement 2). Therefore, we have also changed the text to remove any assertion that myeloid arginine depletion <italic>causes</italic> de novo arginine synthesis in PDAC tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Lastly, it would be nice to evaluate if co-culture of pancreatic cancer cells with myeloid cells in RPMI media can recapitulate the effects of TIFM on tumor cell growth rate and arginine levels both intracellularly and in the media.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree such co-culture experiments would be interesting. Such experiments would require substantial investment to design co-culture systems where macrophages and cancer cells could be grown together while lowering arginine levels to those measured physiologically in the microenvironment. We are interested in developing such systems, but think developing such a system is beyond the scope of this current manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Garcia-Bermudez, Javier, Michael A.
