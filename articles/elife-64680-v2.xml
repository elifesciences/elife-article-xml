This phenomenon of time-dependent parental care is observed in biparental mammals, as well as more widely throughout the animal kingdom, such as insects, fish, and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elwood, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying parental behavior and uncovered specific circuit nodes and neuronal populations mediating the positive control of parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stagkourakis et al., 2020</xref>). However, the existence of a similar circuit organization to control infant-directed aggression and the relationship between such pathway and that of adult-mediated aggression have not yet been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tachikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsuneoka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2020</xref>). Using induction of the immediate early gene (IEG) <italic>Fos</italic> as a molecular readout of neuronal activation after interaction with pups, we found that <italic>urocortin-3</italic> (<italic>Ucn3</italic>)-expressing neurons in the perifornical area (PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic>) of the hypothalamus are activated during infant-directed attacks in male and female mice, but not during other forms of aggression. Inhibition of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons in virgin males suppresses infant-directed aggression, while activation of these cells in virgin females disrupts parental behavior. We determined the input and output organization of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons and showed that optogenetic activation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> axon terminals in specific target regions, that is, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), ventral lateral septum (LSv), and amygdalohippocampal area (AHi), triggers different aspects of infant-directed agonistic responses, such as neglect, repulsion, and aggression. Based on their function and connectivity, PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons help define a new brain pathway mediating the specific expression of infant-directed neglect and aggression. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the control of opposite behaviors toward infants according to an animal’s sex and physiological status.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Urocortin-3-</italic>expressing cells in the perifornical area are specifically activated during infant-directed aggression</title><p>To identify neuronal populations involved in infant-directed aggression, we monitored the induction of the IEG <italic>Fos</italic> across brain regions involved in social behavior control, that is, the hypothalamus and septal and amygdaloid nuclei, in infanticidal virgin males, fathers and mothers after interactions with pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

This is in agreement with previous studies describing specific expression of <italic>Ucn3</italic> in the PeFA, as well as in few other brain regions such as the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBNST), the MPOA, the medial amygdala, and the nucleus ambiguus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venihaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wittmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deussing et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, <italic>Ucn3</italic> displayed the highest colocalization with <italic>Fos</italic>+ cells after infanticide (55.3% <italic>Fos</italic>+ cells co-express <italic>Ucn3</italic>) compared to <italic>Avp</italic> (7.5% <italic>Fos</italic>+ cells co-express <italic>Avp;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Significant expression overlap was also seen between <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Trh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with a previous report of co-expression of <italic>Ucn3</italic> and <italic>Trh</italic> by large fractions of PeFA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wittmann et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, few neurons active during infanticide were marked by <italic>Gal</italic> (20.8%), a marker that is highly co-expressed with <italic>Fos</italic> (42.8%), as detected by our microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and pS6 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B), but that labels only a very small subset of PeFA neurons. Another candidate marker, <italic>Oxt</italic>, did not colocalize significantly with <italic>Fos</italic> in mice that committed infanticide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and may have been mistakenly identified due to its high level of expression in this region of the hypothalamus. Quantification of <italic>Ucn3</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> colocalization across the entire PeFA revealed that while <italic>Ucn3</italic>+ cells are found throughout the PeFA, <italic>Ucn3</italic>+/<italic>Fos</italic>+ neurons identified after infant-directed attack are located primarily in the rostral half of the PeFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the activity of <italic>Ucn3</italic>+ PeFA neurons (PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic>) neurons was specifically associated with infant-directed agonistic interactions or was more generally increased by aggressive displays. We found that a significant number of PeFA neurons were activated by pup-directed attack in virgin males and females as well as by acute stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; green dots). However, remarkably, when looking specifically at the <italic>Ucn3</italic>+ subpopulation in PeFA, <italic>Fos</italic> expression was only significantly induced in PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons after pup-directed attacks by virgin males compared to fresh bedding exposure. A trend was also observed in infanticidal virgin females, resulting from the analysis of three rare infanticidal mice seen out of a large group of otherwise non-aggressive virgin females. Strikingly, no <italic>Fos</italic> induction was observed in PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons after other forms of aggression such as maternal defense, inter-male aggression, and predation, nor by stress or feeding, suggesting a specific role of this population in infant-directed aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>; yellow bars). In addition, while <italic>Ucn3+</italic> cells did not express <italic>Fos</italic> in lactating females after exposure to pups, a non-statistically significant trend toward activation of <italic>Ucn3+</italic> neurons in virgin females that either attacked or retrieved pups was observed, suggesting some engagement of this population in virgin states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). No sex or state-dependent difference was observed in the number of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons in virgin or mated males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and most PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<italic>Vglut2</italic>, or <italic>Slc17a6;</italic> 91.3% ± 1.2%) suggesting an excitatory function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We conclude from these data that pup-directed aggression, but no other forms of adult aggression or other behaviors, specifically activates excitatory <italic>Ucn3</italic>+ neurons of the rostral PeFA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inhibition of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuronal activity in virgin males blocks infanticide</title><p>To test if PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuronal activity is required for the display of male infanticide, we used a conditional viral strategy to express the inhibitory opsin NpHR3.0, or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), in PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons and implanted bilateral optical fibers above the PeFA of virgin males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> silencing did not affect motor activity and, importantly, did not reduce adult intruder-directed aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Hence, all sessions were started with the laser ON condition in both experimental and control groups, followed by laser OFF in the second session, and back to laser ON in third session (see Materials and methods). As expected, control females improved their parenting from session to session, with more pups retrieved and with shorter latencies in each subsequent session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). By contrast, optogenetic stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons reduced female parenting with fewer pups collected and with longer latencies in the third session compared to first (laser ON) and second (laser OFF) sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Further, the duration of parental behaviors, investigation bout length, and time spent in the nest with pups were significantly reduced in the third compared to earlier sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), and fewer females in the ChR2 group retrieved pups to the nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons were also shown to share common targets with PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons, such as AHi, LS, and VMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). Activation of MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons has been shown to robustly, reversibly, and acutely enhance parental behavior in virgin females and fathers and to suppress ongoing infant-directed aggression in virgin males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). In our experiments, MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons are likely to be strongly activated in females exposed to pups, thus presumably exerting their putative inhibitory role on PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons and their projections, therefore occluding the full expression of pup-directed agonistic behavior following artificial activation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons in females but less so when more direct activation is provided to PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuronal projections to AHi. Further investigation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuron function while MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neuron activity is inhibited will be necessary to address this hypothesis.</p><p>Inhibition of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons has a robust effect to suppress ongoing infant-directed attack behavior, but unlike MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neuron stimulation, this effect appears long-lasting and does not reverse in the short term. We interpret this result as indicating that suppression of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuron activity induces downstream circuit plasticity that favors the stable expression of parenting and inhibition of pup-mediated aggression. Indeed, we attempted to activate PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons in mothers and fathers in pilot experiments and were unable to observe increased neglect or aggression, suggesting that PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuron activation cannot overcome the MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> circuit activity in parental animals.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the PeFA leads to a so-called ‘hypothalamic rage response’ comprising typical aggressive displays including piloerection, teeth baring, and bite attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slotnick et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kruk et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canteras et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, we observe <italic>Fos</italic>+ neurons in the PVH and PeFA of males and females displaying conspecific aggression, but these neurons are <italic>Ucn3</italic>-negative, suggesting that distinct PeFA populations mediate aggression toward either adults or infants. In addition, previous studies have implicated <italic>Ucn3</italic> in the PeFA in the regulation of social recognition, stress responsivity, and, more recently, risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venihaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deussing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuperman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horii-Hayashi et al., 2021</xref>). However, our experiments with targeted inhibition or stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons specifically affected parental behavior with no impact on adult social behavior, indicating that PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons may be specifically tuned to social cues from infants and/or juveniles rather than adult conspecifics.</p><p>Specific tuning of these neurons to social cues is supported by our finding that input areas to PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons include the MPOA, MeA, and PVH, known to be essential for integration of social cues sensed by the vomeronasal system that has been well-established as a crucial pathway for infanticide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tachikawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons directly send input to PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons, suggesting a direct relationship between this well-established hub for pro-parental behavior and the putative infant-directed aggression neuron population described here. Inputs from PVH largely express <italic>Avp</italic> and <italic>Crh</italic>, and <italic>Avp</italic>-expressing PVH neurons have previously been implicated in male-typical social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donaldson and Young, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Insel, 2010</xref>), while <italic>Crh</italic>-expressing PVH neurons are essential mediators of the physiological stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vale et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previously identified hypothalamic neuronal populations critical for feeding (e.g., <italic>Agrp</italic>-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus) and parenting (MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons) have been shown to be organized in distinct pools, each largely projecting to a distinct downstream area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, individual PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons project to multiple targets, in a similar manner to VMH neurons extending collaterals to downstream defensive circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the three major PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> target areas VMH, LS, and AHi convey overlapping but distinct aspects and degrees of infant-directed neglect and aggression. Our recording data suggests that PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> projections make direct excitatory functional connections with the neuronal populations of LS, VMH, and AHi. Among these areas, PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> projections to AHi showed particularly strong connectivity and high probability of release, and when stimulated lead to overt pup-directed attack behaviors. By contrast, weaker connectivity was identified between PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> and LS and VMH neurons, which may in part explain the less robust behavioral manifestations of selective activation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> projections to LS and VMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wittmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battagello et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taking the connectivity strength and functional behavior results altogether, our data suggest that each projection may participate in different aspects and degrees of agonistic responses to pups. Based on the role of VMH in conspecific aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesized a role for PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> to VMH projection in pup-directed attack. However, we found instead that this projection regulates pup investigation. The PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> to LS projections also led to sustained reductions in pup interactions, a finding that is consistent with a recent study showing that LS neurons expressing corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2), the high-affinity receptor for <italic>Ucn3</italic>, may control persistent anxiety behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2014</xref>) and, in addition, led to incidences of pup-directed aggression. The function of the AHi is not well understood, although recent data suggest that it may send sexually dimorphic projections to MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons essential for parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>), while projections from the AHi to the MPOA have recently been shown to modulate infant-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2020</xref>). We noticed that the AHi-projecting neurons that are active during infanticide were located predominantly in the rostral PeFA, as were the majority of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons associated with infanticide. Thus, we propose that the pattern of activation within subsets of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons defined by their projection targets correlates with the degree of antiparental behavior displayed by the individual, from neglect and avoidance to genuine pup-directed attack.</p><p>In turn, the roles of distinct PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neuronal projections in the expression of pup-directed behavior may explain the different behavior outcomes we observed between somatic and projection stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> cells. Following PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> somatic optogenetic stimulation, we observed neglect and some rare instances of aggression toward pups. Stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> to lateral septum projections led to pup avoidance, a more pronounced phenotype than what was observed in the somatic stimulation group. Following stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> to VMH projections, we observed pup neglect that was fairly similar to behavior observed with somatic stimulation. By contrast, stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> to AHi projections led to overt aggressive behavior in about half the females tested, a much more pronounced response than the soma stimulation group. Thus, direct stimulation of a specific projection may be more efficient in triggering behaviors directly related to the function of the target region. For example, LS is known to have a role in persistent anxiety-like phenotypes and, indeed, stimulation of this projection elicits extreme pup avoidance. Similarly, the AHi has recently been associated with infant-directed aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2020</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that this projection target is preferentially involved in pup attack behavior.</p><p>Additionally, there is a strong level of connectivity between pro-parental MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> and anti-parental PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> -associated circuits. Indeed, MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> and PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn</sup></italic> neurons have been found to project to many of the same target regions, including the VMH and LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>), and we found that about half of the monosynaptic inputs to the PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> cells originate from MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the strength of MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> inhibitory tone in parental animal is likely to strongly affect the behavioral outcomes observed after somatic versus projection stimulation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons.</p><p>Parental behavior, and by extension infant-directed aggression, is highly regulated by context and previous social experience. Previous studies have shown that females with repeated exposure to pups will become more parental over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lonstein and De Vries, 2000</xref>). Our experiments with virgin females also showed a similar strong effect of pup exposure on subsequent infant-directed behavior. We observed that males allowed to interact with pups during suppression of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons displayed long-lasting reduced aggression toward pups, and that activation of PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons in females induced prolonged reduction in parenting. These results stand in contrast to the effects of stimulation of the MPOA<italic><sup>Gal</sup></italic> neurons, which confers rapid, reversible facilitation of parental behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these data suggest that PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons may undergo significant plasticity, leading to long-lasting functional changes and may induce enduring changes in downstream parental circuitry.</p><p>The functional characterization of the PeFA<italic><sup>Ucn3</sup></italic> neurons and their major projection targets enabled us to uncover how this neural population plays a role in regulating pup-directed neglect and aggression, thus revealing a pathway that is distinct from the brain control of adult-directed aggressive responses. This may have implications for the understanding of infant-directed behavior in many taxa as hypothalamic structures and peptides are highly conserved across species. We found that specific projections control aspects of antiparental behavior such as the duration of pup investigation, repulsion, as well as stereotyped displays of pup-directed agonistic behavior. The discovery of a dedicated circuit node for pup-directed aggression further supports the notion that this behavior might have adaptive advantages in the wild. This study reveals a novel neural substrate for understanding how parental behavior is modulated at a circuit level and opens new avenues for studying the context- and physiological state-dependent expression of parenting in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Mice were habituated to the testing environment for 10 min. 1–2 C57BL6/J pups 1–4 days old were presented in the cage in the opposite corner to the nest. Test sessions began when the mouse first closely investigated a pup (touched the pup with its snout) and lasted for 5–15 min. In the event that the mouse became aggressive by biting and wounding the pup, the session was immediately halted and the pup was euthanized. The following behaviors were quantified: latency to retrieve, sniffing (close contact), grooming (handling with forepaws and licking), nest building, time spent in the nest, crouching, latency to attack (latency to bite and wound), aggression (roughly handling, aggressively grooming, aggressive carrying with no retrieval), and tail rattling. A ‘parenting behavior’ index was calculated as the sum of duration of sniffing, grooming, nest building, time spent in the nest, and crouching. Mice were categorized as ‘parental’ if they showed pup retrieval behavior and ‘non-parental’ if they did not retrieve pups. Mice were categorized as ‘aggressive’ if they showed bite attacks, tail rattling, aggressive pup carrying, or aggressive pup-grooming, and as ‘non-aggressive’ if they did not display any of these behaviors.

Males were then either presented with a 1–4-day-old C57BL/6J pup or no stimulus and allowed to interact for 10 min, after which time behavior was recorded and the pup was removed. 60 min after stimulus presentation, males were sacrificed and a punch (1 mm diameter) was collected from a 2-mm-thick brain slice containing the PeFA, the paraventricular nucleus, and part of the anterior hypothalamus. The tissue was processed for pS6 immunoprecipitation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knight et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, punches were held in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and containing 1X phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, 1X calyculin, protease inhibitor cocktail [EDTA free], 250 µg/mL cycloheximide, and 2.5 µL/mL Rnasin) and 10 punches were pooled per sample, with three biological replicates taken from infanticidal and naïve groups. Tissue was homogenized, centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 g, subjected to treatment with 0.7% NP40 and 20 mM DHPC, and centrifuged for 10 min at (20,000 rcf) at 4°C to obtain the supernatant containing the input fraction. A 10 µL sample of the input was kept for sequencing and the remaining input fraction was incubated with Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) conjugated to pS6 antibody (Life Technologies 44923G) at a concentration of around 4 µg/IP for 10 min at 4°C. Beads were collected on a magnet and washed in 0.15 M KCl wash buffer, then associated RNAs were lysed into RLT buffer and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was checked for quality and quantity on an Agilent tape station. High-quality samples from matched input and IP fractions were prepared using the Low-input Library Prep kit (Clontech).</p><p>Sequenced reads were mapped with STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), version 2.5.3a, to the mm10 reference mouse genome and the Gencode vM12 primary assembly annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mudge and Harrow, 2015</xref>), to which non-redundant UCSC transcripts were added, using the two-round mapping approach. This means that following a first mapping round of each library, the splice-junction coordinates reported by STAR, across all libraries, are fed as input to the second round of mapping. The parameters used in both mapping rounds are: outSAMprimaryFlag = “AllBestScore”, outFilterMultimapNmax=“10”, outFilterMismatchNoverLmax=“0.05”, outFilterIntronMotifs=“RemoveNoncanonical”. Following read mapping, transcript and gene expression levels were estimated using MMSEQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turro et al., 2011</xref>). Following that, transcripts and genes that cannot be distinguished according to the read data were collapsed using the mmcollapse utility of MMDIFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turro et al., 2014</xref>), and the fragments per killobase million (FPKM) expression units were converted to natural logarithm of transcript per million (TPM) units since the latter were shown to be less biased and more interpretable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). In order to test for differential gene activation between the infanticidal males and naïve males, we used a Bayesian regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perez et al., 2015</xref>). We defined the response (for each transcript or gene) as the difference between means of the posterior TPMs of the IP and input samples (i.e., paired according to the tissue punches from which they were obtained). The uncertainty in the response was computed as square root of the sum of the variances of the posterior TPMs of the IP and input samples divided by the number of posterior samples (1000). The categorical factor for which we estimated the effect was defined as the behavior of the animal, meaning infanticidal and naïve, where naïve was defined as baseline. Hence, our Bayesian regression model estimates the posterior probability of the natural logarithm of the ratio between infanticidal IP TPMs divided by input TPMs and naïve IP TPMs divided by input TPMs being different from zero. In order to define a cutoff of this posterior probability, above which we consider the activation (i.e., effect size) significant, we searched for a right mode in the distributions of posterior probabilities across all transcripts and genes (separately for each), and placed the cutoff at the local minima that separates the right mode from the left mode, which represents transcripts and genes for which the likelihood of differential gene activation is very weak and hence their posterior probability is dominated by the prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Pilot experiments and our previous observations indicated that mated parents were insensitive to manipulations aimed at reducing parental behaviors, so we used virgin males and females in order to maximize our opportunity to see decrements in parenting. Virgin males were prescreened for infanticidal behavior. We injected 200 nL of AAV1/DIO-hChR2-eYFP for activation or AAV1/FLEx-NpHR3.0-eYFP (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_26966_AAV1">Addgene_26966_AAV1</ext-link>) for inhibition (or AAV1/FLEx-YFP RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_27056_AAV1">Addgene_27056_AAV1</ext-link> or AAV1/FLEx-tdTomato as control virus) bilaterally into the PeFA (AP –0.6, ML ±0.3, DV –4.2). Mice recovered for 1–2 weeks and in a second surgery a dual fiber optic cannula (300 µm, 0.22 NA, Doric Lenses) was implanted 0.5 mm above the target area and affixed to the skull using dental cement. Cannula positions were as follows: PeFA = AP –0.6 mm, ML ±0.5 mm, DV –3.7 mm; LS = AP 0.3 mm ,ML ±0.5 mm, DV –3.2 mm; VMH = AP –1.6, ML ±0.5 mm, DV –5.2; AHi = AP –2.3 mm, ML ±2.5 mm, DV –4.7 mm. Mice recovered for an additional week prior to the start of behavioral testing. In pilot studies, we found that the order of testing impacted parental behavior results, so rather than randomizing test order, we alternated laser ON and OFF conditions in the same order for both control and manipulated mice. For locomotion, feeding, and conspecific aggression tests, we randomized the order of laser ON/OFF presentation. On test days, the fiber implant was connected to an optical fiber with commutator connected to either a 473 nm laser (150 mW, Laserglow Technologies), or a 460 nm LED (50 W, Prizmatix) for ChR2 stimulation, or to a 589 nm laser (300 mW, OptoEngine) for NpHR3.0 inhibition. Behavior tests were 5 min in duration for each condition and behavior category. For parental behavior assays with ChR2, the 473 nm laser or 460 nm LED was triggered in 20 ms pulses at 20 Hz for 2 s when the mouse contacted the pup with its snout, and the order of laser sessions was ON first, OFF second, ON third. For locomotor experiments with ChR2 activation, the laser was triggered (20 ms, 20 Hz, 2 s) every 10 s to approximately equivalent duration as the time laser was on during the parental sessions, and this stimulation pattern was selected based on previous studies and pilot data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). For cookie experiments with activation, the laser was triggered when the mouse contacted the cookie. For conspecific aggression experiments with activation, the laser was triggered when the test mouse made close contact with the intruder mouse. The power exiting the fiber tip was 5 mW, which translates to ~2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the target region (calculator provided by Deissertoth lab at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php">http://www.stanford.edu/group/dlab/cgi-bin/graph/chart.php</ext-link>). For all behavior assays with NpHR3.0, the 589 nm laser was illuminated (20 ms, 50 Hz) throughout the duration of the 5 min session at a power of 15 mW, or ~8.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. For parenting sessions with inhibition, the order of laser sessions was OFF first, ON second, OFF third.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Chemogenetics</title><p><italic>Ucn3</italic>::Cre virgin female mice (or Cre-negative littermates as controls) 8–12 weeks old were used for these experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mary Kay Lobo as Reviewer #1 and the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Broberger (Reviewer #2); Lauren A O'Connell (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study makes an important contribution to our understanding of the brain mechanisms that drive instinctive behaviors, by identifying a neuronal population involved in pup-directed aggression. By applying a broad array of techniques this study provides compelling evidence that urocortin III (Ucn3) neurons in the PeFA induce infanticide behavior in male mice. While previous studies identify circuits mediating positive parenting toward infants this impactful study provides new information into the circuitry mediating negative behaviors toward infants. This paper will be of interest to scientists studying both parental and/or aggression behavior and the underlying neural circuits.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is some difficulty synthesizing these data into a unified model of the exact role of these neurons in adult mouse responses to pups, these limitations can be amended through mainly text edits. Additional text edits, figure edits, inclusion or quantification of new images, and clarification or inclusion of new electrophysiology data will further help to improve clarity and support the conclusions in this manuscript. Detailed comments are listed below.</p><p>1. In the introduction, the framing is centered on mammals, but this work rests on a broader framework of behavioral ecology, where many taxa (in addition to mammals) invest considerable resources in offspring. Likewise, infanticide is widespread across the animal kingdom (birds, fish, frogs, invertebrates). It is encouraged that the authors highlight some non-mammalian species to expand the behavioral ecology foundation on which this work could stand and make it of interest to a wider audience. This could be applied in the first paragraphs of the introduction and discussion.</p><p>2. Edits to the text would provide more clarity to support the conclusions about the neural basis of pup directed aggression.</p><p>a. The data as they stand appear to only support a role for PeFAUcn3 cells driving pup directed aggression in males, while in females activity of the neurons disrupt pup care but does not unambiguously drive aggression. Please rephrase to reflect in which instances – if any – (e.g. anatomy, activating stimuli, effects of stimulating or inhibiting) the authors believe the cells to be different between the sexes and what this might mean functionally. Or do the authors think that the findings reflect the fact that in male inhibition paradigms were primarily employed, whereas females were primarily exposed to activation?</p><p>b. There seems to be a lot of variation in behavior and even a bimodal response sometimes. For example, when PeFAUcn3 neuron are inhibited, only three males have inhibited pup-directed aggression, but all lack aggression by the next OFF period. Please discuss as to why there is this variation in infant-directed aggression in males and how do the authors posit this is regulated within the present circuit. Additional discussion into why these OFF manipulations do not immediately work in all males is warranted. Is there a circuit activity basis for the time delay?</p><p>c. It would be very valuable if the authors comment in the Discussion about why the combined results of stimulating the three PeFAUcn3 projections do not seem to mirror the effect of stimulating the cell bodies. It is not expected to see the &quot;full&quot; effect of somatic illumination (as additional, non-tested projections may contribute to that), but there appears to be more aggression with terminal than with cell body activation. It would benefit the reader to have the authors' provide discussion to make sense of this discrepancy.</p><p>d. Only 2-3 animals out of 15 females showed signs of aggression thus describing that &quot;activation of PeFAUcn3 neurons…induced signs of aggression&quot; at the end of the first paragraph on page 8 may be an overstatement.</p><p>e. In the discussion, the authors state that PeFAUcn3 neuron activation is &quot;long-lasting and not reversible.&quot; Please revise this as &quot;Not reversible&quot; is an overstatement given the authors examined this effect only 24 hours later, but not at a longer time period.</p><p>f. Did the authors manipulate the activity of PeFAUcn3 neurons in parents (dams, sires) and if so, what was the effect? It is not necessary to perform this study, but if is available it would provide further knowledge into the role of PeFA Ucn3 neurons in behavior.</p><p>3. Additional text edits would provide clarity to this the study and support the conclusions made by the authors.</p><p>a. In Figure 1H the authors show data from virgin females that engaged in pup attacks but Figure 3G and Figure 4E show control females do not display aggressive behavior. Please provide more information into how female pup attacks were quantified in Figure 1 vs Figure 3 and 4 that would account for these differences.</p><p>b. In the first paragraph for the expression analyses of c-fos positive brain areas using in situ hybridization and subsequent laser microdissection, did all virgin males attack? The text only mentions &quot;sections of tissue from virgin males after interactions with pups&quot; – it does not hint at the outcome of the behavioral interaction.</p><p>c. For the text corresponding to figure 1E – &quot;In situ hybridization analysis showed that Ucn3 expression is spatially restricted to the PeFA…&quot; Please clarify what this is compared to and is this the only place in the brain that this peptide is made?</p><p>d. In the Results, when data is reported from &quot;infanticidal males&quot;, were these animals certified infanticidal, i.e. had they been tested beforehand in the presence of pups?</p><p>e. In the discussion, the authors state &quot;In our experiments, MPOAGal neurons remain fully activated in females exposed to pups, thus exerting their inhibitory role on PeFAUcn3 neurons and their projections&quot;. Please clarify where the authors show that MPOA Gal neurons exert inhibitory role on PeFAUnc3 neurons. Based on Figure 5E, it does not look like many of these Gal neurons project to the Ucn3 neurons and there is no information about activity-based regulation between the two. However, Figure 5F demonstrates high colocalization. Can the authors please clarify the connection between these two cell types – both based on the evidence presented here and their hypotheses about how these cells may regulate one another? If there is no demonstration of an inhibitory role then the authors may rephrase to clarify that this is inference from the GABAergic molecular phenotype of MPOAGal neurons since GABA transmission can in some cases be depolarizing.</p><p>f. The authors state that Ucn3 neurons in the PeFA are involved in the &quot;regulation of social recognition&quot; and then go on to say that these neurons are tuned specifically to cues from pups. Please clarify if adult social recognition was also examined?</p><p>4. Additional clarity about statistical methods and data analyses employed.</p><p>a. The Methods lack a statistics section. There does not appear to be a description of statistics for behavior data, whether the many comparisons met the assumptions of the many parametric tests, or what software was used for statistics in many of the comparisons. The reviewers do acknowledge that some statistical methods were presented, such as with gene expression data.</p><p>b. Code for Bayesian model of pS6 data could not be located on the indicated GitHub page provided in the manuscript. Either it is not there currently, or it is not well labeled. Please make sure this code is clearly labeled, well annotated, and available prior to publication.</p><p>c. In reference to the sex differences uncovered in Figure 1 – Colocalization of c-fos and Ucn3 was significant only in virgin males that attack pups and not females although a trend was observed. Did the authors do a power analysis prior to this study? Is this a power issue or is there a real sex difference here?</p><p>d. Figure 1 – Supplement 1 Graph E. There are t-test results but please clarify that a t-test was performed in the legend? It appears that a t-test is comparing the colocalization to total Ucn3+ neurons, but if that is the case, an independent t-test is not appropriate.</p><p>e. In Figure 7 use caution when using a t-test with only 3 replicates and make sure these data fit the assumptions of this parametric test.</p><p>f. Most of the Figure legends include statistical information but Figure 8 legend is missing n and statistics.</p><p>g. please ensure each statistic has full reporting, e.g., test statistic, degrees of freedom, in addition to p value.</p><p>5. New images or quantification of images will improve the conclusions in this manuscript.</p><p>a. Figure 1B is the main figure that demonstrates visualization of enhanced c-Fos reactivity in PeFA of virgin males after infant directed attacks. However, the low power image used does not easily convey this information. While the authors include many higher power images in other subfigures it would be helpful for the reader to see a higher power image inlet in this first subfigure.</p><p>b. On page 6 the authors state that excitatory Ucn3 neurons are activated based on the Vglut/Ucn3 colocalization image in Supplemental Figure 1. However, it is difficult to visualize the colocalization in this image. Please provide quantification of the Vglut/Ucn3 positive neurons relative to Ucn3 only positive neurons.</p><p>c. The images shown in Supplemental Figures 2, 3 and 4 are not ideal for demonstrating that the construct is expressed in the Ucn3 cells. Please show double-staining for the virus-encoded fluorophore and Ucn3 mRNA/protein. Inclusion of quantification for at least one construct would demonstrate the level of expression in Ucn3 neurons.</p><p>6. Edits to the electrophysiology data in Figure 8 and validation of optogenetic/ chemogenetic protocols.</p><p>a. Please justify the relevance of including the data in Figure 8A-C as pretty much all brain neurons are expected to receive excitatory input and this data set does not isolate PeFA synapses.</p><p>b. Using amplitude as a measure of the strength of connectivity appears to be an oversimplification as it is difficult to make a direct comparison between targets using the experimental design in this experiment.</p><p>c. The authors classify the PSCs they recorded after stimulation of PeFAUcn3 cells as excitatory. This is a fair assumption given that these cells are glutamatergic but the manuscript lacks information specifying that there was pharmacological isolation by gabazine or a similar drug. Please clarify this.</p><p>d. Figure 8A-C: As noted above there is uncertainty as to the value of these data in the context of the current study. However, if they are included then please also include raw traces and not only quantification.</p><p>e. Please include validation (eg by slice electrophysiology and application of light/CNO) that show that the opto- and chemogenetic strategies for stimulation and inhibition achieves the in vivo stimulation goals at a cellular level.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64680.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is some difficulty synthesizing these data into a unified model of the exact role of these neurons in adult mouse responses to pups, these limitations can be amended through mainly text edits.

However, we also show that specific stimulation of the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections to AHi generates clear observable aggressive behavior of virgin females toward pups. Thus, PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neuron activity may trigger aggression of both males and females toward pups, as further elaborated below (see also further response to point 2c regarding the stimulation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections).</p><p>In addition, we have also manipulated the activity of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons in mated males and females (see also response to point 2f about activity manipulation in parents) and did not observe changes in behavior. As mentioned in later points, we have now added a sentence in the discussion to summarize and clarify the entire set of functional manipulations.</p><p>Our interpretation of the lack of observable aggression during artificial activation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons in animals normally displaying parenting behavior (virgin females, mothers and fathers) relies on our findings that PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons receive substantial inhibitory input from MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons (Figure 5 E, F). Because MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons are highly active in all parenting animals in response to pup cues, particularly in mated males and females (mothers and fathers) (Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Kohl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018), we postulate that aggression is readily observed in virgin males after artificial activation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons because MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons do not exert any inhibitory modulation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons in that state.</p><p>By contrast, the direct stimulation of the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections to AHi in parental animals may effectively shortcut the inhibition by MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons, as well as specifically focus the outcome of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> activity to a strong aggression-driving brain area (AHi) and thus leads to observable aggressive displays toward pups. This hypothesis is further elaborated in the response to point 2c below.</p><p>Our summary model, presented in figure 10 proposes that PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons are tuned to pup-directed neglect and aggression in both males and females, but undergo substantial inhibition of activity in parenting animals (virgin females, mothers, and fathers). To formally demonstrate this model, one would need to alleviate the inhibition from the brain circuitry normally mediating parenting, meaning inhibit MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons, while activating PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons, in order to robustly trigger aggression in parenting animals. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the appropriate tools to manipulate two genetically identified neural populations. We have clarified our findings and interpretation in the discussion and emphasized our view on the critical role of MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> inhibitory inputs on the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neural population in parenting animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. There seems to be a lot of variation in behavior and even a bimodal response sometimes. For example, when PeFAUcn3 neuron are inhibited, only three males have inhibited pup-directed aggression, but all lack aggression by the next OFF period. Please discuss as to why there is this variation in infant-directed aggression in males and how do the authors posit this is regulated within the present circuit. Additional discussion into why these OFF manipulations do not immediately work in all males is warranted. Is there a circuit activity basis for the time delay?</p></disp-quote><p>When PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neuron are inhibited, we indeed observed complete suppression of aggression in 3 males (Figure 2c), and found that all but one male showed an extremely long latency to attack and a significantly reduced percentage of time spent displaying aggression (Figure 2d). Thus overall, PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neuron inhibition induces a clear reduction of aggression towards pups. Interestingly, this inhibition appears to be long lasting and even further progress, such that all males are non-aggressive by the time of the next behavior testing (OFF 2). At the circuit level, we interpret this prolonged and self-sustained reduction in pup-mediated attack as an indication that pro-parental circuits become progressively more active following inhibition of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons, thus leading to a complete loss of aggression by the time we retest the males.</p><p>The apparent bimodal distribution during the ON trial may result from a distribution of efficiency of virus infection biased toward different projection targets. We quantified viral efficiency, but this parameter did not explain the distribution in behavior. We have included a statement clarifying our interpretation that suppression of PeFAUcn3 activity favors expression of parental behavior in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. It would be very valuable if the authors comment in the Discussion about why the combined results of stimulating the three PeFAUcn3 projections do not seem to mirror the effect of stimulating the cell bodies. It is not expected to see the &quot;full&quot; effect of somatic illumination (as additional, non-tested projections may contribute to that), but there appears to be more aggression with terminal than with cell body activation. It would benefit the reader to have the authors' provide discussion to make sense of this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue: we agree that a more explicit discussion of the data obtained by stimulating PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> somas versus projections is needed. PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> soma stimulation induces neglect behavior and some instances of aggression toward pups in 3/15 females. Stimulation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> to ventromedial hypothalamus projection triggers neglectful behavior, fairly similar to behavior observed in the somatic stimulation group. Stimulation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> to lateral septum projection triggers pup avoidance, a more pronounced phenotype than in the soma stimulation group. Finally, stimulation of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> to AHi projection triggers aggressive behavior in about half the females tested, which as the reviewer has noted is a much more pronounced aggression than the soma stimulation group. Our interpretation involves two non-exclusive phenomena. First, inhibitory MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons project to Ucn3+ neuronal somas in the PeFA as well as to many of the same target regions as PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons, including the VMH and LS (Kohl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). Thus, it is possible that the strength of agonistic phenotypes observed by stimulating PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neuronal soma versus various projections depends on the strength of the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> excitatory connection to these target areas as well as that of MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> inhibitory tone in parental animals. Second, direct stimulation of a specific projection may be more efficient in triggering behaviors directly related to the function of the target region. For example, LS is known to have a role in persistent anxiety-like phenotypes and indeed, stimulation of this projection elicits extreme pup avoidance. Similarly, the AHi has recently been associated with infant-directed aggression (Yamaguchi et al., 2020), supporting our hypothesis that this projection target is preferentially involved in pup attack behavior. We have amended the discussion to include these hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Only 2-3 animals out of 15 females showed signs of aggression thus describing that &quot;activation of PeFAUcn3 neurons…induced signs of aggression&quot; at the end of the first paragraph on page 8 may be an overstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the observation: this is indeed an overstatement, and we have now amended the text to reflect that we observed signs of aggression in only a few females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. In the discussion, the authors state that PeFAUcn3 neuron activation is &quot;long-lasting and not reversible.&quot; Please revise this as &quot;Not reversible&quot; is an overstatement given the authors examined this effect only 24 hours later, but not at a longer time period.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that “not reversible” is too strong of a statement in view of the short 24 hour time window used in our assay. We have now amended the statement to reflect this comment (see also point 2b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Did the authors manipulate the activity of PeFAUcn3 neurons in parents (dams, sires) and if so, what was the effect?

We have a statement in the “Optogenetics” methods section that provides details.</p><p>We believe that these data highlight the importance of physiological state in the regulation of parenting versus infanticide and hope to follow up on these data in the future using more refined approaches. Therefore, we have also added a similar statement in the main text in the Results section and in the discussion explaining the experiments in mated animals and our interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Additional text edits would provide clarity to this the study and support the conclusions made by the authors.</p><p>a.

Please provide more information into how female pup attacks were quantified in Figure 1 vs Figure 3 and 4 that would account for these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. We rarely saw pup-directed aggression in females, but in the process of testing many animals for the data shown in Figure 1H, we did come across a few infanticidal females that attacked pups. In subsequent experiments, we did not observe any pup directed attack, but detected some aggressive displays including tail-rattling, aggressive carrying, and biting. We have added a sentence to indicate that pup-directed aggression is rare in females, but we did observe attack in 3 mice over the course of our screen. Later in the text, we specify that the aggressive behavior quantified is tail-rattling behavior for 3G and bite-attack and aggressive carrying for 4E. We give a detailed summary of our evaluation criteria in the methods section regarding aggressive and parental behavior quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

According to the literature, Ucn3 is expressed in the PeFA but not in the adjacent paraventricular nucleus. Ucn3 is also expressed in the MPOA, the medial amygdala, the BNST/PeFA and the nucleus ambiguus (Venihaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; Wittmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009; Deussing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010).

In the discussion, the authors state &quot;In our experiments, MPOAGal neurons remain fully activated in females exposed to pups, thus exerting their inhibitory role on PeFAUcn3 neurons and their projections&quot;. Please clarify where the authors show that MPOA Gal neurons exert inhibitory role on PeFAUnc3 neurons. Based on Figure 5E, it does not look like many of these Gal neurons project to the Ucn3 neurons and there is no information about activity-based regulation between the two. However, Figure 5F demonstrates high colocalization. Can the authors please clarify the connection between these two cell types – both based on the evidence presented here and their hypotheses about how these cells may regulate one another? If there is no demonstration of an inhibitory role then the authors may rephrase to clarify that this is inference from the GABAergic molecular phenotype of MPOAGal neurons since GABA transmission can in some cases be depolarizing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our phrasing was too strong and have clarified how previously published work, as well as our new data, have led to our current hypothesis of an inhibitory effect of MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons on the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> of parental animals. In brief, previous work has demonstrated that in females and fathers, MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons are highly active (Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Kohl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). Moreover, we observed in the present study that around half of MPOA neurons projecting to PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons express galanin, thus representing a highly substantial input category to these neurons (Figure 5e,f). To further clarify and emphasize these data, we have updated the figure legend to indicate that the arrowheads depict colocalized cells (5e) and that the percentages are for the colocalized inputs (5f). Thus, we hypothesize that MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons, which are around 95% GABAergic (Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014), inhibit the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons in parentally-behaving mice. As the reviewer rightfully pointed out, we do not have direct evidence for inhibition of the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons by the MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> inputs, and have therefore rephrased our statement in the text to indicate that we infer that the galanin neurons are likely inhibiting the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> cells, as also discussed in response to Point 2a. Amended as follows: “In our experiments, MPOA<sup>Gal</sup> neurons remain fully activated in females exposed to pups, thus exerting their putative inhibitory role on PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons and their projections”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f.

In reference to the sex differences uncovered in Figure 1 – Colocalization of c-fos and Ucn3 was significant only in virgin males that attack pups and not females although a trend was observed. Did the authors do a power analysis prior to this study? Is this a power issue or is there a real sex difference here?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helping us clarify this issue. We very rarely observed attack in females and included as much data as we were able to collect in the lab, but likely it is underpowered to observe a true sex difference. We have amended the text accordingly on page 6:</p><p>“A trend was also observed in infanticidal virgin females, resulting from the analysis of 3 rare infanticidal mice seen out of a large group of otherwise non-aggressive virgin females.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Figure 1 – Supplement 1 Graph E. There are t-test results but please clarify that a t-test was performed in the legend? It appears that a t-test is comparing the colocalization to total Ucn3+ neurons, but if that is the case, an independent t-test is not appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment, we have reanalyzed these data with a Chi-Square test and updated the statistics in Figure 1—Supplement 1 panel E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

New images or quantification of images will improve the conclusions in this manuscript.</p><p>a. Figure 1B is the main figure that demonstrates visualization of enhanced c-Fos reactivity in PeFA of virgin males after infant directed attacks. However, the low power image used does not easily convey this information. While the authors include many higher power images in other subfigures it would be helpful for the reader to see a higher power image inlet in this first subfigure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that addition of insets in the figure will improve the manuscript, we have now provided high power images in the supplement to figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. On page 6 the authors state that excitatory Ucn3 neurons are activated based on the Vglut/Ucn3 colocalization image in Supplemental Figure 1. However, it is difficult to visualize the colocalization in this image. Please provide quantification of the Vglut/Ucn3 positive neurons relative to Ucn3 only positive neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting to include the percentage in the main text, we have updated to reflect this percentage on page 5 “91.3%±1.2%”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The images shown in Supplemental Figures 2, 3 and 4 are not ideal for demonstrating that the construct is expressed in the Ucn3 cells. Please show double-staining for the virus-encoded fluorophore and Ucn3 mRNA/protein. Inclusion of quantification for at least one construct would demonstrate the level of expression in Ucn3 neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting inclusion of these data. Ucn3 is localized at synapses, so it is not possible to visualize by immunostaining together with the fluorescent tag of the expressed viral construct. Instead, we have now provided <italic>in situ</italic> data for the DREADD construct expression in ucn3 neurons in Supplement to figure 4B. We also have data concerning the impact of chemogenetic stimulation on PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> cell firing in Supplement to Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Edits to the electrophysiology data in Figure 8 and validation of optogenetic/ chemogenetic protocols.</p><p>a. Please justify the relevance of including the data in Figure 8A-C as pretty much all brain neurons are expected to receive excitatory input and this data set does not isolate PeFA synapses.</p><p>b. Using amplitude as a measure of the strength of connectivity appears to be an oversimplification as it is difficult to make a direct comparison between targets using the experimental design in this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of clarity in the experimental design underlying this figure. We have included additional information in the figure (Figure 8A) and the figure legends to improve the description of the experiments. We have also included an additional supplemental figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) depicting selective targeting of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> with ChR2 and responses of PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons in response to blue light (465±40 nm) activation. In response to the reviewers’ suggestion, we have replaced Figure 8 A-B in the original submission with raw traces (and average traces Figure 8C) of the evoked events in the neuronal populations of the three projection targets (LS, VMH and AHi) for PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons.</p><p>The experiments outlined in Figure 8 were performed to examine the strength of PeFa-Ucn3 projections to three target regions based on the outcome of our tracing experiments. It is true that our experiments were not designed to quantify the precise number of release sites or the precise value of quantal size at PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> target sites. Our data provides a strong evidence of strong connectivity between PeFA Ucn3 neurons and AHi. Specifically, the data in panels C-D show the relative strength of the inputs from PeFA synapses to three different regions. In panel C, we show that we can selectively label and activate PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections by expressing ChR2 in Ucn3-Cre mice. By specifically activating PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections to LS, VMH and AHi, we were able to ascertain the mean postsynaptic responses in the above-mentioned areas. Our data supports the claim that the mean responses from activating PeFA are significantly stronger in Ahi than those observed in LS or VMH (Figure 8D).</p><p>In panel E, we used the paired pulse paradigm to compare the probability of release from PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections to LS, VMH and AHi. Previous studies have shown that the paired pulse ratio, the ratio of response to second pulse to that of the first pulse is inversely related to the release probability at many synapses (Manabe et al., 1993; Debanne et al., 1996). Our data strongly supports the claim that the PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> projections to AHi show very high probability of release as evident from significant paired pulse depression (Figure 8E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The authors classify the PSCs they recorded after stimulation of PeFAUcn3 cells as excitatory. This is a fair assumption given that these cells are glutamatergic but the manuscript lacks information specifying that there was pharmacological isolation by gabazine or a similar drug. Please clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our description. We agree with the reviewer that pharmacological manipulation is one clear way to isolate glutamatergic synaptic connectivity. Another way is to clamp the neurons at the reversal potential for GABAA (Cl<sup>-</sup>). For the inhibitory ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors that carry Cl− (GABAA), under normal slice recording conditions the equilibrium potential is very close to the resting potential of the neurons (approximately –70 mV). Thus, by clamping the neurons at -70 mV during slice recordings, the driving force for the Cl<sup>-</sup> conduction is 0 (or negligible). Thus, this approach does not necessitate blocking of GABAergic neurotransmission to isolate glutamatergic neurotransmission (EPSC) (Kato et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Figure 8A-C: As noted above there is uncertainty as to the value of these data in the context of the current study. However, if they are included then please also include raw traces and not only quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the original 8A-B with the raw traces (and average traces) of the evoked events in the neuronal populations of the three projection targets (LS, VMH and AHi) for PeFA<sup>Ucn3</sup> neurons. We have also included additional schematic in the figure (Figure 8A) and the figure legends to improve the description of the experiments.
