Most often, the new genetic material is delivered into cells using a modified virus that no longer causes disease, called a viral vector. Virus-mediated gene therapies are currently being explored for degenerative eye diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, and neurological disorders, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. A number of gene therapies have also been approved for treating some rare cancers, blood disorders and a childhood form of motor neuron disease.</p><p>Despite the promise of virus-mediated gene therapy, there are significant hurdles to its widespread success. Viral vectors need to deliver enough genetic material to the right cells without triggering an immune response or causing serious side effects. Selecting an optimal vector is key to achieving this. A type of viruses called adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are prime candidates, partly because they can be easily engineered. However, accurately comparing the safety and efficacy of newly engineered AAVs is difficult, due to variation between test subjects and the labor and cost involved in careful testing.</p><p>Öztürk et al. addressed this issue by developing an experimental pipeline called scAAVengr for comparing gene therapy vectors head-to-head. The process involves tagging potential AAV vectors with unique genetic barcodes, which can then be detected and quantified in individual cells using a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing. This means that when several vectors are used to infect lab-grown cells or a test animal at the same time, they can be tracked. The vectors can then be ranked on their ability to infect specific cell types and deliver useful genetic material.</p><p>Using scAAVengr, Öztürk et al. compared viral vectors designed to target the light-sensitive cells of the retina, which allow animals to see. First, a set of promising viral vectors were evaluated using the scAAVengr pipeline in the eyes of marmosets and macaques, two small primates. Precise levels and locations of gene delivery were quantified. The top-performing vector was then identified and used to deliver Cas9, a genome editing tool, to primate retinas.</p><p>Öztürk et al. also used scAAVengr to compare viral vectors in mice, analysing the vectors’ ability to deliver their genetic cargo to the brain, heart, and liver. These experiments demonstrated that scAAVengr can be used to evaluate vectors in multiple tissues and in different organisms.</p><p>In summary, this work outlines a method for identifying and precisely quantifying the performance of top-performing viral vectors for gene therapy. By aiding the selection of optimal viral vectors, the scAAVengr pipeline could help to improve the success of preclinical studies and early clinical trials testing gene therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macaca fascicularis</kwd><kwd>callithrix jacchus</kwd><kwd>scRNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>adeno-associated

approach for the treatment of inherited disease, and AAV is a leading viral vector candidate for safe and efficient delivery. A growing number of clinical trials are using AAV to treat diseases such as retinal degeneration, neurological disorders, and hemophilia, through gene replacement, genome editing, and optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">High and Roncarolo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sahel and Dalkara, 2019</xref>). And, with the recent FDA approval for treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy, gene therapies are rapidly becoming a clinical reality. However, significant hurdles prevent the successful, widespread implementation of AAV-mediated gene therapies, including efficient gene delivery and immune response to viral vectors and gene products. Recent efforts to reengineer viral vectors have shown promise for addressing these issues, resulting in AAVs with improved abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li and Samulski, 2020</xref>). The enhanced viral vectors produced by these high-throughput methods still require quantitative validation and comparison, however, currently a challenging and burdensome process.</p><p>The selection of an optimal vector is essential to the success of the therapy. Sufficient gene expression is critical, while enhanced tropism and greater efficiency of gene delivery reduces the titer of vector required and decreases the likelihood of immune response. Quantitative comparisons of newly engineered vectors, including evaluation of transgene expression levels and cell-type tropism, have in the past required large numbers of animals, and therefore involved significant ethical and financial burden. Additionally, in primates, the large variability between animals, due to differences in anatomy and immune responses, has made comparisons between animals inaccurate. Here, we have developed a single cell RNA-seq AAV engineering (scAAVengr) pipeline for rapid, quantitative in vivo comparison of transgene expression from newly engineered AAV capsid variants across all different cell types in a tissue in parallel, and in the same animals.</p><p>In this work, the scAAVengr pipeline was applied to primates, which are the most physiologically similar animal to humans, and are thus a critical preclinical model. Successful clinical translation of gene therapies depends on highly efficient vectors for human tissue, and vector performance in small animals often does not accurately predict efficiency in primates. For retinal gene therapy in particular, primates are essential, as existing AAV vectors infect the primate retina significantly less efficiently than in rodent retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalkara et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, primates are the only animal model that has a macula and foveal pit (the region of the retina responsible for high acuity vision in humans), making them the most relevant translational model. Notably, the pattern of AAV expression also differs in foveal and in peripheral retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalkara et al., 2013</xref>), with highest expression in the foveola and in a perifoveal ring of retinal ganglion cells, and punctate expression near blood vessels in the periphery. The scAAVengr single-cell RNA-Seq pipeline allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the clinical potential of multiple lead candidates across all retinal cell types, in the foveal and peripheral retina, in a large animal model with eyes similar to humans. The scAAVengr pipeline can be applied to any species or tissue for which marker genes can be identified, however, as demonstrated here through screening performed in mouse brain, heart, and liver following systemic injections of pooled AAV library.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Animals were treated post-injection with daily topical application of prednisolone acetate and oral antibiotics and a tapering dose of corticosteroids. Non-invasive retinal imaging by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Spectralis HRA + OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) was performed under general anesthesia. Overlapping en face images were captured using the short-wavelength (480 nm) autofluorescence imaging mode to detect GFP expression. Following euthanasia, retinal samples were collected either for DNA/RNA analysis (see above) or for immunohistochemistry after paraformaldehyde fixation and embedding.

Intravitreal injections (150–250 µL) were performed with a 30-gauge insulin syringe under general anesthesia delivering the viral solution in the mid-vitreous. Three weeks later, dogs were euthanized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital, and both eyes were flattened by making relief cuts in the globe. Two mm punches of RPE were immediately collected from superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal regions of the retina, as well as from the area centralis, and flash frozen. DNA was extracted from samples using a Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and AAV <italic>cap</italic> genes were recovered via PCR from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) punches. AAV genomes were then repackaged and reinjected. Five rounds of selection were performed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with error prone PCR done following the third round of selection to introduce additional diversity into the library.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Deep sequencing of directed evolution libraries from rounds of selection conducted in dogs</title><p>Following rounds of selection, the AAV2-7mer library was found to give rise to the majority of resulting variants. Each round of selection from the AAV2-7mer was then subjected to deep sequencing in order to analyze the dynamics of each individual variant and overall convergence of the library. A ~ 75–85 base pair region containing the 7mer insertion was PCR amplified from harvested DNA. Primers included Illumina adapter sequences containing unique barcodes to allow for multiplexing of amplicons from multiple rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced with a 100-cycle single-read run on an Illumina HiSeq 2,500. DNA sequences were translated into amino acid sequences, and the number of reads containing unique 7mer insert sequences were counted. Read counts were normalized by the total number of reads in the run. Pandas was used to create plots.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Deep sequencing analysis of rounds of selection in canine</title><p>Best performing variants were chosen as variants with the greatest fold increase in the final round of selection relative to the initial plasmid library (# reads in final round, normalized to total number of reads in the round / # of reads in plasmid library, normalized to total number of reads in the round).

To compare the selected variants head-to-head, these 20 vectors, along with an AAV2 control, were packaged individually with a ubiquitous CAG promoter driving expression of GFP fused to a unique DNA barcode (AAV-barcode). Vectors were titer matched, mixed together, and injected intravitreally into both eyes of 3 WT dogs. Six weeks after injection, potent GFP fluorescence was detected by fundus imaging of the canine eyes. GFP expression was present in every layer of the dog retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Eyes were harvested, tissue samples were collected from across the retina, the RPE was separated from the neuroretina, and photoreceptors were collected using transverse sectioning on a cryostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne et al., 2020</xref>). DNA and mRNA were extracted from retinal samples using a Qiagen Allprep kit. Samples were collected from areas across the retina, and from the outer nuclear layer (ONL) or RPE. Following DNA and mRNA extraction, AAV-barcodes were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and from cDNA, from photoreceptors and RPE. cDNA was created from mRNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. AAV-barcodes were PCR amplified directly from DNA or cDNA. Primers amplified a ~ 50 bp region surrounding the AAV-barcode and contained Illumina adapter sequences and secondary barcodes to allow for multiplexing of multiple samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>AAV-barcodes amplified from the ONL, RPE, and the injected AAV libraries were then subjected to Illumina sequencing to quantify the representation of each of the variants. PCR amplicons sequenced with a 100-cycle single-read run on a MiSeq. Read counts were normalized by total number of reads in the run. Analysis of barcode abundance was performed using in-house code written in Python, followed by creation of plots in Pandas. Best performing variants were selected based on the fold increase in the percent of total library, relative to the injected library (% of total in recovered sample / % of total in injected library). Analysis was performed on n = 3 dogs. Variants were ranked on the basis of the normalized change in frequency of their representation in the recovered genomes relative to the injected AAV library (% of total in recovered AAV library / % of total in injected library). Selected variants largely outperformed AAV2 in three dogs and across peripheral, mid-peripheral and central retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, the most abundant variant (K91, LAHQDTTKNA), which was overly represented in the original library, did not outperform other variants in canine retina, indicating that the metric of quantity of representation in the final round of selection is not the best indicator of fitness for transgene expression. Rankings based on mRNA and DNA recovery indicated different top-performing variants. Evaluation on the basis of mRNA is a more relevant readout of AAV performance, as it is indicative of transgene expression, rather than persistence in extracellular spaces of the tissue or viral endocytosis without useful mRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>DE subset library construction</title><p>Unique 25 bp DNA barcodes were cloned after the stop codon of eGFP, in an AAV ITR-containing plasmid construct containing a self-complementary CAG promoter driving eGFP expression (scCAG-eGFP-Barcode-bghPolyA). <italic>Cap</italic> genes were cloned into an AAV rep/cap plasmid (Addgene #64839) for packaging.

Deep sequencing was used to quantify the relative abundance of vector in the pooled library, by amplifying using primer/adapters and sequencing on a MiSeq Nano flow cell. Titers for all variants in the pool were determined to be within ±1 log from the average variant in the pool, a range that was found to be compatible with accurate normalization across samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Single-cell dissociation of primate retina</title><p>The NHP retinas were dissected, and regions of interest were isolated (macula, superior, and inferior periphery).

As each UMI (unique molecular identifier) represents a single mRNA molecule captured, only one AAV-barcode should exist for each UMI.

DE, which involves applying a selective pressure to libraries of mutated AAV vectors, and conducting iterative rounds of selection, has been used in mouse to create AAV vectors with new abilities to infect Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klimczak et al., 2009</xref>), to infect photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalkara et al., 2013</xref>) and in primates to deliver genes to the outer retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byrne et al., 2020</xref>).

In all three conditions (alone, in the presence of three additional variants, or infected in the presence of 16 additional variants), the number of cells infected by AAV2, and the average number of transcripts recovered from infected cells (averaged across all cells infected) were stable. For K912, the number of cells infected and the average number of transcripts recovered from infected cells were stable between the 4-member pool and the 16-member pool. Together these results indicate that competition for receptors, or the presence of additional variants in the library does not impact quantification of AAV performance.</p><p>Then, we estimated the number of unique AAV variants that could be directly compared through the scAAVengr pipeline.

Quantitative comparisons of newly engineered vectors, including evaluation of transgene expression levels and cell-type tropism, have, in the past, required large numbers of animals. In primates, such studies have been impractical, due to the associated ethical and financial burden. Additionally, in primates, the large variability between animals has made comparisons between animals inaccurate, and evaluation of multiple AAVs in the same animal was not possible. In order to address these problems, we developed a single-cell RNA-seq AAV engineering (scAAVengr) pipeline for quantitative head-to-head in vivo comparison of transgene expression from newly engineered AAV capsid variants. By simultaneously quantifying cellular and viral RNA at the single-cell level, this method allows for efficient, direct, and head-to-head comparison of multiple vectors across all cell types in the same animals. Pan-tissue efficiency of transgene expression can be determined, as well as specificity for any cell-type of interest that can be identified by its transcriptome profile. The number and identity of unique AAV serotypes infecting a single cell can be observed, and the efficiency and specificity of a potential gene therapy can be accurately estimated.</p><p>Here, we have evaluated the AAV tropism of newly engineered AAV capsid variants, created in the context of dog retina, with increased ability to infect all major retinal cell types. These variants were directly compared to variants created through DE in primate eyes, as well as naturally occurring variants and tyrosine modified versions. The overall top-performing AAV, K912, was identified through screening performed in the context of the canine retina. Canines, which have an even thicker vitreous than primates, may represent a more difficult model, with a higher barrier for transduction, resulting in better performing viruses. Further work will need to be done to determine whether vectors from canine screens consistently out-perform variants screened in other animal models.</p><p>The overall rate of infection achieved by K912, around 2% of total retinal cells, suggests that significant improvements in AAV transduction must be achieved for maximal therapeutic benefit to be achieved via intravitreal injections. Additional improvements to AAV screening protocols or library construction may be required in order to find even better performing vectors. Here, the best performing variants were determined by using the cloned AAV DE library (plasmid used for packaging) as the denominator for evaluation. Additional work will be required to determine whether the packaged AAV DE library (Round 0) may be a better common denominator to follow DE enrichment. It remains to be seen whether barriers to retinal penetration by AAV vectors from intravitreal injection can be overcome by modification of the AAV capsid alone, or whether alternative methods for vector delivery are required. The scAAVengr pipeline may also be useful in determining absolute rates of infection and direct comparison with other routes of administration or methods for transgene expression.</p><p>The 17-member scAAVengr library of AAV variants was also analyzed in brain, heart and liver following systemic injection in neonatal mice. Variants including K912 and NHP9, which performed well in primate retina, did not infect mouse brain, liver and heart, which indicates that the mutations which confer increased ability to cross structural barriers in the retina are not sufficient for infection from systemic injection in neonatal mice. Further analysis could be performed, using the same dataset, to quantify infectivity in specific subtypes of retinal cell types, as subtype marker genes are validated. Additional work is required to determine the maximum number of pooled AAV variants that can be screened simultaneously, though our results indicate that libraries containing at least E + 5 variants can be evaluated from a single sample containing 8000 cells. Quantification revealed that multiple AAV serotypes do infect individual cells, suggesting that competition between variants does not inhibit infection. Analysis of in vitro infection of AAV variants in HEK293 cells also suggests that competition between variants infecting the same cells does not significantly affect the number of infected cells or the level of transgene expression in infected cells, validating infectivity data from pooled AAV variants. However, in vivo confirmation of this finding is warranted, as the barriers affecting the dynamics of infection may differ in a more complex environment, such as the retina.</p><p>Marmoset eyes, which are significantly smaller than human and macaque eyes, were more easily infected than cynomolgus macaques, with greater percentages of cells infected and more infection events per cell. Marmoset eyes may represent a less challenging target for AAV transduction than cynomolgus macaques due to more efficient diffusion of viral particles in smaller eyes, a less rigid vitreous consistency, or immunological factors. This suggests that large primates may be of more use for accurate prediction of performance of gene delivery efficiencies in humans, particularly in the retina, but potentially in other targets as well, such as infection of organs from systemic injections, where diffusion rates and structural barriers may differ between marmosets and macaques. The rate of Cas9 editing in macaques was similar to the total percent of cells infected by K912, indicating that editing was efficient in infected cells. Importantly, similar rates of infection and genome editing indicate that scRNA-seq can accurately estimate the efficiency of viral gene delivery.</p><p>Data from primate retina and mouse brain, heart, and liver validate that the scAAVengr workflow is applicable to any tissue for which cell type marker genes are available, and provides a rapid, quantitative method by which AAV vectors can be rapidly evaluated for their clinical potential. This method enables the definitive ranking of AAV’s, in terms of transgene expression efficiency, and in future studies will enable the identification of vectors with greater cell-type specificity. The quantitative nature and single-cell resolution provided by the scAAVengr pipeline therefore enables identification and development of optimal AAV vectors for clinical translation.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is an inventor on AAV capsid variants (US patent IDs: 10,214,785, 10,745,453).

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

The approach (&quot;pipeline&quot;) relies on a single cell transcriptome analysis of GFP(+), rAAV-transduced cells in simian retina. The analysis assigns a particular internal barcode (capsid's identity) to a particular cell type (external barcodes) constituting retina tissue. The frequency of the respective NGS reads is directly corelated to the capsid transduction efficiency. The approach is indeed a significant technological step forward allowing a reduction in animal use while advancing bioinformatics as a viable and less expensive alternative. The former argument, however, if taken to its extreme, could be counter-productive since, as authors themselves noted (lines 65-66), animals vary, and reducing their number may skew the outcome in favor of a particular animal idiosyncrasies. This paper is of potential interest to a broad audience of investigators studying AAV vectors for therapeutic uses. The scAAVengr technique described is promising, although has not been completely characterized with regard to the number of AAV vectors that can be accurately tested or the use of the approach to study AAV transduction of other organs or tissues beyond the retina.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the technique described is promising, additional characterization is needed to know the number of AAV vectors that can be accurately tested as well as how useful the system is for targeting other tissues beyond retina. For example, the authors suggest that the 17 pooled AAV vectors did not compete with each other to transduce retinal cells, and cite the finding that a small number of sequenced cells were infected with multiple AAVs to support this hypothesis, as shown in Figure 5. But, Figure 5 also shows that the great majority of retinal cells sequenced were infected with a single AAV serotype. Thus, it is not clear that AAVs did not compete. Or does this indicate that most of the &quot;single serotype cells&quot; are the result of a transduction event with a single viral genome? Or that most transduced cells are specifically selective for a specific capsid? Further studies using different numbers of AAV serotypes are needed to address this issue. Similarly, testing scAAVengr in another tissue/organ type would be helpful to demonstrate the potential application of scAAVengr to studies beyond the retina. Alternatively, the paper could be modified to refocus on the use in the retina and data acquired from this focused approach.</p><p>(2) One of the major concerns is the description of the pooled, &quot;titer-matched&quot; GFP-barcode libraries (line 506). If, after deep sequencing of the control injected mixture the &quot;relative abundance&quot; of the pool was between ~2.65E+11 – 6.58E+11 vg/ml (~2.5-fold difference, not robust, but within experimental titering error), the resulting &quot;dilution factors&quot; were determined to be in the range of ~14-fold (AAV9 to AAV1). Which of these is correct? If appears the actual NGS read data were normalized by the factor of 14 for AAV1/NHP9 in order to compare them to AAV9. If this was how the data was corrected, is it valid? Once can envision several scenarios (e.g. titer-dependent capsid concentration gradient across the vitreous) for the data misinterpretation.</p><p>(3) The manuscript is focused on the scAAVengr method and evaluation of the data described regarding the transduction of retinal cell types with the AAV vectors tested needs to be included in the discussion. For example, why did the K912 vector identified through the DE experiment performed in dogs outperform the NHP vectors in transducing outer retinal cells in the primate experiments reported? Further, what does the finding that the best AAV vectors derived from DE experiments designed to identify vectors that can transduce retinal photoreceptor cells transduced only a small fraction of these cells in the experiments reported? Does it suggest that the barriers to retinal penetration by AAV vectors cannot be overcome by modification of the AAV capsid alone? These are important topics that can inform readers regarding the potential uses of the scAAVengr method and need to be included in the discussion.</p><p>(4) There were multiple differences between results obtained in marmoset vs. macaque eyes. For example, more cells were infected in marmoset retinas compared to macaque retina, and fewer &quot;co-infections&quot; with multiple AAVs were detected in macaque retinal cells than marmoset cells. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss the reasons for this, and the related implications for using the scAAVengr method in other organs.</p><p>(5) The main combinatorial library, 10-mer amino acid insertion at ~588, is not consistent with several instances describing it as a 7-mer insertion (lines 406, 417, 462 etc). This discrepancy needs addressed.</p><p>(6) Normalizing frequencies of the DE-evolving variants to the starting plasmid library (line 107) does not seem to be the best way to follow the enrichment due to the noise from the dead-end non-packaged variants. The original packaged library (Round 0) may be the better common denominator to follow DE enrichment.</p><p>(7) The figures used in the manuscript are helpful for presenting the complex data described, but took significant effort to interpret. Inclusion of more complete descriptions of how to &quot;read&quot; the figures in the legends would be helpful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;scAAVengr, a transcriptome-based pipeline for quantitative ranking of engineered AAVs with single-cell resolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 1 peer reviewer, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The reviewer has opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) It is not clear that the newly added experiments in 5B address transduction-competition related to K912. See Reviewer comment 1 for more details.</p><p>(2) Ensure consistency in referencing &quot;pools, libraries, mixes&quot; for clarity. See Reviewer comment for more details.</p><p>(3) Ensure consistency in referencing &quot;barcodes&quot;. See Reviewer comment for more details.</p><p>Reviewers comments for the authors:</p><p>(1) The newly added experiments described in figure 5B do not really address transduction-competition in a context that is relevant to the main story (the intravitreal injection environment), and does not quantify the transduction events produced by the serotypes relevant to the main story (ie K912).</p><p>Example: if K912 was evolved for transduction (TD) of cells in the intravitreal environment, it may no longer be fit to TD HEK293. Therefore quantifying of the TD-efficiency of the would-be competitors is also warranted in order to demonstrate that the model is relevant. Please address this concern by further stating caveats/limitations of this data.</p><p>Without testing these variants singly, these experiments do not address whether AAV2's poor performance in the intravitreal environment in the context of the mixed library was due to direct (binding) competition by serotypes that were &quot;more fit&quot;, or just AAV2 lack of suitability altogether.</p><p>(2) The overall body of work deals with many layers of &quot;mixes, pools, libraries, etc.&quot; Phrasing and references to these various entities seemed inconsistent or ambiguous at times leading to significant confusion for this reviewer. I recommend that some space be given to explicitly defining the various groups/mixes/pools, and then maintaining that vocabulary throughout the text. (see line 824, 825. please provide definition of &quot;cloned AAV library&quot; vs &quot;packaged library&quot;)</p><p>(3) Likewise, this work deals with several layers of &quot;barcoding&quot; (sorted cell barcode, mRNA unique molecular identifier, and viral payload (GFP barcode)). Again, phrasing and references to these various entities seemed inconsistent or ambiguous at times leading to significant confusion for this reviewer. Again, I recommend that some more space be given to definition and graphic representation.</p><p>One example of barcode related confusion: It appears that the &quot;GFP barcoding&quot; for variant serotypes do not allow for quantification of multiple infections by the same serotype. (That is for example: all K912 TD events are binned by the same unique barcode associated with the GFP payload, see line 471). This is different from the description of the barcoding of AAV2 in Figure 5C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64175.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The study entitled &quot;scAAVengr, a transcriptome-based pipeline for quantitative ranking of engineered AAVs with single-cell resolution&quot; by Öztürk et al. describes an approach of engineering and identifying the most efficient AAV capsid/s within a small-scale rAAV library using a barcoded GFP reporter.

We have addressed these issues with experiments shown in Figure 5B and C and newly created Figures 7 and 8. In order to determine whether the presence of other AAV variants impedes infection of library members, HEK293 cells grown in vitro were infected with either AAV2 alone, or AAV2 in the presence of additional AAV variants (Figure 5B). 1E+6 HEK293 cells were infected with (a) AAV2 (MOI of ~6E+3, 2 technical replicates were performed), or (b) AAV2 (MOI of ~6E+3) + AAV8 (MOI of ~4E+4), AAV9 (MOI ~2E+4) and K912 (MOI ~4E+3), or (c) AAV2 (MOI ~6E+3) and the additional 16 variants of the 17-member library tested in primates (MOI ~5E+3). In all three conditions (alone, in the presence of 3 additional variants, or infected in the presence of 16 additional variants) the number of cells infected by AAV2 and the average number of transcripts recovered from infected cells were stable, indicating that competition for receptors, or the presence of additional variants in the library does not impact quantification of AAV performance.</p><p>Then, in order to validate the scAAVengr pipeline in other species and tissues, we screened the same 17-member AAV library in mouse brain, heart and liver following systemic injections (Figure 7). AAV library was packaged, containing each GFP-barcoded virus, and 50 uL of a 5e+12 vg/mL titer library was injected via facial vein in P0 mice. The absolute number of cells infected by each serotype was quantified. Then, the percent of total cells infected by each serotype was quantified for each major cell type and used to create heat maps of serotype infectivity (Figure 8A). Finally, within infected cells, the level of transgene expression was evaluated, relative to total transcripts recovered from each cell (Figure 8B). Each of these metrics was corrected by the dilution factors for variants in the injected library, previously determined by deep sequencing. Heat maps of these metrics revealed that variants AAV8, AAV8-2YF, AAV9, AAV-92YF and AAVrh.10 infected brain, heart and liver following neonatal systemic injections. AAV1 and AAV5 also infected liver cells. These results are in agreement with previously published data on the tropism of these AAV serotypes (Duan, 2016; Foust et al., 2009; L. Wang et al., 2010; Z. Wang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2014; H. W. Zhang et al., 2011; Zincarelli, Soltys, Rengo, and Rabinowitz, 2008). SCH/NHP26, a variant created through DE in primate with a backbone partially based on AAV9, also infected brain, heart and liver. In contrast, AAV2-based retinal DE variants, including K912 and NHP9, did not efficiently infect organs outside of the eye, indicating that these variants do not cross the vasculature. Together, these experiments demonstrate the application of scAAVengr to studies beyond the retina and in additional animal models. One of the major concerns is the description of the pooled, &quot;titer-matched&quot; GFP-barcode libraries (line 506). If, after deep sequencing of the control injected mixture the &quot;relative abundance&quot; of the pool was between ~2.65E+11 – 6.58E+11 vg/ml (~2.5-fold difference, not robust, but within experimental titering error), the resulting &quot;dilution factors&quot; were determined to be in the range of ~14-fold (AAV9 to AAV1). Which of these is correct? If appears the actual NGS read data were normalized by the factor of 14 for AAV1/NHP9 in order to compare them to AAV9. If this was how the data was corrected, is it valid? Once can envision several scenarios (e.g. titer-dependent capsid concentration gradient across the vitreous) for the data misinterpretation.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to clarify the titers and range of relative abundances of variants in the pool. The manuscript now reads “(The total titer of pooled virus was: ~2E+12 – 5E+12 vg/ml, see Supplementary File 1).” We have removed the dilution factors listed, as these varied from prep to prep. The abundances for all variants in the pool were determined to be within a log of the average variant in the pool. We saw no correlation between abundance in the pool and overall performance (i.e. in some preps the most abundant variant was a low performer and vice versa.) Additionally, we explored the effects of relative abundance of variants in a new experiment, presented in Figure 4B. In this experiment, we saw no significant difference in AAV performance, in terms of percent cells infected or number of cells infected, whether an AAV made up 100% of the library or &lt;10% of the library. The dynamics of virus dilution are an important topic that we are currently exploring further for a manuscript in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript is focused on the scAAVengr method and evaluation of the data described regarding the transduction of retinal cell types with the AAV vectors tested needs to be included in the discussion. For example, why did the K912 vector identified through the DE experiment performed in dogs outperform the NHP vectors in transducing outer retinal cells in the primate experiments reported?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting outcome, and we have added the following text to the discussion to address this point<bold>: “</bold>The overall top-performing AAV, K912, was identified through screening performed in the context of the canine retina. Canines, which have an even thicker vitreous than primates, may represent a more difficult model, with a higher barrier for transduction, resulting in higher performing viruses. Further work will need to be done to determine whether vectors from canine screens consistently out-perform variants screened in other animal models.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, what does the finding that the best AAV vectors derived from DE experiments designed to identify vectors that can transduce retinal photoreceptor cells transduced only a small fraction of these cells in the experiments reported? Does it suggest that the barriers to retinal penetration by AAV vectors cannot be overcome by modification of the AAV capsid alone? These are important topics that can inform readers regarding the potential uses of the scAAVengr method and need to be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important questions, and we have added the following text to the discussion to address these points: “The overall rate of infection achieved by K912, around 2% of total retinal cells, suggests that significant improvements in AAV transduction must be achieved for maximal benefit to be achieved via intravitreal injections. It remains to be seen whether barriers to retinal penetration by AAV vectors from intravitreal injection can be overcome by modification of the AAV capsid alone. The scAAVengr pipeline may also be useful in determining absolute rates of infection and direct comparison with other routes of administration or methods for transgene expression.” There were multiple differences between results obtained in marmoset vs. macaque eyes. For example, more cells were infected in marmoset retinas compared to macaque retina, and fewer &quot;co-infections&quot; with multiple AAVs were detected in macaque retinal cells than marmoset cells. It would be helpful for the authors to discuss the reasons for this, and the related implications for using the scAAVengr method in other organs.</p><p>We agree that this is an interesting finding, and we have added the following text to address these points. “Marmoset eyes, which are significantly smaller than human and macaque eyes, were more easily infected than cynomolgus macaques, with greater percentages of cells infected and more infection events per cell. Marmoset eyes may represent a less challenging target for AAV transduction than cynomolgus macaques due to more efficient diffusion of viral particles in smaller eyes, a less rigid vitreous consistency, or immunological factors. This suggests that large primates may be of more use for accurate prediction of performance of gene delivery efficiencies in humans, particularly in the retina, but potentially in other targets as well, such as infection of organs from systemic injections, where diffusion rates and structural barriers may differ between marmosets and macaques.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main combinatorial library, 10-mer amino acid insertion at ~588, is not consistent with several instances describing it as a 7-mer insertion (lines 406, 417, 462 etc). This discrepancy needs addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text, in order to more accurately describe the library. The following statement was rewritten: “DE was implemented similarly to the screen previously reported in primate retina. AAV2-based libraries, including a ~588 peptide insertion library that contained a random 7-mer peptide flanked by constant flanking linker sequences LA and A, for a total of 10 amino acids.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Normalizing frequencies of the DE-evolving variants to the starting plasmid library (line 107) does not seem to be the best way to follow the enrichment due to the noise from the dead-end non-packaged variants. The original packaged library (Round 0) may be the better common denominator to follow DE enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers it would be interesting to determine whether Round 0 is a better common denominator to follow DE enrichment, and while this manuscript is focused mainly on the single-cell RNA-seq-based scAAVengr pipeline, we are currently evaluating whether Round 0 may be a better common denominator. This is the focus of a subsequent manuscript in preparation. We have addressed this concern in the manuscript, by including the following text in the discussion: “Here, the best performing variants were determined by using the cloned AAV library as the denominator for evaluation. Additional work will be required to determine whether the packaged library (Round 0) may be a better common denominator to follow DE enrichment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The figures used in the manuscript are helpful for presenting the complex data described, but took significant effort to interpret. Inclusion of more complete descriptions of how to &quot;read&quot; the figures in the legends would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have included additional text in figure legends in order to help with interpretation of figures.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers comments for the authors:</p><p>1) The newly added experiments described in figure 5B do not really address transduction-competition in a context that is relevant to the main story (the intravitreal injection environment), and does not quantify the transduction events produced by the serotypes relevant to the main story (ie K912).</p><p>Example: if K912 was evolved for transduction (TD) of cells in the intravitreal environment, it may no longer be fit to TD HEK293. Therefore quantifying of the TD-efficiency of the would-be competitors is also warranted in order to demonstrate that the model is relevant. Please address this concern by further stating caveats/limitations of this data.</p><p>Without testing these variants singly, these experiments do not address whether AAV2's poor performance in the intravitreal environment in the context of the mixed library was due to direct (binding) competition by serotypes that were &quot;more fit&quot;, or just AAV2 lack of suitability altogether.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree with this concern, and we have quantified the performance of other variants included in the experiment, including K912. This additional data shows that K912 retains its ability to infect HEK293 cells, and that the performance of K912, as well as the other variants, is constant in this context, despite the presence of additional variants. In addition, we have added the following text to the discussion “However, in vivo confirmation of this finding is warranted, as the barriers affecting the dynamics of infection may differ in a more complex environment, such as the retina.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The overall body of work deals with many layers of &quot;mixes, pools, libraries, etc.&quot; Phrasing and references to these various entities seemed inconsistent or ambiguous at times leading to significant confusion for this reviewer. I recommend that some space be given to explicitly defining the various groups/mixes/pools, and then maintaining that vocabulary throughout the text. (see line 824, 825. please provide definition of &quot;cloned AAV library&quot; vs &quot;packaged library&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have clarified the various libraries used in the manuscript and ensured that our vocabulary is consistent. Additionally, we have added a supplemental figure illustrating the various libraries and pools used throughout the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Likewise, this work deals with several layers of &quot;barcoding&quot; (sorted cell barcode, mRNA unique molecular identifier, and viral payload (GFP barcode). Again, phrasing and references to these various entities seemed inconsistent or ambiguous at times leading to significant confusion for this reviewer. Again, I recommend that some more space be given to definition and graphic representation.</p><p>One example of barcode related confusion: It appears that the &quot;GFP barcoding&quot; for variant serotypes do not allow for quantification of multiple infections by the same serotype. (That is for example: all K912 TD events are binned by the same unique barcode associated with the GFP payload, see line 471). This is different from the description of the barcoding of AAV2 in Figure 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that all K912 TD events are binned by the same barcode. The AAV’s used in the primate scAAVengr study were tracked by AAV-barcodes, with one unique barcode for each AAV serotype. The AAV’s used to infect HEK293 cells in Figure 5C were packaged with random barcodes comprised of n=64, 4,096, 262,144, or 268,435,456 unique members. Thus, the number of unique barcodes recovered indicates the number of different AAVs that infected cells and were recovered through the 10x pipeline. We have clarified the various barcodes used in the manuscript and ensured that our vocabulary is consistent. Additionally, we have added a supplemental figure illustrating the barcoding strategies used throughout the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
