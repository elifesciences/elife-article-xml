(<italic>KCNB1</italic>) or Kv2.2 (<italic>KCNB2</italic>). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (<italic>KCNF1</italic>), Kv6.1 (<italic>KCNG1</italic>), Kv6.2 (<italic>KCNG2</italic>), Kv6.3 (<italic>KCNG3</italic>), Kv6.4 (<italic>KCNG4</italic>), Kv8.1 (<italic>KCNV1</italic>), Kv8.2 (<italic>KCNV2</italic>), Kv9.1 (<italic>KCNS1</italic>), Kv9.2 (<italic>KCNS2</italic>), and Kv9.3 (<italic>KCNS3</italic>). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>voltage-gated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>RY785</kwd><kwd>guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX)</kwd><kwd>chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells</kwd><kwd>mouse neurons</kwd><kwd>human neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016257</institution-id><institution>University of California Davis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03-TR004200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Marquis</surname><given-names>Matthew James</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferns</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Sack</surname><given-names>Jon T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-NS127216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Jo</surname><given-names>Sooyeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25-NS063307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Aberra</surname><given-names>Aman S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Verity</given-names></name><name><surname>Whiddon</surname><given-names>Zachary</given-names></name><name><surname>Sack</surname><given-names>Jon T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03-TR004200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Marquis</surname><given-names>Matthew James</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferns</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Sack</surname><given-names>Jon T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publicatio</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Drugs are identified that unmask molecular origins of certain neuronal potassium currents, enabling functional analysis of previously indistinguishable potassium channel subtypes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Kv2 voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel subunits, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, are broadly expressed in electrically excitable cells throughout the body and have important ion-conducting and non-conducting functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trimmer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirmiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vierra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsumoto et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with this widespread expression, Kv2 channels have profound impacts on many aspects of our physiology including vision, seizure suppression, stroke recovery, pain signaling, blood pressure, insulin secretion, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocksteins, 2016</xref>). Although modulation of Kv2 channels may hold therapeutic promise, Kv2 subunits are poor systemic drug targets due to their importance in many tissues.</p><p>A potential source of molecular diversity for Kv2 channels are a group of Kv2-related proteins which have been referred to as regulatory, silent, or KvS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bocksteins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobertz, 2018</xref>). KvS subunits are an understudied class of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel (Kv) subunits that comprise one fourth of mammalian Kv subunit types. Like all other Kv proteins, the ten KvS proteins (Kv5.1, Kv6.1–6.4, Kv8.1–8.2, and Kv9.1–9.3) are alpha subunits with a voltage sensor and pore domain. Distinct from other Kv alpha subunits, KvS have not been found to form functional homomeric channels. Rather, KvS alpha subunits co-assemble with Kv2 alpha subunits to form heterotetrameric Kv2/KvS channels in which the KvS subunit makes up part of the K<sup>+</sup>-conductive pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salinas et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>). Kv2/KvS heteromers have biophysical properties distinct from those of homomeric Kv2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Post et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Richardson and Kaczmarek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocksteins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocksteins et al., 2017</xref>). KvS mRNAs are expressed in tissue and cell-specific manners that overlap with Kv2.1 or Kv2.2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocksteins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocksteins and Snyders, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocksteins, 2016</xref>). These expression patterns and functional effects suggest that Kv2 conductances in many cell types might be Kv2/KvS heteromeric conductances. Consistent with narrow expression of the many KvS subunits, genetic mutations and gene-targeting studies have linked disruptions in the function of different KvS subunits to defects in distinct organ systems including retinal cone dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inamdar et al., 2022</xref>), male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Regnier et al., 2017</xref>), seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorge et al., 2011</xref>), and changes in pain sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsantoulas et al., 2018</xref>). These organ-specific disruptions suggest that each KvS subunit selectively modulates a subset of Kv2 channels. However, studies of the physiological roles of KvS subunits have been hindered by a lack of tools to identify native KvS conductances. Due to limited KvS pharmacology, there is little evidence that definitively ascribes native K<sup>+</sup> conductances to KvS-containing channels. While studies have identified native conductances attributed to KvS subunits (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocksteins, 2016</xref>), it has not been clear whether the Kv2 conductances that are prominent in many electrically-excitable cell types are carried by Kv2-only channels, or Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels.</p><p>No drugs are known to be selective for KvS subunits. However, Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels do have some pharmacology distinct from channels that contain only Kv2 subunits. Quaternary ammonium compounds, 4-aminopyridine, and other broad-spectrum K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers have different potencies against certain KvS-containing channels as compared to Kv2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Post et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thorneloe and Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stas et al., 2015</xref>). However, these blockers are poorly selective and cannot effectively isolate Kv2/KvS conductances from the many other voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> conductances of electrically excitable cells.</p><p>Highly selective Kv2 channel inhibitors fall into two mechanistically distinct classes. One class is the inhibitory cystine knot peptides from spiders. An exemplar of this class is the tarantula toxin guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX), which has remarkable specificity for Kv2 channel subunits over other voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrington et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thapa et al., 2021</xref>). GxTX binds to the voltage sensor of each Kv2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milescu et al., 2009</xref>), and stabilizes that voltage sensor in a resting state to prevent channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tilley et al., 2019</xref>). GxTX binding requires a specific sequence of residues, TIFLTES, at the extracellular end of the Kv2 subunit S3 transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milescu et al., 2013</xref>). This GxTX-binding sequence is conserved between Kv2 channels but is not retained by any KvS subunit. A second class of selective Kv2 inhibitors is a family of small molecules discovered in a high throughput screen for use-dependent Kv2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrington et al., 2011</xref>). Of these, RY785 is the most selective for Kv2 channels over other channel types. RY785 acts like a pore blocker which binds in the central cavity of Kv2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquis and Sack, 2022</xref>). The central cavity-lining residues of all KvS subunits have differences from Kv2 subunits. We recently reported that coexpression of Kv5.1 with Kv2.1 led to a conductance that was resistant to RY785 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferns et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we develop a method to isolate conductances of KvS-containing channels. We identify that the combination of GxTX and RY785 can distinguish conductances of Kv2-only channels from channels that contain the KvS subtypes, Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9. To determine whether cell types enriched with KvS mRNA have functional KvS-containing channels, we use these inhibitors to reveal native neuronal conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. While this study does not address the impact of GxTX or RY785 on action potentials or in vivo, the distinct pharmacology of Kv2/KvS heteromers presented here suggests that KvS conductances could be targeted to selectively modulate discrete subsets of cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers are resistant to RY785 and sensitive to GxTX</title><p>To identify a pharmacological strategy to distinguish Kv2/KvS heteromeric conductances from other endogenous neuronal conductances, we determined the Kv2/KvS selectivity of known Kv2 inhibitors. To test whether Kv2 inhibitors also inhibit Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels, we transfected KvS cDNA into a stable cell line which was subsequently induced to express Kv2.1 (Kv2.1-CHO) and later recorded whole cell currents. We previously found that 1 μM RY785 or 100 nM GxTX blocked almost all the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> conductance of this Kv2.1-CHO cell line, with 1±2% or 0 ± 0.1% (mean ± SEM) current remaining respectively at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tilley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquis and Sack, 2022</xref>). To test the pharmacological response of KvS we began with Kv8.1, a subunit that creates heteromers with biophysical properties distinct from Kv2 homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>), and modulates motor neuron vulnerability to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). After transfection of Kv8.1 into Kv2.1-CHO cells, we find that a sizable component of the delayed rectifier current became resistant to 1 μM RY785 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This RY785-resistant current was inhibited by 100 nM GxTX, suggesting that the GxTX-sensitivity arises from inclusion of Kv2.1 subunits in the channels underlying the RY785-resistant current. A simple interpretation is that RY785-resistant yet GxTX-sensitive currents are carried by Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromeric channels. The fraction of RY785-resistant current had a pronounced cell-to-cell variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Co-expression of KvS and Kv2 subunits can result in Kv2 homomers and Kv2/KvS heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pisupati et al., 2018</xref>), and we presume variability in the RY785-sensitive fraction results from cell-to-cell variability in the proportion of Kv8.1-containing channels.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers are resistant to RY785 and sensitive to GxTX.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exemplar traces from a voltage-clamped Kv2.1-CHO cell transfected with Kv8.1.

In Kv2.1-CHO cells transfected with Navβ2, 1 μM RY785 efficiently blocked Kv2.1 conductance, leaving 4 ± 0.6% (mean ± SEM) of current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). We also transfected Kv2.1-CHO cells with a member of the AMIGO family of Kv2-regulating transmembrane proteins. AMIGO1 promotes voltage sensor activation of Kv2.1 channels in these Kv2.1-CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sepela et al., 2022</xref>). 1 μM RY785 blocked Kv2.1 conductances in cells transfected with AMIGO1, leaving 0.6 ± 1% (SEM) of current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These control experiments indicate that transfection of a set of other transmembrane proteins did not confer resistance to RY785, suggesting that the RY785 resistance is not generically induced by overexpression of non-KvS transmembrane proteins.</p><p>To determine whether Kv8.1-containing channels are completely resistant to RY785, we performed an RY785 concentration-effect experiment. To pre-block Kv2.1 homomers, we began concentration-effect measurements at 0.35 μM RY785, which we expect to block 98% of homomers based on the estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 6 nM RY785 for the Kv2.1 currents in these Kv2.1-CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquis and Sack, 2022</xref>). Notably, currents resistant to 0.35 μM RY785 were blocked by higher concentrations of RY785, with nearly complete block observed in 35 μM RY785 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We quantified block of tail currents at –9 mV following a 200ms step to +71 mV, and normalized to current from the initial 0.35 μM RY785 treatment. This protocol revealed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5±1 μM (SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The Hill coefficient of 1.2±0.2 is consistent with 1:1 binding to a homogenous population of RY785-inhibited channels. We had noted that solution exchanges can change current amplitudes, and interleaved time-matched solution exchange controls. These controls revealed variable current rundown of approximately 30% on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Time-matched control washes were followed by treatment with 35 μM RY785 to confirm that currents in these cells had similar RY785 sensitivity to those in our concentration-effect experiment. Following block by 35 μM RY785, washing with 0.35 μM RY785 caused increases in current amplitudes in every trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The run-down and incomplete wash-out indicates that the 5 μM IC<sub>50</sub> of RY785 for these resistant channels may be an underestimate. Kv2.1/Kv8.1 currents were unblocked in the first current test following RY785 washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This rapid recovery indicates that unblocking of Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers occurred during the less than 3 min wash time at –89 mV, or that RY785 unblocked on the millisecond time scale during activating voltage pulses. This is distinct from Kv2.1 homomers, where RY785 becomes trapped in deactivated channels and unblocks much more slowly, with a time constant of about 2 hr at –92 mV or 100 s at +28 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquis and Sack, 2022</xref>). The dramatically faster unblock from Kv2.1/Kv8.1 is consistent with the weaker affinity observed for RY785. Overall, the results suggest that Kv8.1-containing channels in these Kv2.1-CHO cells form a pharmacologically homogenous population with an affinity for RY785 ~3 orders of magnitude weaker than Kv2.1 homomers. Our estimates of the affinities of Kv2.1 homomeric and Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromeric channels for RY785 suggest that ~1 μM RY785 elicits nearly complete block of Kv2.1 homomer conductance while blocking little Kv2.1/KvS heteromer conductance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RY785 blocks Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers in a concentration-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Current amplitudes during an RY785 concentration-effect experiment on a Kv2.1-CHO cell transfected with Kv8.1.

Previous studies have identified that Kv2/Kv8.1 gating kinetics are distinct from Kv2 homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>), and we set out to identify whether RY785-resistant currents from Kv8.1 transfected CHO cells had similarly modulated kinetics. While concentrations of RY785 that partially block Kv2.1/Kv8.1 modified the kinetics of voltage-dependent gating, suggesting state-dependent block, we did not observe modification of kinetics with 3.5 μM or lower concentrations of RY785 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To study the biophysical properties of the Kv8.1 conductance in the Kv2.1-CHO cells, we analyzed currents in 1 μM RY785 to block the Kv2.1 homomers. For comparison, Kv2.1-CHO cells were transfected with a control plasmid and treated with a DMSO vehicle control. We stepped cells to –9 mV from a holding potential of –89 mV and fit the current rise with an exponential function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref>). Cells transfected with Kv8.1 and blocked with 1 μM RY785 had a significantly slower activation time constant and lower sigmoidicity (shorter relative activation delay) than those only expressing Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Conductance-voltage relations were fit with a Boltzmann function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">equation 2</xref>) revealing that the half-maximal conductance of Kv8.1-transfected cells is shifted positive relative to Kv2.1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). We did not detect a significant difference in the steepness (z) of the conductance-voltage relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Currents from Kv8.1-transfected cells inactivated less during a 10 s step to –9 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). However, the steady-state inactivation of Kv8.1-transfected cells was shifted to more negative voltages and is less steep than Kv2.1-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>). We did not observe substantial changes in current amplitude in cells treated with DMSO vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the biophysical properties reported here are consistent with a previous report which identified that co-expression of Kv8.1 with Kv2.1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes slows the rate of activation, reduces inactivation and shifts steady-state inactivation to more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>). This previous report also identified a positive shift in the conductance-voltage relation when Kv8.1 is co-expressed with a Kv2 subunit (Kv2.2), similar to our findings with Kv2.1/Kv8.1. Together these results show that RY785-resistant currents in cells transfected with Kv8.1 are distinct from Kv2.1 homomer currents and have changes in gating consistent with prior reports of Kv8.1/Kv2 biophysics.

Rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons have robust GxTX-sensitive conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Bean, 2014</xref>) yet transcriptomics have revealed little evidence of KvS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sapio et al., 2020</xref>). We investigated whether SCG neurons have conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers. As functional characterization alone cannot be trusted to classify their channel mediators of conductances, we define conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers as 'KvS-like' and conductances consistent with Kv2 homomers as 'Kv2-like'. To help isolate Kv2-like and KvS-like currents, we bathed SCG neurons in a cocktail of Nav, Cav, Kv1, Kv3, and Kv4 inhibitors then recorded voltage-gated currents. We found that exposing SCG neurons to 1 μM RY785 inhibited most of the voltage-gated current, and subsequent addition of 100 nM GxTX to the same neurons inhibited little additional current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To quantify inhibition, we analyzed tail currents 10ms after repolarizing to –45 mV. This time window was chosen because a hallmark of Kv2 currents is relatively slow deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thorneloe and Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).

Subsequent application of 100 nM GxTX had little further effect. To determine if the RY785-sensitive conductances are consistent with previous reports of Kv2 channels, we examined the biophysical properties of the Kv2-like (RY785-sensitive) currents defined by subtraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Current activation began to be apparent at –45 mV and had a conductance that was half maximal at –11 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We investigated whether these neurons have conductances consistent with KvS-like pharmacology by performing whole cell voltage clamp on cultured DRG neurons that had clear GFP fluorescence. Voltage-clamped neurons were bathed in the same cocktail of channel inhibitors used on SCG neurons, plus the Nav1.8 inhibitor A-803467. Application of 1 μM RY785 inhibited outward currents somewhat, but unlike in SCG neurons, a prominent delayed-rectifier outward conductance with slow deactivation remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> left panel). Tail currents in 1 μM RY785 decreased 29 ± 3% (mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> left panel). Subsequent application of 100 nM GxTX decreased tail currents by 68 ± 5% (mean ± SEM) of their original amplitude before RY785. We do not know the identity of the outward current that remains in the cocktail of inhibitors + RY785+GxTX. We observed variable current run-up or run-down but no significant effect of vehicle in blinded, interleaved experiments, while RY785 significantly decreased tail currents relative to vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> right panel). We do not know what conductances the vehicle solution exchange affects, the changes appear to be time-dependent or due to the solution exchange itself.

While changes in inactivation are prominent with KvS subunits, we did not investigate inactivation in neurons because the lengthy depolarizations required often resulted in irreversible leak current increases that degraded the accuracy of RY785/GxTX subtraction current quantification. We did note that the KvS-like currents deactivated slower than Kv2-like currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), consistent with the effects of several KvS subunits whose transcripts are expressed in nociceptor DRG neurons.

Together, these results indicate that, in these mouse DRG neurons, RY785-sensitive currents are Kv2-like, while RY785-resistant yet GxTX-sensitive currents are KvS-like. Under these conditions, 58 ± 3% (mean ± SEM) of the delayed rectifier conductance was resistant to RY785 yet sensitive to GxTX (KvS-like; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We note that the ratio of KvS- to Kv2-like conductances is expected to vary with holding potential, as KvS subunits can change the degree and voltage-dependence of steady state inactivation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>We also tested the other major mouse C-fiber nociceptor population, peptidergic nociceptors, to determine if this subpopulation also has conductances resistant to RY785 yet sensitive to GxTX.

RY785 blocks homomeric Kv2 channels, and subsequent application of GxTX selectively inhibits Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels. Such a protocol can aid in identification of Kv2/KvS conductances separately from the Kv2 homomer conductances that are likely to be in the same cell. Characterization of these now separable conductances can reveal impacts of Kv2 channels and KvS-containing channels on electrophysiological signaling. This is valuable as there are few other tools to probe the contributions of KvS subunits to electrical signaling in native cells and tissues.</p><p>It is remarkable that resistance to RY785 is shared across all of the KvS subtypes. We found Kv2.1/Kv8.1 conductances to be ~1000 times less sensitive to RY785 than Kv2.1 homomer conductances in the same cell line. Based on the observation that &gt;50% of Kv current was resistant to 1 µM RY785 in some Kv2.1-CHO cells transfected with Kv5.1, Kv6.4, or Kv9.3, these Kv2.1/KvS channels are expected to have IC<sub>50</sub> &gt;1 µM, at least 100-fold less sensitive than the ~6 nM IC<sub>50</sub> for Kv2.1 in this cell line. This suggests that the RY785 inhibitory site is substantially disrupted by KvS subunits. We analyzed computational structural models of RY785 docked to a Kv2.1 homomer and a 3:1 Kv2.1:Kv8.1 heteromer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) to gain structural insight into how KvS subunits might interfere with RY785 binding. We used Rosetta to dock RY785 to a cryo-EM structure of a Kv2.1 homomer in an apparently open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-Mariño et al., 2023</xref>). The top-scoring docking pose has RY785 positioned below the selectivity filter and off-axis of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), similar to a stable pose observed in molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). In this pose, RY785 contacts a collection of Kv2.1 residues that vary in every KvS subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B, D and E</xref>). Notably, RY785 bound similarly to a 3:1 model of Kv2.1/Kv8.1, in contact with the three Kv2.1 subunits, yet avoided the Kv8.1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This is consistent with RY785 binding less well to Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers, and also suggests that a 3:1 Kv2:KvS channel could retain an RY785 binding site when open. However, the RY785 resistance of Kv2/KvS heteromers may primarily arise from perturbed interactions with the constricted central cavity of closed channels. In homomeric Kv2.1, RY785 becomes trapped in closed channels and prevents their voltage sensors from fully activating, indicating that RY785 must interact differently with closed channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marquis and Sack, 2022</xref>). Here we found that Kv2.1/Kv8.1 current rapidly recovers following washout of RY785, suggesting that Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers do not readily trap RY785 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the structural modeling suggests that KvS subunits sterically interfere with RY785 binding to the central cavity, while functional data suggest KvS subunits disrupt RY785 trapping in closed states.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Structural models of RY785 docked to a Kv2.1 homomer and 3:1 Kv2.1:Kv8.1 heteromer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of RY785 docked to a Kv2.1 homomer (PDB 8SD3).

Any of these could alter the RY785 IC<sub>50</sub>. Pharmacology can yield surprises, such as the unexpected resistance of human Nav1.7 to saxitoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walker et al., 2012</xref>). The degree of resistance to RY785 may vary among KvS subunits as with other central cavity drugs such as tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Post et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thorneloe and Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stas et al., 2015</xref>). Also, the degree of resistance to RY785 may vary if Kv2:KvS subunit stoichiometry varies. With high doses of RY785, we found that the concentration-response characteristics of Kv2.1/Kv8.1 in CHO cells revealed hallmarks of a homogenous channel population with a Hill slope close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, other KvS subunits might assemble in multiple stoichiometries and result in pharmacologically-distinct heteromer populations.</p><p>Second, it is possible that RY785 can modulate other voltage-gated channels. However, we think RY785 is unlikely to have substantial off-target effects, as RY785 is much less potent against other non-Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channel subfamilies as well as voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrington et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Third, concentrations of RY785 which partially blocked Kv2.1/Kv8.1 modified the gating of the voltage-activated conductance, indicating that RY785 can alter properties of heteromer conductance. Also, channel state-dependent binding is expected to influence the affinity of RY785. These effects could create complications in analyzing current subtractions.</p><p>Fourth, these are functional characterizations of currents and should not be solely trusted to classify the molecular identity of the underlying channels. While it seems unlikely that pore-forming subunits other than KvS subunits complex with Kv2 subunits, other factors could potentially disrupt the RY785 pharmacology as KvS subunits do. Regulation of Kv2 channel gating could potentially allosterically disrupt RY785 inhibition. Extensive homeostatic regulation of Kv2.1 gating maintains neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Misonou et al., 2006</xref>; for example, ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Misonou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aras et al., 2009</xref>), glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Misonou et al., 2008</xref>), phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murakoshi et al., 1997</xref>), SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plant et al., 2011</xref>), and AMIGO auxiliary subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peltola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maverick et al., 2021</xref>) all alter Kv2 gating. Intriguingly, some KvS subunits are reported to functionally interact with Kv7 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Renigunta et al., 2024</xref>). Also, the cocktail of inhibitors used in most neuron experiments here could potentially alter RY785 or GxTX action against KvS/Kv2 channels.</p><p>Despite these possibilities, we think the most parsimonious interpretation of RY785-resistant, GxTX-sensitive conductances is that they are produced by heteromeric Kv2/KvS channels. However, it is important to consider these other possibilities when interpreting RY785 resistance of GxTX-sensitive conductances. With these caveats in mind, we suggest that RY785-resistance combined with GxTX-sensitivity is strong evidence for heteromeric Kv2/KvS currents.</p><p>Delayed-rectifier Kv2-like conductances are prominent in many electrically excitable cell types. While we found only RY785-sensitive Kv2-like conductances in SCG neurons, Kv2/KvS heteromer-like conductances were dominant in DRG neurons. This striking contrast is consistent with KvS transcript abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sapio et al., 2020</xref>). Beyond these cell types, it is unclear how prevalent Kv2/KvS heteromer conductances are. While Kv2 subunits are broadly expressed in electrically excitable cells throughout the brain and body, transcripts for KvS subunits have unique expression patterns that are specific to each KvS subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocksteins, 2016</xref>) and can fluctuate with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Regnier et al., 2016</xref>). However, transcript levels alone are not sufficient to predict protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). We found recently that native Kv2 channels in mouse brain contain KvS subunit proteins, including Kv5.1, Kv8.1, Kv9.1, and Kv9.2. Notably, the KvS mass spectral abundance relative to Kv2.1 ranged from ≈18% for Kv5.1–2% for Kv9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferns et al., 2025</xref>), and Kv5.1 protein expression was largely restricted to cortical neurons. Thus, it seems likely that significant Kv2/KvS heteromeric conductances also exist in specific subsets of brain neurons.</p><p>The physiological role of Kv2/KvS heteromers in neurons and other excitable cells remains enigmatic. Previous studies have used knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Regnier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyamae et al., 2021</xref>), transient transfection of KvS subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsantoulas et al., 2012</xref>), and modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyamae et al., 2021</xref>) to probe the presence of endogenous and functional KvS-containing channels, and these methods can identify phenotypic changes that suggest potential roles of KvS-containing channels. Application of GxTX in vivo could be used to probe the physiological roles of Kv2 with or without KvS subunits, while RY785 selectively targets Kv2-only channels. Genetic mutations and gene targeting studies have linked disruptions in the function of KvS-containing channels to epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jorge et al., 2011</xref>), neuropathic pain sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsantoulas et al., 2018</xref>), labor pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) and retinal cone dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inamdar et al., 2022</xref>), stressing their functional importance in specific cell types. The unique pharmacology of KvS-containing channels identified here provides a new and direct method of identifying conductances mediated by KvS-containing channels in native neurons and establishing what contributions KvS subunits make to electrophysiological signaling.</p><p>Finally, these findings also support the potential utility of KvS channels as drug targets. Kv2-targeted drug leads have poor tissue and cell specificity and suffer from pronounced side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

The liquid junction potential of –9 mV between these solutions was accounted for. The liquid junction potential was calculated according to the stationary Nernst–Planck equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marino.M and Brogioli, 2014</xref>) using LJPcalc (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_025044">SCR_025044</ext-link>).

Cells were then added to a recording chamber (Warner, 64–0381) and were rinsed with the CHO-external patching solution after adhering to the bottom of the recording chamber. Transfected Kv2.1-CHO cells were identified by GFP fluorescence and were selected for whole cell voltage clamp. Thin-wall borosilicate glass recording pipettes (Sutter, BF150-110-10) were pulled with blunt tips, coated with silicone elastomer (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning), heat cured, and tip fire-polished to resistances less than 4 MΩ. Series resistance of 2–14 MΩ was estimated from the Sutterpatch whole-cell parameters routine. Series resistance compensation between 13 and 90% was used to constrain voltage error to less than 15 mV; compensation feedback lag was 6 µs for most experiments or 100 µs for concentration-effect experiments. Capacitance and ohmic leak were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. Output was low-pass filtered at 5 kHz using the amplifier’s built-in Bessel and digitized at 25 kHz or, for concentration-effect experiments, 1 and 10 kHz. Experiments were performed on Kv2.1-CHO cells with membrane resistance greater than 1 GΩ assessed prior to running voltage clamp protocols while cells were held at a membrane potential of –89 mV. RY785 (gift from Bruce Bean, Harvard, or Cayman, 19813) was prepared in DMSO as a 1 mM stock for dilutions to 1 µM or a 35 mM stock for concentration-effect experiments. Stocks of GxTX-1E Met35Nle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tilley et al., 2014</xref>) in water were 10 µM. Stocks were stored frozen and diluted in recording solution just prior to application to cells. Solutions were flushed over cells at a rate of approximately 1 ml/min. Concentrated RY785 and GxTX stocks were stored at –20 °C. Kv2.1-CHO cells were given voltage steps from –89 mV to –9 mV for 200ms every 6 s during application of RY785 until currents stabilized. When vehicle control was applied to cells, –9 mV steps were given for a similar duration. All RY785 solutions contained 0.1% DMSO. Vehicle control solutions also contained 0.1% DMSO but lacked RY785. Perfusion lines were cleaned with 70% ethanol then doubly-deionized water. For concentration-effect experiments, changes in current amplitude due to solution exchange were controlled for by treating every other tested cell with multiple washes of the same, 0.35 μM RY785 solution instead of increasing concentrations of RY785. The timing and duration of these control washes was similar to that of the washes in concentration-effect experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole cell voltage clamp of mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons</title><p>Whole cell recordings from <italic>Mrgprd<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mouse and human neurons were performed using the same methods as CHO cell recordings with the following exceptions.

It is possible that off target effects of blockers may introduce errors in the quantification Kv2/KvS heteromer-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents. For example, 4-aminopyridine is expected to block a small fraction, 2%, of Kv2 homomers and have a lesser impact on Kv2/KvS heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Post et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thorneloe and Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stas et al., 2015</xref>) which could result in a slight overestimation of the ratio of Kv2/KvS heteromers to Kv2 homomers. After addition of 1 μM RY785, neurons were given 10 steps to –24 mV for 500ms to allow for voltage dependent block of RY785. Thin-wall borosilicate glass recording pipettes were pulled with blunt tips, coated with silicone elastomer, heat cured, and tip fire-polished to resistances less than 2 MΩ. Series resistance of 1–4 MΩ was estimated from the whole-cell parameters circuit. Series resistance compensation between 55 and 98% was used to constrain voltage error to less than 15 mV. Ohmic leak was not subtracted. Neurons were held at a membrane potential of –74 mV to mimic a physiological resting potential. KvS subunits can profoundly shift the voltage-inactivation relation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerschensteiner and Stocker, 1999</xref>) and this potential is likely insufficiently negative to relieve inactivation from all Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels. Also, the activation membrane potential is close to the half-maximal point of Kv2/KvS conductances. Thus the ratio of Kv2-like to KvS-like conductance is expected to vary with voltage protocols.</p><p>Whole cell recordings from <italic>Calca<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice were made using the same methods as <italic>Mrgprd<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice with the following exceptions.

While analysis of tail currents could skew the quantification of total Kv2 like and KvS-like conductances, our data supports that mouse nociceptors and human neurons have tail currents that are resistant to RY785 and sensitive to GxTX consistent with the presence of Kv2/KvS heteromers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Preparation of rKv2.1 and hKv2.1/hKv8.1 docking inputs</title><p>The rKv2.1 homomer (PDB ID: 8SD3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-Mariño et al., 2023</xref>) was energy minimized using cryo-EM structure refinement with Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

To provide the same pore conformation as input between homomer and heteromer docking, the Kv8.1 subunit from ColabFold was superimposed to a Kv2.1 subunit from the energy-minimized model used for homomer docking; this heteromer model was then energy minimized by fixing the Kv2.1 backbone and sidechain chi torsion angles while allowing the Kv8.1 backbone and sidechain chi torsion angles to minimize with Rosetta FastRelax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tyka et al., 2011</xref>) using the BetaNov16 scoring function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pavlovicz et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Preparation of RY785 docking input</title><p>RY785 was extracted as a structure data file from PubChem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2023</xref>).

Briefly, GALigandDock in the flexible docking mode was used with a padding value of 7 Å, 20 generations with a pool of 100 poses, and the entire pool of poses as output. With this run mode, the entire pore cavity had the potential to be sampled with side chain flexibility. We ran GALigandDock 100 times, generating 10,000 total models for both the rKv2.1 homomer and hKv2.1/hKv8.1 heteromer. The top 10 models were selected for visual inspection by sorting the top 10% of models by total score, followed with the top 10 of the subset by interface score.

Many neurons express both types of subunits and therefore have the capacity to make both homomeric Kv2 channels and heteromeric Kv2/KvS channels. Determining the contributions of each of these channel types to native potassium currents has been very difficult because the differences in biophysical properties are modest and there are no Kv2/KvS-specific pharmacological tools. The authors set out to design a strategy to separate Kv2 and Kv2/KvS currents in native neurons based on their observation that Kv2/KvS channels have little sensitivity to the Kv2 pore blocker RY785 but are blocked by the Kv2 VSD blocker GxTx. They clearly demonstrate that Kv2/KvS currents can be differentiated from Kv2 currents in native neurons using a two-step strategy to first selectively block Kv2 with RY785, and then block both with GxTx. The manuscript is beautifully written; takes a very complex problem and strategy and breaks it down so both channel experts and the broad neuroscience community can understand it.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The compounds the authors use are highly selective and unlikely to have significant confounding cross-reactivity to other channel types. The authors provide strong evidence that all Kv2/KvS channels are resistant to RY785. This is a strength of the strategy - it can likely identify Kv2/KvS channels containing any of the 10 mammalian KvS subunits and thus be used as a general reagent on all types of neurons. The limitation then of course is that it can't differentiate the subtypes, but at this stage, the field really just needs to know how much Kv2/KvS channels contribute to native currents and this strategy provides a sound way to do so.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors are very clear about the limitations of their strategy, the most important of which is that they can't differentiate different subunit combinations of Kv2/KvS heteromers.

The authors have kept all the strong points I liked from the first round and made it even stronger with their thoughtful and substantive responses to reviews. My first review was strongly supportive, and my initial short assessment/public review was written with the assumption that they would be public and the paper would be published essentially in its original form. All those points still apply so I am going to leave the initial reviews as is. The paper is a pleasure to read and a nice contribution to the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99410.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors used combined blockers/modulators to dissect the potassium currents mediated by inter-subunit heteromeric Kv channels.

It is believed that these channels fine-tune the voltage-activated K+ currents that repolarize the membrane potential during action potentials, with a direct effect on cell excitability, mostly by determining action potentials firing frequency.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>What makes silent Kv subunits even more important is that, by being expressed in specific tissues and cell types, different silent Kv subunits may have the ability to fine-tune the delayed rectifying voltage-activated K+ currents that are one of the currents that crucially determine cell excitability in these cells. The present manuscript introduces a pharmacological method to dissect the voltage-activated K+ currents mediated by Kv2/KvS heteromers as a means of starting to unveil their importance, together with Kv2-only channels, to the cells where they are expressed.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the method is effective in quantifying these currents in any isolated cell under an electric voltage clamp, it is ineffective as a modulating maneuver to perhaps address these currents in an in vivo experimental setting.

Additionally, to test whether the KvS isolation strategy requires the cocktail in neurons, we performed new experiments on a different subclass of nociceptors without the blocker cocktail and identified a substantial KvS-like component (new Fig 7 Supplement 3).</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>“After whole-cell voltage clamp was established, non-Kv2/KvS conductances were suppressed by changing to an external solution containing a cocktail of inhibitors: 100 nM alpha-dendrotoxin (Alomone) to block Kv1 (Harvey and Robertson, 2004), 3 μM AmmTX3 (Alomone) to block Kv4 (Maffie et al., 2013; Pathak et al., 2016), 100 μM 4-aminopyridine to block Kv3 (Coetzee et al., 1999; Gutman et al., 2005), 1 μM TTX to block TTX sensitive Nav channels, and 10 μM A803467 (Tocris) to block Nav1.8 (Jarvis et al., 2007). It is possible that off target effects of blockers may introduce errors in the quantification Kv2/KvS heteromer-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents. For example, 4-aminopyridine is expected to block a small fraction, 2%, of Kv2 homomers and have a lesser impact on Kv2/KvS heteromers (Post et al., 1996; Thorneloe and Nelson, 2003; Stas et al., 2015) which could result in a slight overestimation of the ratio of Kv2/KvS heteromers to Kv2 homomers.”</p><p>“We also tested the other major mouse C-fiber nociceptor population, peptidergic nociceptors, to determine if this subpopulation also has conductances resistant to RY785 yet sensitive to GxTX.

However, quantifying inactivation of Kv2/KvS channels requires steps to positive voltages for approximately 10 seconds.

Consequently, we did not acquire inactivation data in neurons, and we now explain in the manuscript why such data was not obtained.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>“While changes in inactivation are prominent with KvS subunits, we did not investigate inactivation in neurons because the lengthy depolarizations required often resulted in irreversible leak current increases that degraded the accuracy of RY785/GxTX subtraction current quantification.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(vi) Functional characterization of currents only, as suggested by the authors as a bona fide of Kv2 and Kv2/KvS currents, should not be solely trusted to classify the currents and their channel mediators.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and now state explicitly that functional characterization cannot be trusted to classify their channel mediators of conductances, and we try to be clear about this throughout the manuscript by using soft terms such as &quot;KvS-like&quot; when identity is uncertain.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>“As functional characterization alone cannot be trusted to classify their channel mediators of conductances, we define conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers as 'KvS-like' and conductances consistent with Kv2 homomers as 'Kv2-like'.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>There is not a lot to do here - this was a real pleasure to read and very easy to understand, as written. Here are a few minor things to consider:</p><p>(1) The naming of the KvS subunits has always been confusing - it is not clear that Kv5,6,8,9 are members of the Kv2 subfamily from the names. KvS does a good job of differentiating them by assembly phenotype and has been used a lot in the literature, but it doesn't solve the misconception of what subfamily they belong to. This might not matter so much for mammals, where all KvS channels are in the Kv2 subfamily, but it makes it impossible to extend the naming system to other animals where subunits requiring heteromeric assembly are common in most subfamilies. How about trying the name Kv2S? It would have continuity with KvS in the reader's mind, make it clear that they are Kv2 subfamily, and make a naming system that could be extended beyond vertebrates. This is not a problem the authors created - just a completely optional suggestion on how to solve it if so inclined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that naming conventions for these subunits are problematic, and agonized quite a bit about nomenclature. In the end we chose to stick with the precedent of KvS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Another naming issue they should definitely change is the use of &quot;subfamily&quot; for the different KvS subtypes (Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9). This really creates confusion with the higher-order subfamilies that have a very clear functional definition: a subfamily of Kv genes is a group of related genes that have assembly compatibility. Those are Kv1, Kv2, Kv3 and Kv4. KvS genes are assembly compatible with Kv2, evolutionarily derived from the Kv2 lineage, and thus clearly a part of the Kv2 subfamily. Using a subfamily for the next lower level of the naming hierarchy confuses this. The authors should use different terms like sub-type or class or subgroups for the divisions within KvS.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have standardized to Kv2/KvS as a subfamily; Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9 as subtypes; and individual proteins, e.g. Kv8.1, as subunits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) When you discuss whether the KvS subunit directly disrupts Ry785 binding in the pore or works allosterically and you said you know which KvS residues point into the pore from models, I thought that maybe you could tell from a sequence alignment whether the KvS channels you didn't test look the same in the conduction pathway as the ones you did test. If so, you could mention that if the binding site is the pore, they should all be resistant. Alternatively, if one you didn't test looks fundamentally more similar to the Kv2s in this region, then maybe it could be fingered as a possible exception that needs to be tested later.</p></disp-quote><p>Great ideas. We now assess sequence KvS variability near the proposed RY785 binding site in all KvS subunits. We generated structural models of RY785 docking to Kv2.1 and Kv2.1/Kv8.1 and found that residues near RY785 are different in all KvS subunits.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><p>“We analyzed computational structural models of RY785 docked to a Kv2.1 homomer and a 3:1 Kv2.1:Kv8.1 heteromer (Fig 9) to gain structural insight into how KvS subunits might interfere with RY785 binding. We used Rosetta to dock RY785 to a cryo-EM structure of a Kv2.1 homomer in an apparently open state (Fernández-Mariño et al., 2023). The top-scoring docking pose has RY785 positioned below the selectivity filter and off-axis of the pore (Fig 9 A), similar to a stable pose observed in molecular dynamic simulations (Zhang et al., 2024). In this pose, RY785 contacts a collection of Kv2.1 residues that vary in every KvS subtype (Fig 9 B,D,E). Notably, RY785 bound similarly to a 3:1 model of Kv2.1/Kv8.1, in contact with the three Kv2.1 subunits, yet avoided the Kv8.1 subunit (Fig 9C). This is consistent with RY785 binding less well to Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers, and also suggests that a 3:1 Kv2:KvS channel could retain a RY785 binding site when open.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Future suggestion or tip - not for this paper. Your data shows your isolation strategy works really well on Kv6 channels, and these are also the Kv2/KvS channels that have the most pronounced biophysical changes. Working on neurons that have a prominent Kv2/Kv6 component would really show how well the strategy outlined here works to describe the physiology of native neurons. The highest KvS expression I have seen in public data in a wellstudied cell type is Kv6.4 in spinal motor neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Wonderful tip, thank you.

The term KvS-containing channels, and Kv2/KvS channels, seem more accurate. Uniformization in this regard will also make the manuscript more easily readable.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

This reference is important since it sets what are the Kv2.1-CHO cells. In this regard it is also important to mention, even better to address, the expressing qualities of this system in the face of a co-expression with a plasmid-based expression of silent Kv subunits. Are these two ways of expressing Kv subunits, meant to come together (or not) in heteromers, balanced? This question is critical here. Still, in regard to Kv2.1-CHO cells, it was not clear in the manuscript if the term &quot;transfection&quot; refers only to the plasmids used to temporarily induce the expression of silent Kv subunits and potentially Kv channels accessory subunits.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the Trapani &amp; Korn, 2003 reference (thank you for pointing out this accidental omission), and better explain expression methods. The benefit of the inducible Kv2.1 expression is control of Kv conductance densities which can otherwise become so large as to be refractory to voltage clamp. The beauty of the expression system is that cells recently transfected with KvS subunits can be induced to express just enough Kv2.1 to get a substantial but not clampoverwhelming RY785-resistant Kv2/KvS conductance. We also discuss that our expression methods are distinct from past studies.

To record from a consistent subpopulation of mouse somatosensory neurons which has been shown to contain GxTXsensitive currents and have abundant expression of KvS mRNA transcripts (Zheng et al., 2019), we used a <italic>MrgprdGFP</italic> transgenic mouse line which expresses GFP in nonpeptidergic nociceptors (Zylka et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2019). Deep sequencing identified that mRNA transcripts for Kv5.1, Kv6.2, Kv6.3, and Kv9.1 are present in GFP+ neurons of this mouse line (Zheng et al., 2019) and we confirmed the presence of Kv5.1 and Kv9.1 transcripts in GFP+ neurons from <italic>MrgprdGFP</italic> mice using RNAscope (Fig 7 Supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) In Figure 8B, were +RY data different from veh data?

The discussion section spends half of its space trying to elaborate on possible blocking/inhibiting/modulating mechanisms for RY785.

Notably, RY785 bound similarly to a 3:1 model of Kv2.1/Kv8.1, in contact with the three Kv2.1 subunits, yet avoided the Kv8.1 subunit (Fig 9C). This is consistent with RY785 binding less well to Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers, and also suggests that a 3:1 Kv2:KvS channel could retain a RY785 binding site when open. However, the RY785 resistance of Kv2/KvS heteromers may primarily arise from perturbed interactions with the constricted central cavity of closed channels. In homomeric Kv2.1, RY785 becomes trapped in closed channels and prevents their voltage sensors from fully activating, indicating that RY785 must interact differently with closed channels (Marquis and Sack, 2022). Here we found that Kv2.1/Kv8.1 current rapidly recovers following washout of RY785, suggesting that Kv2.1/Kv8.1 heteromers do not readily trap RY785 (Figure 2 Supplement). Overall, the structural modeling suggests that KvS subunits sterically interfere with RY785 binding to the central cavity, while functional data suggest KvS subunits disrupt RY785 trapping in closed states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) DISCUSSION.
