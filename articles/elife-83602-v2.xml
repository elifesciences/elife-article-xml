Specific therapeutics targeting the highly conserved myosin motor family are urgently needed as mutations in at least six of its members cause numerous diseases. Allosteric modulators, like the myosin-II inhibitor blebbistatin, are a promising means to achieve specificity. However, it remains unclear why blebbistatin inhibits myosin-II motors with different potencies given that it binds at a highly conserved pocket that is always closed in blebbistatin-free experimental structures. We hypothesized that the probability of pocket opening is an important determinant of the potency of compounds like blebbistatin. To test this hypothesis, we used Markov state models (MSMs) built from over 2 ms of aggregate molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. We find that blebbistatin’s binding pocket readily opens in simulations of blebbistatin-sensitive myosin isoforms. Comparing these conformational ensembles reveals that the probability of pocket opening correctly identifies which isoforms are most sensitive to blebbistatin inhibition and that docking against MSMs quantitatively predicts blebbistatin binding affinities (R<sup>2</sup>=0.82). In a blind prediction for an isoform (Myh7b) whose blebbistatin sensitivity was unknown, we find good agreement between predicted and measured IC50s (0.67 μM vs. 0.36 μM). Therefore, we expect this framework to be useful for the development of novel specific drugs across numerous protein targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>cryptic pockets</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30HL162431-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meller</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG067194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL141086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS GM29090 to L.A.L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leinwand</surname><given-names>Leslie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE2139839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lotthammer</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1552471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cryptic pocket in the myosin motor domain selectively opens in molecular dynamics simulations, and the probability of pocket opening is predictive of how potently a compound will inhibit a particular myosin motor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Achieving specificity is a major challenge in the design of novel drugs. An effective drug must bind its target protein tightly and avoid triggering unwanted side effects that might arise due to off-target interactions with other proteins. This problem is especially challenging when targeting specific members of protein families when multiple closely related isoforms with similar structures are expressed. Another notoriously difficult problem is targeting enzymes with substrates, such as ATP, that are shared across many protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longo et al., 2020</xref>), because compounds that compete with endogenous ligands at active sites may trigger off-target effects.</p><p>Targeting allosteric sites offers several practical advantages for drug design. Unlike drugs targeting active sites, allosteric compounds can enhance desirable protein functions, in addition to the more classic drug design strategy of inhibiting undesirable activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knoverek et al., 2019</xref>). Allosteric sites are often less conserved than active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wenthur et al., 2014</xref>), making it easier to achieve specificity. Indeed, several highly specific allosteric compounds have been serendipitously discovered through high-throughput screens. These allosteric compounds target diverse proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dror et al., 2013</xref>), myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>), kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), and β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these successes, <italic>de novo</italic>, structure-based, rational drug design efforts targeting allosteric sites are difficult because most experimental structural studies only offer a limited snapshot of a protein’s larger conformational landscape. In solution, proteins occupy a diverse set of conformational states, and some allosteric binding sites are not readily apparent from these static structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cimermancic et al., 2016</xref>). Discovering and targeting such ‘cryptic’ pockets may be an appealing strategy for achieving specificity toward clinically relevant proteins deemed ‘undruggable’ by conventional structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vajda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Myosins are a ubiquitous superfamily of ATPases that hold potential as drug targets for numerous diseases. Myosins are responsible for many cellular processes including endocytosis, cell division, muscle contraction, and long-range transport. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Preller and Manstein, 2012</xref>) Compounds targeting a subset of striated muscle myosins have been developed and shown great promise in clinical trials for heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teerlink et al., 2021</xref>) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olivotto et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, the myosin inhibitor, mavacamten, received FDA approval for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2022</xref>) Despite this progress, there is a need for additional myosin modulators in the settings of heart and skeletal muscle diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrick and Greenberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tajsharghi and Oldfors, 2013</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, 2014</xref>), and parasitic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>). However, targeting specific myosin isoforms remains extremely difficult because there are 38 myosin genes in the human genome with the typical cell in the human body expressing about 20 myosin isoforms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Preller and Manstein, 2013</xref>) Furthermore, myosins with divergent cellular roles and biochemical properties share a highly conserved motor domain fold and active site structure. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robert-Paganin et al., 2020</xref>) High-throughput screens have revealed a handful of promising small molecules that allosterically inhibit or activate myosins with varying degrees of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bond et al., 2013</xref>). Developing a quantitative understanding of how these allosteric modulators achieve specificity would improve our ability to design novel therapeutics targeting specific myosin isoforms.</p><p>Blebbistatin is a myosin-II specific allosteric inhibitor which can be used to understand the molecular mechanisms governing specificity. Blebbistatin was discovered in a high-throughput screen targeting nonmuscle myosin IIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Straight et al., 2003</xref>). However, further experiments revealed that blebbistatin broadly inhibits other myosins-II isoforms, such as fast skeletal, β-cardiac, and smooth muscle myosin with varying IC50s, but does not inhibit other myosin families, such as myosin-Xs and myosin-Vs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limouze et al., 2004</xref>). Blebbistatin inhibits myosin ATPase by preventing the release of phosphate from the active site and interfering with actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovács et al., 2004</xref>). However, experimental structures of blebbistatin bound to myosin reveal that it binds in a cleft approximately 9 Å from the active site, consistent with its designation as an allosteric effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allingham et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which blebbistatin differentially inhibits myosin isoforms is not completely understood. Previous studies have posited that blebbistatin specifically inhibits myosin-IIs because of a single residue difference between myosin-IIs and other myosins at the blebbistatin binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rauscher et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is much less clear what molecular determinants explain differences in blebbistatin potency between isoforms in the myosin-II family. For example, across multiple experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limouze et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eddinger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Várkuti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radnai, 2021</xref>), smooth muscle myosin is inhibited less potently than nonmuscle myosin IIA, despite perfect sequence identity between the residues that line the blebbistatin-binding pocket in these two isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). It has previously been suggested that blebbistatin binds at a ‘cryptic’ pocket that is usually closed in crystal structures of myosins without a bound blebbistatin. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cimermancic et al., 2016</xref>) Indeed, the blebbistatin binding site is closed in crystal structures of two blebbistatin-sensitive myosin isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that blebbistatin sensitivity is also encoded by factors beyond the sequence of the binding pocket.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Blebbistatin’s cryptic binding pocket is closed in blebbistatin-free experimental myosin structures and the sequence of surrounding residues is highly conserved across myosin isoforms with widely varying IC50s.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The motor domain of a <italic>D.d</italic>. myosin-II molecule bound to blebbistatin.

Select residues (same as those shown in C) are shown in cyan sticks. (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of blebbistatin contact residues (within 5 Å of blebbistatin in 1YV3) reveals that 16 of 19 residues are identical among myosin-IIs despite almost two orders of magnitude difference in blebbistatin IC50. We also include an unconventional myosin-X to highlight an important sequence difference at residue 466 (A vs. F) that separates blebbistatin-sensitive (IC50 &lt;150 μM) and blebbistatin-insensitive isoforms (IC50 &gt;150 μM). A star indicates a residue is conserved among all myosin isoforms shown. A double cross is used to indicate sequence differences previously suggested to play an important role in determining blebbistatin specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allingham et al., 2005</xref>).

In both structures, the cryptic blebbistatin-binding pocket is closed, and an aligned blebbistatin molecule (orange) clashes with a leucine residue (cyan). The two residues that differ between these isoforms (cyan histidine and asparagine in cardiac; cyan tyrosine and glutamine in smooth) do not form specific interactions with blebbistatin (e.g. hydrogen bonds).

A growing body of work has strengthened the view that cryptic pockets closed in crystal structures can open in excited structural states explored in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zimmerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuzmanic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porter et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollingsworth et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we reasoned that the blebbistatin cryptic pocket would open in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To test our hypothesis, we leverage all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, Markov State Models (MSMs), and a novel MSM-based approach to aggregating docking results across structural ensembles for accurate prediction of binding affinities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Blebbistatin’s cryptic binding pocket opens in simulations</title><p>We first sought to establish whether the blebbistatin pocket is open in any blebbistatin-free myosin experimental structures or if it is a ‘cryptic’ site. Cryptic pockets are cavities that open and close as a protein fluctuates in solution but are typically closed and therefore hidden in experimental structures.</p><p>To assess whether the blebbistatin-binding site is cryptic, we queried the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for an exhaustive set of myosin motor domains, yielding 124 structures that were not crystallized with blebbistatin or blebbistatin derivatives (see Materials and methods). We then assessed the degree of pocket opening at the blebbistatin binding site using the LIGSITE pocket detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendlich et al., 1997</xref>). Briefly, LIGSITE finds concavities on a protein surface by identifying grid points that are surrounded by protein but not in contact with protein atoms (see Materials and methods). Those LIGSITE grid points that were within 5 Å of an aligned blebbistatin molecule were considered part of the blebbistatin pocket.

This allowed us to interrogate if a single binding-competent structure with the appropriate pocket residues could explain differences in blebbistatin affinity.

Finally, we aggregated the docking results by finding a weighted average of binding constants and converting this value to a free energy of binding. To assess the accuracy of these predictions, we pooled IC50 measurements from all available experiments and converted these measurements to binding free energies under the assumption that IC50 was essentially equivalent to K<sub>i</sub> (see Materials and methods for detailed rationale).

Myh7b’s blebbistatin binding site is identical to β-cardiac myosin’s. However, there are numerous sequence differences immediately surrounding blebbistatin’s binding site (7 positions that differ between Myh7b and β-cardiac myosin within 1 nm of blebbistatin’s binding site). In simulations of a homology model of its motor domain, Myh7b had substantial pocket opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, when we docked to representative structures from the Myh7b simulations and aggregated predicted binding affinities using its MSM, we predict that the binding affinity of blebbistatin for Myh7b is –8.8 kcal/mol. Thus, we hypothesized that Myh7b would be highly sensitive to blebbistatin inhibition and that its IC50 would be more similar to the IC50 of fast skeletal and β-cardiac myosin than that of smooth muscle myosin.</p><p>We find that blebbistatin potently inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of Myh7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, IC50: 0.36 μM). We used recombinant human Myh7b and β-cardiac myosin S1 constructs expressed in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> cells in our experiments. We measured NADH-linked ATPase rates at increasing concentrations of blebbistatin (0.3125 μM to 20 μM) and fit a hyperbolic Hill equation to the data to determine the IC50. As a control, we measured the IC50 value for β-cardiac myosin S1. We obtain an IC50 of 1.12±0.29 μM (error indicates standard deviation between replicates), a value which closely matches with previously published IC50s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis and the computational prediction of blebbistatin’s affinity for Myh7b based on MSM-docking (0.67 μM), we obtain an experimentally measured IC50 for Myh7b (0.36±0.08 μM) that is more similar to fast skeletal and β-cardiac myosin’s IC50 than smooth muscle myosin’s IC50. Thus, our experiments provide additional validation for the MSM-docking approach.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A ligand’s specificity is most typically attributed to differences in the composition of residues at the ligand binding site. Sequence variation at a binding site can modify the shape of a binding pocket or alter the types of interatomic interactions formed between a ligand and its target protein. Mutagenesis experiments have shown that sequence differences in the blebbistatin pocket are an important determinant of blebbistatin’s selectivity for myosin-IIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). While myosin isoforms outside the myosin-II family have a bulky aromatic residue that points into the blebbistatin pocket, myosin-IIs have smaller residues at that analogous position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the binding pocket residues that coordinate binding of blebbistatin are insufficient to fully explain its isoform specificity.</p><p>Our results highlight that the distribution of structural states explored in solution can be an essential determinant of specificity. We find that differences in blebbistatin pocket dynamics are important determinants of differences in IC50 between myosin-II isoforms. Pocket opening is substantially more probable in skeletal muscle myosin than it is in smooth muscle myosin, consistent with blebbistatin’s more potent effects on skeletal muscle myosin. Furthermore, even when the blebbistatin binding site is perfectly conserved between isoforms, such as in the cases of nonmuscle myosin-IIA and smooth muscle myosin, MSM-weighted docking predicts differences in blebbistatin affinity which are consistent with experimentally measured differences in IC50. Thus, pocket dynamics, together with differences in the blebbistatin pocket’s residue composition are both important determinants of specificity.</p><p>Given there are differences in pocket opening probabilities even when pocket-lining residues are identical or near identical, distant sequence elements must allosterically modulate pocket opening. Our results demonstrate that physics-based simulations can capture these allosteric networks by modeling complex couplings throughout the myosin molecule. Even though myosin motors from the myosin-II family share high-sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and structural similarity, they are evolutionarily tuned to explore different distributions of conformations in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Porter et al., 2020</xref>). Future work is needed to isolate precisely which sequence elements control blebbistatin pocket opening.</p><p>Though our present work relies on combining long simulations and highly parallel simulations gathered on folding@home with docking, we speculate that several alternative methods could produce similar results. Efficient sampling of cryptic pocket opening is possible with adaptive sampling methods like FAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zimmerman and Bowman, 2015</xref>) or enhanced sampling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henin et al., 2022</xref>) like metadynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meller et al., 2022</xref>) and accelerated molecular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miao et al., 2016</xref>). In many cases, a relatively modest amount of sampling is sufficient to observe cryptic pocket opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meller et al., 2023</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meller et al., 2022</xref>, although accurate estimation of opening probabilities may require additional sampling. Furthermore, we note that our analysis could be improved by using more rigorous, physics-based methods for predicting protein-ligand affinity (e.g. Molecular Mechanics Generalized Boltzmann Surface Area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Future work will investigate which sampling strategies and binding prediction methods are most efficient and accurate.</p><p>Our findings agree with other studies that demonstrate the importance of pocket dynamics in modulating ligand specificity. Another myosin inhibitor, CK-571, which specifically targets smooth muscle myosin binds at a perfectly conserved binding site, suggesting an important role for structural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sirigu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the CK-571 pocket has not been observed in ligand-free myosin structures. Similar results have been found in other systems. Positive allosteric modulators of a G-protein-coupled receptor bind at a dynamic cryptic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollingsworth et al., 2019</xref>), and their selectivity has been attributed to differences in cryptic pocket opening. Together, a growing body of evidence suggests that cryptic pockets can be exploited to develop isoform-specific drugs against proteins with nearly identical crystal structures.</p><p>Additionally, our finding that the blebbistatin pocket readily opens in simulation is consistent with an important role for conformational selection. Many other simulation studies have also demonstrated that protein conformational changes associated with ligand binding are present in the ligand-free ensemble of structures adopted by proteins in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman and Geissler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oleinikovas et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a growing body of experimental evidence supports a primary role for conformational selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Changeux and Edelstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pelc et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vogt and Di Cera, 2012</xref>). However, there are examples (e.g. Niemann-Pick Protein C2) when even several rounds of adaptive sampling simulations do not sample cryptic pocket opening. These results along with a flux-based analysis of binding mechanisms suggest that induced fit may also play an important role, especially at high ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results highlight the general capacity of computational modeling to capture how subtle sequence differences induce conformational preferences, which, in turn, can control function. Simulations that reveal how sequence variation impacts conformational dynamics have potential to bolster our understanding of how patient-specific mutations contribute to protein dysfunction and drug response as well as to guide the development of new therapeutics. Indeed, certain myosin variants associated with disease may show mutation-induced changes in dynamics that could be targeted as part of a precision medicine approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg and Tardiff, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Snoberger et al., 2021</xref>).

As a result, our reported volumes represent the core of a pocket and are smaller than the space available to ligands. After generating pocket grid points for a myosin structure, we filtered those grid points in the blebbistatin pocket if they were within 2.5 Å of an aligned blebbistatin molecule. We employed a local alignment using homologous residues within 5 Å of blebbistatin. Finally, we required that pockets be continuous and selected the largest cluster of grid points defined as having a shortest inter-grid point distance of 1.5 Å.</p><p>To generate distributions of pocket volumes, we followed two different procedures. For the previously published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Porter et al., 2020</xref>), we calculated volumes for each representative structure in the Markov State Model and weighted by the equilibrium probability of each state in the MSM. This was done because (a) the size of the dataset prohibited calculating pockets for all simulation frames and (b) these MSMs contained thousands of states and hence were likely to capture a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the blebbistatin pocket. For the new simulations generated for this work, we calculated pocket volumes for every structure we saved from our simulations (save rate of one frame per 20 ps) and then weighted each of these volumes by the probability of a given structure in that isoform’s MSM, specifically the equilibrium probability of the MSM state that the structure is assigned to divided by the number of structures assigned to that MSM state. This second approach allows us to track the temporal evolution of pocket volumes in individual trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Docking</title><p>Docking against individual structures was performed using smina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>).

PDB files were converted to PDBQT files using AutoDockFR (ADFR suite). The ligand PDBQT files were generated using the same ADFR suite. The ligand charges were assigned using antechamber. To center the docking grid box on the blebbistatin binding pocket, we first selected backbone heavy atoms from residues within 0.5 nm of blebbistatin in its <italic>holo</italic> structure (PDB: 1YV3) and aligned this selection using an iterative procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossfield et al., 2007</xref>.

Closed states will receive unfavorable (i.e. more positive) docking scores reflecting in small association constants while open states will receive favorable (i.e. more negative) docking scores resulting in large association constants. Similarly, high probability states will contribute more to the weighted sum of micro-association constants, which is the macro-association constant of the ligand binding reaction. Hence, a protein that pays a high entropic penalty for ligand binding because it has only a few, low probability open states will have a small macro-association constant and an unfavorable overall MSM-docking score. Conversely, a protein that pays a low entropic penalty for ligand binding because of its many, high probability open conformers will have a large macro-association constant and hence a more favorable overall MSM-docking score.</p><p>Because we docked to multiple structures for each MSM state, we found a consensus docking score by using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where f is a structure from simulation, s is the MSM state that structure belongs to, N is the number of structures from that MSM state for which docking was performed, and π is the equilibrium probability of that MSM state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Recombinant myosin was produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sommese et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deacon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Resnicow et al., 2010</xref>) with minor changes. Adenoviruses encoding human β-MyHC S1 (amino acids 1–842) and human MYH7b S1 (amino acids 1–850) followed by a flexible GSG linker and C-terminal PDZ binding peptide (RGSIDTWV) were used to infect differentiated C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> cells. The source of the cell lines was ATCC. They were not authenticated or tested for mycoplasma because they were exclusively used to produce protein, and their identity does not impact any of the results in the manuscript. C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> cells were harvested 4 days after infection, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through 5 µM and 1.2 µM filters and applied to a column containing SulfoLink resin (ThermoFisher, 20402) coupled to PDZ. The column was washed with 30 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP and myosin S1 (bound by endogenous C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> light chains) was eluted using a peptide with tighter affinity for PDZ (WQTWV).

Before the experiment, actin was polymerized by dialysis in ATPase buffer containing 20 mM Imidazole, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM DTT followed by 1.1 x molar ratio phalloidin stabilization. Experiments were conducted in ATPase buffer with the addition of the NADH-coupled enzymes (0.5 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate [Sigma, P0564], 0.47 mM NADH [Sigma, N7410], 100 U/mL pyruvate kinase [Sigma, P9136], and 20 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase [Sigma, L1254]). Blebbistatin (Selleckchem, S7099) was dissolved in DMSO. The blebbistatin concentration was varied using serial dilutions. Before gathering data, 2 mM ATP was added to each well. Experiments were performed at 25 ° C using a BioTek Syngergy H1 microplate reader. Absorbance was monitored at 340 nm and it decreased linearly with time. Rates for each well were determined based on the linear fitting of the absorbance as a function of time. A control well containing actin, no myosin, and 20 μM blebbistatin was used as a baseline. Finally, a Hill equation was fit to the data to determine an IC50 for each experiment.

Thus, blebbistatin can be considered a mixed inhibitor of actin-activated ATPase activity.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Donald Hamelberg as Reviewing Editor and José Faraldo-Gómez as Senior Editor. All reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is slight confusion on whether the authors are investigating specificity or affinity or both. Experiments so far have provided IC50s of blebbistatin, which the authors equivocate to Ki, i.e. affinity in their methods. However, the authors note in the discussion that specificity is usually related to composition of residues at the binding site, which is identical for most of the myosin-IIs studied here. Thus, it could be argued that blebbistatin binds all the myosins specifically. Are authors making the argument that a difference in binding affinity (again measured using IC50s as proxy) indicates a different in specificity, even if the pocket looks the same across isoforms? It is suggested that authors provide a brief discussion on their rationale here. Perhaps the specificity refers to the comparison between Myosin-IIs and other non-II isoforms, as opposed to between II-isoforms.</p><p>2) Homology models: It is evident that homology models are used for several of the simulations performed, but because there are so many states under investigation (ADP-bound, ATP-bound, nucleotide free, etc), it is not very clear exactly which structures are generated by homology model and the table provided in the Methods does not contain an exhaustive list. It would be helpful for authors to include a detailed table describing all proteins AND states simulated, and the source of these structures (i.e. Xray or homology). Additionally, it would be helpful to have more information about how appropriate the models are. What is the sequence identity/similarity between Myosins in this domain? For existing crystal structures of any 2 Myosin-II in the same state, what is their RMSD? This would assure readers of structural similarity in this protein family and the appropriateness of using models. Finally, how was stability of models assessed? If RMSDs were performed following simulations, these should be provided as assurance that the models were stable in simulation.</p><p>3) A major weakness of the work is the use of docking scores to compute the IC50 of blebbistatin for the different isoforms of myosin. Docking scores are usually empirical and previous works have shown that they are usually poorly correlated with experimental binding affinities. The work would be improved if the authors used a more physics-based approach with low computational cost to estimate the IC50 value, such as Molecular Mechanics Generalized-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-GBSA).</p><p>4) On the correlation plot in Figure 6A, if myosins with IC50 &gt; 150 mM were added to the plot, would the r<sup>2</sup> correlation still be high?</p><p>5) In Figure 1 C and D, can authors label the residues they show in cyan to match the numbering in 1B? This would help readers make connections quicker.</p><p>6) For figure 4, can authors add the equilibrium probability (such as shown in Figure 3B) to each figure? This seems like a useful metric to quickly quantify probability of pocket opening from MSM.</p><p>7) Authors should clarify early on what is meant by 'apo' vs 'holo' structures. This becomes evident upon further reading, but not obvious early on as there is both an active site and allosteric site in this protein.</p><p>8) Can authors specify, of the 124 structures mined from the PDB used to check cryptic pocket existence, how many unique myosin sequences does this correspond to? What is distribution among families?</p><p>9) The authors show a figure of the open cryptic pocket observed in MD and how it overlays nicely (i.e with small RMSD) with holo crystal structure. Later, authors speculate that the aromatic side chain at position 466 points in the pocket and reduces the volume available for blebbistain binding. It would be interesting to see a representative figure from myosin V simulations in the predicted open conformation. Presumably blebbistatin also binds mysoin Vs, but just with lower affinity? Or is the IC50 of 150 mM in this case also taken as a proxy indicator that these myosins do not bind blebbistatin?</p><p>10) It could be interesting for authors to discuss on speculate on what may dictate pocket opening dynamics. Are these controlled by protein sequence elements? If so, why would they be so different for very similar isoforms?</p><p>11) It would be very interesting to read a discussion about the age-old concept of induced fit versus conformational selection. These data support conformational selection, but some information about types of sites for which cryptic pocket opening is partial or insufficient to support binding without ligand-induced changes would be appreciated.</p><p>12) It may have missed in the text, but does blebbistatin interfere with actin binding or the ability to exchange in ATP when bound to actin?</p><p>13) Greater clarification of the 'weighted' free energy from docking would be appreciated, particularly in light of the configurational entropy that may be inherent among the apo states of the protein.</p><p>14) Please clarify the simulation conditions for the existing dataset of apo motor fluctuations (line 246)</p><p>15) Long (&gt;500 ns) simulations demonstrated that the cryptic side opens, but occurs late in the simulation. In light of which, would you have anticipated that a large ensemble of shorter simulations could uncover the same opening event from the same starting conditions? Similarly, could you speculate on whether enhanced sampling techniques (accelerated MD, meta dynamics etc) could achieve an equivalent outcome as was obtained by folding at home? A MSM based on shorter aMD simulations would strongly support your argument in this regard. If successful, this could make the MSM+docking approach appealing to the broader community that does not have ready access to the distributed computing framework.</p><p>16) Please clarify what is meant by conformation ensembles were enriched for 'such structures' (line 353)</p><p>17) The interpretation of the lag time data in the supplement is that the lifetimes are not fully converged with respect to lag time (skeletal and β cardiac) – is there any structural significance to those nonconvergent states?</p><p>18) π --&gt; $\pi$ (line 577 )</p><p>19) figure 1: letters in panels A and B have a light color, hard to read.</p><p>20) figure 2C: &quot;Blebbistatin is shown in cyan with the pocket from the MD structure shown as a cyan contour.&quot;</p><p>It seems blebbistatin is in orange.</p><p>&quot;Select residues…&quot;</p><p>Typo, change to 'Selected'.</p><p>Residues Y269, L270, and F657 could be indicated in the figure to make it more informative.</p><p>Letters have light color, hard to read.</p><p>21) page 18: &quot;When we docked to the closed apo experimental structures from which simulations were launched, we unsurprisingly found very poor docking scores for all myosin-II isoforms (Figure S6).&quot;</p><p>Where was the bound pose located?

We have also emphasized that starting structures for each our simulations were generated using homology modeling.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have listed the sequence identity between the myosin sequence we modeled and the template crystal structure in a table in the Methods.</p><p>The high sequence similarity (&gt;= 85% for all homology models) between input sequences and template structure sequences indicate that the selection of template structures was reasonable.</p><p>To further demonstrate that homology modeling between myosin-IIs is appropriate, we have also included information about the structural similarity between myosin-II crystal structures. We provide a table containing the C-α RMSD between the different prepowerstroke crystal structures used as templates for homology modeling in the supplement.</p><p>Finally, we rely on Markov State Models to address the possibility that input starting structures from homology modeling were low probability conformations in the ensemble of structures adopted by a given isoform. If the structures from homology modeling were high energy conformers, we would expect the simulation to transition away from these structures and the high flux away from these states to lead to low equilibrium probabilities in the final MSM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major weakness of the work is the use of docking scores to compute the IC50 of blebbistatin for the different isoforms of myosin. Docking scores are usually empirical and previous works have shown that they are usually poorly correlated with experimental binding affinities. The work would be improved if the authors used a more physics-based approach with low computational cost to estimate the IC50 value, such as Molecular Mechanics Generalized-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-GBSA).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that docking has significant limitations when it comes to predicting the relative affinities of different compounds for a target protein and share your interest in adopting more physically rigorous methods for such purposes. However, in this case, we reasoned that simple docking may capture the relative affinities of a single compound for different protein targets given that (1) the parameters are likely more reliable for the 20 amino acids than all of chemical space, given the greater availability of data, and (2) any errors in the description of the compound will be systematic. The correlation between previously measured IC50s and our predicted affinities is consistent with this hypothesis. More importantly, our experimental characterization of MYH7b shows that our approach was predictive in this case. Given this data, we believe that the inclusion of MM-GBSA calculations or other free energy methods is beyond the scope of this current work.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s comments, we have included the following commentary on alternative approaches in the discussion (line 444):</p><p>Furthermore, we note that our analysis could be improved by using more rigorous, physics- based methods for predicting protein-ligand affinity (e.g., Molecular Mechanics Generalized Boltzmann Surface Area). Future work will investigate which sampling strategies and binding prediction methods are most efficient and accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On the correlation plot in Figure 6A, if myosins with IC50 &gt; 150 mM were added to the plot, would the r<sup>2</sup> correlation still be high?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this suggestion. It is something we have considered doing. However, blebbistatin’s affinity for non-myosin-IIs is beyond the detectable limit from experiments (blebbistatin’s limited solubility prevents testing at high concentration). Hence, it is not clear what value to use for the experimental affinity of these isoforms, so we do not believe it is possible to include them in the <italic>R</italic><sup>!</sup> calculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1 C and D, can authors label the residues they show in cyan to match the numbering in 1B? This would help readers make connections quicker.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have labeled the residues displayed in figure 1C and 1D with the same numbering as in 1B. This will allow readers to better understand sequences differences at the blebbistatin pocket.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For figure 4, can authors add the equilibrium probability (such as shown in Figure 3B) to each figure? This seems like a useful metric to quickly quantify probability of pocket opening from MSM.</p></disp-quote><p>The equilibrium probabilities for each isoform are included in a supplemental figure. Since this may have been easy to miss in our previous version, we have included explicit mention of this figure in the caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Authors should clarify early on what is meant by 'apo' vs 'holo' structures. This becomes evident upon further reading, but not obvious early on as there is both an active site and allosteric site in this protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for pointing out this ambiguity. We have replaced all instances of “apo” with “blebbistatin-free” to clarify that these structures did not include blebbistatin. We define “holo” explicitly on line 147 and list the reference PDB ID for further clarification when it was reasonable to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Can authors specify, of the 124 structures mined from the PDB used to check cryptic pocket existence, how many unique myosin sequences does this correspond to? What is distribution among families?</p></disp-quote><p>There were 23 unique sequences represented in the 124 myosin structures mined from the PDB. Of these 23 sequences, 11 were from the myosin-II family while the other 12 were from other myosin families (e.g., myosin-Vs, myosin-Xs, etc.). We have added these details to the Methods to demonstrate that this set of structures comprised a diverse collection of myosin isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors show a figure of the open cryptic pocket observed in MD and how it overlays nicely (i.e with small RMSD) with holo crystal structure. Later, authors speculate that the aromatic side chain at position 466 points in the pocket and reduces the volume available for blebbistain binding. It would be interesting to see a representative figure from myosin V simulations in the predicted open conformation. Presumably blebbistatin also binds mysoin Vs, but just with lower affinity? Or is the IC50 of 150 mM in this case also taken as a proxy indicator that these myosins do not bind blebbistatin?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer observes, the IC50 listed for myosin-V (&gt; 150 mM) is meant to indicate that blebbistatin does not bind this isoform within the detectable limit of experiments. In simulations of myosin-V, the blebbistatin pocket remains closed, never reaching the <italic>holo</italic> volume. Indeed, myosin-V has a striking lack of conformational heterogeneity in the position of its U50 linker, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83602-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The green structure is the holo crystal structure; the cyan structure is the blebbistatin-free myosin-V crystal structure; and the gray residues indicate the positions of the leucine in the U50 linker for myosin-V across a subset of MSM cluster centers (this leucine never adopts its blebbistatin-bound orientation in myosin-V simulations).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It could be interesting for authors to discuss on speculate on what may dictate pocket opening dynamics. Are these controlled by protein sequence elements? If so, why would they be so different for very similar isoforms?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers pose very interesting questions. We have added the following paragraph to address these points (line 430):</p><p>“Given there are differences in pocket opening probabilities even when pocket-lining residues are identical or near identical, distant sequence elements must allosterically modulate pocket opening. Our results demonstrate that physics-based simulations can capture these allosteric networks by modeling complex couplings throughout the myosin molecule. Even though myosin motors from the myosin-II family share high sequence identity (Table S3) and structural similarity, they are evolutionarily tuned to explore different distributions of conformations in solution.<sup>40</sup> Future work is needed to isolate precisely which sequence elements control blebbistatin pocket opening.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It would be very interesting to read a discussion about the age-old concept of induced fit versus conformational selection. These data support conformational selection, but some information about types of sites for which cryptic pocket opening is partial or insufficient to support binding without ligand-induced changes would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and this addition will undoubtedly strengthen our Discussion section. We have added the following paragraph discussing conformational selection vs. induced fit (line 458):</p><p>“Additionally, our finding that the blebbistatin pocket readily opens in simulation is consistent with an important role for conformational selection. Many other simulation studies have also demonstrated that protein conformational changes associated with ligand binding are present in the ligand-free ensemble of structures adopted by proteins in solution. Furthermore, a growing body of experimental evidence supports a primary role for conformational selection. However, there are examples from our previous work (e.g., Niemann-Pick Protein C2) where even several rounds of adaptive sampling simulations do not sample cryptic pocket opening. These results along with a flux-based analysis of binding mechanisms suggest that induced fit may also play an important role, especially at high ligand concentrations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) It may have missed in the text, but does blebbistatin interfere with actin binding or the ability to exchange in ATP when bound to actin?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the question. Light scattering and pyrene-actin fluorescence measurements as well as ultracentrifugation experiments have shown that blebbistatin interferes with actin binding. We have added this point to our introduction. Blebbistatin does not have a significant effect on ATP-induced dissociation of actomyosin most likely because it cannot bind myosin when it is bound to actin. We have added the following line about blebbistatin’s mechanism of inhibition (line 80):</p><p>“Blebbistatin inhibits myosin ATPase by preventing the release of phosphate from the active site and interfering with actin binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Greater clarification of the 'weighted' free energy from docking would be appreciated, particularly in light of the configurational entropy that may be inherent among the apo states of the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for providing this opportunity to clarify how our MSM- docking approach considers protein configurational entropy. In contrast to docking to a single structure, we directly consider a protein’s configurational entropy by docking to a diverse ensemble of structures from the apo simulations. The overall free energy of binding from docking to an MSM can be written as:<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>total</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext>Tln\ </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow/></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>eqi</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>π</italic> is the equilibrium probability of the MSM state and Keqi is the equilibrium association constant for a MSM microstate calculated from the docking score for that MSM state.</p><p>If a protein has nearly all closed states, then most of its docking scores will be unfavorable. These states will minimally contribute to the macro-association constant, which is the weighted sum of micro-association constants. Similarly, states that are low probability will have a small contribution to the overall macro-association constant. Conversely, if a protein has mostly open states, those states will receive favorable docking scores and contribute substantially to the macro-association constant. Hence, the MSM-docking approach directly considers the distribution of open and closed states in the apo ensemble.</p><p>We have clarified this argument in the Methods section (line 623):</p><p>“We note that this formula directly considers the configurational entropy of the protein by taking a weighted average of the micro-association constants over all the states in the <italic>apo</italic> MSM. Closed states will receive unfavorable (i.e., more positive) docking scores reflecting in small association constants while open states will receive favorable (i.e., more negative) docking scores resulting in large association constants. Similarly, high probability states will contribute more to the weighted sum of micro-association constants, which is the macro-association constant of the ligand binding reaction. Hence, a protein that pays a high entropic penalty for ligand binding because it has only a few, low probability open states will have a small macro- association constant and an unfavorable overall MSM-docking score. Conversely, a protein that pays a low entropic penalty for ligand binding because of its many, high probability open conformers will have a large macro-association constant and hence a more favorable overall MSM-docking score.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Please clarify the simulation conditions for the existing dataset of apo motor fluctuations (line 246)</p></disp-quote><p>In the main text, we have clarified that these simulations were conducted without blebbistatin and without nucleotide in the active site.

In light of which, would you have anticipated that a large ensemble of shorter simulations could uncover the same opening event from the same starting conditions? Similarly, could you speculate on whether enhanced sampling techniques (accelerated MD, meta dynamics etc) could achieve an equivalent outcome as was obtained by folding at home? A MSM based on shorter aMD simulations would strongly support your argument in this regard. If successful, this could make the MSM+docking approach appealing to the broader community that does not have ready access to the distributed computing framework.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an excellent point. As suggested by the reviewer, we would expect to uncover the same opening event from a large ensemble of shorter simulations. Indeed, this is what we see in our folding@home simulations launched from a closed state.</p><p>The reviewer also points out that our MSM-docking approach may be more broadly interesting if it does not require exhaustive sampling via distributed computing. Based on our other work assessing cryptic pocket opening across 12 systems, we would speculate that enhanced sampling techniques or even 10 relatively short MD simulations would be sufficient to sample many cryptic pocket opening events. We have added these details to a new paragraph (line 438):</p><p>“Though our present work relies on combining long simulations and highly parallel simulations gathered on folding@home with docking, we speculate that several alternative methods could produce similar results. Efficient sampling of cryptic pocket opening is possible with adaptive sampling methods like FAST or enhanced sampling methods like metadynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics. In many cases, a relatively modest amount of sampling is sufficient to observe cryptic pocket opening, though accurate estimation of opening probabilities may require additional sampling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Please clarify what is meant by conformation ensembles were enriched for 'such structures' (line 353)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this particular line was ambiguous.
