However, mispairing of the therapeutic αβ chains with endogenous αβ chains reduces therapeutic TCR surface expression and generates self-reactive TCRs. We report a general strategy to prevent TCR mispairing: swapping constant domains between the α and β chains of a therapeutic TCR. When paired, domain-swapped (ds)TCRs assemble with CD3, express on the cell surface, and mediate antigen-specific T cell responses. By contrast, dsTCR chains mispaired with endogenous chains cannot properly assemble with CD3 or signal, preventing autoimmunity. We validate this approach in cell-based assays and in a mouse model of TCR gene transfer-induced graft-versus-host disease. We also validate a related approach whereby replacement of αβ TCR domains with corresponding γδ TCR domains yields a functional TCR that does not mispair. This work enables the design of safer TCR gene therapies for cancer immunotherapy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19095.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19095.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19095.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>T cells enable the immune system to recognize invading microbes and diseased cells while ignoring healthy cells. The ability of a T cell to recognize a specific microbe or diseased cell is determined by two proteins that pair to form its “T cell receptor.” The paired receptors are exported to the surface of the T cell, where they bind to infected or cancerous cells. Those T cells that produce receptors that bind healthy cells are eliminated during development.</p><p>T cells can generally distinguish between the body’s own cells and the cells of invading bacteria or other microbes. However, cancer cells are more difficult to identify because they are similar to healthy cells. Efforts to develop therapies that enhance the immune system’s ability to recognize cancer cells have had only limited success. One successful approach – known as T cell receptor gene therapy – modifies T cells to destroy cancer cells by arming them with a cancer-specific T cell receptor.</p><p>This technique produces T cells possessing two T cell receptors – the cancer-specific receptor and the one it had originally – so it is possible for proteins from the two receptors to mispair. This impedes the correct pairing of the cancer-specific T cell receptor, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy. More importantly, mispaired T cell receptors may cause the immune cells to attack healthy cells in the body, leading to autoimmune disease. To make T cell receptor gene therapy safe, the cancer-specific receptor must not mispair with the resident receptor.</p><p>Here, Bethune et al. describe a new strategy to prevent T cell receptors from mispairing. The researchers altered the arrangement of particular regions in a cancer-specific T cell receptor to make a new receptor called a domain-swapped T cell receptor (dsTCR). Like normal T cell receptors, the dsTCRs were exported to the T cell surface and were able to interact with other proteins involved in immune responses. Furthermore, T cells armed with dsTCRs were able to kill cancer cells and prevent tumor growth in mice. Unlike other cancer-specific receptors, dsTCRs did not mispair with the resident T cell receptors in mouse or human cells, and did not cause autoimmune disease in mice.</p><p>The findings of Bethune et al. show that the structure of the T cell receptor is unexpectedly robust, in that it still works even if it is modified. The next step is to study dsTCRs in more detail with the aim of optimizing them so that they might be used in human clinical trials in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19095.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19095.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>receptor biogenesis</kwd><kwd>cancer immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P01CA132681-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baltimore</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000892</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15CHAL02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bethune</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name><name><surname>Baltimore</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bethune</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhns</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineered T cell receptors enable targeted immunotherapy with a reduced risk of harmful autoimmunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T lymphocytes recognize cellular targets with extraordinary sensitivity and specificity. The T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell surface binds to its cognate peptide antigen presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the target cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reinherz, 2015</xref>). The TCR - a heterodimer that is uniquely rearranged in each T cell during its development - is the sole determinant of T cell specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DembiĆ et al., 1986</xref>). Accordingly, transfer of the α and β genes encoding a tumor-reactive αβ TCR can impart anti-tumor reactivity to a cancer patient’s T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clay et al., 1999</xref>). Upon reinfusion into the patient, these engineered T cells mediate potent anti-tumor cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2011</xref>). This approach – termed TCR gene therapy – has demonstrated clinical responses for several malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parkhurst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robbins et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>), which may be bolstered in the future through combination with complementary immunotherapies like dendritic cell-based vaccination and checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate-Daga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brahmer and Hammers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mellman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma and Allison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Topalian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chodon, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the promise of TCR gene therapy, there remain significant limitations to its safety and efficacy. Among these is that TCR-transduced αβ T cells express two α and two β chains, a non-physiological situation in which the introduced TCR α and β chains can mispair with the endogenous TCR β and α chains, respectively. TCR chain mispairing reduces the level of correctly-paired, tumor-reactive TCR heterodimers expressed on the T cell surface, possibly reducing therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorritsma et al., 2007</xref>). More ominously, mispairing can generate self-reactive TCR heterodimers that do not undergo thymic negative selection. These mispaired TCRs engender autoreactivity in TCR-transduced human T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Loenen et al., 2010</xref>) and mediate lethal graft-versus-host disease in mice administered TCR-transduced T cells following a protocol mimicking human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunse, 2014</xref>). Although no serious adverse events have been attributed to TCR mispairing in engineered T cell trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosenberg, 2010</xref>), autoreactive off-target and off-tumor engineered T cell responses have caused deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2010</xref>). These underscore the need to safeguard against TCR mispairing-related autoreactivity, particularly as more potent immunotherapy regimes are employed.</p><p>Efforts to prevent TCR mispairing can be broadly categorized as either engineering the transduced TCR (adding interchain disulfide bonds, murinizing portions of the TCR, expressing TCR as a single chain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uckert and Schumacher, 2009</xref>) or reducing expression of the endogenous TCR (shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunse, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okamoto et al., 2009</xref>) or genomic knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Provasi et al., 2012</xref>]). Although several engineering strategies improve pairing between the transduced chains, complete prevention of mispairing has not been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thomas et al., 2007</xref>) and murine TCRs are immunogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis, 2010</xref>). Endogenous TCR knockout prevents mispairing, but the extensive processing currently required to generate these cells is incompatible with clinical protocols. The ideal solution will prevent mispairing entirely, eliminating the risk of autoimmunity. Additionally, modifications made to the introduced TCR chains should avoid foreign sequences to minimize immunogenicity. Finally, these modifications must be restricted to the constant TCR domains, such that they can be applied without further optimization to any TCR of therapeutic interest. We describe a novel approach for preventing TCR mispairing that meets these criteria. We show that this approach is further improved by combining it with the complementary strategy of endogenous TCR knockdown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Domain-swapped TCR (dsTCR) design</title><p>Our approach to prevent TCR mispairing exploits the molecular requirements for TCR biogenesis and function. The TCR α and β chains each contain a membrane-distal variable immunoglobulin domain (V), which imparts specificity, and several constant domains including a membrane-proximal constant immunoglobulin domain (C), a connecting peptide (cp), a transmembrane helix (TM), and a short cytoplasmic tail (cyto) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To achieve functional form, the TCR αβ heterodimer must assemble with six additional chains (CD3 dimers γε, δε, and ζ<sub>2</sub>), which facilitate export of the TCR complex to the cell surface and mediate signal transduction upon antigen binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Call and Wucherpfennig, 2005</xref>). If the TCR/CD3 complex is not assembled properly prior to export, it is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonifacino, 1989</xref>). Assembly with CD3 requires contacts within the constant domains of both the TCR α and β chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhns and Davis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu and Call, 2006</xref>), most critically the basic residues within the transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2002</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We designed interchain domain-swapped (ds) TCRs in which select constant domains of the TCR α and β chains are exchanged in a reciprocal manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Correctly paired α/β dsTCRs retain all domains necessary to assemble with CD3 and to enact tumor-targeted immunity. By contrast, mispaired heterodimers comprising one dsTCR chain and one wild-type (wt) TCR chain lack domains necessary to assemble with CD3 or to enact autoimmune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19095.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic outlining the domain-swapped TCR strategy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The TCR/CD3 complex comprises the antigen-specific variable (<bold>V</bold>) Ig domain and constant domains (constant Ig, C; connecting peptide, cp; transmembrane helix, TM; and cytoplasmic tail, cyto), which assemble with CD3 chains.

The murine pro-B cell line, BaF3, will grow in the absence of IL-3 only when provided Jak-Stat signaling via dimerized signaling domains of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR).

We have observed that some TCR is exported to the surface of transfected 293Ts even when CD3 assembly is incomplete (i.e. 26%, 0%, 52%, and 100% residual export respectively when omitting CD3δ, CD3ε, CD3γ, or CD3ζ from transfection). We suspected that this accounted for the low level of apparent pairing between dsTCR and wtTCR chains observed on 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). To determine whether dsTCRs form a complex with endogenous CD3 in T cells, we transduced the Jurkat human T cell line with wt- and dsTCRs and used flow cytometry to assess surface expression. Both dsTCR<sub>C</sub> and dsTCR<sub>cp</sub> assemble endogenous CD3, express on the cell surface, and bind cognate A2/MART1 multimers to an extent similar to the wtTCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast, hybrid constructs comprising one dsTCR chain and one wtTCR chain were not detectable on the surface of transduced Jurkat cells, indicating that, as expected, these mispaired constructs failed to form a mature complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Virtually all transduced (Myc271<sup>+</sup>) cells were positive for A2/MART1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating the dsTCRs competed favorably for CD3 recruitment in the presence of the endogenous Jurkat TCR. To determine whether dsTCR/CD3 complexes are functional, dsTCR-transduced Jurkat T cells were coincubated with K562 target cells expressing either cognate A2/MART1 or control A2/NYESO1 single-chain trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with multimer staining results, dsTCRs mediated antigen-specific release of IL-2, whereas hybrid wt/dsTCRs simulating mispairing did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the Jurkat T cell line, primary T cells express a diverse repertoire of endogenous T cell receptors, which may mispair or compete for surface expression with the transduced TCR to differing extents across cells. We therefore transduced primary T cells with wt- and dsTCRs to assess their function in a more physiologically relevant context. As expected, wtTCR was detected in only a subset (74%) of transduced (LNGFR<sup>+</sup>) cells, indicating ~25% of T cells express an endogenous TCR that out-competes F5 TCR for CD3 recruitment and cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Dextramer staining was lower for dsTCRs than wtTCRs in primary T cells (25% and 11% of LNGFR+ cells, for dsTCR<sub>C</sub> and dsTCR<sub>cp</sub>, respectively; MFI = 21% and 13% that of wtTCR). This indicates a larger subset of endogenous TCRs outcompete the dsTCRs for CD3 recruitment. Nonetheless, T cells transduced with either wtTCR or dsTCRs were functional, secreting IFN-γ and upregulating cell surface CD25 in an antigen-specific manner when coincubated with target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>). As with Jurkat cells, simulated mispaired constructs elicited no such activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>). Thus, dsTCRs assemble with endogenous CD3 to mediate antigen-specific immunity in primary lymphocytes and are rendered nonfunctional when mispaired with wtTCR chains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>dsTCRs do not mispair with endogenous TCR and do not cause graft-versus-host disease</title><p>Transduced α and β chains can each mispair with endogenous chains, and autoreactivity is an unpredictable result of the particular transduced and endogenous chains involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Loenen et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate whether dsTCR chains can mispair with any of the diverse array of endogenous TCR chains expressed across primary T cells, we devised an assay for measuring mispairing without regard to antigenic specificity. We tagged the N-termini of the α and β chains of F5 TCR with cMyc and V5 epitope tags, respectively, and confirmed that the addition of these tags did not alter TCR surface expression on Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then delivered each chain individually (i.e. Myc-α only or V5-β only), such that the export of the tagged TCR chain is dependent on mispairing with endogenous TCR chains. The wtα and wtβ chains of F5 TCR mispaired with endogenous TCR chains in 88% and 58% of transduced T cells, respectively. By contrast, neither dsα nor dsβ chains exhibited detectable mispairing with endogenous TCR chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the murine OTI TCR: wtα and wtβ chains were mispaired in 63% and 84% of transduced murine T cells, whereas mispairing was not observed with dsα or dsβ chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, even when mispairing propensity is maximized by transduction of a single dsTCR chain in the absence of stoichiometric expression of its correct partner, dsTCR chains exhibit no detectable mispairing with endogenous TCR chains.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19095.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Domain-swapped TCRs do not mispair with endogenous TCRs and do not cause graft-vs-host disease.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Flow cytometric measurement of mispairing of (<bold>A</bold>) human F5 TCR chains in human peripheral blood T cells and (<bold>B</bold>) murine OTI TCR chains in murine splenic T cells.

Mice that develop TI-GvHD due to TCR chain mispairing exhibit destruction of the hematopoietic compartment and rapid weight loss, generally necessitating sacrifice within 1–2 days of onset of cachexia. We transduced T cells with wt- and dsTCR derivatives of OTI TCR, as this TCR resulted in the highest incidence of TI-GvHD of those TCRs tested in the initial report of the model. Based on our finding that dsTCR chains do not mispair with endogenous TCR chains, we expected to recapitulate TI-GvHD in wtTCR-transduced T cell recipients, but not in dsTCR-transduced T cell recipients. Indeed, mice that received wtTCR(IRES)-transduced T cells - in which the transduced wtTCR chains were linked by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence – exhibited significant cachexia following IL-2 administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although some of these mice regained weight and survived, 47% (7/15) developed TI-GvHD to an extent that necessitated euthanasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendle et al., 2010</xref>), the incidence of TI-GvHD could be reduced but not eliminated by replacing the IRES with a viral 2A sequence to ensure stoichiometric expression of the wtTCR chains. In this wtTCR(2A) group, less weight loss was observed and only 1/15 mice developed fatal TI-GvHD. By contrast, cachexia was not observed for mice that received dsTCR<sub>C</sub>(2A)-transduced T cells, and none (0/25) of these mice developed TI-GvHD. Thus, dsTCRs prevent mispairing and thereby prevent mispairing-related autoimmune complications in a model of TCR gene therapy.</p><p>The lack of TI-GvHD in mice receiving dsTCR-transduced T cells was not due to lack of function in vivo. Mouse T cells transduced with OTI wtTCR or dsTCR<sub>C</sub> produced a similar complement of cytokines upon stimulation with cognate peptide-MHC multimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). For at least 6 weeks following T cell injection, V<sub>α</sub>2<sup>+</sup>/V<sub>β</sub>5<sup>+</sup> T cells were present in the spleen and retained specificity for H-2K<sup>b</sup>/Ova tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These splenic T cells exhibited antigen-specific IFN-γ release and modulated the surface expression of T cell activation markers upon stimulation with ovalbumin peptide ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). The ovalbumin-expressing murine thymoma line, E.G7, grew in all control mice injected with LNGFR-transduced T cells, but did not grow detectably in any mice injected with either wtTCR- or dsTCR-transduced T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Tumor cell killing was antigen-specific, because EL4 – the ovalbumin-negative parental line from which E.G7 was derived – grew readily in mice injected with dsTCR-transduced T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The relative efficacies of wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells were compared by titrating down the number of T cells injected prior to tumor cell injection. Both wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells slowed tumor growth when mice were injected with 1 T cell per 500 tumor cells, and prevented tumor growth entirely at higher tested ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Accordingly, employing dsTCRs in adjunct with approaches to reduce endogenous TCR expression may increase dsTCR surface expression while also improving the safety of these approaches in a complementary manner. We explored the compatibility of dsTCRs with two such approaches: knockdown of endogenous TCR in mature T cells, and hematopoietic stem cell TCR gene therapy.</p><p>A recent report demonstrated that RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous TCR genes improves surface expression and reduces mispairing of a co-delivered codon-optimized TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunse, 2014</xref>). However, TI-GvHD was not eliminated entirely, indicating incomplete knockdown of endogenous TCR. We hypothesized that combining dsTCRs with endogenous TCR knockdown would improve cell surface expression of dsTCRs while also eliminating TI-GvHD entirely. To investigate this combination approach, we transduced mouse T cells with vectors that co-delivered 1) shRNA targeting endogenous TCR α and β genes and 2) codon-optimized wt- and dsTCR versions of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific P14 murine TCR. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunse, 2014</xref>), the β chain (V<sub>β</sub>8) of P14 wtTCR was disproportionally detected on the cell surface relative to the α chain (V<sub>α</sub>2) - indicative of mispairing - even when translational stoichiometry was ensured through the use of a viral 2A sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

By contrast, no TI-GvHD was observed in mice receiving P14 dsTCR-transduced T cells, whether or not shRNAs were co-delivered. As with OTI dsTCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), P14 dsTCR did not induce TI-GvHD because the P14 domain-swapped α and β chains did not mispair with endogenous chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). By contrast, individually delivered P14 wild-type α and β chains mispaired with endogenous chains even when both endogenous chains were knocked down. In fact, knockdown of both endogenous chains increased mispairing of P14 wtα, suggesting the reduction of competing endogenous α enabled more mispairing of the weak P14 wtα with the remaining endogenous β chain. Prevention of TCR mispairing via endogenous TCR knockdown therefore relies on both the reduction of endogenous TCR and the equal (over)expression of the transduced TCR chains. Taken together, these results suggest that a combination approach of endogenous TCR knockdown and dsTCR transduction may optimize safety and efficacy over either approach alone.</p><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with pre-rearranged TCR genes differentiate into antigen-specific T cells in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vatakis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang and Baltimore, 2005</xref>).

As with the interchain domain-swapped constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), chimeric domain-swapping at the V-C junction resulted in loss of TCR surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast, both dsTCR<sub>δγ</sub> and dsTCR<sub>γδ</sub> expressed on the surface and bound cognate dextramer to a similar extent as wtTCR. As expected, 3 of the 4 simulated mispaired constructs comprising one chimeric chain and one wtTCR chain did not bind dextramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Only the wtα/dsβ<sub>γ</sub> mispaired construct was detected at a low level on the cell surface, binding dextramer at 20% the level of wtTCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Dextramer binding results were similar in primary T cells, indicating that chimeric dsTCR<sub>δγ</sub> and dsTCR<sub>γδ</sub> assemble with CD3 chains with similar efficiency as wtTCR in the presence of competing endogenous TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; MFI for dsTCR<sub>δγ</sub> and dsTCR<sub>γδ</sub> = 157% and 174% that of wtTCR, respectively). T cells expressing chimeric dsTCRs were activated and secreted IFN-γ in response to coincubation with cognate antigen-expressing target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). In contrast to dextramer binding, these functional outputs were reduced for chimeric dsTCRs relative to wtTCR, indicating chimeric domain-swapping partially impaired signaling capacity. Replacing the chimeric TCR cytoplasmic signaling domains with those from αβ TCR did not substantively alter the function of chimeric dsTCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Only the wtα/dsβ<sub>γ</sub> mispaired construct exhibited low levels of dextramer binding (7% of wt) and secreted IFN-γ (20% of wt), indicating some allowance for pairing between constant TCRα and TCRγ domains.

However, mispairing between introduced and endogenous TCR chains produces autoreactive human T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Loenen et al., 2010</xref>) and causes graft-vs-host disease in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunse, 2014</xref>), indicating that TCR gene transfer poses a non-theoretical risk of autoimmunity. As the potency of TCR gene therapy is augmented through combination with other immunotherapies (e.g. checkpoint blockade), there may be a concomitant rise in mispairing-related serious adverse events. This work describes a domain-swapping strategy to prevent TCR mispairing, thereby improving the safety of this promising approach.</p><p>By swapping constant domains between α and β chains of a clinically-relevant αβ TCR, we generated a receptor that retains antigenic specificity and function but does not mispair with endogenous TCRs. Interchain domain-swapped TCRs prevent mispairing-related autoreactivity through three potential mechanisms: (1) dsTCR chains mispair with wtTCR chains inefficiently due to juxtaposition of non-interacting domains (i.e. neither α nor β self-associate); (2) mispairing between wt and ds chains results in a receptor that incompletely assembles with CD3 chains and is degraded; (3) mispaired wt/dsTCRs that escape degradation and express on the surface with an incomplete complement of CD3 chains will have impaired signaling capacity. Thus, proper dsTCR/CD3 complex assembly is central to the differential function of correctly paired versus mispaired dsTCRs. The detailed mechanism by which dsTCRs assemble with CD3 chains remains open. The transmembrane domains and connecting peptides of wtTCRs participate in complex assembly while the ectodomains contribute to complex stability and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhns and Davis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu and Call, 2006</xref>). The dsTCRs reorient these domains with respect to one another. Despite this, dsTCRs assemble with CD3 chains with proper juxtaposition of CD3ε chains, express on the cell surface, and mediate functional, antigen-specific responses, including tumor cell killing. This indicates that dsTCR/CD3 complexes preserve the transmembrane contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains that are essential for complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2002</xref>). If transmembrane orientation is preserved, it is unlikely that the short, rigid CD3 connecting peptides can contact the reoriented TCR ectodomains, resulting in presumed (though undemonstrated) disruption of these stabilizing contacts. This could account for the generally lower surface expression observed for dsTCRs relative to the wtTCR. The dsTCR<sub>cp</sub> construct additionally reorients the connecting peptides with respect to the transmembrane domains, consistent with its generally lower surface expression relative to the dsTCR<sub>C</sub> construct. That both of these constructs transduce extracellular ligand binding into intracellular signaling suggests that the function of the TCR/CD3 complex is remarkably robust toward structural perturbation.</p><p>The functional avidity of dsTCR-transduced T cells can be optimized for clinical application in several ways. First, wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced Jurkat T cells performed equivalently in functional assays, indicating the importance of high transduction efficiency. Second, assembly of dsTCRs with CD3 may be improved by reducing the number of endogenous TCRs competing for these chains. In this work, we showed that dsTCRs are compatible with TCR-transduced HSC transfer, as well as with shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous TCR genes. Combining dsTCRs with these adjunct approaches improved cell surface expression of dsTCRs and safeguarded against mispairing with residual endogenous TCR. Third, swapping domains closer to the V-C junction would avoid reorienting constant domains with respect to each other, thereby preserving all contacts with CD3. We attempted to optimize such a construct in this work (dsTCR<sub>V</sub> and dsTCR<sub>Cδγ</sub>), but found that all constructs that swapped domains at the V-C junction abrogated TCR surface expression completely. Interestingly, a conceptually related approach has been used to ensure correct pairing of heavy and light chains in bispecific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaefer et al., 2011</xref>), and the lead architecture (CrossMab<sup>CH1-CL</sup>) from that application swapped domains at the V-C junction (i.e. the elbow). It is unclear why the dsTCR<sub>V</sub> variant was entirely nonfunctional whereas analogously manipulated CrossMab antibodies bind antigen with affinity comparable to wild-type Fab. This may be attributable to a more flexible antibody hinge or to the specifics of how the domain-swap was achieved. Notably, the CrossMab approach differed from ours in that domains were swapped asymmetrically between chains (i.e. heavy chain residues were duplicated in the hinge/elbow region of both the heavy and light chains), so a similar modification to our approach may identify a functional dsTCR design that is swapped near the V-C junction.</p><p>Finally, although we focus on TCRs relevant to cancer immunotherapy, domain-swapping was applied successfully to all TCRs attempted, including four human TCRs and two mouse TCRs. Thus, the general dsTCR approach can be applied broadly to TCRs of therapeutic interest, enabling development of safer immunotherapies for a variety of cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).

After 60–72 hr of transduction, Jurkats were assayed for TCR surface expression and function. To test for surface expression, cells were rinsed and stained with fluorescent antibodies and pMHC multimers in FACS buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded from analysis using 7-AAD. To test for function, unselected Jurkat T cells were co-incubated in a 96-well plate at a 1:1 ratio with K562 cells stably expressing control or cognate peptide-MHC single chain trimers.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor and three reviewers: Brian Baker, Bernard Malissen, and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting manuscript builds and tests domain-swapped chains of the T cell receptor heterodimer to demonstrate that a number of domain-swapped combinations permit reasonable maintenance of assembly and function upon heterologous expression, yet substantially prevent assembly with 'wild-type' endogenous chains and the functional consequences thereof. The findings are of interest both for adding to the understanding of the structural constraints on T cell receptor assembly and signaling, and for creating a novel technological modality to add to the growing portfolio of methods for tumor-directed immunotherapy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an exciting manuscript, but there are a few concerns we'd like you to address:</p><p>1) One concern relates to the somewhat sketchy quantification of the comparative efficiency of the domain-swapped T cell receptors. Specifically, there are two distinct ultimate functional outcomes in vivo being measured, and are correlatable with two distinct consequences of domain-swapped TCRs (dsTCRs); – reduction of pairing with endogenous TCR chains correlatable with loss of GVH induction activity, and reduction of cell-surface dsTCR levels potentially correlatable with possible quantitative reduction of anti-tumor activity. Quantified estimates of these correlations, perhaps most simply using cell number titrations for the relevant assays in vivo, would be immensely useful and very feasible additions.</p><p>2) A second concern is an extension of the first point above; – there are at least two other modalities for achieving these ends that the authors use for comparison; – stoichiometric expression of heterologous TCR chains for preferential coupling using a viral IRES substitute (2A), and shRNA-mediated 'knockdown' of endogenous TCR expression. Quantified estimates of the comparative efficiency of the dsTCR approach with these approaches for both GVH prevention and anti-tumor activity, again perhaps most simply using input cell number titrations for the relevant assays in vivo, would be very useful and feasible additions.</p><p>3) A major question in the manuscript is how the successful swapping strategies impact TCR/CD3 architecture on T cells, and what the authors perceive to be the 'loss of stabilizing contacts in the extracellular domains. It is unclear what this interpretation is based on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> outlines the oft-discussed charges in the TM helices and how they are believed to interact and help align the CD3 chains, but it is not necessarily the case (albeit possible) that swapping these around would lead to a loss of stabilizing contacts in the extracellular parts, given what we know (and don't know) about the structural relationships and the constraints on TCR/CD3 overall architecture. In fact, it is plausible to argue that the data suggest that there is malleability in the architecture (and by extension, some malleability in the signaling mechanism), consistent with some published literature. A related issue to address is the swapping of the actual constant domains themselves – this is likely to have considerable disruptions simply based on structural principles of how the constant domains interface with each other and the variable domains. It would be useful to discuss these issues to have them better clarified in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19095.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an exciting manuscript, but there are a few concerns we'd like you to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One concern relates to the somewhat sketchy quantification of the comparative efficiency of the domain-swapped T cell receptors.

In response to these two points, we have performed a follow-up study in which we transduced mouse splenocytes with ovalbumin-specific OTI wtTCR, dsTCR, or codon optimized wtTCR with shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous TCR. In all of these constructs, the TCR α and β chain genes were linked using a 2A sequence. We then injected mice with varying numbers (3.3x10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, or 10<sup>4</sup>) of transduced T cells (down from 10<sup>6</sup> cells used in manuscript). Two experiments were then performed:</p><p>A) Animals were first tested for GvHD as described in the manuscript. At these lower input levels, none of the animals developed disease. This was expected because the 2A linker ensured equal stoichiometry between the introduced α and β chains – decreasing mispairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and previously reported<sup>1</sup>) – and because lower polyclonality of the transduced T cell population reduces the risk of deleterious mispairing<sup>1,2</sup>.</p><p>B) Next, we injected animals with 5x10<sup>6</sup> ovalbumin-expressing E.G7 thymoma and monitored the growth of these tumor cells over time. At 10<sup>5</sup> T cell input and higher, wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells similarly prevented tumor growth in all mice tested. At 10<sup>4</sup> T cell input, both wtTCR and dsTCR-transduced T cells slowed but did not prevent tumor growth entirely. This suggests that wtTCR- and dsTCR-transduced T cells are similarly efficient at protecting against tumor growth in this xenograft model. These results have been added to the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and have been discussed in the revised text.</p><p><italic>3) A major question in the manuscript is how the successful swapping strategies impact TCR/CD3 architecture on T cells, and what the authors perceive to be the 'loss of stabilizing contacts in the extracellular domains. It is unclear what this interpretation is based on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> outlines the oft-discussed charges in the TM helices and how they are believed to interact and help align the CD3 chains, but it is not necessarily the case (albeit possible) that swapping these around would lead to a loss of stabilizing contacts in the extracellular parts, given what we know (and don't know) about the structural relationships and the constraints on TCR/CD3 overall architecture. In fact, it is plausible to argue that the data suggest that there is malleability in the architecture (and by extension, some malleability in the signaling mechanism), consistent with some published literature. A related issue to address is the swapping of the actual constant domains themselves – this is likely to have considerable disruptions simply based on structural principles of how the constant domains interface with each other and the variable domains. It would be useful to discuss these issues to have them better clarified in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>There are two questions asked in point 3 above:</p><p>First, how do we know extracellular contacts are disrupted by domain-swapping?</p><p>We do not know. We hypothesize that this is so based on observations that 1) transmembrane contacts are critical for assembly<sup>3</sup> so these must be preserved in the dsTCR/CD3 complex, 2) extracellular variable (V) and constant (C) domains are rotated relative to TM domains in dsTCR constructs, so if CD3 contacts with TCR transmembrane domains are preserved, it is unlikely that the short, rigid connecting CD3 peptides enable the extracellular contacts to be preserved in the reoriented TCR C domains, and 3) dsTCR/CD3 complex assembly/surface expression is impaired relative to wtTCR/CD3 complex assembly, so disruption of extracellular contacts is a potential (unproven) hypothesis to explain this impairment.</p><p>Second, how does domain-swapping affect the structural relationship between variable and constant domains?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref> suggest that the relationship between the V and C domains sets constraints on domain-swapping. For both constructs in which we attempted to position the domain-swap directly between the extracellular V and C domains, we ablated surface expression of the dsTCR complex entirely. It seems likely that the conserved, rigid hinges of the TCR chains do not enable proper V-V and C-C pairing in the domain-swapped constructs. Only by domain-swapping further down the chains – at junctions before and after the connecting peptide – were we able to get functional dsTCR complexes.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have expanded and clarified our discussion of TCR/CD3 assembly in the wt and ds complexes. We have also emphasized that our presumption of ectodomain-CD3 contact disruption is a hypothesis only, and is undemonstrated in the current work.</p><p>1) Bendle, G.M., et al.
