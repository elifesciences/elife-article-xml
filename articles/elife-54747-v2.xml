chemical hapten which induces allergic contact dermatitis and is used in the treatment of warts, melanoma, and alopecia areata. This therapeutic setting therefore provided an opportunity to study T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire changes in response to hapten sensitization in humans. Repeated exposure to DPC induced highly dynamic transient expansions of a polyclonal diverse T cell population. The number of TCRs expanded early after sensitization varies between individuals and predicts the magnitude of the allergic reaction. The expanded TCRs show preferential TCR V and J gene usage and consist of clusters of TCRs with similar sequences, two characteristic features of antigen-driven responses. The expanded TCRs share subtle sequence motifs that can be captured using a dynamic Bayesian network. These observations suggest the response to DPC is mediated by a polyclonal population of T cells recognizing a small number of dominant antigens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>repertoire</kwd><kwd>contact dermatitis</kwd><kwd>patch test</kwd><kwd>cdr3 motif</kwd><kwd>Bayesian network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007190</institution-id><institution>Unilever</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chain</surname><given-names>Benny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chronic exposure to a potent chemical contact sensitizer drives a self-limiting expansion of a polyclonal population of T cells recognizing a small number of dominant antigens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPC) is an example of a hapten, a small organic compound that reacts with biological macromolecules including proteins to form immunogenic conjugates. It is a potent skin sensitizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mose et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stute et al., 1981</xref>) and, since it is non-mutagenic in the AMES assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilkerson et al., 1987</xref>), it has been used as an immunostimulant in the treatment of warts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley et al., 1999</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Read et al., 2017</xref>), and alopecia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashworth et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karanovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). DPC can also act as an adjuvant to conventional immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Moos et al., 2012</xref>). Because of its clinical applications, and because it is not commonly found in the environment, DPC serves as an interesting model to study primary and secondary responses to chemical haptens in humans, although the confounding effects of any underlying clinical condition in the treated individuals must obviously be considered. Clinically, repeated exposure results in rapid sensitization, but the magnitude of the resulting allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) does not continue to increase during repeated exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mose et al., 2017a</xref>), suggesting the existence of regulatory processes. Global expression profiling at the site of elicitation suggested a predominantly Th1/Th17 type T cell infiltration, whose dynamics mirrored the clinical and histopathological picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mose et al., 2017b</xref>). High serum interleukin-4 (IL4) and low interleukin-12 (IL12) were observed in patients with alopecia showing a favorable response to DPC treatment.</p><p>As part of an extended project to understand more fully the immunological events leading to ACD, and hence generate better tools for chemical risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimber et al., 2012</xref>), we have measured the T cell receptor repertoire (TCRrep) changes in ex vivo blood samples collected from patients before and after therapeutic sensitization with DPC. In a previous study, we used a newly developed quantitative, robust experimental and computational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oakes et al., 2017a</xref>) to measure changes in the TCRrep following in vitro re-stimulation of blood from individuals allergic to the environmental contact allergen paraphenylene diamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oakes et al., 2017b</xref>). A limitation of the study was that the extent of allergen exposure prior to challenge was unknown. Here we extend these studies to document in vivo changes to the TCRrep during primary and secondary sensitization with DPC in a small cohort of patients with alopecia. Exposure to DPC results in transient expansions of a set of related TCR sequences in the peripheral blood. The number of responding TCRs correlates with the extent of sensitization and is not observed in unexposed individuals. The results suggest that exposure to a contact allergen in vivo stimulates an initial polyclonal expansion of antigen-specific responding T cells which, however, does not increase on further repeated exposure to antigen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We carried out TCRseq on unfractionated blood samples from 29 patients with alopecia (<xref ref-type="table"

As controls, we carried out TCRseq on five healthy volunteers, for which we had time points that matched the 0-, 2-, and 6-week time points of the DPC sensitized group. We obtained a total of 24,431,855 distinct TCR sequences, of which 17,451,853 were unique across all samples. The number of TCR sequences obtained varied between samples (mainly due to small differences in volume of individual libraries when preparing the pooled library for sequencing) and are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The median number of TCRs per sample was 95,638 (range 23,224–690,600) and the median number of unique TCRs per sample was 75,111 (range 19,095–342,336).

We observed that in a number of individuals, there was a population of TCRs which were absent before sensitization and present at relatively high abundance after sensitization (indicated by the pink dots in the left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This change is seen clearly in the abundance profile of all TCRs that were absent in the pre-sensitization sample, but present after sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On the basis of these profiles, we counted the proportion of TCRs absent at PS and present at PT1 with an abundance of eight times or above. The remainder of this study focuses on this population, which we refer to as PT1 expanded. The percentages of PT1 TCRs which are expanded in each individual are summarized for patients and healthy volunteers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. For comparison, we calculated the percentage of TCRs absent at PT1 but present at PS with an abundance of eight times or above (referred to as PS expanded). The range of percentages of expanded TCRs at PT1 is clearly much greater in the patients than in the healthy volunteers (between 0 and 2 weeks), although the medians are not significantly different (p=0.16 and p=0.47 for alpha and beta respectively, Mann–Whitney). The percentage of expanded TCRs at PT1 in the patients is significantly larger than the percentage of TCRs which were expanded at PS and absent at PT1 (p=0.02 for alpha, p=0.03 for beta, Wilcoxon signed–rank). This is not the case for the healthy volunteers (p=0.79 for alpha, p=0.59 for beta, Wilcoxon signed–rank). Similar results were obtained setting the expansion threshold at 16 or 32.

The DBN is a probabilistic graphical model, which provides a flexible classification tool that can incorporate heterogeneous data (e.g. sequences as well as V/J usage).</p><p>We constructed a DBN to classify TCR beta CDR3 sequences into one of two classes: DPC-related CDR3s and randomly sampled pre-sensitization CDR3s from the same individuals. To construct the training/test sets for the model, we used the PT1 expanded CDR3 sequences (≥8) for the DPC class, which were at most 22 amino acids long (2019 beta sequences from 22 patients), and for the control class, a randomly generated set of the same number of TCRs from the combined pre-sensitization sequences. CDR3 sequences in the expanded set were excluded from the pre-sensitization (control) training set. The length of CDR3 sequences used in the model was capped at 22 in order to manage the computational complexity of the algorithm, while still utilizing all expanded sequences. To account for the variable length of the CDR3 sequences, the sequences were aligned by the first Cysteine of the CDR3 on the left, up to the final Phenylalanine of the CDR3, then ‘completed’ to length 22 using a dummy variable (‘amino acid number 21’). The DBN took as input the amino acid in each position in the CDR3 (converted to an integer 0–21 for each amino acid or dummy), the V and J genes, as well as position-specific triplet scores and class scores (as explained in Materials and methods).

The probability of observing a specific amino acid in a particular position given its neighbors differs between DPC-expanded sequences and control sequences.

Such relationships are utilized by the model in classification.</p><p>The DBN classifier could classify the full DPC/control test sets with mean accuracy of 94% from 10 repeats of 10-fold cross validation, and sets of 10 sequences with mean accuracy 77.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> upper panel).

The key findings are that the response to sensitizer is accompanied by a dynamic, robust polyclonal increase in abundance of a defined set of TCR genes which presumably reflects clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells in response to DPC. Notably, the breadth of the response, as captured by the number of TCRs that increase in frequency, is very diverse between individuals and predicts the degree of sensitization. Furthermore, the response of individual TCRs, which reflect individual T cell clonal dynamics, is transient, with most TCRs returning to low frequencies, or disappearing by the subsequent time point.</p><p>The immunological mechanisms that drive ACD have been studied in detail (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimber et al., 2012</xref>). The dose and frequency of exposure are both key parameters in determining the strength of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedmann, 2007</xref>), although it is clear that the full impact of different factors on the observed variance in the population is still not fully understood, and is one limitation in accurate prediction of allergy to chemical exposure in the context of consumer safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basketter and Safford, 2016</xref>). There is widespread agreement that activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cells plays key roles, although antibody may also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singleton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The nature of the molecular interaction between the sensitizer, which is usually a chemical hapten that reacts with macromolecules including proteins in the skin following exposure, remains much less well understood than for microbial or viral peptide antigens. There are no MHC tetramers﻿ or multimers which can be used to identify DPC or indeed any hapten-specific T cells. Nevertheless, a number of lines of evidence support our hypothesis that the TCRs that increase in frequency following sensitization represent an antigen-specific response. The observed changes from zero to eight are unlikely to be due to sampling effects; in fact, modeling sampling as a Poisson process indicates that changes from zero to eight or more have individual probabilities of &lt;0.05. The observed changes are also unlikely to arise from exposure to unknown antigens (e.g. infectious agents) since the number of expanded TCRs at the first time point post-sensitization is greater than the number of expanded TCRs observed in unsensitized individuals sampled at similar time points, for the great majority of the patients tested. The functional link between TCR expansion and DPC exposure is also strengthened by the observed statistical correlation between the number of expanded TCRs and the vigor of sensitization, as measured by the patch test. Moreover, the expanded set of TCRs show strong evidence of V and J gene skewing, and of increased CDR3 clustering, both well-established signatures of an antigen-specific T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glanville et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dash et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, these features are shown to be discriminatory enough to allow classification of TCRs into DPC-related and pre-sensitization TCRs by the DBN. Taken together, this set of observations suggest that DPC, perhaps in the form of a set of modified-self peptide adjuncts, stimulates a transient expansion of T cells carrying a defined set of related TCRs. The observation that TCR clustering, V region enrichment, and DBN classification could be observed across a panel of unrelated individuals is particularly intriguing, and suggests that hapten-specific responses may be less dependent on MHC matching than conventional peptide-specific responses. However, further more detailed study is required to determine the molecular target of the DPC-responsive TCRs.</p><p>DPC is considered a potent sensitizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stute et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mose et al., 2017b</xref>). Nevertheless, we noted a wide range of quantitative responses in different individuals, at least as measured by standard patch test results. This was reflected in a wide range of expanded TCRs, and the number of expanded TCRs at the first post-sensitization sample (2 weeks) showed strong correlation with the strength of the response. The reasons for this inter-individual variation are unknown, but could reflect inter-individual differences in immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodin et al., 2015</xref>), or potentially differences in factors that control hapten penetration, such as skin thickness or composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reynolds et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the factors that determine this variation may be important in developing novel approaches to ACD risk prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MacKay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maxwell and Mackay, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In our study, low responders were not boosted by repeated exposure to DPC over many months. In fact, the response was usually maximal at the first patch test, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms come into play to limit the response in vivo. Similarly the initial TCR expansion did not continue to increase despite repeated exposure to antigen, and indeed the majority of TCRs showed very transitory responses, with individual TCR frequencies falling to around pre-sensitization frequencies by the next time point. Similar rapid expansion and subsequent contraction have been observed in response to live attenuated yellow fever vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeWitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pogorelyy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>), one of few examples where TCR repertoire has been studied before and after challenge in a human setting. The latter study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pogorelyy et al., 2018</xref>) precisely documents changes in TCR frequency in three pairs of twins, at several time points before and after exposure to a single dose of the live attenuated YFV 17D vaccine. The study documented the expansion and then contraction of several hundred TCR genes, which reflected the clonal expansion, and subsequent contraction of a polyclonal set of vaccine-specific T cells. However, in this case antigen was delivered as a single dose of vaccine, which gives rise to systemic but very transitory viremia. T cell contraction in the vaccine context may therefore reflect the rapid disappearance of antigen. In contrast, the patients in the current study were exposed to repeated doses of DPC weekly over the course of many months for their therapeutic benefit. The mechanisms which limit the DPC response are therefore more likely to be due to intrinsic regulatory pathways (e.g. Treg induction), or changes in intrinsic migratory pathways rather than simply reflect antigen disappearance. We noted that a second wave of TCRs appeared at increased frequency at PT2, 6 weeks post-sensitization. This set of ‘late’ TCRs was almost completely distinct from the ‘early’ peak at week 2. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the magnitude of the patch test score at PT1 and the number of TCRs expanded at PT2. Additional experiments will be needed to explore whether this set of late TCRs represents part of a regulatory mechanism, which regulates and limits further T cell expansion during chronic exposure to DPC.</p><p>In conclusion, this study is the first analysis of in vivo TCR repertoire changes in response to a chemical allergen, and is one of only a handful of studies that document in vivo longitudinal changes in TCRrep in response to immunization in humans. We cannot rule out that the immune response in this population is different from healthy individuals, since all patients suffered from some form of alopecia, which is believed to have an autoimmune etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trüeb and Dias, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, DPC is unlikely to bear any relation to the autoimmune target in alopecia, since similar therapeutic responses (hair growth) can be observed in patients with alopecia treated with other completely unrelated contact sensitizers. While the qualitative balance of immune response may be influenced by the underlying autoimmune background, the specificity of the TCR repertoire is likely to reflect fundamental features of the response to chemical haptens. The study confirms our previous in vitro findings that the response even to a simple chemical such as DPC is polyclonal involving dozens or even hundreds of TCRs. The study also highlights the dynamic nature of the TCR repertoire. Further studies will be required to unravel the complex mechanisms that regulate the immune response to chronic antigen exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Decombinator V4</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Decombinator">https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Decombinator</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_006732">SCR_006732</ext-link></td><td valign="top">This software suite is under active development; latest versions available at the GitHub site.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">TCRseq protocol</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uddin et al., 2019b</xref> PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727254">31727254</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">This protocol is in a continuous state of development.

The TCR DBN was built in MATLAB (2019b), using the Bayes Net Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murphy, 2001</xref>). The DBN took as input the position along the CDR3 sequence, the amino acid in each position, the V and J genes, a position-specific triplet score, and a class score relative to sequence position. An edge between neighboring amino acids was included in the network to model the observed non-independence between neighboring amino acids in their specific sequence positions and the sequence specificity. The triplet score was calculated by taking for each position the triplet containing the two previous amino acids in the CDR3 and ranking it against other triplets in this position in the control and DPC training sets. The triplet was given a score of 1 if it appeared more frequently (in a given position) in the DPC training set than in the control training set, which consisted of the same number of sequences randomly sampled from the pre-sensitization repertoires of the same patients. Triplets that were more frequent in the control set were scored 2, and triplets that appeared equally in the DPC and control sets were scored 1 or 2 uniformly at random. Positions 1 and 2 were taken as a singleton and an ordered pair of amino acids respectively and scored similarly. Triplets were chosen since they were sufficiently high dimensional to capture amino acid dependencies but remained computationally feasible. To calculate the class scores, the following procedure was followed: 1. Each V gene in the training set was scored 1 if it was more prevalent in the DPC set, 2 if in the control set, and 1 or 2 uniformly at random otherwise. 2. The J genes were scored similarly. 3. For each sequence position, every amino acid (and an additional dummy amino acid added to the end of CDR3s shorter than 22 to equalize sequence lengths) was scored 1 or 2 as above. 4. Finally, the class score for position <italic>i</italic> was assigned 1 if the total number of ‘1’ scores obtained by Steps 1–3 and the triplets scores from positions <italic>1,2,…,i−1</italic> was greater than the number of ‘2’ scores; a score of 2 if the number of ‘2’s was greater, and 1 or 2 randomly otherwise. Training sequences were assigned 1 or 2 in position 22 according to their original class. This process ensured knowledge about the likelihood of belonging to either set could be learned by the model across time slices (positions). Class scores for the test sets were calculated based on gene, amino acid, and triplet frequencies in the training sets. Nodes depicting specificity (DPC or control) were included as hidden (latent) variables (the Class nodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Inference on the network was done using the Junction Tree algorithm, and parameters were initiated with Dirichlet priors and fitted to the network by Expectation Maximization with a maximum of 10 iterations. Two DBNs were constructed, one for the DPC training set and one for the control set. To classify TCR sequences, the log likelihood of each model was calculated. For sets of sequences, we calculated the sum log likelihood for each model. The results of the DBN were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, running each train-test pair 10 times, and calculating the mean classification accuracy (number of sequences/sets of sequences correctly classified divided by total number of sequences/sets of sequences). The training and test sets all consisted of equal numbers of DPC-related and control sequences, and running the DBN with shuffled class labels returned ~50% accuracy.

The authors have identified signatures of polyclonal T-cell response following sensitization involving stereotypical T-cell receptor genes.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yuval Elhanati (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript presents a longitudinal analysis of the whole blood TCR repertoire dynamics in patients with Alopecia Areata upon primary, secondary and chronic exposure to DPC treatment. The authors have identified signatures of polyclonal T-cell response following sensitization involving stereotypical T-cell receptor genes. Using a Dynamic Bayesian Network, the authors characterize a sequence based classifier that with a high accuracy can predict sensitization based on TCR sequence. Data collection and analysis are performed carefully and the results are presented clearly, but there are still some concerns that we would like to see addressed.</p><p>1) Most of the analysis rely on recognizing the expanded clones. For this purpose TCRs were counted based on their fold change – 2, 4, 8 and 16. However, the fold change can be very sensitive to the sample size at each time point – smaller samples tend to have lower diversity, which translates into bigger clone frequencies. This bias in particular, is present for TCR clones with low multiplicities (i.e., the majority of TCRs in your data). For example, consider two replicate blood samples such that one is sequenced ten times deeper than the other. A lot of singletons (TCRs with count 1) should be present in the deep sample, whereas almost all of them should be absent in the other sample. To estimate frequencies however, authors adjust these absent counts from 0 to 1 and divide the adjusted counts by the total counts in each sample. As a result, these fluctuations due to sample depth would appear as 10-fold difference in frequency of the singleton clones between samples.</p><p>– To gauge the validity of the analysis, it would be insightful if authors show more basic statistics for the fold change in clone sizes: what are pre-sensitization frequency and counts for expanding clones? Are there a lot of clonotypes that grow from 0 to 8 counts? What fraction of pre-sensitization high-frequency clones expand? One way to show this is to make scatterplots for clone counts in PS vs counts in PT1, ideally in log-scale; see DeWitt et al., 2015 Figure 2 as an example.</p><p>– Given the concerns above, it is also necessary that authors provide a table with details on sample size in data (e.g. unique clonotypes and UMIs for each sequenced sample) and show that the results are robust to these differences. For example, do observed differences in Figure 2 hold, if all time points are down-sampled to the same number of UMI per sample?</p><p>2) A more detailed description of the methods for analysis of clone size dynamics is necessary: Are clonal frequencies estimated after adding 1 to zero counts or are missing clones assigned a minimum frequency in a given sample (see the example in comment 1)?</p><p>3) From the comparison of Figure 2 and Supplementary file 2 it seems that expansion analyses in α and β repertoires do not quite agree. In particular, for the α chain, there are no significant differences between control and patient groups. If there are strong clonal expansions, one expects a correlated fold increase in α and β chains that belong to the same clone. Can authors explain this discrepancy? Is there a correlation between the number of expanded clones in α and the β repertoires?</p><p>4) Presentation of Figure 3 should be improved. For examples, clonal dynamics can be shown by connected lines over time. For comparison, it would be useful to show similar statistics in healthy individuals.</p><p>5) Figure 4 is difficult to read, specifically the left panels in C, D and E. These plots highlight the dependence of the number of expanded TCRs on the expansion fold change, which is rather trivial and not the point the authors are making here. On the other hand, the differences between the different sensitization groups are difficult to see. A different visualization should be considered.</p><p>6) Figure 5: Although V/J usage can reflect a response to DPC, the authors should first analyze whether the V/J usage is patient dependent or treatment dependent. For instance, this can be done by performing the same analysis on all clonotypes from patients versus healthy volunteers, expanded clonotypes in healthy individuals versus 1000 random clones in healthy individuals, etc… In addition, the use of box-plot is not readable for all the V and J. Better summarizing the information as heatmap.</p><p>7) For DBN, it is not clear from the Materials and methods how the sequences are aligned since TCRs have variable length.</p><p>8) To train a DBN, the authors construct the negative set from TCRs of healthy donors which were not in the expanded positive set. A natural negative set would be the patient-specific TCRs that were present in the pre-sensitized sample but did not expand. Authors should check how their results are robust to this choice of negative set.</p><p>Also, TCRs are somewhat individual-specific and so using a negative set from different donors might be problematic and create an &quot;easy&quot; task for classification. This can be fixed by using donor specific training sets.</p><p>What is the ratio of positive to negative set? Again, how robust is the performance of DBN to this training ratio. Authors should provide access to their training and test sets as a separate supplementary file.</p><p>9) Can authors discuss in more detail the TCR features that are informative for DPC classification. Do the authors expect same classifier performance for other tasks (e.g. distinction of TCRs specific for certain viral epitope from TCRs specific for other epitopes), or high accuracy of DBN is limited to the special case of DPC-recognizing TCRs?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54747.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript presents a longitudinal analysis of the whole blood TCR repertoire dynamics in patients with Alopecia Areata upon primary, secondary and chronic exposure to DPC treatment.

To estimate frequencies however, authors adjust these absent counts from 0 to 1 and divide the adjusted counts by the total counts in each sample. As a result, these fluctuations due to sample depth would appear as 10-fold difference in frequency of the singleton clones between samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this very important point. Indeed, the estimation of ratios is fraught with potential confounders of the type the reviewers raise. On the basis of the suggestions below, we have re-examined the raw data (what the reviewers refer to as “basic statistics”). We note (see below, and new Figure 2) that actually almost all the repertoire activity we observe following sensitisation is focused on TCRs ABSENT pre-sensitisation. Rather than calculate frequencies, and impute missing values, we therefore now focus on those TCRs absent at PS, and expanded at PT1. For comparison, we also analyse the complementary group – those absent at PT1, and expanded at PS. In this way, we do not have to impute any missing values, do not have to calculate fold expansion, but can focus directly on the proportion of TCRs present at an expanded threshold at a particular timepoint. In all quantitative analyses we subsample all the repertoires to the same number of TCRs (defined by unique UMIs), so as to add additional robustness to the analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To gauge the validity of the analysis, it would be insightful if authors show more basic statistics for the fold change in clone sizes: what are pre-sensitization frequency and counts for expanding clones? Are there a lot of clonotypes that grow from 0 to 8 counts? What fraction of pre-sensitization high-frequency clones expand? One way to show this is to make scatterplots for clone counts in PS vs counts in PT1, ideally in log-scale; see DeWitt et al., 2015, Figure 2 as an example.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. This way of visualisation is indeed very instructive and these plots are included in Figure 2, and in Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the concerns above, it is also necessary that authors provide a table with details on sample size in data (e.g. unique clonotypes and UMIs for each sequenced sample) and show that the results are robust to these differences. For example, do observed differences in Figure 2 hold, if all time points are down-sampled to the same number of UMI per sample?</p></disp-quote><p>We include unique TCRs and total UMIs for each sample in Supplementary file 1. We show that the proportion of expanded TCRs is not correlated to the number of UMIs per sample. We also carry out repeat subsampling of the data to the lowest number of UMIs and calculate the correlation between expansion and patch score. The qualitative picture is the same, although as discussed in more detail in the manuscript, the expansion threshold at which the mean correlation becomes statistically significant changes a little bit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more detailed description of the methods for analysis of clone size dynamics is necessary: Are clonal frequencies estimated after adding 1 to zero counts or are missing clones assigned a minimum frequency in a given sample (see the example in comment 1)?</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is no longer relevant since, as discussed above, we do not use fold change any more, and do not have to assign values to missing points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) From the comparison of Figure 2 and Supplementary file 2 it seems that expansion analyses in α and β repertoires do not quite agree. In particular, for the α chain, there are no significant differences between control and patient groups. If there are strong clonal expansions, one expects a correlated fold increase in α and β chains that belong to the same clone. Can authors explain this discrepancy? Is there a correlation between the number of expanded clones in α and the β repertoires?</p></disp-quote><p>Expanded α and β TCR numbers are indeed closely correlated (rho – 0.85, p-value&lt;0.0001) (now included in Supplementary file 3). Occasionally there are small differences in statistics for α and β; we presume this reflects sampling effects or some other technical variation between samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Presentation of Figure 3 should be improved. For examples, clonal dynamics can be shown by connected lines over time. For comparison, it would be useful to show similar statistics in healthy individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have redrawn these clonal dynamics as lines and included healthy volunteers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 is difficult to read, specifically the left panels in C, D and E. These plots highlight the dependence of the number of expanded TCRs on the expansion fold change, which is rather trivial and not the point the authors are making here. On the other hand, the differences between the different sensitization groups are difficult to see. A different visualization should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely redrawn this figure, focusing on the correlation between number of expanded TCRs and sensitization scores. We believe the results are now clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5: Although V/J usage can reflect a response to DPC, the authors should first analyze whether the V/J usage is patient dependent or treatment dependent. For instance, this can be done by performing the same analysis on all clonotypes from patients versus healthy volunteers, expanded clonotypes in healthy individuals versus 1000 random clones in healthy individuals, etc… In addition, the use of box-plot is not readable for all the V and J. Better summarizing the information as heatmap.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that V/J usage may be patient dependent. For this reason, we have compared the expanded set of each individual against unexpanded sets from the same individual. This shows that certain genes are over-represented in the expanded TCRs compared to background for the individual. We have rearranged the plots to make them more readable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For DBN, it is not clear from the Materials and methods how the sequences are aligned since TCRs have variable length.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an explanation of how the sequences are aligned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) To train a DBN, the authors construct the negative set from TCRs of healthy donors which were not in the expanded positive set. A natural negative set would be the patient-specific TCRs that were present in the pre-sensitized sample but did not expand. Authors should check how their results are robust to this choice of negative set.</p><p>Also, TCRs are somewhat individual-specific and so using a negative set from different donors might be problematic and create an &quot;easy&quot; task for classification. This can be fixed by using donor specific training sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the control set to TCRs from the pre-sensitization repertoires of the same donors as the expanded set. As suggested by the reviewer, this is indeed a more difficult classification task, and we have found that the DBN is very good at telling individuals apart !!! With the new control set, classifying individual sequences is somewhat harder for the DBN, but it is still very successful at classifying sets of sequences. We have included both the results for sets and single sequences in the new Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the ratio of positive to negative set? Again, how robust is the performance of DBN to this training ratio. Authors should provide access to their training and test sets as a separate supplementary file.</p></disp-quote><p>The positive and negative sets are the same size, and running the model with shuffled class labels produces around 50% accuracy. We have added this to Materials and methods. The positive and negative sets are submitted as Supplementary files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can authors discuss in more detail the TCR features that are informative for DPC classification. Do the authors expect same classifier performance for other tasks (e.g. distinction of TCRs specific for certain viral epitope from TCRs specific for other epitopes), or high accuracy of DBN is limited to the special case of DPC-recognizing TCRs?</p></disp-quote><p>We are writing a manuscript fully focused on the DBN and we would prefer to leave the discussion of other data sets etc. to this other manuscript, as it is not really relevant to this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
