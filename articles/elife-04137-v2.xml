Plasmalemma clathrin-coated structures range from unitary domed assemblies to expansive planar constructions with internal or flanking invaginated buds. Precisely how these morphologically-distinct coats are formed, and whether all are functionally equivalent for selective cargo internalization is still disputed. We have disrupted the genes encoding a set of early arriving clathrin-coat constituents, FCHO1 and FCHO2, in HeLa cells. Endocytic coats do not disappear in this genetic background; rather clustered planar lattices predominate and endocytosis slows, but does not cease. The central linker of FCHO proteins acts as an allosteric regulator of the prime endocytic adaptor, AP-2. By loading AP-2 onto the plasma membrane, FCHO proteins provide a parallel pathway for AP-2 activation and clathrin-coat fabrication. Further, the steady-state morphology of clathrin-coated structures appears to be a manifestation of the availability of the muniscin linker during lattice polymerization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04137.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04137.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04137.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells can take proteins and other molecules that are either embedded in, or attached to, their surface membrane and move them inside via a process called endocytosis. This process often involves a protein called clathrin working together with numerous other proteins. Early on, a complex of four proteins, called the adaptor protein-2 complex, interacts with both the ‘cargo’ molecules that are to be taken into the cell, and the cell membrane. Clathrin molecules then assemble into an ordered lattice-like coat, on top of the adaptor protein complex layer. This deforms a small patch of the cell membrane and curves it inwards. The clathrin molecules coat this pocket as it grows in size, until it engulfs the cargo. The pocket quickly pinches off from the membrane to form a bubble-like structure called a vesicle, which is brought into the cell.</p><p>A family of proteins termed Muniscins were thought to be involved in the early stages of endocytosis and have to arrive at the membrane before the adaptor protein-2 complex and clathrin. But experiments to test this idea—that reduced, or ‘knocked-down’, the production of Muniscins—had given conflicting results. As such, it remained unclear how the small patches of membrane carrying cargo molecules are marked as being destined to become clathrin-coated vesicles.</p><p>Now Umasankar et al. have studied the role that these proteins play in the early stages of endocytosis in human cells grown in a laboratory. A gene-editing approach was used to precisely disrupt a gene that codes for a Muniscin protein called FCHO2. Umasankar et al. observed that these ‘edited’ cells formed clathrin coats that were more irregular compared with those that form in normal cells. Nevertheless, clathrin-mediated vesicles still formed when this protein was absent, though the process of endocytosis was slower.</p><p>Similar results were seen when Umasankar et al. used the same approach to disrupt the gene for a related protein called FCHO1 in the same cells. A short fragment of the Muniscin proteins, called the linker, was shown to bind to, and activate, the adaptor protein-2 complex. The linker then recruits this complex to the specific regions of the cell membrane where clathrin-coated vesicles will form. Several dozen other proteins also accumulate where clathrin pockets form; as such, one of the next challenges will be to investigate if this mechanism of locally activating the cargo-gathering machinery is common in living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04137.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04137.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>TALEN</kwd><kwd>adaptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM106963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traub</surname><given-names>Linton M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The muniscin protein FCHO1 interacts with, and activates, the adapter protein-2 complex (AP-2) to promote the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The precise purpose of clathrin-coated vesicles was correctly deduced 50 years ago from thin-section electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roth and Porter, 1964</xref>). Noticing the very close apposition of a compacted lumenal protein load and a cytosol-oriented ‘bristle’ coat on opposite faces of striking membrane invaginations, it was astutely reasoned that the bulbous plasmalemma structures ferry macromolecules into the cell interior in a highly selective manner. While it was soon clear clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a rapid activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Goldstein, 1976</xref>), and is importantly involved in many fundamental cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brodsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>), the regularity of the static coated structures in micrograph views masks the true underlying molecular dynamics and complexity. It is also challenging to identify the very earliest stages of clathrin coat assembly in thin sections because of the restricted size, ill-defined morphological features, and a lack of prominent membrane curvature. With the recent live-cell clarification of the linked temporal steps that define clathrin-coated structure initiation, growth, invagination and scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), it is clear that a large number of gene products are involved. The choreographed arrival and departure of these numerous proteins matches well their defined biochemical activities and the morphological progression of the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, what exactly defines a restricted plasma membrane zone that is destined to become a clathrin-coated bud remains elusive. In this regard, the clathrin coats at the cell surface are distinct from many other intracellular cargo sorting coats in that the selected assembly site is not demarcated by deposition of a GTP-bound small GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). The lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) is required for clathrin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boucrot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zoncu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nunez et al., 2011</xref>), but this phosphoinositide is broadly distributed over the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Ordered polymerization of a clathrin patch in fact appears to be a variable and probabilistic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brach et al., 2014</xref>). The nucleation stage displays the widest temporal variation and likely involves the largest number of protein cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). While the principal heterotetameric cargo-selective adaptor, designated AP-2, is certainly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mitsunari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>), its initial occurrence at inchoate bud sites is paralleled by a sizable suite of early-arriving pioneers, including eps15, intersectin, epsin, Fcho1 and Fcho2, CALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) and Necap 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>). The Fcho family (<underline>F</underline>er/<underline>C</underline>ip4 <underline>h</underline>omology <underline>o</underline>nly proteins), collectively termed the muniscins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reider et al., 2009</xref>), is posited to act as internalization site founders on the basis of the biochemical properties of the proteins and the endocytic consequences of RNAi-mediated transcript silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>). Here we show that munsicins are indeed consequential endocytic pioneers, but that clathrin-mediated endocytosis still persists in their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Uezu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brach et al., 2014</xref>).

And the clathrin-coated regions in the clone 1.E cells are populated with a full cohort of early-arriving clathrin coat pioneers despite the abnormal surface arrangement. At steady state, surface deposited AP-2 and clathrin are accompanied by CALM, DAB2, intersectin 1, EPS15 and HRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–J</xref>), all members of the pioneer module of endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) and found in HeLa cell clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borner et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in obvious contrast to other observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>), neither clathrin nor AP-2 is completely soluble in the clone 1.E cells in spite of the extremely low level of muniscins compared with unedited cells. Further, these results demonstrate plainly that congregation of EPS15/EPS15R and intersectin 1 at bud zones does not depend upon stoichiometric FCHO1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>).

In the parental cells, these account for &lt;25% of the AP-2 signal while in the FCHO1/2-depleted cells these small puncta represent almost 45% of the total AP-2. There is also an increase in the largest (&gt;600 nm<sup>2</sup>) clathrin assemblages, as previously seen in <italic>FCHO2</italic> silenced HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>).

Analogous results are obtained upon measuring the distribution of EPS15 in the two cell types. Engineered loss of muniscins therefore shifts the equilibrium of clathrin lattices at the cell surface to the very small and the largest forms.</p><p>The ultrastructural basis for the altered surface distribution of clathrin assemblies in clone 1.E cells can be appreciated in deep-etch EM replicas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At steady state, the ventral surface of the parental HeLa SS6 cell line typically exhibits a range of clathrin-coated assemblies and invaginated buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Both solitary coated buds and spherical coated invaginations adjacent to regions of planar clathrin lattice are regularly dispersed over the membrane. By contrast, conspicuous expanses of plasma membrane devoid of polyhedral clathrin typify the clone 1.E cells, and overall the number of deeply invaginated buds is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Whereas abutting planar assemblages are abundant, individual, spatially isolated de novo forming coated buds are present in clone 1.E cells, as well as small patches of flat polygonal assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Beside the spatial effects of <italic>FCHO1/2</italic> gene disruption, structural alterations within the assembled clathrin layer are also apparent.

Because the transferrin receptor has a YXXØ-type YTRF internalization signal that depends on AP-2 for uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinrichsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Motley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2004</xref>), our results suggest that AP-2 cargo capture may be compromised in the clathrin assemblies in clone 1.E cells. The disparity in transferrin sequestration between steady-state clone 1.E and ordinary clathrin-coated structures is better appreciated by transfecting GFP-tagged full-length FCHO1 into the gene-edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–L</xref>). Forced reexpression of FCHO1 normalizes the AP-2 arrangement on the ventral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). A 2-min pulse of transferrin concentrates the ligand near these AP-2/FCHO1-positive spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–H</xref>). Adjacent untransfected clone 1.E cells have the characteristic dispersed transferrin signal over the plasma membrane, and even strongly AP-2-positive structures do not concentrate transferrin similar to relatively dimmer AP-2 puncta in the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Further analysis of transferrin binding to GFP-FCHO1-transfected HeLa clone 1.E cells by total internal reflection microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) corroborates the defect in transferrin clustering in the clone 1.E cell line.</p><p>After a 10-min pulse of transferrin, medial plane confocal optical sections illustrate that both the clone 1.E cells and neighboring GFP-FCHO1-transfected cells accumulate the ligand in perinuclear endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–L</xref>), albeit internalization is more efficient in the presence of expressed FCHO1. Stalled ligand-bound receptor still persists at the surface of the clone 1.E cells.

By contrast, the GFP-μHD does concentrate at plasma membrane clathrin assemblages, because the domain functions as an interaction hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dergai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>) but, again, does not refashion these atypical coated zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,D′</xref>).

Deletion of residues 316–467 from full-length GFP-tagged FCHO1 prevents complementation of the clathrin distribution despite deposition of the transfected protein at clathrin pincta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,H′</xref>). The linker section of FCHO1, but neither the EFC domain nor μHD, also repatterns the bulky clathrin in MCF-7 cells to more regularly dispersed arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).

All four subunits of the heterotetramer sediment with the GST-FCHO1 linker, but engagement of AP-2 is not as efficient as the C-terminal portion of the cargo-selective monomeric adaptor ARH that binds directly to the β2 subunit appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mishra et al., 2005</xref>), and clathrin binding is limited.

Fused to GST, the conserved central segments of FCHO2 (residues 314–444) and Sgip1 (residues 77–214) also bind to cytosolic AP-2, although the interaction with FCHO2 is comparatively weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>The independently folded α- and β2-subunit appendages of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) can engage FCHO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>).

The C-terminal portion of EPS15 is the highest affinity μHD binding partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A limited sequence tract between residues 595 and 636 represents the principal interaction region in EPS15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion of part of this region (residues 617–636) within the GST-EPS15 (595–896) fusion protein has a strong inhibitory effect on both FCHO1 and FCHO2 interactions from K562 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). AP-2 also binds to the C-terminal third of EPS15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but with lower apparent affinity and utilizing the tandemly arrayed Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF) tripeptide repeats positioned distal to the μHD-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benmerah et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iannolo et al., 1997</xref>). Consequently, the association of cytosolic AP-2 with the GST-EPS15 (Δ617–636) is not different from the binding to the whole GST-EPS15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Yet there is a strong decrease in the amount of clathrin associated with the immobilized Δ617–636 fusion, which parallels the diminished engagement of FCHO1 and FCHO2. The majority of the soluble clathrin remains in the Δ617–636 assay supernatant fractions. Because AP-2 cannot engage clathrin trimers productively without undergoing allosteric activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>), it is as if FCHO1/2 promote conformational rearrangement of AP-2 to facilitate clathrin binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Functional linkage between the muniscin linker polypeptide and AP-2</title><p>The role of the FCHO1 linker polypeptide was further explored using a tailored fusion to the cytosolic aspect of Tac (CD25), a type I transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Uchiyama et al., 1981</xref>). Transient expression of Tac in HeLa SS6 cells leads to surface accumulation because this α chain of the IL-2 receptor is poorly internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Humphrey et al., 1993</xref>). At steady state, individual low-level-expressing cells have a prominent surface pool of Tac and an internal population that overlaps partly with the Golgi-region marker GPP130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Linstedt et al., 1997</xref>) and with the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGOLN2/TGN46). The intracellular population in these cells thus represents primarily the biosynthetic trafficking of new Tac molecules en route to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,A′</xref>). Cells expressing high levels of the Tac transgene have, in addition, a second internal accumulation of Tac, which colocalizes well with a pulse of internalized transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Switching a Tac-linker (FCHO1 residues 265–609) hybrid-encoding plasmid for Tac leads to similar but not identical expression and spread in HeLa SS6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–B″</xref>). Increased localization of Tac-linker with the transferrin endocytic marker indicates that this customized fusion is more rapidly internalized from the cell surface than the native Tac protein. Analogous results are obtained upon expressing a Tac-FCHO1 μHD (residues 609–889) hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,C′</xref>). Consequently, we find that ectopic Tac and Tac-fusion proteins display a dichotomous distribution of surface and internal pools, the composition of the latter differing depending on the level of Tac protein driven by the transfected plasmid DNA and on the amino acid sequence of the cytosolic portion.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04137.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Trafficking of exogenous Tac and Tac-FCHO1 fusion proteins in HeLa cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>A′</bold>) Maximal projection (<bold>A</bold>) and a selected medial plane (<bold>A′</bold>) of deconvolved confocal image <italic>z</italic>-stacks of HeLa SS6 cells transiently transfected with a Tac-encoding plasmid.

First, assembled AP-2, normally restricted entirely to puncta on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, becomes mistargeted to juxtanuclear regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–A″</xref>), located similarly to the Golgi and endosome compartment markers that overlap with intracellular Tac. The ectopic AP-2 is accompanied by colocalized EPS15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). We infer that the high local density of the Tac-FCHO1 linker, as it traverses the biosynthetic pathway following ER export or concentrates on maturing endosomes, promotes anomalous recruitment of AP-2. Yet, when a corresponding Tac fusion with the FCHO1 μHD (residues 609–889) is transfected, very strong EPS15 and intersectin 1 (not shown) deposition on the Golgi/endosome region occurs, but strikingly this is not paralleled by AP-2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B–B″</xref>). The effect of overexpression of a Tac-linker + μHD (FCHO1 residues 316–889) hybrid appears similar to the linker alone, albeit with more robust EPS15 binding accompanying juxtanuclear AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C–C″</xref>). Visualizing the Tac-FCHO1 fusion-expressing cells with an anti-Tac mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D–D″</xref>) clarifies that the juxtanuclear pool of endocytic proteins is indeed recruited to Tac-positive internal structures. Thus, EPS15 (and intersectin 1) recruited by the Tac-anchored FCHO1 μHD concentrated on Golgi/endosome membranes does not attract cytosolic AP-2, but AP-2 associated with these compartments through the membrane-linked linker polypeptide results in deposition of EPS15. Impressively, the massing of AP-2 and EPS15 upon perinuclear biosynthetic and endocytic organelles in Tac-FCHO1 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A–C</xref>) or Tac-FCHO1 linker + μHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D–F</xref>) expressing cells occurs in the absence of any conspicuous PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> enrichment in these compartments, as judged by a GFP-tagged PLCδ1 PH domain sensor selective for PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04137.019</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>An artificial transmembrane FCHO1 linker protein misrecruits AP-2 onto internal membrane structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>A″</bold>) Selected medial (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>A′</bold>) or basal (<bold>A″</bold>) optical sections of deconvolved confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks collected from HeLa SS6 cells transiently transfected with Tac-FCHO1 linker (residues 265–609).

While Tac alone has no noticeable effect on the characteristic distribution of AP-2 and EPS15 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A–D</xref>), the Tac-FCHO1 linker promotes deposition of a fraction of these proteins onto juxtanuclear membranes and remodels the abnormal surface clathrin patches into more homogenous and regularly scattered assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E–H</xref>). By contrast, the Tac-FCHO1 μHD gives rise to noteworthy sequestration of EPS15 on juxtanuclear structures, as occurs in the parental HeLa SS6 cells, but again without accompanying AP-2 recruitment or refashioning of the surface clathrin structures in the clone 1.E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13I–L</xref>).

In fact, a considerable number of clathrin coat components and ancillary proteins have been experimentally deleted or incapacitated without complete disruption of clathrin-dependent internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kang-Decker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Morris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kamikura and Cooper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holmes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Koh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mullen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pozzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scotland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsushima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alazami et al., 2014</xref>). Although Fcho1 and Fcho2 were proposed to be all-important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>), we have carefully evaluated the overall veracity of this provocative idea. HeLa cells with undetectable levels of FCHO1 and FCHO2 still fabricate clathrin lattices and internalize clathrin-dependent transmembrane cargo. We have maintained these muniscin-depleted cells in culture for many months.</p><p>That is not to say that these proteins are insignificant. The cellular concentration of muniscins regulates clathrin-coated structure organization and dynamics and, thereby, the efficiency of cargo internalization. Clearly, this underscores the importance of these particular pioneers in clathrin lattice biogenesis and function. The enlarged clustered clathrin assemblies characteristic of essentially-munsicin-null HeLa cells appear to be linked to physiological compensation. Operationally, they resemble hot spots, areas of repeated vesicle budding from non-terminal clathrin puncta within a spatially restricted area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nunez et al., 2011</xref>). Hot spots were actually reported the first time GFP-tagged clathrin-coated structures were visualized live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaidarov et al., 1999</xref>). Endocytic activity at hot spots is more resistant to perturbations in the levels AP-2 and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, so-called nucleation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nunez et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the extended long-lived lattices are likely better adapted to coupled budding events to conserve and reuse limiting factors and maintain steady, but slowed, clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>The reduced capacity to sequester transferrin (receptors) within the clathrin-coated structures that we note in clone 1.E cells could indicate that the unstructured linker domain of FCHO1/2 stabilizes the activated, open form of AP-2 to bias cargo capture. This idea is in line with the increased abundance of the smallest population of coated structures in the clone 1.E (and clone #64) cells, presumably abortive structures because of the overall reduced rate of transferrin uptake in these cells. However, live-cell imaging discloses that FCHO1/2 arrive at nascent clathrin bud sites on the cell surface with or before AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), and current copy number estimates suggest that AP-2 outnumbers FCHO2 in HeLa cells by an order of magnitude and FCHO1 by at least a factor of 1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>). So the interaction between AP-2 and FCHO1/2 is unlikely to be stoichiometric within the lattice, as borne out by proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borner et al., 2012</xref>). An obvious question, though, is why AP-2 is not able to properly engage the transferrin receptor YTFR sorting signal despite being positioned in the surface lattices of clone 1.E cells. As indicated above, it is well established that the heterotetramer displays multiple modes of attachment to membrane-apposed clathrin. In addition to four spatially discrete PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaidarov and Keen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>), AP-2 has at least two dedicated cargo-specific interactions surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>), a clathrin box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shih et al., 1995</xref>) to contact the clathrin heavy chain terminal domain β-propeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">ter Haar et al., 2000</xref>), as well as a second site in the β2 subunit appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edeling et al., 2006</xref>) that binds to the extended α-solenoid region of the clathrin heavy chain designated the ankle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Knuehl et al., 2006</xref>). Both the α- and β2-subunit appendages interact with a large overlapping set of early-arriving clathrin-associated sorting and accessory proteins. The appendages do not depend on allosteric changes within the core to promote binding because AP-2 can be quantitatively affinity purified with immobilized appendage binding motifs or immunoprecipitated with mAb AP.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chin et al., 1989</xref>), which binds to the platform interaction site of the α appendage. We suspect that the wide range of interaction possibilities allows deposition of some incompletely rearranged AP-2 at clathrin lattices formed in the absence of muniscins. AP-2 can transition between metastable states; a partially open form bound to the dileucine sorting signal has been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). An incomplete conformational transition in all membrane-associated AP-2 in the clone 1.E cells may also be linked to the alterations in lattice arrangement we see. Using synthetic liposome templates, AP-2 driven clathrin-coated buds are spherical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>) while clathrin coats nucleated by a monomeric clathrin binding domain are flat but stabilize membrane remodeling induced by thermal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dannhauser and Ungewickell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The crescent-shaped EFC domain in the FCHO proteins prompted the conjecture that initial dimpling of a spherical membrane patch defined a bud site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>). Further, if the munsicins, and their pioneer binding partners collectively assembled into a circumferential rim defining the outer edge of the indented membrane, they could stabilize nascent buds possibly by preventing lateral diffusional escape of phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) necessary for successful placement of incoming inner layer coat constituents. Yet two lines of evidence argue against this notion: First, the linker region alone is able to correct or remodel the abnormal distribution of clathrin structures, even when not directly membrane associated. Second, the Tac-linker + μHD chimera, while membrane spanning, is unlikely to similarly remodel membrane topology adjacent to the linker, but it is still able to restore the organization of surface clathrin in clone #64/1.E cells. Instead, the unstructured linker tract between the folded EFC and μHD domains in FCHO1, and the sequence-related portion of Sgip1, are able to drive membrane deposition of AP-2 and partner engagement. In this sense, muniscins could operate in a conceptually analogous manner to the small GTPase Arf1 activating the structurally and functionally related heterotetrameric AP-1 clathrin adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ren et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our findings allow us to rationalize a number of recent studies with an integrated model for the biogenesis of clathrin lattices at the cell surface. We concur that both AP-2 and Fcho1/2 are central regulators during clathrin coat initiation; both are clearly core members of the pioneer module of endocytic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>). A pivotal assembly step involves the conformational rearrangement of AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Höning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). This shift in the equilibrium from the closed cytosolic basal conformation to the open, assembly-competent form of AP-2 can be regulated synergistically by PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and tyrosine (YXXØ)- or dileucine ([DE]XXXL[LIM]-based internalization signals). Reorganization of AP-2 by these allosteric regulators could account for the reported minimal stoichiometry of two AP-2 heterotetramers and one or two clathrin trimers to nucleate a clathrin-coated structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed targeted gene disruption of the AP-2 μ2 subunit is pre-implantation lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mitsunari et al., 2005</xref>). But in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>, AP-2 is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yeung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, seven early module (pioneer) proteins can be deleted without fully disrupting clathrin-dependent internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brach et al., 2014</xref>). As noted above, loss of numerous mammalian pioneer factors (Eps15, CALM, Hrb, epsin, Dab2, intersectin, Necap 1) similarly does not terminate clathrin-mediated endocytosis. One interpretation of these results is that there are several parallel pathways to arrive at an internalization competent clathrin assemblage at the plasma membrane. However, extinguishing the muniscins has a more severe effect than loss of a set of pioneers that physically engage the μHD. This is plainly apparent in cells expressing the tailored Tac-μHD protein—despite massive misrouting of EPS15 (and EPS15R and intersectin) to the juxtanuclear region, AP-2-positive puncta at the cell surface persist. Our findings indicate that FCHO1, and specifically the linker segment, interacts with AP-2 and can promote membrane deposition of the heterotetramer in the absence of elevated levels of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Further, because AP-2 cannot bind productively to clathrin in the closed basal conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>), our biochemical experiments showing that FCHO1 can modulate the clathrin binding properties of EPS15-bound AP-2 suggest that FCHO1 can provide an alternative pathway to rearrange AP-2 to promote cargo capture, clathrin lattice assembly and budding. The remarkable effect that a membrane-attached FCHO1 linker has on the disposition of surface clathrin structures supports this idea. The appearance of expanded planar clathrin sheets, which often contain assembly defects in cells depleted of muniscins (FCHO2 principally), argues additionally for an important role of these proteins in overseeing swift and regular polymerization of the clathrin coat. Necap 1 also exerts a regulatory input on AP-2 by competitively engaging several binding surfaces on the heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ritter et al., 2013</xref>). As FCHO1 and Necap 1 associate with each other, whether the effect of the FCHO1 linker directly involves Necap 1 will be important to establish. Finally, our results defining regulation of overall size of clathrin-coated buds raise the possibility that kinetic uncoupling between the outer and inner layer components of other vesicular coats could also alter the morphology of the forming tubulovesiclular carrier to accommodate variably sized cargo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of TALEN gene-edited cells</title><p>All TALENs were designed using open-access software (Mojo Hand; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.talendesign.org">http://www.talendesign.org</ext-link>) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedell et al., 2012</xref>).

Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 at 37°C on MatTek dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) and imaged continuously at 5 s/frame. GFP/YFP was excited with a 488 nm laser, Alexa Fluor546 conjugated anti-Tac mAb with a 561 nm laser, and transferrin-Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with a 647 nm laser line. Images were collected using an Andor (Belfast, Ireland) Xyla 5.5 camera; at full resolution under these conditions the pixel size with a 1 × coupler matches Nyquist sampling (120 nm <italic>xy</italic> exactly). Data sets were acquired acquired using Nikon Elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Adherent plasma membrane from parental HeLa SS6 and clone #64/1.E cells were prepared for rapid-freeze, deep-etch electron microscopy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heuser, 2000</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Suzanne Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There is tremendous interest in the earliest events underlying clathrin mediated endocytosis, and this careful study explores the roles of FCHO 1 and 2, previously implicated as being key and essential for endocytosis initiation. The authors created a HeLa cell in which FCHO1 and FCHO2 genes are targeted using TALEN endonucleases, in an effort to clarify confusion that has resulted from other labs achieving different extents of siRNA depletion. They report that a central FCHO1 linker region is key to AP2 recruitment.</p><p>The experiments are carried out with great care yet the paper would benefit from some tightening and clarification of the figures to guide non-experts through the comparisons. The reviewers have two major requests.</p><p>First, it would be great to show direct interaction of AP2 with the linker region. This would make the story very complete. You showed previously that alpha and beta2 appendages both bind to FCHO1; it should be very easy to test if binding occurs via the linker.</p><p>Second, you conclude that these proteins “impact the fidelity of the polyhedral construction” and are not “obligatory for sustained clathrin lattice growth”. These conclusions would be bolstered significantly by at least some quantitation of marker protein distributions in fluorescent micrographs (size of stained objects from Cellprofiler or ImageJ for quantitative comparison) and careful assessment of the EM images as follows:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, (Please show magnification bars in all figures) the authors conclude that clone 1.E cells “display geometrically poorly ordered lattices” yet this is hard to discern from the images shown. Please quantify the shapes (# and size of pentagons/hexagons/heptagons), diameters of patches, etc. to provide metrics that support the conclusions. The use of deep etch to score this phenotype is a really nice part of the paper, but the differences need to be made more clear.</p><p>In summary, an excellent and interesting contribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04137.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The experiments are carried out with great care yet the paper would benefit from some tightening and clarification of the figures to guide non-experts through the comparisons. The reviewers have two requests</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, it would be great to show direct interaction of AP2 with the linker region. This would make the story very complete. You showed previously that alpha and beta2 appendages both bind to FCHO1; it should be very easy to test if binding occurs via the linker</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this issue is central to our claim that the FCHO1/2 linker polypeptide can act as a regulator of AP-2 conformation and membrane association. To address whether we could detect a physical interaction between the FCHO1/2 linker and AP-2, we performed two additional sets of experiments.</p><p>The first was to interrogate whether the a appendage of AP-2 binds to the FCHO1 linker region, because as the reviewers correctly state, we published previously that the a appendage (and to a lesser extent the b2 appendage) can pull down FCHO1 in biochemical assays. For this we used the competition pull-down format. Soluble AP-2 in rat brain cytosol binds to bead-bound GST-FCHO1 linker (316-467), but addition of a large excess of the AP-2 a appendage has no appreciable effect on this binding. Under the same conditions, the C-terminal tract of EPS15 fused to GST also binds AP-2 from brain cytosol but added a appendage clearly competes with the intact heterotetramer in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude from this work that it is NOT the AP-2 appendages that bind to the FCHO1 unstructured linker sequence.</p><p>More important, we then conducted protein interaction assays with the purified recombinant core of AP-2. This heterotetrameric complex binds physically to the FCHO1, FCHO2 and Sgip1 linker regions, and the presence of the bound AP-2 subunit chains is confirmed by immunoblotting. We conclude that the linker polypeptide engages the AP-2 core complex directly, which is certainly more gratifying and mechanistically understandable if this interaction operates by changing the conformation of AP-2 to promote membrane attachment, cargo capture and coat assembly.</p><p>These new results are by far the most significant addition to the revised version, and the accompanying narrative text is now added to the manuscript as part of the extended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and supplement. We are very grateful to the reviewers for urging us to extend our work and ascertain that the linker interaction is both direct and involves the tetrameric core of AP-2.</p><p><italic>Second, you conclude that these proteins “impact the fidelity of the polyhedral construction” and are not ”obligatory for sustained clathrin lattice growth”</italic>. <italic>These conclusions would be bolstered significantly by at least some quantitation of marker protein distributions in fluorescent micrographs (size of stained objects from Cellprofiler or ImageJ for quantitative comparison) and careful assessment of the EM images as follows:</italic></p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, (Please show magnification bars in all figures) the authors conclude that clone 1.E cells “display geometrically poorly ordered lattices” yet this is hard to discern from the images shown.

The use of deep etch to score this phenotype is a really nice part of the paper, but the differences need to be made more clear</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we have added scale bars to all of the morphologic images. Further, we have used Nikon Elements software package to measure size distribution parameters and now state the findings in the text:</p><p>“Comparative quantitative analysis of the distribution of AP-2 in HeLa SS6 and the clone 1.E cells indicates a sharp increase in the very smallest (&lt;60 nm<sup>2</sup>) coated structures on the ventral surface. In the parental cells, these account for &lt;25% of the AP-2 signal while in the FCHO1/2-depleted cells these small puncta represent almost 45% of the total AP-2. There is also an increase in the largest (&gt;600 nm<sup>2</sup>) clathrin assemblages, as previously seen in FCHO2 silenced HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mulkearns and Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>). After disruption of the FCHO1 and FCHO2 genes, 46% of membrane-associated AP-2 is present in structures &gt;600 nm<sup>2</sup> while only 29% of AP-2 occurs within this size category in the HeLa SS6 cells. Analogous results are obtained upon measuring the distribution of EPS15 in the two cell types. Engineered loss of muniscins therefore shifts the equilibrium of clathrin lattices at the cell surface to the very small and the largest forms.”</p><p>For the quantification of the freeze-etch EM micrographs, we attempted to provide metrics as urged by the reviewers. Unfortunately, the difficulty is that, as we are trying to convey, in our preparations of replicas from the FCHO1/2 doubly depleted HeLa clone #64/1.E cells, the ultrastructure of the lattices is generally too distorted to accurately count the full number of hexagons, pentagons and heptagons. This is illustrated by an enlargement from the clone #64/1.E cell freeze-etch data sets, shown for the reviewers below:<fig id="fig15" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04137-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>There are numerous instances where it is difficult to define the precise edges of a polygon within the array. We are unable to provide an accurate metric at this time; this will be the subject of additional future analysis. In any event, what we are basically trying to display with these images is that there are discernable ultrastructural differences between the parental planar clathrin lattices and those that are present in the deep-etch replicas of clone #64/1.E cells. We have now prepared a second rapid freeze-deep etch image set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) that we believe answers qualitatively the reviewers query about the difficulty in discerning the geometric differences from the images previously shown. In the new figure, enlargements from two similarly sized zones of clathrin in either the HeLa SS6 or HeLa clone #64/1.E cells are presented. The regular features of the normal parental arrays are highlighted, and the abnormalities in the clone #64/1.E cells are identified. The fact that there are planar clathrin assemblies in the clone #64/1.E cells forms basis for our assertion that FCHO1/2 are not “obligatory for sustained clathrin lattice growth”.</p><p>Ultimately, this is not a central point of the manuscript, but the number of separate images we now show should make it clear that the abnormal lattices are reproducibly seen in our data set. With the current time constraints, we feel that a thorough morphological description and quantitative treatment of the lattice changes is out of the scope of the present study. Yet, given the entire collection of results presented in this manuscript, we hope that the reviewers will be satisfied with the supplement that better delineates (albeit qualitatively) the ultrastructural abnormalities in the FCHO1/2-depleted cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
