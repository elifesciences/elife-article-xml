sequence identity than non-homologous proteins. Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09492.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09492.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells grow and divide with remarkable precision to ensure that their genetic material is faithfully duplicated and distributed equally to the newly formed daughter cells. This precision is achieved through a series of steps known as the cell cycle. The cell cycle is ancient and conserved across all Eukaryotes, including plants, animals and fungi. However, some of the core proteins present in animals and fungi are unrelated. This raises the question as to how a drastic change could have occurred and been tolerated over evolution.</p><p>In animals and plants, a protein called E2F controls the expression of genes that are needed to begin the cell cycle. In most fungi, an equivalent protein called SBF performs the same role as E2F, but the two proteins are very different and do not appear to share a common ancestor. This is unexpected given that fungi and animals are more closely related to one another than either is to plants.</p><p>Medina et al. searched the genomes of many animals, fungi, plants, algae, and their closest relatives for genes that encoded proteins like E2F and SBF. SBF-like proteins were only found in fungi, yet some fungal groups had cell cycle regulators like those found in animals. Zoosporic fungi, which diverged early from the fungal ancestor, had both SBF- and E2F-like proteins, while many fungi later lost E2F during evolution.</p><p>So how did fungi acquire SBF? Medina et al. observed that part of the SBF protein is similar to proteins found in many viruses. The broad distribution of these viral SBF-like proteins suggests that they arose first in viruses, and a fungal ancestor acquired one such protein during a viral infection. As SBF and E2F bind similar DNA sequences, Medina et al. hypothesized that this viral SBF hijacked control of the cell cycle in the fungal ancestor by controlling expression of genes that were originally controlled only by E2F. In support of this idea, experiments showed that many E2F binding sites in modern genes are also SBF binding sites, and that E2F sites can substitute for SBF sites in SBF-controlled genes. Future experiments in zoosporic fungi, which have animal-like and fungal-like features, would provide a glimpse of how a fungal ancestor may have used both SBF and E2F. These experiments may also reveal why most fungi have retained the newer SBF but lost the ancestral and widely conserved E2F protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09492.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09492.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>chytrid</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2OD008654-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Edgar M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchler</surname><given-names>Nicolas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Edgar M</given-names></name><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Jonathan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skotheim</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchler</surname><given-names>Nicolas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BAA-11-66</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medina</surname><given-names>Edgar M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buchler</surname><given-names>Nicolas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM092925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Jonathan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skotheim</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

For example, the cell cycle controls proliferation in response to a variety of internal and external signals during the G1 phase, between cell division and DNA replication. These input signals, including cell growth, are integrated into a gradual increase in cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, which triggers a feedback loop at the basis of the all-or-none irreversible decision to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Topology of G1/S regulatory network in mammals and budding yeast is conserved, yet many regulators exhibit no detectable sequence homology.</title><p>Schematic diagram illustrating the extensive similarities between (<bold>A</bold>) animal and (<bold>B</bold>) budding yeast G1/S cell cycle control networks.

In animal cells, Cyclin D, in complex with either Cdk4 or Cdk6, initiates cell cycle entry by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. This begins the inactivation of pRb and the concomitant activation of the E2F transcription factors that induce transcription of downstream cyclins E and A, which complete the inhibition of pRb thereby forming a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, in budding yeast, the G1 cyclin Cln3-Cdk1 complex initiates the transition by phosphorylating and partially inactivating Whi5, an inhibitor of the SBF transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nasmyth and Dirick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sidorova and Breeden, 1993</xref>). This allows for SBF-dependent transcription of the downstream G1 cyclins <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, which also inactivate Whi5 to complete a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Skotheim et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, both the biochemical function of G1 regulators and their specific targets are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Many of the individual proteins performing identical roles are unlikely to be true orthologs, <italic>i.e.</italic>, it cannot be inferred from sequence identity that the proteins evolved from a common ancestral gene. In yeast, a single cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk1, binds distinct cyclin partners to perform all the functions of three non-orthologous animal Cdks (Cdk2, 4 and 6) during cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu and Kipreos, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, no member of the transcription factor complex SBF-Whi5 exhibits amino acid sequence identity or structural similarity to any member of the E2F-pRb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hasan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, Cdk inhibitors such as Sic1 and p27 play analogous roles in yeast and mammals despite a total lack of sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cross et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these examples imply significant evolution of cell cycle regulatory proteins in fungi and/or animals while the network topology remains largely intact. Although identification of network topology is restricted to a few model organisms and is not as broad as sequence analysis, the similar network topology in budding yeast and animals suggests that this feature is more conserved than the constituent regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doonan and Kitsios, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The shared presence of E2F-pRb within plants (Archaeaplastida) and animal (Metazoa) lineages would suggest that this regulatory complex, rather than the fungal SBF-Whi5 complex, was present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doonan and Kitsios, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Harashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hallmann, 2009</xref>). The sequence divergence between G1 regulators is surprising because fungi and animals are more closely related to one another than either is to plants. This fungal-metazoan difference raises the question as to where the fungal components came from. Fungal components could either be rapidly evolved ancestral regulators or have a distinct evolutionary history, which would suggest convergent evolution of regulatory networks.</p><p>To address this question, we examine conserved and divergent features of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. In contrast to previous work that considered a protein family of cell cycle regulators in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eme et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gunbin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), we studied the evolutionary history of an entire regulatory network across hundreds of species. We examined a greater number of genomes covering most of eukaryotic diversity, including Excavata, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, SAR (Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria), Archaeplastida (plants), Amoebozoa, Apusozoa and the Opisthokonta (animals and fungi). This survey allowed us to estimate the cell cycle repertoire of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), a prerequisite to clarifying the evolutionary transitions of the cell cycle components of both animals and fungi.</p><p>Our results indicate that LECA likely had complex cell cycle regulation involving at least one Cdk, multiple cyclin families, activating and inhibitory E2F transcription factors, and pRb-family pocket proteins. Identifying the LECA repertoire helps establish that the emergence of SBF-Whi5 is abrupt and distinguishes fungi from all other eukaryotes. We show that basal fungi can have both ancestral E2F-pRb and fungal SBF-Whi5 components. Thus, fungal evolution appears to have proceeded through a hybrid network before abruptly losing the ancestral components in the lineage leading to Dikarya. This supports the hypothesis that network structure, rather than the individual components, has been conserved through the transition to fungi and argues against the case of convergent evolution.</p><p>Our data confirm that SBF shows homology to KilA-N, a poorly characterized domain present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses. Thus, SBF is not derived from E2F (its functional analog) and likely emerged through horizontal gene transfer in the fungal ancestor. We show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast. We then use high-throughput in vitro binding assay data to elucidate the shared nucleotide preferences of E2F and SBF for DNA binding. These data suggest that a viral SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control, activating transcription via the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstruction of complex cell cycle control in the ancestral eukaryote</title><p>Recent work shows that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) already had a complex repertoire of protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dacks and Field, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, all sequenced eukaryotic lineages have lost entire gene families that were present in LECA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast to the growing consensus that LECA had an extensive repertoire of proteins, the prevailing view of the cell cycle in LECA is that it was based on a simple oscillator constructed with relatively few components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nasmyth, 1995</xref>). According to the ‘simple’ LECA cell cycle model, an ancestral oscillation in Cyclin B-Cdk1 activity drove periodic DNA replication and DNA segregation, while other aspects of cell cycle regulation, such as G1 control, may have subsequently evolved in specific lineages. The model was motivated by the fact that Cdk activity of a single Cyclin B is sufficient to drive embryonic cell cycles in frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murray and Kirschner, 1989</xref>) and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stern and Nurse, 1996</xref>), and that many yeast G1 regulators have no eukaryotic orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To determine the complexity of LECA cell cycle regulation, we examined hundreds of diverse eukaryotic genomes. We first built sensitive profile Hidden Markov Models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eddy, 2011</xref>) for each of the gene families of cell cycle regulators from model organisms <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> These HMMs were then used to query the sequenced eukaryotic genomes for homologs of both fungal and animal cell cycle regulators (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for a complete list of regulatory families in each genome). Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the detected homologs for accurate sub-family assignment of the regulators and inference of their evolutionary history (see Materials and methods). If LECA regulation were simple, we would expect little conservation beyond the Cyclin B-Cdk1 mitotic regulatory module. However, if LECA regulation were more complex, we would expect to see broad conservation of a wider variety of regulators.</p><p>While we did not find either of the fungal regulators (SBF and Whi5) outside of Fungi, we did find animal-like cell cycle regulators in Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, SAR, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Excavata and Metazoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, the cyclin sub-families (A, B, D, and E) known to regulate the cell cycle in metazoans (for cyclin phylogeny see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) are found across the major branches of eukaryotes. We also found examples of all three sub-families of E2F transcription factors (E2F1-6, DP, E2F7/8) and the pRb family of pocket proteins (for E2F/DP and pRb phylogeny see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Nearly all species contain the APC specificity subunits Cdc20 and Cdh1/Fzr1, which regulate exit from mitosis and maintain low Cdk activity in G1 (for Cdc20-family APC phylogeny see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that LECA cell cycle regulation was based on multiple cyclin families, as well as regulation by the APC complex and members of the pRb and E2F families. More broadly, our phylogenetic analyses tend to place the fungal regulators as sister groups to the metazoan regulators, as would be expected from the known eukaryotic species tree. These phylogenies are in agreement with the hypothesis that many fungal and metazoan regulators were vertically inherited from an opisthokont ancestor rather than loss of these regulators in fungi followed by secondary acquisition through horizontal gene transfer.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Animal and plant G1/S regulatory network components were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</title><p>Distribution of cell cycle regulators across the eukaryotic species tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adl et al., 2012</xref>).

We were unable to find any eukaryotic homologs of SBF or Whi5 outside of fungi, with a few exceptions related to DNA viruses that we discuss later. SBF is an important member of a larger family of winged helix-turn-helix transcription factors that includes Xbp1, Bqt4, and the APSES family (<underline>A</underline>cm1, <underline>P</underline>hd1, <underline>S</underline>ok2, <underline>E</underline>gf1, <underline>S</underline>tuA); see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for a complete list of homologs in each fungal genome. The emergence of the new fungal regulators SBF, which includes the large APSES family, and Whi5 is abrupt and occurs near the split of basal fungi from metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The precise location remains unclear because we have only 1 Nuclearid genome (<italic>Fonticula alba</italic>) and because Microsporidia are fast-evolving fungal parasites with reduced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cuomo et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the new regulators (SBF and Whi5) and ancestral regulators (E2F and Rb) co-exist broadly across basal fungi and the lineages formerly known as 'zygomycetes' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Zoosporic, basal fungi such as Chytrids (<italic>e.g., Spizellomyces punctatus</italic>) can have both fungal and animal cell cycle regulators, which likely represents the ancestral fungal hybrid network. SBF-Whi5 in budding yeast plays a similar role to E2F-pRb in animals, which suggests that these pathways were functionally redundant in an ancestral hybrid network. This redundancy would lead to the evolutionary instability of the hybrid network and could explain why different constellations of components are present in the extant zygomycetes and basal fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the zygomycetes have lost pRb while retaining E2F, which was then abruptly lost in the transition to Dikarya. However, with the possible exception of Microsporidia, all fungi have retained SBF and never completely reverted back to the original ancestral state.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fungal ancestor evolved novel G1/S regulators, which eventually replaced ancestral cyclins, transcription factors, and inhibitors in Dikarya.</title><p>Basal fungi and 'Zygomycota' contain hybrid networks comprised of both ancestral and fungal specific cell cycle regulators.

To this end, we scrutinized the highly conserved E2F and SBF DNA-binding domains to detect any sequence and structural homology. We used the Pfam HMMER model of the E2F/DP DNA-binding domain and SBF+APSES DNA-binding domain (KilA-N.hmm), which is homologous to the KilA-N domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iyer et al., 2002</xref>). Our rationale for using KilA-N.hmm from Pfam for remote homology detection of SBF+APSES stems from the fact that it was trained on a diverse set of KilA DNA-binding domains across bacterial DNA viruses, eukaryotic DNA viruses, and fungal SBF+APSES proteins. Thus, it should be a more sensitive HMM model to detect remote KilA-N homologues in other eukaryotic genomes. Our controls (<italic>H. sapiens</italic> genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) demonstrate that E2F_TDP.hmm is specific to E2F/DP and that KilA-N.hmm is specific to SBF+APSES. We show that genomes with hybrid network (<italic>S. punctatus</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and other basal fungi with both transcription factors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) have both E2F/DP and SBF+APSES. E2F_TDP.hmm never hits an SBF+APSES transcription factor and KilA-N.hmm never hits an E2F transcription factor (i.e. there are no scores on the diagonal of the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, there is no misclassification by the Pfam HMM models. These data suggest that SBF and other KilA-N domains have no more sequence identity to E2F than non-homologous proteins. We find that non-fungal genomes only hit E2F/DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) with the notable exception of <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, the only non-fungal genome with E2F/DP and KilA-N homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The DNA-binding domains of SBF/MBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al., 1997</xref>) and E2F/DP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>) are structurally classified as members of the winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) family, which is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aravind et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gajiwala and Burley, 2000</xref>). Although the DNA-binding domains of E2F/DP and SBF/MBF are both classified as wHTH proteins, they show important differences in overall structure and mode of protein-DNA complex formation that lead us to conclude that it is highly unlikely that they are orthologs.</p><p>Many wHTH transcription factors, including the E2F/DP family, have a ‘recognition helix’ that interacts with the major or minor grooves of the DNA. The E2F/DP family has an RRXYD DNA-recognition motif in its helix that is invariant within the E2F/DP family and is responsible for interacting with the conserved, core GCGC motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: red structure). The RRXYD recognition motif is strikingly conserved in E2F/DP across all eukaryotes, including the E2F/DP proteins uncovered in basal fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left). The first solved SBF/MBF crystal structure, Mbp1 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the absence of DNA, originally suggested that Mbp1 recognizes its MCB (Mlu I cell cycle box, ACGCGT) binding site via a recognition helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). However, a recent crystal structure of PCG2, an SBF/MBF homolog in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, in complex with its MCB binding site does not support this proposed mode of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In striking contrast to many wHTH structures, in which the recognition helix is the mediator of DNA binding specificity, the wing of PCG2 binds to the minor groove to recognize the MCB binding site. The two glutamines in the wing (Q82, Q89) are the key elements that recognize the core MCB binding motif CGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, blue structure). Family-specific conservation in the DNA-binding domain is observed for all members of the SBF family, including basal fungal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). In summary, the incongruences in sequence, structure, and mode of DNA-interaction between E2F/DP and SBF/MBF families strongly suggest that SBF is not derived from E2F.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>E2F and SBF show incongruences in sequence, structure, and mode of DNA binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Although both proteins share a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain, the E2F/DP and SBF/MBF superfamilies do not exhibit significant sequence identity or structural similarity to suggest a common recent evolutionary origin according to CATH or SCOP databases. Furthermore, each wHTH has a different mechanism of interaction with DNA: the arginine and tyrosine side-chains of recognition helix-3 of E2F (E2F4 from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>]) interact with specific CG nucleotides, where as the glutamine side-chains of the 'wing' of SBF/MBF (PCG2 from <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2015</xref>]) interact with specific CG nucleotides.

Previous work has shown that the DNA-binding domain of the APSES and SBF proteins is homologous to a viral KilA-N domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iyer et al., 2002</xref>). KilA-N is a member of a core set of 'viral hallmark genes' found across diverse DNA viruses that infect eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koonin et al., 2006</xref>). Outside the fungal SBF/APSES sub-family, little is known about the KilA-N domain structure, its DNA-binding recognition sequence, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brick et al., 1998</xref>). The wide distribution of DNA viruses and KilA-N across the three domains of life suggests that the fungal ancestor likely acquired SBF via horizontal gene transfer rather than the other way around.</p><p>To broaden the scope of analysis beyond the eukaryotic genomes that we studied, we carefully surveyed all KilA-N domains present in the Pfam database. The majority of known KilA-N domains (weighted by species, not the number of sequences) are found in prokaryotes (85%) with a smaller fraction (10%) found in eukaryotes and a smaller fraction found in DNA viruses (5%). The KilA-N domains in prokaryotes appear to be either integrated by or derived from prokaryotic DNA viruses (i.e. bacteriophage), and thus, we will treat them as such. Within the eukaryotes, all known KilA-N domains are found in fungal genomes with three notable exceptions.</p><p>The first exception is <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, a parasitic excavate with 1000+ KilA-N domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> KilA-N domains have top blast hits to prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, e.g. Mimivirus, a large double-stranded DNA virus of the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yutin et al., 2009</xref>). Mimiviruses are giant viruses known to infect simple eukaryotic hosts, such as <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and possibly other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahão et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raoult and Forterre, 2008</xref>). The second and third exceptions are found in two insects, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> ('pea aphid') and <italic>Rhodius prolixus</italic> ('triatomid bug'). The one KilA-N domain in <italic>A. pisum</italic> genome has a top blast hit to eukaryotic DNA viruses (e.g. Invertebrate Iridescent Virus 6). The three KilA-N domains in <italic>R. prolixus</italic> have top blast hits to prokaryotic DNA viruses (e.g. Enterobacteria phage P1). The diverse and sparse distribution of KilA-N domains throughout the eukaryotic genomes is consistent with their horizontal gene transfer into hosts from eukaryotic DNA viruses and/or via engulfed bacteria that were infected with prokaryotic DNA viruses. In fact, the horizontal transfer of genes between Mimivirus and their eukaryotic host, or the prokaryotic parasites within the host, has been shown to be a more frequent event that previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moreira and Brochier-Armanet, 2008</xref>)</p><p>To gain further insight into the possible evolutionary origins of the SBF subfamily via horizontal gene transfer, we aligned diverse KilA-N sequences from the Uniprot and PFAM database to the KilA-N domain of our most basal fungal SBF+APSES sequences (Zoosporic fungi ('Chytrids') and 'Zygomycetes') and built a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There are three major phylogenetic lineages of KilA-N domains: those found in eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses, and the fungal SBF+APSES family. Our results show that the fungal SBF+APSES family is monophyletic and is strongly supported by multiple phylogenetic support metrics. This suggests a single HGT event as the most likely scenario that established the SBF+APSES family in a fungal ancestor. However, our current phylogeny is unable to distinguish whether the SBF family arrived in a fungal ancestor through a eukaryotic virus or a phage-infected bacterium. Structural and functional characterization of existing viral KilA-N domains could help distinguish between these two hypotheses.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.026</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Viral origin of yeast cell cycle transcription factor SBF.</title><p>Maximum likelihood unrooted phylogenetic tree depicting relationships of fungal SBF-family proteins, KilA-N domains in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses.

The overlap between the conserved E2F and SBF consensus sites suggests that ancestral SBF could bind E2F regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, a single base pair substitution in the SBF motif can reduce gene expression by up to ~95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews and Moore, 1992</xref>) and flanking regions outside the core are often important for binding affinity and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nutiu et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, no one has directly measured the extent to which animal E2F and yeast SBF bind similar sites either in vivo or in vitro. To first test whether yeast SBF can bind a canonical E2F binding site, we inserted consensus E2F binding sites in the budding yeast genome. The hijacking hypothesis would be supported in vivo if E2F binding sites could generate SBF-dependent cell cycle regulated gene expression. We used the well-studied <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter, which has three binding sites for SBF (SCB, Swi4,6-dependent cell cycle box) in a nucleosome-depleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-C</xref>). Removal of these SCB sites is known to eliminate cell cycle-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bai et al., 2010</xref>). We replaced the complete SBF sites (TCACGAAA) of <italic>CLN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koch et al., 1996</xref>) with a known E2F binding site (GCGCGAAA) from the promoters of the histone gene cluster in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabinovich et al., 2008</xref>). We observed significant oscillations in GFP expression, which were coordinated with the cell cycle. Importantly, the amplitude of these oscillations was dependent on the budding yeast SBF (Swi4), but not MBF (Mbp1), and disappeared when the 3 binding sites were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that budding yeast SBF can bind E2F-like sites, despite the fact that Dikarya lost ancestral E2F hundreds of millions of years ago.</p><p>There are, of course, other possible E2F DNA binding sites that we could have used in our experiment; we picked this one because it is a well-characterized E2F binding site. To further explore the overlap in sequence specificity, we analyzed data from high-throughput protein-binding microarray (PBM) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Badis et al., 2008</xref>) of human E2F (E2F1) and budding yeast SBF (Swi4). PBM assays measure, in a single experiment, the binding of recombinant proteins to tens of thousands of synthetic DNA sequences, guaranteed to cover all possible 10-bp DNA sequences in a maximally compact representation (each 10-mer occurs once and only once). We used these PBM data to generate DNA motifs for E2F and SBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berger et al., 2006</xref>), and to compute, for each possible 8-bp DNA sequence, an enrichment score (or E-score) that reflects the specificity of the protein for that 8-mer. E-scores vary between -0.5 and +0.5, with larger values corresponding to higher affinity binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berger et al., 2006</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, E2F1 and Swi4 can bind a set of common motifs.

The consensus E2F-only (NN<underline>SG</underline>CGSN) and SBF-only (NN<underline>CR</underline>CGNN) motifs indicate that differential specificity between E2F1 and SBF is mediated by the nucleotides in the 3rd and 4th positions (underlined) before the invariant CG at the 5th and 6th positions.

We then extended our analysis to 290 known E2F target genes in the human genome to test the generality of SBF cross-binding to E2F sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eser et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, one expects strong conservation in the regulatory network controlling the eukaryotic cell division cycle. Consistent with this idea, cell cycle network structure is highly similar in budding yeast and animal cells. However, many components performing similar functions, such as the SBF and E2F transcription factors, lack sequence identity, suggesting a significant degree of evolution or independent origin. To identify axes of conservation and evolution in eukaryotic cell cycle regulation, we examined a large number of genome sequences in Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, SAR, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Excavata, Metazoa and Fungi. Across eukaryotes, we found a large number of proteins homologous to metazoan rather than fungal G1/S regulators. Our analysis indicates that the last eukaryotic common ancestor likely had complex cell cycle regulation based on Cdk1, Cyclins D, E, A and B, E2F, pRb and APC family proteins.</p><p>In contrast, SBF was not present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, and abruptly emerged, with its regulator Whi5, in fungi likely due to the co-option of a viral KilA-N protein at the base of the fungal lineage. The origin of Whi5 is unclear because we found no homologs outside of fungi. Whi5 is a mostly unstructured protein, which, like pRb, recruits transcriptional inhibitor proteins to specific sites on DNA via transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Travesa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). The relatively simple structure of Whi5 suggests that it may have been subsequently co-opted as a phosphopeptide to entrain SBF activity to cell cycle regulated changes in Cdk activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Punctuated evolution of a conserved regulatory network.</title><p>Evolution can replace components in an essential pathway by proceeding through a hybrid intermediate. Once established, the hybrid network can evolve dramatically and lose previously essential regulators, while sometimes retaining the original network topology. We hypothesize that SBF may have hijacked the cell cycle of a fungal ancestor by binding cis-regulatory DNA sites of E2F and activating expression of G1/S genes, thus promoting cell cycle entry. Cell cycle hijacking in a fungal ancestor was followed by evolution of Whi5 to inhibit SBF and Whi5 was subsequently entrained to upstream cell cycle control through phospho-regulation by old or new cyclin-CDKs to create a hybrid network with parallel pathways. The hybrid network likely provided redundant control of the G1/S regulatory network, which could explain the eventual loss of E2F and its replacement by the SBF pathway in more derived fungi (Dikarya). Interestingly, zoosporic fungi such as Chytrids have hybrid networks and are transitional species because they exhibit animal-like features of the opisthokont ancestor (centrioles, flagella) and fungal-like features (cell wall, hyphal growth). We hypothesize that E2F and SBF also bind and regulate a subset of animal-specific and fungal-specific G1/S genes, which could help explain the preservation of the hybrid network in Chytrids. Ancestral SBF expanded to create an entire family of transcription factors (APSES) that regulate fungal-specific traits such as sporulation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and virulence.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09492.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09492.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-09492-fig9-v1"/></fig></p><p>The replacement of E2F-Rb with SBF-Whi5 at the core of the cell cycle along the fungal lineage raises the question as to how such a drastic change to fundamental regulatory network could evolve. One answer can be found in the evolution of transcription factors. When the function of an essential transcription factor does change, it often leaves behind a core part of its regulon for another factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gasch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lavoie et al., 2009</xref>). This process of handing off transcription factor function has been observed to proceed through an intermediate state, present in some extant genomes, in which both factors perform the function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>). The logic of proceeding through an intermediate state has been well-documented for the regulation of genes expressed only in yeast of mating type <bold>a</bold> (asgs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>). In the ancestral yeast and many extant species, asgs expression is activated by a protein only present in <bold>a</bold> cells, while in other yeasts, expression is repressed by a protein only present in α cells and <bold>a</bold>/α diploids. The replacement of the ancestral positive regulation by negative regulation occurred via yeast that contained both systems illustrating how an essential function can evolve through a hybrid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, something similar happened during cell cycle evolution. It appears that the replacement of the E2F-pRb transcription regulatory complex with the SBF-Whi5 complex proceeded via a hybrid intermediate that preserved its function. In the hybrid intermediate, E2F-Rb and SBF-Whi5 may have evolved to be parallel pathways whose functions overlapped to such an extent that the previously essential E2F-Rb pathway could be lost in the transition to Dikarya. Interestingly, many basal fungi (e.g. Chytrids) have preserved rather than lost this hybrid intermediate, which suggests that each pathway may have specialized functions. Chytrids exhibit both animal (e.g. centrioles, flagella, amoeboid movement) and fungal features (e.g. cell wall, hyphal growth) whose synthesis needs to be coordinated with cell division. The preservation of the hybrid network in chytrids could then be explained if animal-like and fungal features are regulated by the E2F-Rb and SBF-Whi5 pathways respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Once Fungi lost many of the ancestral animal-like features during the emergence of the 'zygomycetes' or Dikarya, the ancestral E2F-pRb components could have evolved new functions or have been lost.</p><p>The origin of the hybrid network at the base of Fungi is abrupt and may have been initiated by the arrival of SBF via virus. Many tumor viruses activate cell proliferation. For example, the DNA tumor viruses Adenovirus and SV40 highjack cell proliferation in part by activating the expression of E2F-dependent genes by binding pRb to disrupt inhibition of E2F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DeCaprio, 2009</xref>). While the specific mechanisms may differ, when SBF entered the fungal ancestor cell it might have activated the transcription of E2F target genes. Rather than inhibiting the inhibitor of E2F, SBF may have directly competed for E2F binding sites with transcriptionally inactive E2F-Rb complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Consistent with this model, we have shown here that SBF can directly regulate gene expression in budding yeast via a consensus E2F binding site. Thus, the cooption of a viral protein generated a hybrid network to ultimately facilitate dramatic evolution of the core cell cycle network in fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification of potential protein family homologs</title><p>We used Profile-Hidden Markov Models (profile-HMMs) to detect homologs for each of the families studied, using the HMMER 3 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eddy, 2011</xref>).

We used the PBM 8-mer E-scores reported in cis-BP for the data set M0093_1.02:Badis08:SWI4_4482.1_ArrayB. Universal PBM data for E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afek et al., 2014</xref>) is available in the GEO database (accession number GSE61854, probes UnivV9_*). E2F1 8-mer E-scores were computed using the Universal Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) Analysis Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berger and Bulyk, 2009</xref>). An E-score cutoff of 0.37 was used to call SBF and E2F binding sites. This cutoff corresponds to a false positive discovery rate of 0.001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Badis et al., 2009</xref>). To generate DNA motifs for E2F-only, SBF-only, and common sites, we used the Priority software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gordân et al., 2010</xref>) with a uniform prior to align the 8-mers with E-score &gt; 0.37 for E2F only, SBF only, or both E2F and SBF, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Promoter sequences (1000 bp upstream of transcription start) for known E2F targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eser et al., 2011</xref>) were retrieved from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome as provided by UCSC (hg38) (BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38) and the annotation package org.Hs.eg.db from Bioconductor (v3.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gentleman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Huber et al., 2015</xref>). Only regions for which at least two consecutive sliding windows of 8-mers (1 nucleotide step; 7 overlapping nucleotides) were high scoring (E-score ≥ 0.37) were called as potential SBF or E2F binding regions. Overlapping or 'common' binding regions between E2F and SBF were defined as regions that, regardless of their difference in length (nested or partially overlapping), overlapped in at least one full 8-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank F Cross and A Robinson-Mosher for extensive discussions, and J Heitman, D Lew, J Nevins, S Rubin for critical comments on the manuscript.

Your submission has been evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper addresses the evolution of cell cycle specific transcription factors and cyclins in fungi. All of us feel that the cyclin part was less interesting, more speculative, and poorly motivated. Your story about evolution of SBF-like transcription factors is the more interesting aspect. Unfortunately, the key discovery discussed in the paper, namely the origin of SBF from DNA viruses was reported long ago by Koonin and this aspect of the paper is therefore not entirely novel. More interesting is the finding that basal fungi appear to have both SBF and E2F/Rb like factors, confirming that E2F/Rb must have been replaced by SBF early on in the fungal lineage. In a way, one already knew that this must be case since the E2F system is present in plants as well as animals, implying that it must have been present in the common ancestor of fungi and animals, which are closer to each other than plants. We already knew therefore that E2F must therefore have been lost early in the fungal lineage. However, placing when this took place is certainly interesting and an important advance in our understanding.</p><p>All of us were unimpressed by the experiment that E2F site from a histone promoter in mammals can replace the SBF sites in the CLN2 promoter. Results are also consistent with the obvious alternative hypothesis that SBF and E2Fs are distant homologues and the binding specificity has simply been conserved during evolution. We don't see how any experiment along these lines could be said to support the hijacking hypothesis (to the exclusion of the obvious competing hypothesis). Furthermore, even if SBF and E2F are non-homologous, they have overlapping binding specificity. Since sequence specific transcription factors allow degeneracy (or wobble positions) and bind to short DNA sequence families (motifs), these experiments show only that the E2F sites that were chosen probably overlap the specificity of SBF enough that they can be regulated. Therefore, these experiments really add nothing to the hijacking model, except to confirm the observation that the two transcription factors have overlapping specificity.</p><p>Overall, the paper has one really key novel observation, namely the detection of the E2F/Rb system in basal fungi and this is certainly worth publishing. However, you need to show that there really are both classes of proteins in the basal fungi. You need to consider and rule out alternative explanations. For example, are you simply assigning some of the homologues in the basal fungi to be E2Fs and some to be SBF/MBFs because they have reached the limit of homology detections?</p><p>The problem is that this key finding has been wrapped up in a paper that merely repeats Koonin's findings and addresses the evolution of fungal cyclins in a manner that is not particularly revealing. We would recommend a far shorter paper focusing on the one key finding.</p><p>Other Major Comments:</p><p>Note some of these points may not be relevant when you shorten this article. Nonetheless, these comments may help if you decide to wrap up the remaining content for another journal:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>With regard to your models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, have you thought about alternative hypotheses? For example, CLN sets the stage for the acquisition of SBF. What evidences do you have to rule alternatives out?</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are critical to the authors' argument, but the data are very poorly presented. The whole argument rests on the accurate detection of homologues for both types of regulators in the basal fungi. The authors need to take much more care to convince the reader that the observations are not simply due to errors in the homology detection (due for example to longer branches or denser sampling of species in the fungi).</p><p>For example, they need to show convincing evidence that the diversity of the SBF/MBFs falls outside of the diversity of the E2Fs, and that the viral proteins fall within the SBFs and outside of the E2Fs. Figure 6a shows a phylogeny of SBFs, but it doesn't include the E2Fs.</p><p>Even more important, they need to show that there really are both classes of proteins in the basal fungi. They need to consider and rule out alternative explanations. For example, are they simply assigning some of the homologues in the basal fungi to be E2Fs and some to be SBF/MBFs because they have reached the limit of homology detections?</p><p>2) The structural evidence could represent key supporting data to show that E2Fs and SBFs really are two different families. However, is not presented in a very convincing way.</p><p>&quot;it is possible that fungal SBF is a duplicated and hyper-evolved E2F. However, the number and topology of secondary elements (i.e., α helices, β strands, and loops) that stabilize and pack around the core helix-turn-helix are different.&quot;</p><p>Does the number and topology of secondary structural elements always stay the same in homologues? If not, how does this support the hypothesis that they are non-homologous?</p><p>&quot;Crystal structures of the DNA binding domains of E2F and SBF show that they are not structural homologues (Taylor et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Here the authors just state that E2F and SBF are not structural homologues. What is it about the structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that shows that they are not homologues?</p><p>3) Even if the structural evidence is sound, and the proteins are non-homologous, the authors specific argument rests on the identification of <italic>both</italic> proteins in the basal fungi. The authors should show and explain the evidence that the putative homologues in the basal fungi are likely to adopt one structure and not the other. The alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows many irrelevant species, and the homologues from the basal fungi are not highlighted.</p><p>I think the authors need to consider their evolutionary model much more carefully and design experiments that actually test it.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Punctuated evolution and transitional hybrid network in an ancestral cell cycle of fungi&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please advise as to your course of action as soon as possible.</p><p>I encourage you to shorten this further (as per multiple reviewers' request).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors did a good job of clarifying the structural data and present a much more convincing case that the two proteins are non-homologous.</p><p>However, they did very little to address my other concerns.</p><p>Rather than doing a detailed, focused analysis to convince the reader of their hypothesis that the basal fungi contain both transcription factors, and that the SBFs are inherited from a single horizontal transfer event, they simply bolded the basal fungi species names in an alignment. They did not show any phylogenetic analysis that would rule out competing evolutionary scenarios (such as recent transfer of the E2Fs into the basal fungi) or technical issues (such as homology detection problems). In response to my comments about the latter, they simply stated that their HMMs don't make any classification errors:</p><p>&quot;Our profile-HMM for E2F/DP family only detects E2F or DP, where as our profile-HMM for SBF/MBF family only detects SBF/MBF (or APSES).&quot;</p><p>In fact, I agree with the authors that the HMMs are probably very accurate, but why not show data to support this claim? (E.g., the score distributions or phylogenetic trees?)</p><p>The authors don't seem to appreciate (or have chosen to ignore) the fact that remote homology detection (especially the claim that homologs are <italic>not</italic> present) is a statistical process and always has an element of uncertainty. (For example, there might be additional diverged SBF homologues in other eukaryotes that are below the E-value threshold, missed due to gene prediction errors, incomplete genome sequences, etc.) Since the detection of these homologs in the basal fungi and no SBFs in other eukaryotes is the key result of this paper, why not make a convincing case to support it (instead of the unnecessary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>)?</p><p>Similarly, they have not changed the presentation of the experiment demonstrating that the SBF can bind to an E2F binding site. In their response, they claim that this experiment is important because &quot;a single base pair substitution in the SBF motif can reduce gene expression&quot;. However, they have still not showed <italic>which</italic> substitution that was. Therefore the argument is misleading: all substitutions in transcription factor binding sites are not equivalent, and this experiment would only be interesting if the substitution between the histone binding sites and the SBF consensus was one of those that was likely to reduce expression. If it is, why not show this and explain it clearly?</p><p>Furthermore, since E2Fs regulate many cell cycle target genes, it would be much more convincing if the authors simply surveyed the known E2F binding sites and estimated (bioinformatically) which of them SBF is likely to regulate. The observation that SBF can bind the histone binding site (on its own) really adds nothing.</p><p>I think the most important thing for the authors to add is a phylogenetic analysis showing that the data support the hypothesis of a single transfer event in the ancestral fungi.</p><p>As a secondary point, I guess if they really want to include the histone binding site experiment, they should include it in the context of a survey of other known E2F and SBF binding sites, and consider to what extent SBF could have taken over the sites. (More interesting would be to look at the binding sites in the extant species that are predicted to have both TFs and see if there's any evidence for both of them working. However, I understand that we're not supposed to suggest additional analyses at this stage.)</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>A primary concern of the previous round of review was the distinction between E2F and SBF/MBF homologs in basal fungi. The new figure showing the alignment with strong conservation within each family is convincing to me that the distinction drawn is not caused by a limit in homology detection. Adding E2F family proteins to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to illustrate the degree of divergence may be helpful, but I don't believe it is necessary given the statement that the HMMs never identified overlapping proteins or mis-identified known exemplars.</p><p>Overall, this work extends the earlier hypothesis that fungal SBF was transferred from viruses, by narrowing down the phylogenetic context of that transfer and identifying extant species with both SBF and E2F homologs. Much work must be done to characterize the degree to which those species truly have a &quot;hybrid&quot; network, but the present work lays an intriguing foundation. To me, the alternative hypothesis of rapid divergence between the SBF and E2F families is less parsimonious than horizontal transfer of SBF, although it is possible.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Punctuated evolution and transitional hybrid network in an ancestral cell cycle of fungi&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript needs minor revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reduce the number of figures and make them less busy and higher quality (visible). Is each figure really essential? Can it be treated as a supplement to the primary figure (see how this is done for other papers we publish)? People are much less likely to read a paper with many busy figures.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have greatly improved the paper, and have addressed my concerns about technical issues related to the homology detection, as well as included phylogenetic analysis that shows the fungal proteins to be monophyletic, consistent with their model of a single transfer event. They have also added a reasonable bioinformatics analysis that shows the overlap in specificity between SBF and E2F.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall, this work extends the existing viral-origin hypothesis for SBF, primarily by identifying species carrying both SBF and E2F. The additional analyses in this round of review further support this hypothesis. The authors more detailed analysis of HMM performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) gives more confidence in the bioinformatics, and the new phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) makes the evolutionary hypothesis more specific. The new analysis potential binding of SBF to known human E2F binding sites also suggests that hijacking may have been possible (Figure 10), although it does not tell us much about what hijacked hybrid networks would look like.</p><p>At this point, I have no substantive concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09492.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript.</p><p>We have modified the main text to address reviewer comments and we expanded details of data analysis in Methods.

However, placing when this took place is certainly interesting and an important advance in our understanding.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing the significance of our manuscript (&quot;Punctuated evolution and transitional hybrid network in an ancestral cell cycle of fungi&quot;).</p><p>The Whi5-SBF pathway in yeast was only recently established as functionally analogous to the Rb-E2F pathway in mammals (Costanzo et al., 2004; de Bruin et al., 2004). These authors were careful to classify Whi5-SBF as &quot;functional analogues&quot; rather than homologs because Whi5-SBF lacked sequence identity to Rb-E2F. However, neither these authors nor the cell cycle community made the connection between viral KilA-N domains, SBF, hybrid networks, and early fungal evolution -- despite the fact that Koonin and colleagues had already published on the viral origins of APSES (Iyer et al., 2002).</p><p>Our manuscript is respectful of the existing literature. We cite multiple papers that already noted that Rb-E2F is likely ancestral because it is found in both plants and animals (Cao et al., 2010; Cross et al., 2011; Doonan and Kitsios, 2009; Fang et al., 2006; Harashima et al., 2013). However, none of these papers addressed the evolution of SBF versus E2F in the fungal lineage or established the example of cell cycle rewiring via a hybrid network. To this end, we think that our manuscript will be of great interest to the broader community that reads <italic>eLife</italic> (cell cycle, fungal cell biology, virology, and evolution).</p><p> <italic>All of us were unimpressed by the experiment that E2F site from a histone promoter in mammals can replace the SBF sites in the CLN2 promoter. Results are also consistent with the obvious alternative hypothesis that SBF and E2Fs are distant homologues and the binding specificity has simply been conserved during evolution. We don't see how any experiment along these lines could be said to support the hijacking hypothesis (to the exclusion of the obvious competing hypothesis).</italic></p><p>We have rewritten our experimental section to better clarify the purpose of our experiments in budding yeast. By the time we motivate our experiments in subsection “SBF ancestor could regulate E2F-target genes”, we already established that SBF is not a distant homolog of E2F (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and that SBF (with homology to viral KilA-N domain) was derived by HGT (we cite work by Koonin &amp; colleagues and our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the obvious alternative hypothesis that SBF and E2F are distant homologs, and that binding specificity has been conserved during evolution is highly unlikely.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, even if SBF and E2F are non-homologous, they have overlapping binding specificity. Since sequence specific transcription factors allow degeneracy (or wobble positions) and bind to short DNA sequence families (motifs), these experiments show only that the E2F sites that were chosen probably overlap the specificity of SBF enough that they can be regulated. Therefore, these experiments really add nothing to the hijacking model, except to confirm the observation that the two transcription factors have overlapping specificity.</italic></p><p>Briefly, the point of these experiments was to determine whether budding yeast SBF (a molecular &quot;descendent&quot; of the ancestral, viral-derived SBF) is able to recognize and bind a canonical E2F site. We clearly state that the known consensus motifs of SBF from budding yeast and E2F from animals have overlapping binding specificity, which is the observation that originally prompted our hijacking hypothesis. However, given that a single base pair difference can abrogate DNA binding, it was not obvious to us a priori whether yeast SBF would be able to bind a canonical E2F site. To our knowledge, no one has measured SBF binding to an E2F site. Hence, we felt obligated to test SBF binding to an E2F consensus site in vivo.</p><p> <italic>Overall, the paper has one really key novel observation, namely the detection of the E2F/Rb system in basal fungi and this is certainly worth publishing. However, you need to show that there really are both classes of proteins in the basal fungi. You need to consider and rule out alternative explanations. For example, are you simply assigning some of the homologues in the basal fungi to be E2Fs and some to be SBF/MBFs because they have reached the limit of homology detections?</italic></p><p>We used Profile-Hidden Markov Models (profile-HMMs) to detect homologs for each of the families studied, using the HMMER 3 package (Eddy, 2011). Profile-HMMs are some of the most accurate and sensitive methods for detection of remote homologs (Eddy, 2011; Johnson et al., 2010). Starting with a set of diverse yet reliable protein homologs is fundamental for detecting remote protein homology and avoiding “model poisoning” (Johnson et al., 2010). To this end, we used reliable training-set homologs from the cell cycle model organisms <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Homo sapiens, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombeS. pombe</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to build the profile-HMMs used to detect E2F/DP and SBF/MBF homologs. All homologs recovered through profile-HMM search were further validated (or rejected) using an iterative search algorithm (Jackhmmer) against the annotated SwissProt database using the HMMER web server (Finn et al., 2011).</p><p>Our profile-HMM for E2F/DP family only detects E2F or DP, where as our profile-HMM for SBF/MBF family only detects SBF/MBF (or APSES). The same protein was never identified by both profile-HMMs because the sequence profiles and the structure are different; see discussion of E2F and SBF sequence-structure below. In the case of basal fungi, which have both E2F/DP and SBF/MBF, all proteins classified as an E2F/DP are clear homologs of E2F or DP (see alignment in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and all proteins that we classified as SBF/MBF are clear homologs of SBF/MBF (see alignment in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, we have not misclassified E2Fs or SBF/MBFs in basal fungi and we have not reached the limit of homology detection. They are bona fide homologs.</p><p>We now elaborate on our identification of potential protein family homologs in the Methods section.</p><p> <italic>The problem is that this key finding has been wrapped up in a paper that merely repeats Koonin's findings and addresses the evolution of fungal cyclins in a manner that is not particularly revealing. We would recommend a far shorter paper focusing on the one key finding.</italic></p><p>Based on this feedback, we have shortened the manuscript and removed old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Our revised manuscript focuses on the evolution of cell cycle transcription factors and inhibitors (E2F-Rb and SBF-Whi5) and the hybrid network present in early diverging fungi.</p><p>We will publish our specific analysis of fungal cyclin evolution elsewhere.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>With regard to your models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, have you thought about alternative hypotheses?

For example, they need to show convincing evidence that the diversity of the SBF/MBFs falls outside of the diversity of the E2Fs, and that the viral proteins fall within the SBFs and outside of the E2Fs. Figure 6a shows a phylogeny of SBFs, but it doesn't include the E2Fs. Even more important, they need to show that there really are both classes of proteins in the basal fungi. They need to consider and rule out alternative explanations. For example, are they simply assigning some of the homologues in the basal fungi to be E2Fs and some to be SBF/MBFs because they have reached the limit of homology detections?</p><p>As described above in our response to the summary critique, we are confident that we do not have errors in detection of homology in basal fungi.</p><p><italic>2) The structural evidence could represent key supporting data to show that E2Fs and SBFs really are two different families. However, is not presented in a very convincing way. &quot;it is possible that fungal SBF is a duplicated and hyper-evolved E2F. However, the number and topology of secondary elements (i.e., α helices, β strands, and loops) that stabilize and pack around the core helix-turn-helix are different.&quot; Does the number and topology of secondary structural elements always stay the same in homologues? If not, how does this support the hypothesis that they are non-homologous? &quot;Crystal structures of the DNA binding domains of E2F and SBF show that they are not structural homologues (Taylor</italic> et al.<italic>, 1997; Xu</italic> et al.</p><p>, 1997) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).&quot; Here the authors just state that E2F and SBF are not structural homologues. What is it about the structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that shows that they are not homologues?</p><p>In response to the reviewer's questions, we have extended and clarified how the structural evidence supports the hypothesis that E2F/DP and SBF/MBF are two different families. We now write:</p><p>&quot;The DNA-binding domains of SBF/MBF (Taylor et al., 2000; Xu et al., 1997) and E2F/DP (Zheng et al., 1999) are structurally classified as members of the winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) family, which is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Aravind and Koonin, 1999; Aravind et al., 2005; Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). Although the DNA-binding domains of E2F/DP and SBF/MBF are both classified as wHTH proteins, they show important differences in sequence, overall structure, and mode of protein-DNA complex formation that lead us to conclude that it is highly unlikely that they are orthologs.</p><p>The strongest arguments against SBF-E2F orthology are based on structural biology. Many wHTH transcription factors, including the E2F/DP family, have a ‘recognition helix’ that interacts with the major or minor grooves of the DNA. The E2F/DP family has an RRXYD DNA-recognition motif in its helix that is invariant within the E2F/DP family and is responsible for interacting with the conserved, core GCGC motif (Zheng et al., 1999) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: red structure). The RRXYD recognition motif is strikingly conserved in E2F/DP across all eukaryotes, including the E2F/DP proteins uncovered in basal fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). In contrast, the first solved SBF/MBF structure, Mbp1 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the absence of DNA, suggested Mbp1 recognizes its MCB (Mlu I cell cycle box, ACGCGT) binding site via a recognition helix (Taylor et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997). A recent structure of PCG2, an SBF/MBF homolog in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, in complex with its MCB binding site does not support this proposed mode of DNA binding (Liu et al., 2015). In striking contrast to many wHTH structures, in which the recognition helix is the mediator of DNA binding specificity, the wing of PCG2 binds to the minor groove to recognize the MCB binding site. The two glutamines in the wing (Q82, Q89) are the key elements that recognize the core MCB binding motif CGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, blue structure). Family-specific conservation in the DNA-binding domain is observed for all members of the SBF and APSES family, including basal fungal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right). In summary, the incongruences in sequence, structure, and mode of DNA-interaction between E2F/DP and SBF/MBF families strongly suggest that SBF is not derived from E2F.&quot;</p><p>3) Even if the structural evidence is sound, and the proteins are non-homologous, the authors specific argument rests on the identification of both proteins in the basal fungi. The authors should show and explain the evidence that the putative homologues in the basal fungi are likely to adopt one structure and not the other. The alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows many irrelevant species, and the homologues from the basal fungi are not highlighted. I think the authors need to consider their evolutionary model much more carefully and design experiments that actually test it.</p><p>We now highlight the E2F/DP proteins from basal fungi (bold font) in the sequence alignment of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.

We include new data and analysis to address the Reviewer comments. Our new co-author, Dr. Raluca Gordân (Duke), has extensive experience generating and analyzing high-throughput in vitro DNA binding data of eukaryotic transcription factors, e.g. E2F (Afek et al., 2014).

However, they did very little to address my other concerns. Rather than doing a detailed, focused analysis to convince the reader of their hypothesis that the basal fungi contain both transcription factors, and that the SBFs are inherited from a single horizontal transfer event, they simply bolded the basal fungi species names in an alignment. They did not show any phylogenetic analysis that would rule out competing evolutionary scenarios (such as recent transfer of the E2Fs into the basal fungi) or technical issues (such as homology detection problems). In response to my comments about the latter, they simply stated that their HMMs don't make any classification errors: &quot;Our profile-HMM for E2F/DP family only detects E2F or DP, where as our profile-HMM for SBF/MBF family only detects SBF/MBF (or APSES).&quot; In fact, I agree with the authors that the HMMs are probably very accurate, but why not show data to support this claim? (E.g., the score distributions or phylogenetic trees?) The authors don't seem to appreciate (or have chosen to ignore) the fact that remote homology detection (especially the claim that homologs are not present) is a statistical process and always has an element of uncertainty. (For example, there might be additional diverged SBF homologues in other eukaryotes that are below the E-value threshold, missed due to gene prediction errors, incomplete genome sequences, etc.) Since the detection of these homologs in the basal fungi and no SBFs in other eukaryotes is the key result of this paper, why not make a convincing case to support it (instead of the unnecessary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>)?</p><p>We address the Reviewer's key critiques below.</p><p>Critique #1: Convince readers of the hypothesis that the basal fungi contain both transcription factors (E2F and SBF), and convince readers that there have been no errors of remote homology detection or misclassification by HMM models.</p><p>To address our Reviewer's concern with homology detection, we plot the Pfam HMM E-values of E2F_TDP.hmm and KilA-N.hmm (the SBF DNA binding domain from Pfam) of all predicted proteins for any given genome in our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We used KilA-N.hmm for remote homology detection because pSMRC.hmm (our HMM model trained on fungal SBFs to detect SBF; see Figure 5—figure supplement 1) includes two well-conserved fungal ankyrin repeats in addition to the KilA-N DNA binding domain. In contrast, the KilA-N domain from Pfam was trained on a diverse set of KilA DNA-binding domains across bacterial DNA viruses, eukaryotic DNA viruses, and fungal SBF+APSES proteins. Thus, it should be a more sensitive HMM model to detect remote KilA-N homologues in other eukaryotic genomes. All initial hits with E-values between 1e-5 and 1e-10 were further validated (or rejected) using an iterative search algorithm (Jackhmmer) against the annotated SwissProt database using the HMMER web server (Finn et al., 2011). We then inspected these sequences manually for key conserved KilA-N residues.</p><p>Our controls (H. sapiens genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) demonstrate that E2F_TDP.hmm is specific to E2F/DP and that KilA-N.hmm is specific to SBF+APSES. We show that genomes with hybrid network (S. punctatus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, and other basal fungi with both transcription factors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) have both E2F/DP and SBF+APSES. E2F_TDP.hmm never hits an SBF+APSES transcription factor and KilAN. hmm never hits an E2F transcription factor (i.e. there are no scores on the diagonal of the panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, there is no misclassification by the Pfam HMM models. E2F and KilA-N share as much sequence identity with each other as they do with unrelated proteins. The conservation of known sequence-structure relationships in either E2F or SBF (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) reinforces the fact that basal fungi have genuine E2Fs and SBFs.</p><p>Critique #2: Convince readers that SBFs were inherited from a single horizontal gene transfer event.</p><p>Pfam HMM E-values of E2F_TDP.hmm and KilA-N.hmm of our remaining eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) show that we cannot detect SBF+APSES or other KilA-N domains outside of fungi (some initial hits with E-values in between 1e-5 and 1e-10 were subsequently shown to be false positives by an iterative Jackhmmer search on SwissProt database). However, as discussed in our manuscript and shown by Koonin's group (Iyer et al., 2002), fungal SBF DNA-binding domain shows homology to the KilA-N domain from prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses.</p><p>To broaden the scope of analysis beyond our downloaded eukaryotic genomes, we carefully surveyed all KilA-N domains detected by the Pfam database. The majority of known KilA-N domains (weighted by species, not the number of sequences) are found in prokaryotes (85%) with a smaller fraction (10%) found in eukaryotes and a smaller fraction found in DNA viruses (5%). The KilA-N domains in prokaryotes appear to be either integrated by or derived from prokaryotic DNA viruses (i.e. bacteriophage), and thus, we will treat them as such. Within the eukaryotes, all known KilA-N domains are found in fungal genomes with three notable exceptions.</p><p>The first exception is <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, a parasitic excavate with 1000+ KilA-N domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> KilA-N domains have top blast hits to prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, e.g. Mimivirus, a large double-stranded DNA virus of the Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (Yutin et al., 2009). Mimiviruses are giant viruses known to infect simple eukaryotic hosts, such as <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and possibly other eukaryotes (Abrahão et al., 2014; Raoult and Forterre, 2008). The second and third exceptions are found in two insects, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> ('pea aphid') and <italic>Rhodius prolixus</italic> ('triatomid bug'). The one KilA-N domain in A. pisum genome has a top blast hit to eukaryotic DNA viruses (e.g. Invertebrate Iridescent Virus 6). The three KilA-N domains in R. prolixus have top blast hits to prokaryotic DNA viruses (e.g. Enterobacteria phage P1). The diverse and sparse distribution of KilA-N domains throughout the eukaryotic genomes is consistent with their horizontal gene transfer into hosts from eukaryotic DNA viruses and/or via engulfed bacteria that were infected with prokaryotic DNA viruses. In fact, the horizontal transfer of genes between Mimivirus and their eukaryotic host, or the prokaryotic parasites within the host, has been shown to be a more frequent event that previously thought (Moreira and Brochier-Armanet, 2008).</p><p>To gain further insight into the possible evolutionary origins of the SBF subfamily via horizontal gene transfer, we aligned diverse KilA-N sequences from the Uniprot and PFAM database to the KilA-N domain of our most basal fungal SBF+APSES sequences (Zoosporic fungi (“chytrids”) and “Zygomycetes”) and built a phylogenetic tree (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). There are three major phylogenetic lineages of KilA-N domains: those found in eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses, and the fungal SBF+APSES family. Our results show that the fungal SBF family is monophyletic and strongly supported by multiple phylogenetic support metrics, which suggests a single HGT event as the most likely scenario that established the SBF+APSES family in a fungal ancestor. However, our current phylogeny is unable to distinguish whether the SBF family arrived in a fungal ancestor through a eukaryotic virus or a phage-infected bacterium. Structural and functional characterization of existing viral KilA-N domains could help distinguish between these two hypotheses.</p><p>Critique #3: Convince the reader that E2Fs were not horizontally transferred into basal fungi.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> is a phylogenetic analysis of all eukaryotic E2Fs. Our phylogenetic tree shows that fungal E2Fs are adjacent to metazoan E2Fs, as expected from the known eukaryotic species tree. This phylogeny is consistent with the hypothesis that fungal and metazoan E2F were vertically inherited from an opisthokont ancestor, rather than fungi losing E2F and having them horizontally transferred from another organism.</p><p>We now include new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and parts of this discussion in the main text.</p><p> <italic>Similarly, they have not changed the presentation of the experiment demonstrating that the SBF can bind to an E2F binding site. In their response, they claim that this experiment is important because &quot;a single base pair substitution in the SBF motif can reduce gene expression&quot;. However, they have still not showed which substitution that was. Therefore the argument is misleading: all substitutions in transcription factor binding sites are not equivalent, and this experiment would only be interesting if the substitution between the histone binding sites and the SBF consensus was one of those that was likely to reduce expression. If it is, why not show this and explain it clearly?</italic></p><p>Our statement that “a single base pair substitution in the SBF motif can reduce gene expression” was meant as a general statement. For many transcription factor binding sites, even changing a single base pair may result in decrease binding and subsequently decreased gene expression. In our experiment, the change in the SBF site was much more substantial than a single base pair mutation: we replaced the SBF sites (TCACGAAA) of CLN2 (Koch et al., 1996) with a known E2F binding site (GCGCGAAA) from the promoters of the histone cluster genes (Rabinovich et al., 2008). There are, of course, other possible E2F DNA binding sites that we could have used in our experiment; we picked this one because it is a well-characterized E2F binding site.</p><p>To circumvent this sampling bias, we now analyze data from high-throughput protein-binding microarray (PBM) assays (Afek et al., 2014; Badis et al., 2008) of human E2F (E2F1) and budding yeast SBF (Swi4). PBM assays measure, in a single experiment, the binding of recombinant proteins to tens of thousands of synthetic DNA sequences, guaranteed to cover all possible 10-bp DNA sequences in a maximally compact representation (each 10-mer occurs once and only once). We used these PBM data to generate DNA motifs for E2F and SBF (Berger et al., 2006), and to compute, for each possible 8-bp DNA sequence, an enrichment score (or E-score) that reflects the specificity of the protein for that 8-mer. E-scores vary between -0.5 and +0.5, with larger values corresponding to higher affinity binding sites (Berger et al., 2006). As shown in new Figure 10A, E2F1 and Swi4 can bind a set of common motifs. For example, the E2F binding site variant that we tested in budding yeast (GCGCGAAA, highlighted in red), is one of the sites commonly bound in vitro by E2F and SBF.</p><p>Most notably, the in vitro PBM data show that there are specific motifs that can be bound only by E2F or only by SBF. To identify the key nucleotide differences between E2F-only and SBF-only binding, we created motifs of E2F-only and SBF-only sites. The consensus E2F-only (NNSGCGSN) and SBF-only (NNCRCGNN) motifs indicate that differential specificity between E2F1 and SBF is mediated by the nucleotides in the 3rd and 4th positions (underlined). Thus, to address our Reviewer's comment, E2F has a strict preference for G in the 4th position, whereas SBF has a strict preference for C in the 3rd position (Figure 10A).</p><p>We now include new Figure 10 and this discussion in the main text.</p><p> <italic>Furthermore, since E2Fs regulate many cell cycle target genes, it would be much more convincing if the authors simply surveyed the known E2F binding sites and estimated (bioinformatically) which of them SBF is likely to regulate. The observation that SBF can bind the histone binding site (on its own) really adds nothing.</italic></p><p>We scanned the promoters of known E2F target genes from the human genome (CCNE1, E2F1, EZH2) with our empirically-defined DNA binding sites from PBM assays (Afek et al., 2014; Badis et al., 2008) to predict putative E2F-only, SBF-only, and common sites (Figure 10B). As expected, there are many predicted E2F-only and common (E2F &amp; SBF) sites that can be bound by E2F in these known target genes. However, we can also find many potential SBF-only binding sites in these promoters. We extended our analysis to 290 known E2F target genes in the human genome to test the generality of SBF cross-binding to E2F sites (Figure 10C). Most E2F target promoters could be bound by SBF, which supports the hijacking hypothesis where an ancestral SBF might have taken control of several E2F-regulated genes.</p><p>We now include new Figure 10 and this discussion in the main text.</p><p>We note that our observation that SBF can bind an E2F binding site in vivo, leading to cell cycle regulated gene expression, is critical for showing that our results based on high-throughput in vitro data are also true in a cellular (in vivo) environment.</p><p> <italic>I think the most important thing for the authors to add is a phylogenetic analysis showing that the data support the hypothesis of a single transfer event in the ancestral fungi.</italic></p><p>Please see new text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>As a secondary point, I guess if they really want to include the histone binding site experiment, they should include it in the context of a survey of other known E2F and SBF binding sites, and consider to what extent SBF could have taken over the sites. (More interesting would be to look at the binding sites in the extant species that are predicted to have both TFs and see if there's any evidence for both of them working. However, I understand that we're not supposed to suggest additional analyses at this stage.)</italic></p><p>Please see new text and Figure 10.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>Reduce the number of figures and make them less busy and higher quality (visible).
