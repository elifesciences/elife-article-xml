A nucleotide-dependent stabilising cap at microtubule ends is thought to be lost before this switch can occur; however, the nature and size of this protective cap are unknown. Using a microfluidics-assisted multi-colour TIRF microscopy assay with close-to-nm and sub-second precision, we measured the sizes of the stabilizing cap of individual microtubules. We find that the protective caps are formed by the extended binding regions of EB proteins. Cap lengths vary considerably and longer caps are more stable. Nevertheless, the trigger of instability lies in a short region at the end of the cap, as a quantitative model of cap stability demonstrates. Our study establishes the spatial and kinetic characteristics of the protective cap and provides an insight into the molecular mechanism by which its loss leads to the switch from microtubule growth to shrinkage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13470.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13470.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13470.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Much like the skeleton supports the human body, a structure called the cytoskeleton provides support and structure to cells.

They consist of typically 13 protofilaments forming a tube. Their function depends on their ability to switch between growing and shrinking states, called dynamic instability, which is essential for intracellular space exploration, mitosis and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard and Hyman, 2009</xref>). The dynamic properties of microtubules are tightly controlled and a target of numerous anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peterson and Mitchison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seligmann and Twelves, 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of microtubule state switching is not understood.</p><p>The switch-like nature of microtubule stability is thought to depend on the existence of a stabilising GTP (or GDP-Pi) cap at the end of growing microtubules as a result of addition of GTP-loaded tubulin heterodimers and subsequent GTP hydrolysis and phosphate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlier, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). However GTP cannot be visualised in individual dynamic microtubules; therefore the cap size and their relation to individual microtubule stability remains unknown. A variety of models exist, assuming either long caps (several tens of tubulin layers, i.e. hundreds of nanometers long, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlier et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Hill, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>]) or short caps (1-2 tubulin layers, i.e. 8–16 nm only, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolterauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caplow and Shanks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drechsel and Kirschner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>]). Long caps would be a result of random GTP hydrolysis, causing the cap size to increase with growth speed. Short caps would be a consequence of coupled GTP hydrolysis, which would require GTP hydrolysis to accelerate when microtubules grow faster, resulting in a short cap of constant size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayley et al., 1989</xref>). Alternative models exist that assume either currently not observable structural events for loss of stability, such as formation of cracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flyvbjerg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Margolin et al., 2012</xref>) or defects, or local biochemical criteria at the very end of the microtubule, introducing a distinction between the total GTP cap and its part that is critical for stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brun et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Proteins of the EB1 family (EBs) transiently bind to growing microtubule ends as their conformation matures in a nucleotide state-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar and Wittmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>), potentially binding to the GTP (or GDP-Pi) cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seetapun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Before microtubules switch from growth to depolymerisation (catastrophe), the size of the EB binding region tends to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>), potentially suggesting a link between microtubule stability and the size of the EB binding region. As this region extends over several hundred nanometers, an EB binding site cap would be a 'long cap'.</p><p>The recent observation of large microtubule growth fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardner et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerssemakers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schek et al., 2007</xref>) challenged 'short cap' models because transient shrinking episodes during growth phases of up to ~ five tubulin layers (which would remove such short caps) did not cause catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schek et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, long cap models have been challenged by tubulin dilution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Voter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>). Tubulin dilution causes microtubules to stop growing and hence prevents the addition of new capping tubulins, resulting in microtubules undergoing a catastrophe after a delay of several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>). This delay time is thought to be the time it takes for the stabilising structure at the microtubule end to disappear and therefore is a measure of momentary stability at the instant of dilution. In these experiments, delay times were reported to be insensitive to the microtubule growth speed, apparently contradicting 'long cap' models that predict higher stability with increasing growth speed due to longer caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padinhateeri et al., 2012</xref>). However, the cap size itself could not be visualised in these previous experiments and no quantitative explanation could be given for the observed values of the delay times. Given the reported contradicting results, the size of the stabilising cap and especially its relationship with microtubule stability is still unclear. Ultimately, this is due to a lack of experiments measuring the protective cap size and relating it to the stability of individual microtubules.</p><p>To simultaneously measure momentary microtubule stability and EB cap size with high spatio-temporal resolution, we developed a new microfluidics-assisted two-colour TIRF microscopy assay for fast and complete tubulin removal, combining automated microtubule end tracking and EB protein monitoring. For the first time, this allowed us to measure with close-to-nm and sub-second precision the instantaneous stability of individual microtubules, and the instantaneous size of their EB binding site caps, and to directly investigate their relationship. We find that the EB binding region is indeed the stabilising cap. We demonstrate that microtubules with longer caps are more stable and we present a quantitative kinetic model of momentary microtubule stability. Catastrophe is induced when the number of EB binding sites at the very end of the cap has fallen to 15–30% of its steady state value. This establishes the basic mechanism of catastrophe induction based on measured protective cap properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microtubule stability increases with growth speed</title><p>In a microfluidic device, we immobilised Alexa568-labelled stabilised microtubule seeds on a functionalised glass surface.

Fitting traces of the end position and fluorescence background (Materials and methods) allowed us to determine the washout and catastrophe times with sub-sampling time precision, as well as the instantaneous growth speeds measured over a 10 s time period just before washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Growth speeds varied considerably around a mean of 28 nm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). The delay times between washout and catastrophe also showed a broad and non-exponential distribution, with a mean of 7.3 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right), similar to previous dilution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>). As bending can affect the material properties of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaedel et al., 2015</xref>), we tested whether the measured delay times were influenced by mechanical stress, potentially induced by microtubule bending in our assay. We determined the orientation of the growing microtubule end regions relative to the flow direction before tubulin washout, and found that the variation of orientations was relatively small (mean orientation 3.1° with a standard deviation of 7.3°) indicative of good microtubule alignment. No correlation between the delay time and the magnitude of the orientation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, blue data), indicating that mechanical stress is not responsible for the observed variations of the momentary microtubule stabilities in our assay.</p><p>However, in contrast to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>), the delay times clearly increased with increasing growth speed, provided that speeds were measured directly before washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ρ = 0.69, p&lt;10<sup>–15</sup>). This demonstrates that microtubules are more stable when they grow faster. Interestingly, the strong correlation decreased when the growth speed was measured at earlier times before tubulin washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> right), as quantitatively demonstrated by a gradual decrease of the correlation coefficient and a gradual increase of its p-value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, the measured delay times reflect microtubule stability at the moment of tubulin washout and this stability varies over time as the growth speed fluctuates. This might explain why previous tubulin dilution experiments failed to detect the correlation between delay times and growth speeds; there average growth speeds were measured over long time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 1991</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13470.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Momentary stability increases with growth speed at washout time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example end position-time plot.

This suggests that a threshold may have to be reached to induce catastrophe, raising the question of what exactly constitutes this threshold. Two extreme possibilities can be envisaged: A minimal total number of cap sites anywhere in the entire cap might be required for stability. Alternatively a minimal density of cap sites only at its very end where the cap site density is highest might be needed for stability of the cap. In other words, either the entire cap or only its highest density region could be critical for stability. These two scenarios predict different dependencies of the delay times on the growth speed and hence cap length (Materials and methods). To explore the momentary microtubule stabilities over a larger range of cap sizes, we performed tubulin washout experiments at a range of different tubulin concentrations from 10 μM to 35 μM, and at an increased magnesium ion concentration to further increase the velocity range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Brien et al., 1990</xref>). In total 210 microtubules were analysed.

A fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom, solid red line) (Materials and methods) predicts that independent of the initial length of the stabilising cap, catastrophe occurred when around a fifth of the initial density of cap sites (<italic>f</italic><sub>crit</sub> = 0.20) was left at the end of the decaying cap, i.e. ~3 per tubulin layer. The longer the caps at washout, i.e. the faster microtubules grow, the less dependent the momentary microtubule stability becomes on cap length. This is because EB site maturation becomes more important relatively to end shrinkage for reaching the 'end density' threshold, with increasing cap length at washout. In contrast, an alternative model assuming that catastrophe occurs when a critical 'total number' of sites anywhere in the cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>N</italic><sub>crit</sub>) is reached did not agree with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, dashed line): this model predicts a stronger increase of delay times with growth speed for longer caps as a consequence of increasing total EB binding site numbers with cap length at washout.</p><p>Fits to the other speed-sorted mean delay times as a function of mean growth speed (from data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) produced also good agreement with the data for a simple critical 'end density' threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This analysis revealed furthermore that the addition of Mal3-GFP destabilised the cap by increasing the threshold from 14% to 28% of the initial end density, i.e. from ~2 to ~4 cap sites per tubulin layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the length along the microtubule end over which a critical minimal density of cap sites is required for stability, we examined the data using a third version of the simple maturation model: this explicitly considered the number of cap sites within an extended but finite distance of the shrinking end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, inset). Good global fits to our complete dataset, consisting of all delay times and also the Mal3-GFP intensities at washout and catastrophe, were obtained for fixed end region lengths ranging between 8 and ~80 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This puts an upper limit on the size of the critical part of the cap over which a minimal density needs to be maintained for microtubule stability.</p><p>For simplicity we have assumed here throughout that the EB binding site region starts directly at the microtubule end (one-step end maturation). Previously, a detailed analysis of fluorescent EB end profiles has revealed an additional small non-binding region at the very end of the microtubule before the actual EB binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>). This region could be accounted for by a two-step end maturation process consisting first of fast generation of EB binding sites, and a subsequent slower maturation into lattice sites. Applying this more complex model here did not improve the quality of the fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and confirmed that the threshold of stability is defined by a critical end density of cap sites and not by a critical total number of cap sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the absence of Mal3, the 2-step maturation model predicted threshold values for the end density that were ~25% larger compared to the simpler 1-step model. In the presence of Mal3 the two models predicted the same threshold value (within error) due to the first maturation step being very fast in the presence of EB1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the conceptually simpler end maturation model is sufficient to capture the basic principles determining momentary microtubule stability, especially for the more physiological condition in the presence of an EB1 family protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Momentary microtubule stability can be monitored in real time</title><p>We have performed tubulin washout experiments with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Here, using sudden tubulin removal, we directly investigated for the first time the relationship between the size of the protective cap and the momentary stability of individual microtubules.

This indicates that the momentary microtubule stability fluctuates as growth speed varies and that EB caps store a 'memory of stability' over the time scale of several seconds, probably as a consequence of the lifetimes of the EB binding sites being in this range. The observation of this memory excludes memoryless models of microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolterauer et al., 1999</xref>; ).

The total cap is however much larger than what is required for its stability. This property allows the cap to withstand strong growth fluctuations that include even short depolymerisation episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schek et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The observed delay times after tubulin washout were more sensitive to growth speed variations in the lower growth speed regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Kinetic threshold models revealed that this behaviour can be accounted for if only the highest density region of the cap, i.e. its part closest to the microtubule end, determines its stability. This agrees with earlier conclusions that the minimal critical cap required for stability is short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caplow and Shanks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drechsel and Kirschner, 1994</xref>). We found that for the microtubule to be stable on average 15–30% cap sites needed to be left in the end region of the cap which had a length of up to ~10 tubulin layers at most. This conclusion drawn from our tubulin washout experiments is in good agreement with previous observations during steady state growth for the reduction of EB binding sites before catastrophes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>), demonstrating that it is independent of the specifics of the tubulin washout experiment.</p><p>We observed considerable variation of individual delay times around their average values indicating the influence of additional stochastic effects that our simple kinetic threshold model does not capture. Such variability can be expected to result for example from differences in the exact spatial distributions of stabilising tubulins in the cap region and from the structural consequences these different distributions have for stability. Nevertheless our model captures the fundamental characteristics of momentary microtubule stability and provides a quantitative link with the kinetic properties of microtubule growth and GTPase-linked microtubule end maturation.</p><p>At steady state, the catastrophe frequency has been reported to depend on the time of microtubule growth, i.e. on the microtubule age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Odde et al., 1995</xref>). Here we analyzed only microtubules which grew for similar time periods before tubulin washout. This allowed us to neglect ageing effects in our analysis.

EBs destabilize microtubules in three ways: (i) acceleration of conformational end maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>), (ii) acceleration of tubulin dissociation from the microtubule end (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), possibly due to effects of EBs on the microtubule end structure ('taper' or 'sheet') during growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>), and (iii) direct structural destabilisation of the cap (i.e. increase of the end density threshold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which agrees with recent structural studies indicating that EBs induce strain in the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). These findings further support the view that end binding proteins of the EB1 family may have evolved to modulate the stability of the functionally essential protective end structure of the microtubule and may then have gained the additional function to recruit a variety of other unrelated plus end binding proteins (+TIPs), whereas in parallel more effective, for example ATP-dependent modulators of cap stability such as depolymerases of the kinesin-13 family evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duellberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardner et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howard and Hyman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Outlook</title><p>While the debate about the size of the stabilising cap was ongoing, microtubule end binding proteins were discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beinhauer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 1995</xref>) and later used to facilitate microtubule end tracking in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch and Brunner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komarova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seetapun et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors employed microfluidics to monitor microtubule catastrophe induced by a sudden removal of free tubulin. A unique advantage of this approach is that all major parameters of microtubule dynamics (growth rate, duration of the pause between the removal of tubulin and the catastrophe, depolymerization rates) are obtained for specific microtubules that are continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The quality of the data is excellent. The main conclusion is that microtubules are protected by a long cap delineated by the binding of EB. The length of the cap positively correlates with the growth rate and the ability of microtubule to remain stable in the absence of free tubulin. Importantly, the data presented in the manuscript suggest that these correlations have not been observed in previous studies due to rapid fluctuations, the size of the cap needs to be measured right before the catastrophe. This is an excellent paper whose publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is strongly recommended.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers agree that the issue of mechanical stress on microtubule stability, brought to general attention by the work of Manuel Thery and co-workers (see Schaedel et al., Nature Materials 2015) deserves more attention. One reviewer notes that the authors cite the Thiery paper in the Methods and states that the authors only analyze microtubules aligned with the direction of the flow to avoid analyzing damaged microtubules, but also notes that it is unclear what is the tolerance for &quot;aligned with the flow&quot;, and wonders if the authors can completely exclude mechanical stress, given that they need very rapid fluid exchange. All reviewers agree that the issue of mechanical stress should be addressed directly in the Results, not only the Methods. Furthermore, the reviewers agree that if there was an appreciable variability in the angular orientation of the microtubules, one way to address this concern would be to present data that is binned according to the angle relative to the direction of flow.</p><p>2) The effects of microtubule ageing on catastrophe frequency has been described (Gardner et al., Cell 2011), and competing models to explain this phenomenon have been proposed (Coombes et al., Curr Biol 2013, Zakharov et al., Biophys J 2015, and Bowne-Anderson, Bioessays 2013). The authors do not address this point in their manuscript, but the reviewers agree that they should do it, at least in writing, and ideally could also report whether their data can provide additional evidence to evaluate this model, and in particular with reference to the question whether the delay times correlate with the age of the microtubule. No additional experiments are required, but rather an analysis of the existing data to address this point and a discussion of the previous literature.</p><p>3) The reviewers strongly recommend that the authors tabulate all of their quantitative measurements in an appendix. There have been a number of attempts to develop computational/kinetic models for catastrophe, and different groups often refine their model against different experimental datasets. This causes a lot of unnecessary confusion/conflict. Recapitulating the comprehensive measurements reported here will provide a stringent new challenge for models.</p><p>4) Finally, one of the reviewers noted that the models discussed in the manuscript treat the microtubule end in a simplified manner. The reviewer writes: &quot;If I understand the model correctly, the EB binding region extends to the very end of the microtubule. This is contrary to previous work from the Surrey group which showed that EB's do not bind to the very end of the microtubule (Maurer et al., 2014). In the Maurer paper, the tip was modeled as moving from state A (non-EB binding)--&gt; state B (EB binding) --&gt; state C (post-hydrolysis, non-EB binding). The reason this matters in this paper is because of the shrinkage of the tip after the tubulin is washed out. Is this shrinkage reducing the number of EB binding sites? Well, maybe not, because there is no EB in the region that is shrinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, mean shrinkage length of 165 nm, compared to the size of the A region in Maurer 2014, approximately 100 nm). Does the use of a two-step maturation model weaken or strengthen the conclusions presented here?&quot;. A clarification of this point in your rebuttal, and any useful editing that might help clarifying this point, would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13470.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) All three reviewers agree that the issue of mechanical stress on microtubule stability, brought to general attention by the work of Manuel Thery and co-workers (see Schaedel et al., Nature Materials 2015) deserves more attention.

Our fitting software allows us to extract the orientation of the analysed microtubules. Although our experiment was designed in a way that microtubules are aligned with the flow during growth to minimise mechanical stress of the microtubules, we nevertheless quantified the variability in the orientation of the microtubule end regions with respect to the flow direction (the flow cells were manually aligned so that their long axis was parallel to the x-axis of the camera chip). For all three data sets presented in the manuscript we determined the angles of microtubule orientation and found that they were within +/-10 degrees of the flow direction. Plotting the delay times as a function of orientation for all data sets demonstrated convincingly that there was no correlation between angle and delay time. Any potential mechanical strain introduced during fluid exchange is expected to be larger for larger angles; hence, we can conclude that within the range of microtubule orientations of our experiment, there is no evidence of mechanical strain affecting the observed momentary microtubule stabilities (delay times between tubulin washout and catastrophe). We present scatter plots of the delay times vs. the 'raw' orientations for all datasets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and added a corresponding description of this new analysis to the Results, to the Methods and to the legends. For the benefit of the reviewers, we also add scatter plots for the tubulin concentration dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) showing the delay times vs. the magnitude of the average orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>), and of the delay times vs. the standard deviations of the orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B</xref>) (each orientation is an average over 10 s before tubulin washout). All scatter plots show that there are no correlations, demonstrating that the observed differences in delay times are not caused by mechanical stress. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this analysis and consider this an interesting new result that has strengthened our conclusions.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13470.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Delay time vs. the magnitude of the orientation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> relative to the mean: for each data point of a specific tubulin concentration, the mean of the distribution has been subtracted and the magnitude of this relative orientation is plotted.</title><p>Statistical analysis shows no significant correlation (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> =0.01).

Tubulin washout was always performed at a roughly constant time of ~100s after flowing in the tubulin. We considered this restriction necessary given the already complex and rich set of data. Therefore, our model does not describe ageing effects, since all microtubules have roughly the same age. We state this more clearly now in the Discussion. We state that the fast tubulin washout experiments as performed here will be an interesting and powerful method to test different ageing models. We have begun with such experiments and analysis, and given the amount of additional data needed, we conclude that this will be a study of its own in the future, going well beyond the scope of this study here.</p><p> <italic>3) The reviewers strongly recommend that the authors tabulate all of their quantitative measurements in an appendix.

The reviewer writes: &quot;If I understand the model correctly, the EB binding region extends to the very end of the microtubule. This is contrary to previous work from the Surrey group which showed that EB's do not bind to the very end of the microtubule (Maurer et al., 2014). In the Maurer paper, the tip was modeled as moving from state A (non-EB binding)--&gt; state B (EB binding) --&gt; state C (post-hydrolysis, non-EB binding). The reason this matters in this paper is because of the shrinkage of the tip after the tubulin is washed out. Is this shrinkage reducing the number of EB binding sites? Well, maybe not, because there is no EB in the region that is shrinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, mean shrinkage length of 165 nm, compared to the size of the A region in Maurer 2014, approximately 100 nm). Does the use of a two-step maturation model weaken or strengthen the conclusions presented here?&quot;. A clarification of this point in your rebuttal, and any useful editing that might help clarifying this point, would be useful.</italic></p><p>In our previous version of the manuscript we mentioned in the Results section that applying the 2-step model did not change the quality of the fits to our data or any of our main conclusions, but can change the predicted threshold values. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, we now show these fits applying the 2-step model to all three datasets in comparison to the fits using the 1-step model. Importantly, using the 2-step model confirms the conclusion that the <italic>end density</italic> and not the <italic>total number</italic> of binding sites defines the threshold of stability. Two models make similar predictions, essentially because the first (A) region is typically short, see Maurer et al., Curr Biol. 2014. We extended the description of the 2-step model fits in the Results section and added a section to the Methods explaining how the analysis was performed. We feel that the manuscript is more accessible if we continue to focus on the 1-step model throughout and explain under which conditions the predicted thresholds need to be adjusted when the 2-step model is applied. These adjustments are rather minor, essentially because in the 2-step maturation model the first step is always faster than the second step, especially in the presence of EB proteins, as we found previously (Maurer et al., Curr Biol 2014). This means that under more physiological conditions (presence of EBs), the first step of the 2-step model can be neglected, leaving us with a 1-step model. In the absence of EBs (only relevant for some in vitro experiments), we found previously for very fast growing microtubules that the first step is predicted to be ~5x faster than the second step. In this case (absence of EBs), the 2-step model predicts ~25% higher threshold values of stability in the tubulin washout experiment than the 1-step model does. Conceptually, we do not consider this change as very important, especially given that this range is close to the experimental errors and/or observed variability in the data. Nevertheless, we agree that it is important to clarify these points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
