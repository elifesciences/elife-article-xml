Hence, an extensive knowledge of the structural dynamics of the receptor is critical for the development of therapeutics. Here, we target the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R), for which a negligible number of drugs have been approved. We combine molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, network theory, and pocket detection to decipher the activation pathway of A<sub>1</sub>R, decode the allosteric networks, and identify transient pockets. The A<sub>1</sub>R activation pathway reveals hidden intermediate and pre-active states together with the inactive and fully-active states observed experimentally. The protein energy networks computed throughout these conformational states successfully unravel the extra and intracellular allosteric centers and the communication pathways that couple them. We observe that the allosteric networks are dynamic, being increased along activation and fine-tuned in the presence of the trimeric G-proteins. Overlap of transient pockets and energy networks uncovers how the allosteric coupling between pockets and distinct functional regions of the receptor is altered along activation. Through an in-depth analysis of the bridge between the activation pathway, energy networks, and transient pockets, we provide a further understanding of A<sub>1</sub>R. This information can be useful to ease the design of allosteric modulators for A<sub>1</sub>R.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adenosine A1 receptor</kwd><kwd>activation pathway</kwd><kwd>energy networks</kwd><kwd>transient pockets</kwd><kwd>allosteric modulators</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014188</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022M3E5F3080873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014188</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2020R1A2C2101636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014188</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A2025286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014188</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2021H1D3A2A02038434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maria-Solano</surname><given-names>Miguel A</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deciphering the dynamics of the allosteric communication and the formation of transient pockets along the activation pathway of G-protein-coupled receptors provides useful information for the design of allosteric modulators.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biomolecules present intrinsic dynamism and plasticity to respond to physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wodak et al., 2019</xref>).

Allosteric modulators are capable to bind regions other than orthosteric sites and propagate communication networks to other functional regions of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dokholyan, 2016</xref>). A complete information for the structure-based design of allosteric modulators involves not only the exploration of the receptor activation pathway and the identification of binding sites, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2021</xref>) but also the characterization of the allosteric pathways, which is a complicated task. However, allosteric drugs offer the advantage of higher selectivity with respect to conventional drugs due to the greater sequence variability of allosteric sites.

First, we use conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with enhanced sampling techniques to reconstruct the receptor activation conformational landscape of the inward-to-outward TM6 transition revealing the inactive, intermediate, pre-active, and fully-active conformational states. Second, we study the dynamic communication energy networks throughout the conformational states sampled successfully capturing the extra and intracellular communication centers and the pathways that interconnect them. We observe that the allosteric communication is enhanced along the receptor activation and fine-tuned in the presence of the trimeric G-protein. Third, we use a geometry-based approach to search for the formation of transient pockets. By studying the connection between these three elements we give a complete dynamic picture of the A<sub>1</sub>R activation that is essential for the design of specific allosteric modulators. This in silico approach can be also applied to uncover the activation landscape, allosteric networks, and transient pockets of related GPCRs, which is of interest for allosteric drug design.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The free energy landscape of A<sub>1</sub>R activation reveals intermediate and pre-active states</title><p>To uncover the activation pathway of A<sub>1</sub>R in the presence of its endogenous agonist adenosine (A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO), we reconstructed the free energy landscape (FEL) of A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO associated with the TM6 inward-to-outward transition observed by X-ray and Cryo-EM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, we focus on two features: the TM6 torsion and the center of mass (COM) distance between the TM3 and TM6 intracellular ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Initially, we performed conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations starting from both, the inactive (PDB 5N2S) and the active (PDB 6D9H) structures in order to increase the sampling of the activation conformational space. For each starting point, we computed three replicas of 500ns, which is a reasonable simulation time to provide an initial sampling of the receptor activation. Either starting from the inactive or active structures the complete TM6 Inward-to-Outward transition is not sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, when starting from the active structure, an intermediate state centered at ca. TM6 torsion (â140Â°) and TM3-TM6 distance (15 Ã) coordinates is substantially populated. This intermediate structure still presents a rather high degree of TM6 torsion while the TM3-TM6 distance is shortened. In contrast, when starting from the inactive structure, the receptor mostly samples inactive conformations exhibiting a low probability of progressing toward the intermediate state, thus suggesting a higher inactive-to-intermediate transition time scale. For a better characterization of the conformational landscape of the A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO activation and to check the importance of the intermediate state, we relied on metadynamics simulations. The primary objective of this calculation is to identify and reconstruct the major conformational states that are involved in the pathway of receptor activation. Metadynamics is a powerful method that has been successfully used to study complex conformational transitions in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">CalvÃ³-Tusell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maria-Solano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuzmanic et al., 2017</xref>), including GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mafi et al., 2022</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mattedi et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, we performed well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) simulations using the walkers approach (see Materials and methods). We selected 10 representative structures along the activation pathway sampled in the cMD as starting points for the walker replicas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). After 250 ns of accumulated time, we successfully reconstructed the major conformational states of the FEL (see convergence assessment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplements 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref> and error estimation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The FEL in the presence of adenosine confirms that A<sub>1</sub>R presents three major states in dynamic equilibrium (inactive, intermediate, and pre-active) while the fully-active Cryo-EM like state is not significantly populated. The relative stabilities of the three states show that the most stable state is the inactive, followed by the pre-active and intermediate states, which are slightly higher in energy. The inactive state resembles the inactive X-ray coordinates showing short TM3-TM6 distances and low TM6 torsion values (state 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). The inactive conformations are stabilized by a tight energy coupling between TM3 and TM6 (see below). As the activation progresses, TM6 torsion evolves further than the TM3-TM6 distance. At this point, the remaining energy coupling between TM3 and TM6 ends hampers the progression of the TM6 outward transition. This tug of war between forces provokes the adoption of torsion in the TM6 end that is signature of the intermediate conformations (state 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). This notorious torsion evolves to a more stable intermediate conformation (state 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). Finally, a pre-active local energy minimum is reached completing the TM6 transition, which involves the complete break between TM6 and TM3 energy coupling (see below). The pre-active state presents similar TM3-TM6 distances to the fully-active Cryo-EM structure. However, it exhibits higher TM6 torsion values (state 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). In addition, an extra opening of TM6 is accessible (state 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). All data together suggests that the coupling of the G-proteins is required to stabilize the adoption of the fully-active Cryo-EM like structure (see next sections). As a complementary analysis, we conducted the reweighting of the metadynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branduardi et al., 2012</xref>) to determine the free energy as a function of previously identified A<sub>1</sub>R micro-switches (ionic-lock, PIF motif, water-lock, and toggle switch). The fact that we capture the distinct energy barriers associated with unbiased micro-switches highlights the accuracy of the metadynamics simulations in reproducing the pathway of activation and provides useful information to guide the selection of collective variables for future GPCR landscape calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplements 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). Once deciphered the A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO FEL of activation, our study follows on investigating the receptor-specific allosteric properties that harbor these inactive, intermediate, and pre-active states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Energy networks capture the dynamic allosteric pathways along A<sub>1</sub>R activation</title><p>A complete understanding of allosteric modulation involves the decoding of the communication pathways that dynamically couple distinct protein sites.

In the extracellular region, ECL2 and ECL3 present a center of communication connecting with TM4, TM5, TM1, and TM6. Energy pathways involving TM5, TM6, and TM4 propagate from the extracellular ECL2/ECL3 regions and link with TM3 in the intracellular region. In addition, TM3 establishes connections with TM2 and TM7 that communicate back to the ECL2 by crosslinking with TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). TM6 is then energetically coupled with the extracellular region through ECL3/ECL2 and with the intracellular region through TM3. In fact, the TM3 end plays a central role in allosteric communication at the intracellular region. Specifically, R108<sup>3.53</sup> is a communication hub forming and hydrogen networking with D229<sup>6.30</sup>, D104<sup>3.49</sup> (ionic-lock micro-switch) and D326<sup>C-Ter</sup>.

We started the analysis with the inactive PEN, which shows that the extracellular ECL2 center is only connected to the intracellular region through TM2 and TM1. In the intracellular region, R108<sup>3.53</sup> establishes a tight communication with D104<sup>3.49</sup>, D229<sup>6.30</sup>, and D326<sup>C-Ter</sup>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>. Note that D229<sup>6.30</sup> can also communicate with R105<sup>3.50</sup>. This hydrogen-bonded network that captures the ionic-lock micro-switch is signature of the inactive in-ward conformation of TM6. In fact, D229<sup>6.30</sup>-R108<sup>3.53</sup> interaction is pivotal to attaining the inactive conformation of the receptor. Interestingly D326<sup>C-Ter</sup> plays an important role in energy communication. The flexible C-Ter region can partially occupy the G-proteins binding site and perform stable communication with R108<sup>3.53</sup>. We followed the analysis with the PEN of the intermediate ensemble. In this case, the extracellular communication center is reduced and ECL2/ECL3 region is connected to the intracellular region through TM7 and TM1. Interestingly, the communication through TM6 starts to take place partially in the intracellular region. In contrast with the inactive ensemble, D229<sup>6.30</sup> now mainly communicates with R105<sup>3.50</sup> instead of R108<sup>3.53</sup> in the intracellular region, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>. Therefore, at this point, the dynamics of the ionic-lock is altered. This transient interaction is key to preventing TM6 opening after the tension generated in the last segment of TM6 and provokes a torsion in the TM6 intracellular end that captures the receptor in an intermediate state (described above). In this scenario, R108<sup>3.53</sup> communicates with D42<sup>2.37</sup> and D104<sup>3.49</sup>. Note that the C-Ter does not communicate with TM3, which explains the transience of this interaction due to the C-Ter flexibility. Finally, in the pre-active ensemble, the extracellular ECL2 networks are recovered and connected to the intrahelical region through multiple pathways, including TM2, TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM7. Interestingly, the PEN captures Y200<sup>5.58</sup> and Y288<sup>7.53</sup> in the TM5 and TM7 pathways, respectively. These tyrosine residues have been found to stabilize the active state through a hydrogen bond coordinated by a bridging water molecule in the so-called water-lock. However, the water-lock bridge is not observed because non-protein molecules are excluded in the PEN calculation, which points out a major limitation of the methodology. Regarding the TM6 pathway, its partial communication observed in the intermediate state progresses further capturing the toggle switch (W247<sup>6.48</sup>) and it is completed linking with TM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This enhanced communication between the intra and extracellular regions is driven by the complete opening of TM6. As expected, the TM6 opening provokes the break of the ionic-lock disconnecting TM6 (D229<sup>6.30</sup>) from TM3 (R108<sup>3.53</sup> and R105<sup>3.50</sup>). Indeed, the R108<sup>3.53</sup> node loses prominence in the intracellular region. However, R108<sup>3.53</sup> still can communicate with D326<sup>C-Ter</sup>, which may compensate for the break of TM3-TM6 ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>).

For the ECL2/ECL3 extracellular region, 9 allosteric residues have been identified that affect the efficacy of orthosteric agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2016a</xref>). Among all of them, up to 7 are captured in the ECL2/ECL3 PEN communication center (<bold>W156</bold><sup><bold>45.37</bold></sup>, <bold>N148</bold><sup><bold>45.29</bold></sup>, <bold>K173</bold><sup><bold>45.54</bold></sup>, <bold>K265</bold><sup><bold>67</bold></sup>, <bold>E170</bold><sup><bold>45.51</bold></sup>, <bold>S150</bold><sup><bold>45.31</bold></sup>, and <bold>T270</bold><sup><bold>7.35</bold></sup>) and the other 3 are located in the ECL2 alpha helix that connects with the PEN through S150. In addition, other four allosteric residues located in a TM1-7 extrahelical region have been recently reported to be important for PAM cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draper-Joyce et al., 2021</xref>). The PEN directly captures <bold>S246</bold><sup><bold>6.47</bold></sup>, <bold>L242</bold><sup><bold>6.43</bold></sup>, and <bold>L245</bold><sup><bold>6.46</bold></sup>, and the other residue (<bold>G279</bold><sup><bold>7.44</bold></sup>) is located adjacent to the PEN residue H278 and S246. Note that the experimentally identified allosteric residues captured in the PEN are labeled with a red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It is worth mentioning that among the allosteric residues captured in the PEN most of them are identified in the pre-active ensemble while only some of them are identified in the inactive and intermediate states. This is due to the enhanced allosteric communication observed upon activation. In summary, the PEN analysis along the conformational states captures many important positions for the allosteric mechanisms of the receptor and provides a dynamic view of the protein energy communication along the activation of the receptor. The TM6 in-ward to outward transition reveals that the TM6 allosteric pathway along the receptor is missing in the inactive state, partially formed in the intermediate state and completely established upon the receptor activation. Indeed, the pre-active state is characterized by increased allosteric communication through multiple pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>G-protein binding stabilizes the fully-active state and fine-tunes the allosteric communication</title><p>The next unknown we were intrigued to investigate is how the binding of G-proteins affects the A<sub>1</sub>R conformational ensemble and the allosteric networks. To that end, we performed 3 cMD replicas of 500 ns of A<sub>1</sub>R in presence of both, adenosine and heterotrimeric G<sub>i2</sub> protein (referred as ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex). As previously, the MD data was plotted as a function of the TM6 torsion and TM3-TM6 ends distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The population analysis of the receptor activation shows that the presence of the slim GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix in the A<sub>1</sub>R intracellular cavity prevents TM6 to sample intermediate and inactive conformations. Indeed, A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> displays restrictive conformational dynamics by only sampling one major conformational state.

The PEN analysis shows some similarities with respect to the PEN of the pre-active ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In both cases, TM6 allosteric communication is completed and TM7 presents an important communication pathway connecting the intra and extracellular regions. However, the presence of G-Protein finely tunes the PEN in some aspects: (1) the ECL2 extracellular communication center propagates toward the ECL2 helix capturing the <bold>W156</bold><sup><bold>45.37</bold></sup> allosteric residue that was not identified in previous PEN analysis, (2) the communication pathways between extra and intracellular regions are refined only passing through TM2, TM1, TM6, and TM7 and not using TM4 and TM5, certainly TM7 becomes the major communication pathway and another allosteric residue <bold>G279</bold><sup><bold>7.44</bold></sup> is captured as an important communication node, and (3) as expected, the C-Ter does not communicate with TM3 because the end of the Î±5 helix of GÎ±<sub>i2</sub> (GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix) replaces the C-Ter communication position. As a consequence, TM3 (R108) communicates with TM2 (D42) and most importantly with GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix (D667).

To that end, we performed cMD of the heterotrimeric G<sub>i2</sub> protein ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex in presence of the PAM (PAM-ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex) and in absence of adenosine (A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex) in order to compute their conformational landscape and energy networks following the same protocol as for the ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The analysis of the PEN of the A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex reveals that in the absence of ADO, the receptor displays a reduced allosteric communication between PB and functional regions of the receptor, such as the extracellular allosteric center, TM6, and PD allosteric site. As expected, the presence of ADO restores the allosteric coupling between PB and TM6, which could explain the increase in receptor activity associated with agonist binding. Additionally, our analysis of the PAM-ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> complex shows that the PAM reinforces the TM7-ECL3-ECL2 allosteric pathway that couples PD with PB, and ECL2 now communicates to the intracellular region through TM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, a recently published study reported that the orthosteric pocket (i.e. PB) contracts after ADO binding, as demonstrated by shortened distances of the so-called vestibular lid (defined as the sum of the length of the triangle perimeters formed by E170<sup>45.51</sup>-Y271<sup>7.36</sup>-E172<sup>45.53</sup> interacting residues) and the E172<sup>45.53</sup>-K265<sup>67</sup> salt bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref>).

This suggests that PAM promotes the contraction of PB, leading to the stabilization of the ADO-bound state. Thus, the enhanced energy coupling between PB and PD may be responsible for the increase in the binding affinity of ADO in the presence of the PAM, as observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draper-Joyce et al., 2021</xref>). This data indicates that allosteric modulators are able to enhance and redistribute the energy networks, which is likely attributed to their effects on receptor activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Effect of adenosine (ADO) and MIPS51 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) binding on the protein energy networks (PEN) of A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub>.</title><p>ADO in pocket B and MIPS521 PAM in pocket D, both aligned from PDB 7LD3, are depicted in gray and orange sticks, respectively.

It involves the deciphering of activation conformational landscapes, the decoding of allosteric networks, and the characterization of transient pockets that are allosterically coupled with functional regions of the receptor. Here, we focus on the A<sub>1</sub>R due to the failure in the development of efficient and safe allosteric modulators reported to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Draper-Joyce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>The A<sub>1</sub>R activation FEL associated with the TM6 inward-to-outward transition reveals that the receptor is in dynamic equilibrium with inactive, intermediate, and pre-active states, where the inactive is the most stable and the intermediate and pre-active states are separated by a lower energy barrier. This fast-conformational transition observed in the presence of adenosine may favor the binding and activation of G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mafi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostock et al., 2019</xref>). Regarding the activation pathway, the inactive state of TM6 resembles the inactive X-ray structure and progresses towards an intermediate state that is characterized by a rather high TM6 torsion and a modest TM6 opening due to the tight TM3-TM6 energy coupling in the intracellular ends. This results in torsion at the end of TM6, which is signature of the intermediate conformations. This torsion evolves to a more stable intermediate state that exhibits higher TM3-TM6 distances. Finally, TM6 progresses towards a complete opening reaching the pre-active state, in which the fully-active Cryo-EM structure is not highly populated. Interestingly a larger outward movement of TM6 is accessible, as captured in other class A GPCR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rasmussen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2016</xref>). Upon G-protein coupling, the slim GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix induces a population shift toward TM6 fully-active conformations that resemble the active Cryo-EM structure, and the intermediate and inactive states are not accessible. This data is in line with the combined activation mechanism described in many GPCRs by means of NMR and computational studies, which states that the combined action of both, agonist and G-proteins is essential to stabilize the adoption of a less dynamic fully-active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weis and Kobilka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bostock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mattedi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miao and McCammon, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The conformational progression obtained from the inactive to the adoption of fully-active conformations is relevant to target A<sub>1</sub>R drug specificity, especially the hidden intermediate and pre-active states. The collection of all these conformational states is also valuable to compute the allosteric networks of the receptor along the activation pathway. Such analysis provides a dynamic view of how allosteric communication evolves along activation. The analysis of the interaction protein energy networks (PEN) captured the extra and intracellular communication centers together with the allosteric pathways that interconnect them.</p><p>Focusing on the intracellular region, a tight allosteric commutation is observed in the inactive ensemble between D104<sup>3.49</sup>, R108<sup>3.53</sup>, D229<sup>6.30</sup>, and D326<sup>C-Ter</sup>, which is key to attaining TM6 in the inactive state. The strong TM6-TM3 hydrogen network weakens in the intermediate state and D229<sup>6.30</sup> now communicates with R105<sup>3.50</sup>. This transient communication prevents TM6 opening and captures the receptor in intermediate conformations, that are characterized by a structural torsion in the TM6 end. In the pre-active ensemble, TM6 opening provokes the complete loss of TM3-TM6 communication. Interestingly, the flexible D326<sup>C-Ter</sup> performs transient communications along the receptor activation with R108<sup>3.53</sup> and K116<sup>4.34</sup>. These interactions could compensate for the TM6-TM3 break upon activation. However, D326<sup>C-Ter</sup> communication takes place in the region where the G-proteins bind. Thus, the binding of the GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix must also compensate for the release of the C-ter from the G-proteins binding site. In fact, GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>-Î±5 helix (D340) replaces the D326<sup>C-Ter</sup> communication with R108<sup>3.53</sup> becoming a hub node in the intracellular allosteric center. Regarding the allosteric pathways, we observe enhanced communication between the intra and extracellular centers upon activation. In contrast with the inactive and intermediate states, in the pre-active state, multiple energy pathways arise including TM2, TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM7. This is evidenced by the lack of TM6 communication in the inactive state, the partial TM6 communication in the intermediate state, and the complete TM6 communication in the pre-active state. Interestingly, the presence of the G-proteins fine-tunes the allosteric communication profile only passing through TM2, TM1, TM6, and TM7. These insights may be interesting for future biased agonism studies. We hypothesize that the binding of drugs that potentially favor the establishment of specific PEN profiles may result in discrimination between different intracellular partners by preferentially communicating with one of them. Thus, avoiding side effects by activating desired pathways.</p><p>Finally, we studied the connection between transient pockets and PEN along the receptor activation in order to unravel the allosteric coupling between pockets and distinct functional regions of the receptor. As a proof of concept, we focus on PD, which corresponds to the binding site of MIPS52, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) that increases adenosine binding affinity in the orthosteric site (PB). Although PD is open in all conformational states, the communication between PB and PD is enhanced along activation capturing the allosteric residues that were found to affect its PAM from the intermediate to the fully active. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that drugs that bind pockets and interact with PEN that progress towards regions of the receptor where the function can be altered may potentially affect the receptor activity through allosteric effects. Additionally, the pocket where the drug binds must be open at least in the conformational state that is targeted. As a practical aspect, virtual screening campaigns could use this information during the design procedure by selecting drug candidates that perform stronger interactions with PEN residues that are contained in the pockets.</p><p>To further support this hypothesis, we explored the allosteric effects of ADO and MIPS52 PAM on the PEN. Interestingly, we observed that ADO is crucial for the formation of the extracellular center and the allosteric connection between the PB site and the TM6 pathway. Furthermore, MIPS52 PAM reinforces the allosteric pathway that connects PB and PD sites and redistributes other connections. These alterations in the PEN can be related to their mode of action. ADO may increase the activity of the receptor through its communication with TM6 and the PAM may increase ADO binding affinity through stronger energy coupling between PD and PB pockets. These findings imply that the mode of action of allosteric drugs could be predicted depending on how they redistribute the PEN.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With the combination of free energy landscape construction, allosteric networks decoding, and transient pockets calculation we successfully capture hidden conformational states, the allosteric communication centers/pathways, and the transient pockets formed along the A<sub>1</sub>R activation. Most importantly, by an in-depth study of the connection between these three elements, we provide a complete dynamic view of the A<sub>1</sub>R activation. Specifically, we observe that the allosteric communication is progressively enhanced between the extra and intracellular allosteric centers throughout the inactive, intermediate, and pre-active states to be fine-tuned upon the binding of G proteins in the fully-active state. In fact, not only the allosteric networks are dynamic, but the shape and frequency of formation of the transient pockets also change along the different conformational states. Overlap of the energy networks and transient pockets uncovers how the allosteric coupling between pockets and distinct regions of the receptor is altered along the receptor activation pathway. As a proof of concept, adenosine and a previously experimentally determined positive allosteric modulator were found to enhance and redistribute the energy networks of the receptor in a manner that is consistent with their respective biological activities. Understanding and predicting drug effects depending on how they redistribute the protein energy networks present a promising avenue for drug discovery. All these system-specific structural dynamics understanding provide useful information to advance the design of A<sub>1</sub>R allosteric modulators on the basis of structure-based drug design. This computational approach can be also transferable to other GPCRs and related receptors, which is of interest for the design of novel allosteric drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conventional Molecular Dynamics (cMD) simulations</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>System preparation</title><p>In total, five systems were prepared: the inactive conformation of A<sub>1</sub>R in complex with adenosine (A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO, inactive), the active conformation in complex with adenosine (A<sub>1</sub>R-ADO, active), the active conformation in complex with adenosine and heterotrimeric G<sub>i2</sub> proteins (ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2,</sub> active), the active conformation in complex with the heterotrimeric G<sub>i2</sub> proteins (A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2,</sub> active) and the active conformation in complex with adenosine, the MIPS521 positive allosteric modulator and heterotrimeric G<sub>i2</sub> proteins (PAM-ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2,</sub> active).

In the second stage, an unrestrained minimization including all atoms in the simulation cell was carried out. The minimized systems were gently heated in two phases. In the first phase, the temperature was increased from 0K to 100 K in a 40 ps step. Harmonic restraints of 10 kcal mol<sup>â1</sup> Ã<sup>â2</sup> were applied to the protein, ligand, and membrane.

In the second stage, an MD simulation of 5 ns under NPT ensemble at a simulation pressure of 1.0 bar was performed to relax the density of the system. The semi-isotropic pressure scaling using the Monte Carlo barostat was selected to control the simulation pressure.

After the systems were equilibrated in the NPT ensemble, we performed 3 independent MD production runs of 500 ns each (i.e. 1.5 Âµs accumulated time for each system). An 11 Ã cutoff value was applied to Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions. For the PAM-ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub> system, given that the MIPS521 PAM presents low binding affinity because it mostly performs weak interactions with the receptor, we applied a slight parabolic restrain with a force constant of 10 Kcal/(molÂ·Ã<sup>2</sup>) in the distance between S246(OH) and PAM(N).

During a metadynamics simulation, external energy quantities (Gaussian potentials) are added at a regular number of MD steps to a selected CVs (see above). This bias potential encourages the system to escape from local energy minima and overcome energy barriers, thus allowing for enhanced sampling of the CV conformational space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laio and Parrinello, 2002</xref>). After sufficient simulation time, the bias potential converges and the FEL can be reconstructed by summing the Gaussian potentials added to the CV values along the simulation time. Here, Gaussian potentials of height 0.5 kcal mol-1 and width of 0.25 (CV1) and 0.015 (CV2) were deposited every 2 ps of MD simulation at 303 K. For a smooth convergence of the bias potential, we used the well-tempered (WT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barducci et al., 2008</xref>) version of metadynamics algorithm, in which the height of the gaussian potentials were gradually decreased over time proportional to the potential deposited in the currently visited point of the CV space. A bias factor parameter of 10 was selected to control how quickly the Gaussian height is decreased. In addition, the multiple-walkers approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raiteri et al., 2006</xref>) was used to improve the conformational sampling and to speed up the metadynamics simulations. It is based on running in parallel interacting replicas (walkers) where each walker biases the identical CVs and reads the Gaussian potentials deposited by the others during the simulation, thus reconstructing the same metadynamics bias simultaneously. In particular, we run 10 walker replicas. The ten walker structures (W1-10) used as starting points for the walker metadynamics simulations were carefully selected from the initial conformational sampling of the cMD simulations. Specifically, we selected five walker structures (W1-5) from the cMD starting from the inactive X-Ray and five walker structures (W6-10) from the cMD starting from the active Cryo-EM in order to provide a path of conformations that encompasses the conformational states sampled along the A<sub>1</sub>R activation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Each walker replica was run for 25 ns, giving a total of 250 ns. Finally, the FEL of the TM6 inward-to-outward transition was completely reconstructed by summing the Gaussian potentials deposited by all walker replicas as a function of the CVs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Convergence</title><p>An indicator of convergence consists of observing that the free energy surface does not change significantly over time. We estimate the convergence of the recovered FEL for monitoring the free energy difference (ÎÎG) between the local energy minima of the activation conformational surface along the simulation time. In particular, we calculated the inactive-active, the inactive-intermediate, and the active-intermediate local energy minima differences (ÎÎG), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>. The metadynamics simulations were considered to be converged once we observed that with increasing simulation time, the energy differences between the energy minima tend to flatten. In other words, once the free energy surface does not change significantly during a relatively long period of time in the last part of the simulation. We have also assessed convergence by analyzing the CV1 values over simulation time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref> shows that during the first 100 ns, walkers primarily oscillate around their initial CV1 values. Subsequently, at around 200 ns walkers exhibit a higher frequency of crossing into regions occupied by other walkers. This is further supported by the exploration of W1 and W10, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B</xref>. These two walkers initially start the landscape reconstruction at the opposite extremes of the CV space. At 120 ns, they are able to escape from their respective basins and approach each other, sampling similar CV values (at approximately 240 ns). At this point of the simulation, only these two walkers have covered the entire conformational space of activation. Subsequently, they tend to return to previously sampled CV space. The observation that walkers do not become trapped in their initial CVs region, but instead explore and cross into other regions suggests that our sampling strategy, which involved starting the simulations with walkers that spanned the entire CV space of interest, has facilitated the exploration of the relevant conformational space. Although we cannot guarantee full convergence of the free energy landscape under these conditions, we successfully reconstructed the major conformational states of the receptor activation at 250 ns.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Error</title><p>We estimated the error on the 2D free energy landscape of the first collective variable (CV1), which is the TM3-TM6 intracellular ends distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>) using the block averaging technique, as described in the PLUMED tutorial on calculating error bars (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.8/user-doc/html/lugano-4.html">https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.8/user-doc/html/lugano-4.html</ext-link>).

Specifically, we calculate the error using blocks of histograms of 25 ns each, covering the entire 250 ns simulation time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein energy networks (PEN) analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Mean interaction energy matrix (IEM)</title><p>The get Residue Interaction eNergies and Networks (gRINN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">SerÃ§inoÄlu and Ozbek, 2018</xref>) tool was used to calculate the pairwise residue interaction energies along the different conformational ensembles in order to obtain their respective mean interaction energy matrixes (IEM). The analysis was performed considering all residue pairs of A<sub>1</sub>R, which resulted in 326x326 matrixes. For the complete A<sub>1</sub>R conformational ensemble, we used one out of two conformations sampled in the metadynamics simulations resulting in 6,250 structures. For the analysis by conformational states, we split the whole conformational ensemble obtained from metadynamics simulations (12,500 structures) into the inactive, intermediate, and pre-active ensembles, resulting in 3,648 structures for the inactive ensemble, 3,896 structures for the intermediate ensemble and 4,404 structures for the pre-active ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The analysis of the multimeric complexes (ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub>, and PAM-ADO-A<sub>1</sub>R-G<sub>i2</sub>) was performed using 5,000 representative structures from the cMD. For this case, we consider both the intra (A<sub>1</sub>R-A<sub>1</sub>R) and inter (A<sub>1</sub>R-GÎ±<sub>i2</sub>) residue pairs of interactions. In all matrixes, the positive energies (repulsive interactions) were set to 0 and the negative energies (attractive interactions) were converted to absolute values. In the second step, the matrixes were normalized. Hence, the attractive interactions were weighted containing values that range between 0 and 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Shortest Path Map</title><p>To study the allosteric communication by means of PEN, we processed the normalized mean IEM into to Shortest Path Map (SPM) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maria-Solano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romero-Rivera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osuna, 2021</xref>). The SPM algorithm first constructs a network graph in which only the pair of residues with a normalized mean interaction energy (IE) higher than 0.1 are considered nodes. The length of the edge connecting the pair of residues (nodes) is drawn according to their normalized mean IE value (d<sub>ij</sub>=-log |IE<sub>ij</sub>|). Thus, higher normalized mean IE values (closer to 1) will have shorter edge distances, whereas lower normalized mean IE values (closer to 0.1) will have edges with long distances. At this point, we apply the Dijkstra algorithm to identify the shortest path lengths and generate the SPM graph. The Dijkstra algorithm operates through all nodes of the initial network graph and determines the shortest path to go from one node origin to all other nodes. The exploration is over when all nodes have been targeted as origin. In the SPM graph, the width of each edge and the size of each node are proportional to the number of shortest paths passing through that edge or node during the exploration. The method, therefore, offers the visualization of which nodes and edges are more frequently used for going through all residues of the protein, that is they are more central and significant for the communication pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Transient pocket analysis</title><p>The MDpocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidtke et al., 2011</xref>) tool was used to detect transient pockets in the inactive, intermediate, pre-active, and fully-active ensembles. MDpocket is a fast geometry-based algorithm that relies on the concept of alpha spheres and makes extensive use of Voronoi tessellation during cavity detection. The output provides a normalized frequency map allowing for an iso-surface representation. In the frequency map, the iso-values (Î¦i) range from 0 to 1, allowing for visualization of both permanent (Î¦i=1) and transient pockets (0&lt; Î¦i&lt;1). Since we were interested in the detection of transient pockets along the receptor activation we used a Î¦i=0.2 iso-value for the display of pockets in all conformational ensembles studied.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Transient pockets location and containing PEN residues in all conformational states.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90773-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90773-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All the Mean Interaction energy matrixes (IEMs) computed have been deposited on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/biochem0904/A1R-ENetDyna">https://github.com/biochem0904/A1R-ENetDyna</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biochem0904, 2023</xref>), which will allow users to perform customized analysis of the protein energy networks.

This is done by focusing on the allosteric signaling pathways in different activation states, from inactive to active states via intermediate and pre-active ones, as well as the characterization of putative drug-binding pockets. The long-term objectives are to eventually be able to aid drug discovery efforts for this therapeutically important</p><p>GPCR.</p><p>Key findings and major conclusions:</p><p>Conventional MD does not enable the sampling of the complete conformational landscape of receptor activation. Instead, enhanced sampling MD simulations are required to achieve this. Using metadynamics, the authors decipher the activation pathway of A1R, decode the allosteric networks and identify transient pockets. The protein energy networks computed throughout the inactive, intermediate active, pre-active and active conformational states unravel the extra and intracellular allosteric centers and the communication pathways that couple them, whereby the pathways are reinforced in the activated state. These conformations primarily differ in the dynamics of the ionic lock motif that couples TM3 to TM6 in the inactive conformation and reveal that G-proteins are required to fully stabilize the active conformation. Support for these findings comes from prior mutagenesis work on the A1R that identified key allosteric residues that in many cases map to identified communication nodes. Finally, the authors identified allosteric pockets throughout the A1R in four different conformational states that support prior experimental and MD studies on the mechanism of the positive allosteric modulator MIPS521 and which could be targeted for the design of new modulators. This indicates how energy networks are enhanced and redistributed by allosteric modulators and how this might explain their effect on receptor activity. Overall, these findings provide complementary support to a structure-based mechanism of activation and allosteric modulation of A1R, and extend the findings to incorporate dynamics across the full activation pathway.</p><p>The perceived strengths and weaknesses:</p><p>This preprint employs a combination of computational techniques to successfully reconstruct and analyze the conformational ensemble of the A1R activation. The metadynamics simulations supported the aim of the study, the results are clearly presented, and the work is very well written. The authors provide a valuable discussion of how the protein energy network analysis can contribute to the rational design of specific A1R modulators with desired mode of action. The employed computational approach does not capture communication pathways that involve water-mediated connections or interactions between ligands and residues. Moreover, full convergence of the free energy landscapes is not guaranteed. Overall, A1R is a good choice as the target for this study as there is existing structural and pharmacological data to support preliminary findings. Moreover, the framework presented herein could be adapted and scaled to other GPCRs with structural templates, which might enable comparison of allosteric pathways across families and classes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
