these canonical sites are equally effective, and both computational and in vivo UV-crosslinking approaches suggest that many mRNAs are targeted through non-canonical interactions. Here, we show that recently reported non-canonical sites do not mediate repression despite binding the miRNA, which indicates that the vast majority of functional sites are canonical. Accordingly, we developed an improved quantitative model of canonical targeting, using a compendium of experimental datasets that we pre-processed to minimize confounding biases. This model, which considers site type and another 14 features to predict the most effectively targeted mRNAs, performed significantly better than existing models and was as informative as the best high-throughput in vivo crosslinking approaches. It drives the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05005.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are built by using the information contained in molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA). Cells have several ways of controlling the amounts of different proteins they make. For example, a so-called ‘microRNA’ molecule can bind to an mRNA molecule to cause it to be more rapidly degraded and less efficiently used, thereby reducing the amount of protein built from that mRNA. Indeed, microRNAs are thought to help control the amount of protein made from most human genes, and biologists are working to predict the amount of control imparted by each microRNA on each of its mRNA targets.</p><p>All RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of bases, each commonly known by a single letter—‘A’, ‘U’, ‘C’ or ‘G’. These bases can each pair up with one specific other base—‘A’ pairs with ‘U’, and ‘C’ pairs with ‘G’. To direct the repression of an mRNA molecule, a region of the microRNA known as a ‘seed’ binds to a complementary sequence in the target mRNA. ‘Canonical sites’ are regions in the mRNA that contain the exact sequence of partner bases for the bases in the microRNA seed. Some canonical sites are more effective at mRNA control than others. ‘Non-canonical sites’ also exist in which the pairing between the microRNA seed and mRNA does not completely match. Previous work has suggested that many non-canonical sites can also control mRNA degradation and usage.</p><p>Agarwal et al. first used large experimental datasets from many sources to investigate microRNA activity in more detail. As expected, when mRNAs had canonical sites that matched the microRNA, mRNA levels and usage tended to drop. However, no effect was observed when the mRNAs only had recently identified non-canonical sites. This suggests that microRNAs primarily bind to canonical sites to control protein production.</p><p>Based on these results, Agarwal et al. further developed a statistical model that predicts the effects of microRNAs binding to canonical sites. The updated model considers 14 different features of the microRNA, microRNA site, or mRNA—including the mRNA sequence around the site—to predict which sites within mRNAs are most effectively targeted by microRNAs. Tests showed that Agarwal et al.'s model was as good as experimental approaches at identifying the effective target sites, and was better than existing computational models.</p><p>The model has been used to power the latest version of a freely available resource called TargetScan, and so could prove a valuable resource for researchers investigating the many important roles of microRNAs in controlling protein production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05005.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>miRNA targets</kwd><kwd>miRNA-binding sites</kwd><kwd>miRNA target prediction</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agarwal</surname><given-names>Vikram</given-names></name><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>George W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>Jin-Wu</given-names></name><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agarwal</surname><given-names>Vikram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many experimentally identified microRNA-binding sites are ineffective at mediating repression, and an improved quantitative model for predicting the effective sites is as informative as high-throughput experimental approaches.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22-nt RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartel, 2004</xref>). Bound with an Argonaute protein to form a silencing complex, miRNAs function as sequence-specific guides, directing the silencing complex to transcripts, primarily through Watson–Crick pairing between the miRNA seed (miRNA nucleotides 2–7) and complementary sites within the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>). The miRNAs conserved to fish have been grouped into 87 families, each with a unique seed region. On average, each of these families has &gt;400 conserved targeting interactions, and together these interactions involve most mammalian mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, many nonconserved interactions also function to reduce mRNA levels and protein output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Farh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Krutzfeldt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Lim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib228">Selbach et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, miRNAs have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes in worms, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Bushati and Cohen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib233">Stefani and Slack, 2008</xref>). Critical for understanding miRNA biology is the accurate prediction of miRNA–target interactions. Although numerous advances have been made, accurate and specific target predictions remain a challenge.</p><p>Analysis of preferentially conserved miRNA-pairing motifs within 3′ UTRs has led to the identification of several classes of target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>). The most effective canonical site types, listed in order of decreasing preferential conservation and efficacy, are the 8mer site (Watson–Crick match to miRNA positions 2–8 with an A opposite position 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>]), 7mer-m8 site (position 2–8 match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Krek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>]), and 7mer-A1 site (position 2–7 match with an A opposite position 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>]). Experiments have confirmed that the preference for an adenosine opposite position 1 is independent of the miRNA nucleotide identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baek et al., 2008</xref>) and due to the specific recognition of the target adenosine within a binding pocket of Argonaute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib226">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). Two other canonical site types, each associated with weaker preferential conservation and much lower efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>), are the 6mer (position 2–7 match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>]) and offset-6mer (position 3–8 match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>]). Pairing to the 3′ end of the miRNA can supplement canonical sites, although evidence for the use of this 3′-supplementary pairing is observed for no more than 5% of the seed-matched sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Some effective sites lack canonical seed pairing. For example, very extensive pairing to the 3′ region of the miRNA can compensate for a wobble or mismatch to one of the seed positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Doench and Sharp, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>), as exemplified by the two <italic>let-7</italic> sites within the 3′ UTR of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>). Although these 3′-supplementary sites can be detected above background when searching for preferentially conserved pairing configurations, they are exceedingly rare, with conserved miRNA families in mammals and nematodes each averaging &lt;1 preferentially conserved 3′-supplementary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). Other relatively rare, yet effective sites include centered sites, which have 11–12 contiguous Watson–Crick pairs to the center of the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), and cleavage sites, which have the very extensive pairing required for Argonaute-catalyzed slicing of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib250">Yekta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). The existence of additional, still-to-be-characterized types of non-canonical sites is suggested by the large number of mRNA regions that crosslink to the silencing complex in vivo yet lack known site types matching the cognate miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Chi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Khorshid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>With the prediction of hundreds of conserved targets for most mammalian miRNAs (and even more nonconserved targets), knowing which targets are expected to be most responsive to each miRNA provides important information for both large-scale network analyses and detailed experimental follow-up. As previously mentioned, the type of site (e.g., whether the site is an 8mer or a 7mer-A1) strongly influences the efficacy of repression. The number of sites also influences efficacy, with each additional site typically acting independently to impart additional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), although sites between 8–40 nt of each other tend to act cooperatively, and those &lt; 8 nt of each other act competitively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>). Additional features of site context help explain why a given site (e.g., a 7mer-m8 site to miR-1) can be more effective in one 3′ UTR than it is in another. These features include the positioning of the site outside of the path of the ribosome (which includes the first 15 nt of the 3′ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>]) and the positioning of the site within 3′-UTR segments that are more accessible to the silencing complex, as measured by either high local AU content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), high AU content of the entire 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Robins and Press, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hausser et al., 2009</xref>), shorter distance from a 3′-UTR terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gaidatzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib188">Majoros and Ohler, 2007</xref>), shorter 3′-UTR length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hausser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Reczko et al., 2012</xref>), or less stable predicted competing secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib220">Robins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Kertesz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib235">Tafer et al., 2008</xref>). Conserved sites are also more effective, in part because they tend to reside in more favorable contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). Features of the miRNA can also influence site efficacy, with sites being more effective if the miRNA has lower target-site abundance (TA) within the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arvey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>) and stronger predicted seed-pairing stability (SPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Multiple features can be considered together to build quantitative models of targeting efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Wang and El Naqa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Reczko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib242">Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Marin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Gumienny and Zavolan, 2015</xref>). Our recent model, called the context-plus (context+) model, considers the features of our original context scores (i.e., site type, 3′-supplementary pairing, local AU content, and distance from the closest 3′-UTR end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>]), plus two miRNA features (TA and SPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>]). Although the context+ model was trained using multiple regression on 74 high-throughput datasets, the features used to distinguish effective sites (the three features of the original context scores) were identified using only 11 datasets, implying that additional features might be identified through analysis of the additional datasets.</p><p>Here, we examined the function of non-canonical binding sites identified in recent studies and found that mRNAs with these sites are not more repressed than mRNAs without sites, despite compelling evidence that many of these noncanocial sites bind the silencing complex in vivo. This finding justified a focus on the statistical modeling of canonical, seed-matched sites within 3′ UTRs, which mediate the vast majority of repression that can be predicted with current methods. To this end, we pre-processed the 74 datasets to minimize confounding biases and then used stepwise regression to identify the most informative features from a large set of potential targeting features. This approach unbiasedly selected 14 features, which were combined to develop the context++ model of miRNA targeting efficacy. The context++ model was more predictive than any published model and at least as predictive as the most informative in vivo crosslinking approaches. As the engine powering the latest version of TargetScan (v7.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>), this model provides a valuable resource for placing the miRNAs of human, mouse, zebrafish, and other vertebrate species into their respective gene-regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inefficacy of recently reported non-canonical binding sites</title><p>Several high-throughput crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) approaches have been applied to identify sites that bind Argonaute in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>). These experiments all observe significant enrichment for cognate seed-matched sites in the vicinity of the crosslinks, which validates their ability to detect authentic sites. Despite this enrichment, some crosslinks do not correspond to canonical sites to the relevant miRNAs, raising the prospect that these results might reveal novel types of non-canonical binding that could mediate repression. Indeed, five studies have reported crosslinking to non-canonical binding sites proposed to mediate repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Chi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Khorshid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, another biochemical study has reported the identification of non-canonical sites without using any crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib236">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Reasoning that these experimental datasets might provide a resource for defining of novel types of sites to be used in target prediction, we re-examined the functionality of these sites in mediating target mRNA repression.</p><p>We first examined the efficacy of ‘nucleation-bulge’ sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Chi et al., 2012</xref>), which were identified from analysis of differential CLIP (dCLIP) results reporting the clusters that appear in the presence of miR-124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chi et al., 2009</xref>). Nucleation-bulge sites consist of 8 nt motifs paired to positions 2–8 of their cognate miRNA seed, with the nucleotide opposing position 6 protruding as a bulge but sharing Watson-Crick complementarity to miRNA position 6. Meta-analyses of miRNA and small-RNA transfection datasets revealed significant repression of mRNAs with the canonical site types but found no evidence for repression of mRNAs that contain nucleation-bulge sites but lack perfectly paired seed-matched sites in their 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Reasoning that the nucleation-bulge site might be only marginally effective, we examined the early zebrafish embryo with and without Dicer, analyzing the targeting by miR-430, the most highly expressed miRNA of the early embryo. Even in this system, one of the most sensitive systems for detecting the effects of targeting (where a robust repression is observed for mRNAs with only a single 6mer or offset-6mer sites to miR-430), we observed no evidence for repression of mRNAs with nucleation-bulge sites to miR-430 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Because the nucleation-bulge sites were originally identified and characterized as sites to miR-124, we next tried focusing on only miR-124–mediated repression. However, even in this more limited context, the mRNAs with nucleation-bulge sites were no more repressed than mRNAs without sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inefficacy of recently reported non-canonical sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Response of mRNAs to the loss of miRNAs, comparing mRNAs that contain either a canonical or nucleation-bulge site to miR-430 to those that do not contain a miR-430 site.

These four miRNA families were chosen because their predicted targets were the most responsive to knockdown of the 25 miRNAs. p values reflect the median p value (as evaluated by a K–S test) across 100 trials in which a no-site control cohort with matched 3′-UTR lengths was chosen for each site-containing distribution. Length-matched no-site controls were required for this analysis because longer 3′ UTRs had a greater chance of containing additional sites to at least one of the many miRNAs that were knocked down, and thus had a greater chance of being derepressed as a result of interactions otherwise not considered in the analysis. To populate each control cohort, 500 different no-site mRNAs were chosen, considering the 3′-UTR length of each site-containing mRNA and selecting (without replacement) control mRNAs from among the 10 no-site mRNAs with the most similar 3′-UTR lengths.

We considered chimera-supported non-canonical sites that mapped within 3′ UTRs and contained a single mismatch to the 6 nt seed of the miRNA. This set of sites mirrored that analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>), and excluded offset 6mers, which as a class was already known to mediate repression and exhibit preferential conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). Cohorts of control sites were generated such that for each chimera-supported site, each control cohort contained a single example of the identical 6 nt motif that was present in the indicated region (either an AGO cluster or 3′ UTR) but not supported by chimeric reads. To control for local background conservation and thereby avoid treating sites within slowly evolving 3′ UTRs the same as those within rapidly evolving 3′ UTRs, we used the binning procedure developed for calculating <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>); 3′ UTRs were partitioned into 10 conservation bins (based on the median BLS of the nucleotides of the human sequence), and control sites were randomly selected (with replacement) from 3′ UTRs in the same bin as the actual site. Control AGO clusters were collected as was done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>), using genome-wide data downloaded from clipz.unibas.ch and derived from multiple AGO PAR-CLIP experiments performed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Kishore et al., 2011</xref>). The union of AGO clusters for all experiments was computed and filtered for overlap with Ensembl-annotated 3′ UTRs, using the ‘merge’ and ‘intersectBED’ utilities, respectively, found in BEDTools v2.20.1 (parameter ‘-s’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib216">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Attribution of the conservation signal to the confounding effects of conserved regions. Considered are 1443 non-canonical chimera-supported sites selected as in (<bold>A</bold>) but including sites of all miRNA families. For each chimera-supported site, a <italic>z</italic> score was generated using the distribution of BLSs for 100 control sites chosen as in panel (<bold>A</bold>) from either AGO clusters or 3′ UTRs, as indicated. Each <italic>z</italic> score reflected how the conservation of the actual site differed from that of its controls. Compared are cumulative distributions of the <italic>z</italic> scores for sites of broadly conserved miRNAs and those of less conserved miRNAs, using the previously defined sets of broadly and less conserved miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). If the chimera-supported non-canonical sites were preferentially conserved because of their function in mediating repression, then sites of broadly conserved miRNAs would be expected to have a right-shifted distribution compared to sites of less conserved miRNAs. However, no significant difference was discerned between each pair of <italic>z</italic>-score distributions. The remainder of this legend outlines the rationale for the analysis of this panel. One way to reconcile the conservation signal observed in panel (<bold>A</bold>) with our conclusion that a large majority if not all of these sites bind miRNA but do not mediate repression is to consider the potentially confounding biochemical properties of conserved regions, which are illustrated by the observation that artificial siRNAs preferentially target sites that are evolutionarily conserved over those that are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). Because these siRNAs are not natural (and do not share a seed with conserved miRNAs) the evolutionary conservation of these preferred sites could not have arisen because they function to mediate sRNA-guided repression. Instead, some other function of these 3′-UTR regions, such as greater accessibility to RNA-binding factors, must explain their preferential conservation and also endow them with properties that favor sRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). To examine whether confounding properties of conserved 3′-UTR regions might similarly explain the elevated conservation of chimera-supported sites, we compared the <italic>z</italic> scores for sites bound by broadly conserved miRNAs (miRNAs in families conserved beyond mammals, as listed in TargetScan7) with those bound by less conserved miRNAs. MicroRNAs conserved among mammals but not more broadly were grouped with the less conserved miRNAs because canonical 6mer and 7mer sites to these miRNAs have no conservation signal above background, presumably because these miRNAs have not been present long enough for the number of preferentially conserved 6mer and 7mer sites to rise above the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>); we reasoned that the same would be true of non-canonical sites, to the extent that any are preferentially conserved. If the conservation signal observed in panel (<bold>A</bold>) were related to miRNA binding, we would have expected a difference between the scores for the sites of broadly and less conserved miRNAs. The lack of a significant difference supports the idea that chimera-supported non-canonical sites tend to be conserved for the same reason that functional sites to artificial siRNAs tend to be conserved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05005.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05005-fig1-figsupp5-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Another study examined the response of 32 mRNAs that lack canonical miR-155 sites yet crosslink to Argonaute in wild-type T cells but not T cells isolated from miR-155 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>). As previously observed, we found that the levels of these mRNAs tended to increase in T cells lacking miR-155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, a closer look at the distribution of mRNA fold changes between wild-type and knockout cells revealed a pattern not normally observed for mRNAs with a functional site type. As illustrated for the mRNAs with canonical sites (including those supported by CLIP), when a miRNA is knocked out, the cumulative distribution of fold changes for mRNAs with functional site types diverges most from the no-site distribution at the top of the curve, which represents the most strongly derepressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, for the mRNAs harboring non-canonical miR-155 sites, the distribution of fold changes converged with the no-site distribution at the top of the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), raising doubt as to whether non-canonical binding of these mRNAs mediates repression. To investigate these mRNAs further, we examined their response to the miR-155 loss in helper T cell subtypes 1 and 2 (T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2, respectively) and B cells, which are other lymphocytic cells in which significant derepression of miR-155 targets is observed in cells lacking miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib222">Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Eichhorn et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to mRNAs with canonical sites, the mRNAs with non-canonical sites showed no evidence of derepression in the knockout cells of each of these cell types, which reinforced the conclusion that non-canonical binding of miR-155 does not lead to repression of these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next probed the functionality of non-canonical interactions identified by CLASH (crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids), a high-throughput technique that generates miRNA–mRNA chimeras, which each identify a miRNA and the mRNA region that it binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>). As previously observed, mRNAs with CLASH-identified non-canonical interactions involving miR-92 tended to be slightly up-regulated upon knockdown of miR-92 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, a closer look at the mRNA fold-change distributions again revealed a pattern not typically observed for mRNAs with a functional site type, with convergence with the no-site distribution in the region expected to be most divergent. Therefore, we examined a second dataset monitoring mRNA changes after knocking down miR-92 and other miRNAs in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). As reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib246">Wang, 2014</xref>), the slight up-regulation observed for mRNAs with CLASH-identified non-canonical interactions in the original dataset was not reproducible in the second dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, mRNAs with non-canonical interactions to other miRNAs showed no sign of derepression when the cognate miRNAs were knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To mirror the original analyses of CLASH-identified interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>), our analyses included sites located in any region of the mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). No significant difference from the no-site control distribution was observed when restricting our analysis to mRNAs with CLASH-identified non-canonical sites in their 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Many miRNA–mRNA chimeras can also be found in standard AGO CLIP datasets, presumably generated by an endogenous ligase acting in cell lysates during workup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>). Global experiments examining function of these interactions group the mRNAs with non-canonical interactions together with those with canonical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>), and thus the signal for function might arise from only canonical interactions. Indeed, when we re-examined the response of these mRNAs to miRNA knockdown, those with chimera-identified canonical sites tended to be derepressed, whereas those with only chimera-identified non-canonical sites did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–E</xref>). Although at first glance this finding might seem at odds with the elevated evolutionary conservation of chimera-identified non-canonical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>), we found that this conservation signal was not smaller for the sites of less conserved miRNAs and therefore was not indicative of functional miRNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Instead, the reported conservation signal might occur for the same reason that artificial siRNAs tend to target conserved regions of 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated the response of non-canonical sites modeled by MIRZA, an algorithm that utilizes CLIP data in conjunction with a biophysical model to predict target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Khorshid et al., 2013</xref>). As noted by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Majoros et al., 2013</xref>), the definition of non-canonical MIRZA sites was more expansive than that used elsewhere and did not exclude sites with canonical 6mer or offset-6mer seed matches. Indeed, when focusing on only targets without 6mer or offset-6mer seed matches, the top 100 non-canonical MIRZA targets showed no sign of efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined non-canonical clusters identified by IMPACT-seq (identification of miRNA-responsive elements by pull-down and alignment of captive transcripts—sequencing), a method that sequences mRNA fragments that co-purify with a biotinylated miRNA without crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib236">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Although the mRNAs with an IMPACT-seq–supported canonical site were down-regulated upon the transfection of the cognate miRNA, those with an IMPACT-seq–supported non-canonical site responded no differently than mRNAs lacking a site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the novel non-canonical sites recently identified in high-throughput CLIP and other biochemical studies imparted no detectable repression when monitoring mRNA changes. However, monitoring of only mRNA changes leaves open the possibility that these sites might still mediate translational repression. To address this possibility, we examined ribosome-profiling and proteomic datasets, which capture repression also occurring at the level of translation, and again we found that the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites imparted no detectable repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>All of our analyses of experimentally identified non-canonical sites examined the ability of the sites to act in mRNAs that had no seed-matched site to the same miRNA in their 3′ UTRs. Any non-canonical site found in a 3′ UTR that also had a seed-matched site to the same miRNA was not considered because any response could be attributed to the canonical site. At first glance, excluding these co-occurring sites might seem to allow for the possibility that the experimentally identified non-canonical sites could contribute to repression when in the same 3′ UTR as a canonical site, even though they are ineffective in 3′ UTRs without canonical sites. However, in mammals, canonical sites to the same miRNA typically act independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), and we have no reason to think that non-canonical sites would behave differently. More importantly, although the non-canonical sites examined were in mRNAs that had no seed-matched 3′-UTR site to the same miRNA, most were in mRNAs that had seed-matched 3′-UTR sites to other miRNAs that were highly expressed in the cells. Therefore, even if the non-canonical sites could only function when coupled to a canonical site, we still would have observed a signal for their function in our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Confirmation that miRNAs bind to non-canonical sites despite their inefficacy</title><p>The inefficacy of recently reported non-canonical sites was surprising when considering evidence that the dCLIP clusters without cognate seed matches are nonetheless enriched for imperfect pairing to the miRNA, which would not be expected if those clusters were merely non-specific background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Chi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, our analysis of motifs within the dCLIP clusters for miR-124 and miR-155 confirmed that those without a canonical site to the miRNA were enriched for miRNA pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Repeating this analysis, but focusing on only interactions without canonical sites, confirmed this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Applying this type of analysis to non-canonical interactions identified from miRNA–mRNA chimeras in standard AGO CLIP datasets confirmed that these interactions are also enriched for pairing to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>). As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>), these interactions were more specific to the seed region than were the CLASH-identified interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparison of all the chimera data with all the CLASH data showed that a higher fraction of the chimeras captured canonical interactions and that a higher fraction captured interactions within 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results, implying that the chimera approach is more effective than CLASH at capturing functional sites that mediate repression, motivated a closer look at the chimera-identified interactions that lacked a canonical site, despite our finding that these interactions do not mediate repression. In the human and nematode datasets (and less so in the mouse dataset), these interactions were enriched for motifs that corresponded to non-canonical sites that paired to the miRNA seed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Inspection of these motifs revealed that the most enriched nucleotides typically preserved Watson–Crick pairing in a core 4–5 nts within the seed region, with tolerance to mismatches or G:U wobbles observed at varied positions, depending on the miRNA, potentially reflecting seed-specific structural or energetic features, or perhaps context-dependent biases in crosslinking or ligation.</p><p>Motifs for only a few miRNAs had a bulged nucleotide, and if a bulge was observed it was in the mRNA strand and not in the miRNA strand, as expected if the Argonaute protein imposed geometric constraints in the seed of the miRNA. The miR-124 nucleation-bulge site was enriched in mouse chimera interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), as it had been in the human and mouse dCLIP clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Chi et al., 2012</xref>). However, despite identification of this miR-124 interaction in datasets from two methods and two species, this style of bulged pairing was not detected for any other miRNA. Interestingly, for all other cases in which a bulge in the recognition motif was observed (human miR-33 and miR-374, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> miR-50 and miR-58), the bulge was between the nucleotides that paired to miRNA nucleotides 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A bulge is observed between the analogous nucleotides of validated targets of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> miR398 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Jones-Rhoades and Bartel, 2004</xref>), whereas single-nucleotide bulges between other seed-pairing positions have not been reported in other validated plant targets. A bulge between these nucleotides is also observed in the first <italic>let-7</italic> site in the <italic>C. elegans lin-41</italic> 3′ UTR, one of the archetypal 3′-compensatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib218">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the most tolerated bulge in miRNA seed pairing is between the target nucleotides that pair to miRNA nucleotides 4 and 5.</p><p>Some motifs, particularly the more degenerate ones, were found in most of the interactions, whereas other motifs were found in only a small minority (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We suspect that many of the interactions lacking the top-scoring motifs also involve non-canonical binding sites, some of which might function through degenerate versions of the motif that happened to have scored highest in the MEME analysis. Nonetheless, some interactions or CLIP clusters lacking the top-scoring motifs might represent background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014</xref>), and indeed a few with the motif or even with a canonical site might represent background.</p><p>In sum, our analyses of the CLIP datasets confirmed that many of the CLIP clusters and CLASH/chimera interactions lacking a seed match nonetheless capture authentic miRNA-binding sites—otherwise the top enriched motifs would not pair so often to the cognate miRNA. Despite this ability to bind the miRNA in vivo and to function in the sense that they contribute to cellular TA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>), we classify the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites as non-functional with respect to repression because they showed no sign of mediating repression and no signal for miRNA-dependent conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–5</xref>). Thus, the only known non-canonical site types that mediate repression are the 3′-supplementary, centered, and cleavage site types, which together comprise &lt;1% of the effective sites that currently can be predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that additional types of functional non-canonical sites might exist but have not yet been characterized to the point that they can be used for miRNA target prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Lal et al., 2009</xref>), our analysis of the CLIP results justified a focus on the abundant site types that are predictive of targeting and are at least marginally functional, that is, the canonical seed-matched sites, including 6mer and offset-6mer sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Improving dataset quality for model development</title><p>To identify features involved in mammalian miRNA targeting, we analyzed the results of microarray datasets reporting the mRNA changes after transfecting either a miRNA or siRNA (together referred to as small RNAs, abbreviated as sRNAs) into HeLa cells.

Indeed, when considering mRNAs without a canonical site to the transfected sRNA, we found that 3′-UTR AU content often correlated with mRNA fold changes. Moreover, the extent and direction of the correlation was similar for different datasets from the same publication but differed when comparing to datasets from other publications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A second parameter that helped explain the correlated sRNA-independent effects for related datasets was 3′-UTR length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib223">Saito and Satrom, 2012</xref>), which exhibited patterns of correlation similar to those observed for 3′-UTR AU content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Our observation that AU content and 3′-UTR length correlated so differently with global expression changes when comparing results from different publications helps explain why different 3′-UTR features previously seemed to have such variable predictive power in different experimental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hausser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Gumienny and Zavolan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another phenomenon known to systematically perturb the levels of mRNAs without sites to the transfected sRNA is the derepression of mRNAs with sites for endogenous miRNAs, presumably through competition between the transfected sRNA and the endogenous miRNAs for limiting components of the silencing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib223">Saito and Satrom, 2012</xref>). Statistically significant derepression was indeed observed for mRNAs with sites to eight of the 10 miRNA families most frequently sequenced in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>To correct for biases that were independent of the sequence of the introduced sRNA, we used partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to estimate—for each transfection experiment—the component of the transcriptome response that was similar in other highly correlated experiments, and we then subtracted this estimate from the observed response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Applying our technique to all the mRNAs in each of the 74 datasets largely eliminated the correlations observed between datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), as well as the correlations observed between mRNA fold changes and either AU content or 3′-UTR length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which lowered the risk that these effects that are independent of the sRNA sequence would confound subsequent analyses of sRNA targeting efficacy. Moreover, our technique eliminated the signal for derepression of endogenous miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that it did the same for any other biases unrelated to the sequence of the transfected sRNA that have yet to be identified. Reducing these biases substantially reduced the variance in the response for mRNAs without sites to the sRNA, which substantially enhanced the net signal for sRNA-mediated repression of site-containing mRNAs observed in individual arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and all arrays in aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies of miRNA targeting have relied on 3′-UTR annotations from databases such as RefSeq, without accounting for abundant alternative 3′-UTR isoforms present in the tissue or cell line of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib238">Tian et al., 2005</xref>). The presence of more than one abundant 3′-UTR isoform for a gene would confound interpretation of 3′-UTR-related features, such as 3′-UTR length, or distance from the closest 3′-UTR end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the shorter 3′-UTR isoforms might not include some target sites, which would cause these sites to appear ineffective when in fact they are not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib224">Sandberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Lianoglou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>).

Prior to use, our <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores were updated to take advantage of improvements in both mouse and human 3′-UTR annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Flicek et al., 2014</xref>), the additional sequenced vertebrate genomes aligned to the mouse and human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Karolchik et al., 2014</xref>), and our expanded set of miRNA families broadly conserved among vertebrate species, which increased from 87 to 111 families (with the 111 including 16 isomiR families, that is, cases in which a second or third miRNA was produced from a pri-miRNA hairpin, through either conserved expression of miRNAs from both arms of the hairpin or conserved 5′ heterogeneity). Using these updates increased sensitivity, with our estimate for the number of human 3′-UTR sites conserved above background increasing from ∼46,400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>) to ∼62,300. The <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> score on its own correlates with site efficacy, and when using the same set of 3′ UTRs this correlation increased only modestly for the new scores (data not shown), consistent with the notion that the evolutionary signal was already nearly saturated in the previous analysis of 23 species spanning the vertebrate tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, we used our updated <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> score as a feature for sites of broadly conserved miRNAs within our training set.</p><p>A second feature that we re-evaluated was the predicted structural accessibility of the site. As scored previously, the degree to which the site nucleotides were predicted to be free of pairing to flanking 3′-UTR regions was not informative after controlling for the contribution of local AU content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>). However, analysis inspired by work on siRNA site accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib235">Tafer et al., 2008</xref>) suggested an improved scoring scheme for this feature. For this analysis we used RNAplfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bernhart et al., 2006</xref>) to predict the unpaired probabilities for variable-sized windows in the proximity of the site and then examined the relationship between these probabilities and the repression associated with sites in our compendium of normalized datasets, while controlling for local AU content and other features of the context+ model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on these results, which resembled those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib235">Tafer et al., 2008</xref>), we scored predicted structural accessibility (SA) as proportional to the log<sub>10</sub> value of the unpaired probability for a 14-nt region centered on the match to miRNA nucleotides 7 and 8.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Developing a regression model to predict miRNA targeting efficacy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optimizing the scoring of predicted structural accessibility.

This function uses stepwise regression to build models with increasing numbers of features until it reaches the optimal Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The AIC evaluates the tradeoff between the benefit of increasing the likelihood of the regression fit and the cost of increasing the complexity of the model by adding more variables. For each of the four seed-matched site types, models were built for 1000 samples of the dataset. Each sample included 70% of the mRNAs with single sites to the transfected sRNA from each experiment (randomly selected without replacement), reserving the remaining 30% as a test set. Compared to our context-only and context+ models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>), the new stepwise regression models were significantly better at predicting site efficacy when evaluated using their corresponding held-out test sets, as illustrated for the each of four site types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Reasoning that features most predictive would be robustly selected, we focused on 14 features selected in nearly all 1000 bootstrap samples for at least two site types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These included all three features considered in our original context-only model (minimum distance from 3′-UTR ends, local AU composition and 3′-supplementary pairing), the two added in our context+ model (SPS and TA), as well as nine additional features (3′-UTR length, ORF length, predicted SA, the number of offset-6mer sites in the 3′ UTR and 8mer sites in the ORF, the nucleotide identity of position 8 of the target, the nucleotide identity of positions 1 and 8 of the sRNA, and site conservation). Other features were frequently selected for only one site type (e.g., ORF 7mer-A1 sites, ORF 7mer-m8 sites, and 5′-UTR length; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Presumably these and other features were not robustly selected because either their correlation with targeting efficacy was very weak (e.g., the 7 nt ORF sites) or they were strongly correlated to a more informative feature, such that they provided little additional value beyond that of the more informative feature (e.g., 3′-UTR AU content compared to the more informative feature, local AU content).</p><p>Using the 14 robustly selected features, we trained multiple linear regression models on all of the data. The resulting models, one for each of the four site types, were collectively called the context++ model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). For each feature, the sign of the coefficient indicated the nature of the relationship. For example, mRNAs with either longer ORFs or longer 3′ UTRs tended to be more resistant to repression (indicated by a positive coefficient), whereas mRNAs with either structurally accessible target sites or ORF 8mer sites tended to be more prone to repression (indicated by a negative coefficient). Based on the relative magnitudes of the regression coefficients, some newly incorporated features, such as 3′-UTR length, ORF length, and SA, contributed similarly to features previously incorporated in the context+ model, such as SPS, TA, and local AU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). New features with an intermediate level of influence included the number of ORF 8mer sites and site conservation as well as the presence of a 5′ G in the sRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the latter perhaps a consequence of differential sRNA loading efficiency. The weakest features included the sRNA and target position 8 identities as well as the number of offset-6mer sites. The identity of sRNA nucleotide 8 exhibited a complex pattern that was site-type dependent. Relative to a position-8 U in the sRNA, a position-8 C further decreased efficacy of sites with a mismatch at this position (6mer or 7mer-A1 sites), whereas a position-8 A had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, a position-8 C in the site also conferred decreased efficacy of 6mer and 7mer-A1 sites relative to a position-8 U in the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Allowing interaction terms when developing the model, including a term that captured the potential interplay between these positions, did not provide sufficient benefit to justify the more complex model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Improvement over previous methods</title><p>We compared the predictive performance of our context++ model to that of the most recent versions of 17 in silico tools for predicting miRNA targets, including AnTar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wen et al., 2011</xref>), DIANA-microT-CDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Reczko et al., 2012</xref>), ElMMo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Gaidatzis et al., 2007</xref>), MBSTAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2015</xref>), miRanda-MicroCosm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2008</xref>), miRmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib242">Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012</xref>), mirSVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betel et al., 2010</xref>), miRTarget2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib244">Wang and El Naqa, 2008</xref>), MIRZA-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Gumienny and Zavolan, 2015</xref>), PACCMIT-CDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Marin et al., 2013</xref>), PicTar2 implemented for predictions conserved through mammals, chicken, or fish (PicTarM, PicTarC, and PicTarF, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2012</xref>), PITA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Kertesz et al., 2007</xref>), RNA22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib194">Miranda et al., 2006</xref>), SVMicrO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), TargetRank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), and TargetSpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib234">Sturm et al., 2010</xref>); as well as successive versions of TargetScan, which offer context scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>), or context+ scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>) as options for ranking predictions (TargetScan5, TargetScan.P<sub>CT</sub>, or TargetScan6, respectively) for either all mRNAs with a canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR site (TargetScan.All) or those with only broadly conserved sites (TargetScan.Cons). To the best of our knowledge, algorithms excluded from the comparison either were not de novo prediction algorithms (relying on consensus techniques or experimental data), did not provide a pre-computed database of results, or lacked a numerical value (or ranking) of either target-prediction confidence or mRNA responsiveness. To test the performance of the included methods, we used the results of seven microarray datasets that each monitor mRNA changes after transfection of a conserved miRNA into HCT116 cells containing a hypomorphic mutant for Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Linsley et al., 2007</xref>). These datasets differ from those used during development and training of our model with respect to both the cell type and the identities of the sRNAs. To prevent our model from gaining an advantage over methods that used standard 3′-UTR annotations, we used RefSeq-annotated 3′ UTRs (rather than 3P-seq–supported annotations) to generate the context++ test-set predictions. For genes with multiple annotated 3′ UTRs we chose the longest isoform because the microarray probes of the test set often matched only this isoform. For each 3′ UTR containing multiple sites to the cognate miRNA, the context++ scores of individual sites were summed to generate the total context++ score to be used to rank that predicted target.</p><p>The number of potential miRNA–mRNA interactions considered by the different methods varied greatly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which reflected the varied strategies and priorities of these prediction efforts. Out of a concern for prediction specificity, many efforts only consider interactions involving 7–8 nt seed-matched sites. Accordingly, we first tested how well each of the methods predicted the repression of mRNAs with at least one canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The context++ model performed substantially better than the most predictive published model, which was TargetScan6.All.

For example, at the threshold of 4, the 28 predictions with the top scores were identified (an average of 4 predictions per miRNA, allowing miRNAs with more top scores to contribute more predictions), mRNA fold-change values from the cognate transfections were collected, and the median value was plotted. When the threshold exceeded the number of reported predictions, no value was plotted. Also plotted is the median mRNA fold change for all mRNAs with at least one cognate canonical 7–8 nt site in their 3′ UTR (dashed line; an average of 1366 mRNAs per miRNA), the median fold change for all mRNAs with at least one conserved cognate canonical 7–8 nt site in their 3′ UTR (dotted line; an average of 461 mRNAs per miRNA), and the 95% interval for the median fold change of randomly selected mRNAs, determined using 1000 resamplings (without replacement) at each cutoff (shading). Conserved sites were defined as in TargetScan6, with conservation cutoffs for each site type set at different branch-length scores (cutoffs of 0.8, 1.3, and 1.6 for 8mer, 7mer-m8, and 7mer-A1 sites, respectively).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05005.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05005.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05005-fig5-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.018</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Performance of miRNA prediction algorithms on the test set.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) This panel is as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, but shows the results for all algorithms evaluated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.

For example, the drop in performance observed between TargetScan.All and TargetScan.Cons illustrates the effect of limiting analysis to the more highly conserved sites. Nonetheless, the performance of TargetScan.Cons relative to other methods that consider relatively few sites shows that a signal can be observed in this assay even when a very limited number of interactions are scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), presumably because much of the functional targeting is through conserved interactions. Indeed, the performance of ElMMO and TargetScan.P<sub>CT</sub> illustrate what can be achieved by scoring just the extent of site conservation and no other parameter.</p><p>In an attempt to maximize prediction sensitivity, some efforts consider many interactions that lack a canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, all of these algorithms performed poorly in predicting the response of mRNAs lacking such sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The two algorithms achieving any semblance of prediction accuracy did so by predicting some of the canonical interactions with known marginal efficacy. These were DIANA-microT-CDS, which captured modest effects of canonical sites in ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Reczko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Marin et al., 2013</xref>), and the context++ model, which captured the modest effects of canonical 6mers in 3′ UTRs (as modified by the 14 features, which included offset 6mers and 8mer ORF sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The algorithms designed to identify many non-canonical sites performed much more poorly in this test (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.004), consistent with the idea that the vast majority of mRNAs without canonical sites either do not change in response to the miRNA or change in an unpredictable fashion as a secondary effect of introducing the miRNA.</p><p>Another way to evaluate the performance of targeting algorithms is to examine the repression of the top predicted targets. Compared to the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> test, this approach does not penalize efforts that either impose more stringent cutoffs to achieve higher prediction specificity or implement scoring schemes that are not designed to correlate directly with site efficacy. Perhaps most importantly, this approach aligns with the goals of a biologist considering the top-ranked predictions in an attempt to focus on those most likely to undergo substantial repression. When choosing an average of 16 predicted targets for each of the seven test-set miRNAs, we found that these top 112 predictions of the context++ model were significantly more repressed than the top predictions from earlier versions of TargetScan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and the top predictions of the other algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Despite the success of the context++ model, not all of the fold changes for its top predicted targets were negative; for the test set, the distribution of these fold changes intersected 0.0 at a cumulative fraction of 0.92, indicating that mRNAs for 8% of the top predictions increased rather than decreased with transfection of the cognate miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In principle, these mRNAs could still be authentic targets that are repressed in these cells but nonetheless had increased expression values because either experimental noise or secondary effects of introducing the miRNA overwhelmed the signal for miRNA-mediated repression. Alternatively, some or all of these mRNAs could be false-positive predictions. Because only half of the false-positive predictions would be expected to have positive fold changes in the presence of the miRNA, our best estimate of the upper limit on the false-positive predictions was 2 × 8%, or 16%, at this cutoff (for which an average of 16 top predictions per miRNA is considered). At the same cutoff, the distribution of fold changes for each of the previous algorithms intersected 0.0 at a cumulative fractions ranging from 0.50–0.88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which implied lower prediction specificity than that observed for the context++ model, with correspondingly higher estimates for the upper limits of false positives among their top predictions, ranging from 24–100%.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of top-ranked predictions more systematically, we examined median repression of the predicted targets over a broad spectrum of cutoffs, ranging from an average of 4–4096 predictions per miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Regardless of the cutoff, the top context++ predictions were the most repressed. The top predictions of most other algorithms were repressed significantly more than expected by chance, although the median repression of some (MBSTAR, RNA22, PACCMIT-CDS, and AnTarCLIP) did not exceed the median repression of all mRNAs with a canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Plotting average fold changes rather than median fold changes resulted in very similar relative performances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>After eliminating interactions that could involve canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR sites, the remaining top predictions were modestly repressed at best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The most repressed predicted targets without canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR sites were those of the context++ model, which scored predictions with canonical 6mer 3′-UTR sites. For algorithms designed to identify many non-canonical sites, the top predictions without 7–8 nt 3′-UTR sites were essentially unresponsive to the transfected miRNA, which indicated that if effective non-canonical sites for these seven miRNAs exist, they are not enriched among the top predictions of these algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Similar response of targets predicted from the model and the most informative CLIP experiments</title><p>We used our context++ model to overhaul the TargetScan predictions (as described in the next section), and as a third way of testing this model, we compared the performance of these TargetScan7 predictions with that of in vivo CLIP experiments. When doing this comparison we took care to evaluate sets of predictions that each were the same size as the cognate set of CLIP-supported targets, whereas some previous analyses compare expansive sets of computational predictions (e.g., all mRNAs with a 6mer site) to relatively small sets of biochemically supported predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Lipchina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Grosswendt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib236">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). mRNAs with expression signals approaching the array background were not considered. This exclusion was particularly important when comparing to CLIP results; CLIP can only evaluate mRNAs expressed in the cells, which would impart a trivial relative advantage if the computational predictions included targets that appeared unresponsive because they were expressed below the array background. The non-canonical CLIP-supported targets were also not considered, as we had already shown that they do not respond to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–4</xref>), and we did not want the inclusion of these easily recognized false positives to impart a disadvantage to CLIP. Regardless of the set of canonical CLIP-supported targets examined, we did not find a setting in which they responded significantly better than did the cohort of TargetScan7 predictions, and in some cases, the TargetScan7 predictions performed significantly better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–J</xref>). Similar results were observed when comparing the repression of our predictions to that of mRNAs identified biochemically without crosslinking, using either pulldown-seq or IMPACT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib236">Tan et al., 2014</xref>), again focusing on only mRNAs with canonical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>). Thus, for identifying consequential miRNA–target interactions, the TargetScan7 model is not only more convenient than experimental determination of binding sites, it is also at least as effective. The analogous conclusion was reached from analyses that used the context++ model without using the improved annotation and quantification of 3′-UTR isoforms (data not shown).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Response of predictions and mRNAs with experimentally supported canonical binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Comparison of the top TargetScan7 predicted targets to mRNAs with canonical sites identified from dCLIP in either HeLa cells with and without transfected miR-124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chi et al., 2009</xref>) or lymphocytes with and without miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>).

Examination of the mRNA fold-change distributions from the perspective of false positives revealed no advantage of the experimental approaches over our predictions. When compared to the less informative CLIP datasets, the TargetScan7 predictions included fewer mRNAs that increased, and when compared to the CLIP datasets that performed as well as the predictions, the TargetScan7 predictions included a comparable number of mRNAs that increased, implying that the TargetScan7 predictions had no more false-positive predictions than did the best experimental datasets.</p><p>Because some sets of canonical biochemically supported targets performed as well as their cohort of top TargetScan7 predictions, we considered the utility of focusing on mRNAs identified by both approaches. In each comparison, the set of mRNAs that were both canonical biochemically supported targets and within the cohort of top TargetScan7 predictions tended to be more responsive. However, these intersecting subsets included much fewer mRNAs than the original sets, and when compared to an equivalent number of top TargetScan7 predictions, each intersecting set performed no better than did its cohort of top TargetScan7 predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, considering the CLIP results to restrict the top predictions to a higher-confidence set is useful but not more useful than simply implementing a more stringent computational cutoff. Likewise, taking the union of the CLIP-supported targets and the cohort of predictions, rather than the intersection, did not generate a set of targets that was more responsive than an equivalent number of top TargetScan7 predictions (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The TargetScan database (v7.0)</title><p>As already mentioned, we used the context++ model to rank miRNA target predictions to be presented in version 7 of the TargetScan database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>), thereby making our results accessible to others working on miRNAs. For simplicity, we had developed the context++ model using mRNAs without abundant alternative 3′-UTR isoforms, and to make fair comparisons with the output of previous models, we had tested the context++ model using only the longest RefSeq-annotated isoform. Nevertheless, considering the usage of alternative 3′-UTR isoforms, which can influence both the presence and scoring of target sites, significantly improves the performance of miRNA targeting models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our overhaul of the TargetScan predictions incorporated both the context++ scores and current isoform information when ranking mRNAs with canonical 7–8 nt miRNA sites in their 3′ UTRs. The resulting improvements applied to the predictions centered on human, mouse, and zebrafish 3′ UTRs (TargetScanHuman, TargetScanMouse, and TargetScanFish, respectively); and by 3′-UTR homology, to the conserved and nonconserved predictions in chimp, rhesus, rat, cow, dog, opossum, chicken, and frog; as well as to the conserved predictions in 74 other sequenced vertebrate species, thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks.</p><p>Because the main gene-annotation databases (e.g., RefSeq and Ensembl/Gencode) are still in the process of incorporating the information available on 3′-UTR isoforms, the first step in the TargetScan overhaul was to compile a set of reference 3′ UTRs that represented the longest 3′-UTR isoforms for representative ORFs of human, mouse, and zebrafish. These representative ORFs were chosen among the set of transcript annotations sharing the same stop codon, with alternative last exons generating multiple representative ORFs per gene. The human and mouse databases started with Gencode annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>), for which 3′ UTRs were extended, when possible, using RefSeq annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Pruitt et al., 2012</xref>), recently identified long 3′-UTR isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib195">Miura et al., 2013</xref>), and 3P-seq clusters marking more distal cleavage and polyadenylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>). Zebrafish reference 3′ UTRs were similarly derived in a recent 3P-seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib241">Ulitsky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>For each of these reference 3′-UTR isoforms, 3P-seq datasets were used to quantify the relative abundance of tandem isoforms, thereby generating the isoform profiles needed to score features that vary with 3′-UTR length (len_3UTR, min_dist, and off6m) and assign a weight to the context++ score of each site, which accounted for the fraction of 3′-UTR molecules containing the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>).

This model performed better than previous models and at least as well as the best high-throughput CLIP approaches.</p><p>Because our model was trained on data derived from a single cell type, a potential concern was its generalizability to other cell types. Heightening this concern is the recent report of widespread dependency of miRNA-mediated repression on cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Erhard et al., 2014</xref>). However, other work addressing this question shows that after accounting for the different cellular repertoires of expressed mRNAs, the target response is remarkably consistent between different cell types, with alternative usage of 3′-UTR isoforms being the predominant mechanism shaping cell-type-specific differences in miRNA targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>). Testing the model across diverse cell types confirmed its generalizability; it performed at least as well as the best high-throughput CLIP approaches in each of the contexts examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Of course, this testing was restricted to only those predicted targets that were expressed in each cellular context. Likewise, to achieve this highest level of performance, any future use of our model or its predictions would also require filtering of the predictions to focus on only the miRNAs and mRNAs co-expressed in the cells of interest.</p><p>One of the more interesting features incorporated into the context++ model is SA (the predicted structural accessibility of the site). Freedom from occlusive mRNA structure has long been considered a site-efficacy determinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib220">Robins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ameres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Kertesz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib187">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib235">Tafer et al., 2008</xref>) and proposed as the underlying mechanistic explanation for the utility of other features, including global 3′-UTR AU content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Robins and Press, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hausser et al., 2009</xref>), local AU content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>), minimum distance of the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>), and 3′-UTR length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Hausser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib247">Wen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Reczko et al., 2012</xref>). The challenge has been to predict and score site accessibility in a way that is informative after controlling for local AU content, which is important for speaking to the importance of less occlusive secondary structure as opposed to involvement of some AU-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>). The selection of the SA feature in all 1000 bootstrap samples of all four site types showed that it provided discriminatory power apart from that provided by local AU content and other correlated features, which reinforced the idea that the occlusive RNA structure does indeed limit site efficacy. This being said, local AU content, minimum distance of the site, and 3′-UTR length were each also selected in nearly all 1000 bootstrap samples for most site types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which suggests that either these features were selected for reasons other than their correlation with site accessibility or the definition and scoring of our SA feature has additional room for improvement.</p><p>Our ability to confidently identify additional features that each contribute to improved prediction of targeting efficacy was enhanced by our pre-processing of the experimental datasets, which minimized variation from biases unrelated to the sRNA sequence. Yet despite applying this same normalization procedure to our test set, the observed <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.14 implied that our model explained only 14% of the variability observed among mRNAs with canonical 7–8 nt 3′-UTR sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value increased to 0.15 when considering the usage of alternative 3′-UTR isoforms, but 85% of the variability remained unexplained. Error in the microarray measurements, different sRNA transfection efficiencies, variable incorporation of sRNAs into the silencing complex, and secondary effects of introducing the sRNA presumably made major contributions to the unexplained variability. Nonetheless, imperfections of the context++ model also contributed, raising the question of how much the model might be improved by identifying additional features or developing better methods for scoring and combining existing features. In analyses not described, we evaluated the utility of other types of regression (e.g., linear regression models with interaction terms, lasso/elastic net-regularized regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest, boosted regression trees, and iterative Bayesian model averaging) and found their performance to be comparable to that of stepwise regression but their resulting models to be considerably more complex and thus less interpretable.</p><p>One way to evaluate the extent to which the context++ model might be improved is to consider the degree to which its performance depends on the site-conservation feature. Because sites under selective pressure preferentially possess molecular features required for efficacy, inclusion of the site-conservation feature indirectly recovers some of the information that would otherwise be lost when informative molecular features are missing or imperfectly scored. As more informative molecular features are identified and included in a model, less information remains to be captured, and thus the site-conservation feature cannot contribute as much to the performance of the model. The site-conservation feature (<italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub>) was chosen in all 1000 bootstrap samples of each of the three major site types, which showed that the molecular features of our model still do not fully capture all the determinants under selective pressure. However, <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> was not one of the most informative features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, when tested as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, a model trained on only site type and the other 13 molecular features performed nearly as well as the full context++ model (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of 0.126, compared to 0.139 for the full model). This drop in <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of only 0.013 was substantially less than the 0.044 <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> observed for the site-conservation feature on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, TargetScan.P<sub>CT</sub>), which suggested that when predicting the response of the test-set mRNAs with the major canonical site types, the context++ model captured 70% (calculated as [0.044–0.013]/0.044) of the information potentially imparted by molecular features.</p><p>The relatively minor contribution of site conservation highlights the ability of the context++ model to predict the efficacy of nonconserved sites. Although, everything else being equal, its score for a conserved site is slightly better than that for a nonconserved site, this difference does not prevent inclusion of nonconserved sites from the top predictions. Its general applicability to all canonical sites is useful for evaluating not only nonconserved sites to conserved miRNAs but also all sites for nonconserved miRNAs (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>), including viral miRNAs, as well as the off-targets of synthetic siRNAs and shRNAs.</p><p>Our analyses show that recent computational and experimental approaches, including the different types of CLIP, all fail to identify non-canonical targets that are repressed more than control transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">Figures 1, 5C,F</xref>), which reopens the question of whether more than a miniscule fraction of miRNA-mediated repression is mediated through non-canonical sites. Although CLIP approaches can identify non-canonical sites that bind the miRNA with some degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), these non-canonical binding sites do not function to mediate detectable repression. Thus far, the only functional non-canonical sites that can be predicted are 3′-compensatory sites, cleavage sites, and centered sites, which together comprise only a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of the functional sites that can be predicted with comparable accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). The failure of computational methods to find many functional non-canonical sites cannot rule out the possibility that many of these sites might still exist; if such sites are recognized through unimagined determinants, computational efforts might have missed them. CLIP approaches, on the other hand, provide information that is independent of proposed pairing rules or other hypothesized recognition determinants. Therefore, our analyses of the CLIP results, which detected no residual repression after accounting for canonical interactions, provide the most compelling evidence to date on this issue. Unless there is a substantial technical bias in the CLIP approach (such as a large unanticipated disparity in the propensity of non-canonical interactions to crosslink), the inability of current CLIP approaches to identify non-canonical targets that are repressed more than control transcripts argues strongly against the existence of many functional non-canonical targets.</p><p>Why might the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites fail to mediate repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) despite binding the miRNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)? Perhaps these sites are ineffective because perfect seed pairing is required for repression. For example, perfect seed pairing might favor binding of a downstream effector, either directly by contributing to its binding site or indirectly through an Argonaute conformational change that favors its binding. However, this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the activity of 3′-compensatory and centered sites, which can mediate repression despite their lack of perfect seed pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), and the activity of Argonaute artificially tethered to an mRNA, which can mediate repression without any pairing to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Pillai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Eulalio et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a more plausible explanation is that the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites bind the miRNA too transiently to mediate repression. This explanation for the inefficacy of the recently identified non-canonical sites in the 3′ UTRs resembles that previously proposed for the inefficacy of most canonical sites in ORFs: in both cases the ineffective sites bind to the miRNA very transiently—the canonical sites in ORFs dissociating quickly because of displacement by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), and the CLIP-identified non-canonical sites in 3′ UTRs dissociating quickly because they lack both seed pairing and the extensive pairing outside the seed characteristic of effective non-canonical sites (3′-compensatory and centered sites) and thus have intrinsically fast dissociation rates.</p><p>The idea that newly identified non-canonical sites bind the miRNA too transiently to mediate repression raises the question of how CLIP could have identified so many of these sites in the first place; shouldn't crosslinking be a function of site occupancy, and shouldn't occupancy be a function of dissociation rates? The answers to these questions partially hinge on the realization that the transcriptome has many more non-canonical binding sites than canonical ones. The motifs identified in the non-canonical interactions have information contents as low as 5.6 bits, and thus are much more common in 3′ UTRs than canonical 6mer or 7mer sites (12 bits and 14 bits, respectively). This high abundance of the non-canonical binding sites would help offset the low occupancy of individual non-canonical sites, such that at any moment more than half of the bound miRNA might reside at non-canonical sites, yielding more non-canonical than canonical sites when using experimental approaches with such high specificity that they can identify a site with only a single read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Although the high abundance of non-canonical sites partly explains why CLIP identifies these sites in such high numbers, it cannot provide the complete answer. Some non-canonical sites in the CLASH and chimera datasets are supported by multiple reads, and all the dCLIP-identified non-canonical sites of the miR-155 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>) are supported by multiple reads. How could some CLIP clusters with ineffective, non-canonical sites have as much read support as some with effective, canonical sites? Our answer to this question rests on the recognition that cluster read density does not perfectly correspond to site occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014</xref>), with the other key factors being mRNA expression levels and crosslinking efficiency. In principle, normalizing the CLIP tag numbers to the mRNA levels minimizes the first factor, preventing a low-occupancy site in a highly expressed mRNA from appearing as well supported as a high-occupancy site in a lowly expressed mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Jaskiewicz et al., 2012</xref>). Accounting for differential crosslinking efficiencies is a far greater challenge. RNA–protein UV crosslinking is expected to be highly sensitive to the identity, geometry, and environment of the crosslinking constituents, leading to the possibility that the crosslinking efficiency of some sites is orders of magnitude greater than that of others. When considered together with the high abundance of non-canonical sites, variable crosslinking efficiency might explain why so many ineffective non-canonical sites are identified. Overlaying a wide distribution of crosslinking efficiencies onto the many thousands of ineffective, non-canonical sites could yield a substantial number of sites at the high-efficiency tail of the distribution for which the tag support matches that of effective canonical sites. Similar conclusions are drawn for other types of RNA-binding interactions when comparing CLIP results with binding results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Lambert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Variable crosslinking efficiency also explains why many top predictions of the context++ model are missed by the CLIP methods, as indicated by the modest overlap in the CLIP identified targets and the top predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The crosslinking results are not only variable from site to site, which generates false negatives for perfectly functional sites, but they are also variable between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>), which imposes a challenge for assigning dCLIP clusters to a miRNA. Although this challenge is mitigated in the CLASH and chimera approaches, which provide unambiguous assignment of the miRNAs to the sites, the ligation step of these approaches occurs at low frequency and presumably introduces additional biases, as suggested by the different profile of non-canonical sites identified by the two approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For example, CLASH identifies non-canonical pairing to the 3′ region of miR-92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the chimera approach identified non-canonical pairing to the 5′ region of this same miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because of the false negatives and biases of the CLIP approaches, the context++ model, which has its own flaws, achieves an equal or better performance than the published CLIP studies.</p><p>Our observation that CLIP-identified non-canonical sites fail to mediate repression reasserts the primacy of canonical seed pairing for miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Compared to canonical sites, effective non-canonical sites (i.e., 3′-compensatory sites and centered sites) are rare because they require many more base pairs to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib229">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) and thus together make up &lt;1% of the effective target sites predicted to date. The requirement of so much additional pairing to make up for a single mismatch to the seed is proposed to arise from several sources. The advantage of propagating continuous pairing past miRNA nucleotide 8 (as occurs for centered sites) might be largely offset by the cost of an unfavorable conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib226">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, the advantage of resuming pairing at the miRNA 3′ region (as occurs for 3′-compensatory sites) might be partially offset by either the relative disorder of these nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartel, 2009</xref>) or their unfavorable arrangement prior to seed pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib226">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the seed backbone is pre-organized to favor A-form pairing, with bases of nucleotides 2–5 accessible to nucleate pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Nakanishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib225">Schirle and MacRae, 2012</xref>). Moreover, perfect pairing propagated through miRNA nucleotide 7 creates the opportunity for favorable contacts to the minor groove of the seed:target duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib226">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our overhaul of the TargetScan website integrated the output of the context++ model with the most current 3′-UTR-isoform data to provide any biologist with an interest in either a miRNA or a potential miRNA target convenient access to the predictions, with an option of downloading code or bulk output suitable for more global analyses. In our continuing efforts to improve the website, several additional functionalities will also soon be provided. To facilitate the exploration of co-targeting networks involving multiple miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib240">Tsang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Hausser and Zavolan, 2014</xref>), we will provide the option of ranking predictions based on the simultaneous action of several independent miRNA families, to which relative weights (e.g., accounting for relative miRNA expression levels or differential miRNA activity in a cell type of interest) can be optionally assigned. To offer predictions for transcripts not already in the TargetScan database (e.g., novel 3′ UTRs or long non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs), we will provide a mechanism to compute context++ scores interactively for a user-specified transcript. Likewise, to offer predictions for a novel sRNA sequence (e.g., off-target predictions for an siRNA), we will provide a mechanism to retrieve context++ scores interactively for a user-specified sRNA. To visualize the expression signature that results from perturbing a miRNA, we will provide a tool for the user to input mRNA/protein fold changes from high-throughput experiments and obtain a cumulative distribution plot showing the response of predicted targets relative to that of mRNAs without sites. Thus, with the current and future improvements to TargetScan, we hope to enhance the productivity of miRNA research and the understanding of this intriguing class of regulatory RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microarray, RNA-seq, and RPF dataset processing</title><p>A list of microarray, RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and proteomic datasets used for analyses, as well as the corresponding figures in which they were used, is provided (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

To perform this normalization, the number of tags overlapping the 3′ UTR of each annotated transcript was first summed. A matrix of summed tag counts for each cell line/tissue and for each transcript was then compiled, removing transcripts with no tags in any cell type. This matrix was then upper-quartile normalized by calculating the 75th quantile of counts in each cell type, using the calcNormFactors function (parameter ‘method = ‘upperquartile’’) in the ‘edgeR’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib221">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). These scaling factors were then applied to all tags, and the normalized tag counts corresponding to each 3P-seq cluster from different cell lines/tissues were summed. A pseudocount of 0.1 tag was assigned to the longest tandem 3′-UTR isoform, which accommodated cases in which the longest annotated 3′ UTR did not have tag support. In addition, 5 pseudocounts were assigned to the longest Gencode 3′-UTR isoform, which gave preference to this Gencode annotation if the UTR had poor 3P-seq coverage. The 3′-UTR profiles were then generated and used to compute the affected isoform ratio (AIR) and weighted context++ score for each predicted target site as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A, 3A</xref>, respectively, of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al. (2014)</xref>. For zebrafish transcripts, profiles were generated for each developmental stage with a 3P-seq dataset. All input and output annotation files as well as scripts are available for download at TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>MicroRNA sets for TargetScan7</title><p>When partitioning miRNA families according to their conservation level, we began with a high-confidence set of human miRNAs supported by small-RNA sequencing (T Tuschl, personal communication) that shared nucleotides 2–8 with a mouse miRNA supported by small-RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Chiang et al., 2010</xref>). We then extracted 100-way multiz alignments of each mature miRNA from the UCSC Genome Browser and counted the number of species for which nucleotides 2–8 of the miRNA did not change. As an initial pass, those conserved among ≥40 species were classified as mammalian conserved, and those conserved among &gt;60 species were classified as more broadly conserved among vertebrate species. Due to poorer quality alignments for more distantly related species, this procedure misclassified several more broadly conserved miRNAs as mammalian conserved. Therefore, mammalian conserved miRNAs that aligned with &gt;90% homology to a mature miRNA from chicken, frog, or zebrafish, as annotated in miRBase release 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>), were re-classified as more broadly conserved. In addition, miR-489 was included in the broadly conserved set of TargetScanHuman (but not TargetScanMouse) despite having a seed substitution in mouse.</p><p>Some mammalian pri-miRNAs give rise to two or three abundant miRNA isoforms that have different seeds, either because both strands of the miRNA duplex load into Argonaute with near-equal efficiencies or because processing heterogeneity gives rise to alternative 5′ termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azuma-Mukai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib196">Morin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib249">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Chiang et al., 2010</xref>). To annotate these abundant alternative isoforms, we identified all isoforms expressed at ≥33% of the level of the most abundant isoform, as determined from high-throughput sequencing (allowing for 3′ heterogeneity within each isoform). These isoforms were carried forward as mammalian conserved isoforms if they also satisfied this property in the mouse small-RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Chiang et al., 2010</xref>), and as broadly conserved isoforms if they satisfied this property in zebrafish small-RNA sequencing data available in miRBase release 21. Adhering to the miRNA naming convention, if two isoforms mapped to the 5′ and 3′ arms of the hairpin they were named ‘–5p’ and ‘–3p’, respectively, and if two isoforms were processed from the same arm they were named ‘.1’ and ‘.2’ in decreasing order of their abundance, as detected in the human.</p><p>All mature miRNAs were downloaded from miRBase release 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>). Those that matched a conserved miRNA at nucleotides 2–8 were considered part of that miRNA family. All miRNAs and miRNA isoforms annotated in miRBase but not meeting our criteria for conservation in mammals or beyond were also grouped into families based on the identity of nucleotides 2–8 and were classified as poorly conserved miRNAs (which included many small RNAs misclassified as miRNAs). The miRNA seed families and associated conservation classifications are available for download at TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>TargetScan7 predictions</title><p>TargetScan (v7.0) provides the option of ranking predicted targets of mammalian miRNAs according to either cumulative weighted context++ score (CWCS), which ranks based upon the predicted repression, or aggregate <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> score of the longest 3′-UTR isoform, which ranks based upon the confidence that targeting is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For each predicted target, the CWCS estimated the total repression expected from multiple sites to the same miRNA. This score was calculated using the 3′-UTR profiles to weight the marginal effect of each additional site to the miRNA while also taking into account the predicted mRNA depletion resulting from any downstream sites to the same miRNA. This approach was improved over that we used previously to calculate total wContext+ scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>), in that it did not over-estimate the aggregate effect of multiple sites in distal isoforms. For each miRNA family, 8mer, 7mer-m8, 7mer-A1, and 6mer sites were first filtered to remove overlapping sites, and for each reference 3′ UTR, nonoverlapping sites to the same miRNA were numbered from 1 to <italic>n</italic>, starting at the distal end of the 3′ UTR. For each site <italic>i</italic>, from 1 to <italic>n</italic>, the cumulative predicted repression at that site (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) was calculated as <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>C</italic><sub>(<italic>i</italic> − 1)</sub> + (1 − 2<sup><italic>CSi</italic></sup>)(AIR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> − C<sub>(<italic>i</italic> − 1)</sub>), in which <italic>CS</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and AIR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> were the context++ score and AIR of site <italic>i</italic>, and the (1 − 2<sup><italic>CSi</italic></sup>)(AIR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> − C<sub>(<italic>i</italic> − 1)</sub>) term predicted the marginal repression of site <italic>i</italic>, in which the predicted repression at the site (1 − 2<sup><italic>CSi</italic></sup>) was modified based on the fraction of mRNAs containing that site (AIR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) as reduced by the mRNA depletion predicted to occur from the action of any more distal sites (<italic>C</italic><sub>(<italic>i</italic> − 1)</sub>, assigning <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> as 0). The CWCS was then calculated as log<sub>2</sub>(1 − <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>), in which <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> was the <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> at the most proximal site of the reference 3′ UTR. For each reference 3′ UTR, CWCSs were calculated for each member of a miRNA family, and the score from the member with the greatest predicted repression was chosen to represent that family, and the reference 3′ UTR with the most 3P-seq tags was chosen to represent the gene.</p><p>When scoring features that can vary with 3′-UTR length (Min_dist, Len_3UTR, and Off6m), a weighted score was used that accounted for the abundance of each 3′-UTR tandem isoform in which the site existed, as estimated from a compendium of 3P-seq datasets from the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Nam et al., 2014</xref>). Although 6mer sites are used to calculate cumulative weighted context++ scores, and 6mer sites are tallied in the tables, the locations of these 6mer sites are not displayed, and targets with only 6mer sites are not listed. When calculating <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores, the most abundant 3′-UTR isoform as defined by 3P-seq was used to determine the conservation bin to which the 3′ UTR belonged. Sites corresponding to poorly conserved and mammalian-conserved miRNA seed families or sites overlapping annotated ORF regions were assigned <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores of zero. For TargetScanFish, genome-wide alignment quality in zebrafish 3′ UTRs was not of sufficient quality to compute <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores, so a <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> value of zero was assigned to all sites when computing context++ scores. All <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> parameters and parameters for tree branch lengths and regression models, along with pre-computed context++ scores for human, mouse, zebrafish, and other vertebrate species are available for download (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>). Perl scripts using these parameters to compute context++ scores, weighted context++ scores, CWCSs, and aggregate <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> scores are also provided (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org">targetscan.org</ext-link>). Predictions are also made for homologous 3′ UTRs of other vertebrate species, using either human-centric or mouse-centric 3′-UTR definitions and corresponding MSAs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Bioinformatics and Research Computing group at the Whitehead Institute (I Barrasa, B Yuan, Y Huang, and P Thiru) for help implementing improvements to the TargetScan website, A Subtelny for providing insight into positional effects of the miRNA seed, I Ulitsky for initial help with 3P-seq analysis, R Friedman for discussions regarding the computation of <italic>P</italic><sub>CT</sub> parameters, T Tuschl for sharing an unpublished list of the most frequently sequenced human miRNA isoforms, G Agarwal for discussions regarding normalization techniques, G Kudla for help processing the microarray data from the CLASH study, SW Chi and RB Darnell for confirmation of the mRNAs identified as miR-124 targets in their dCLIP study, O Rissland and J Guo for critical reading of the manuscript, and members of the Bartel lab for helpful discussions.

The authors show convincingly that non-canonical miRNA-mRNA interactions exist, but seem to be non-functional in repression of their target transcripts.....Using 14 selected features, multiple linear regression models were trained on the data. The derived context++ model outperforms the most recent versions of twelve in silico miRNA target prediction tools.</p><p>This manuscript is very timely and of interest to a broad scientific readership.”</p><p>“This manuscript represents an extraordinary tour de force and its implementation through TargetScan will be highly significant to the broad field of gene expression regulation and provides a valuable resource to the scientific community.”</p><p>The minor text changes suggested by the reviewers are:</p><p>The authors should cite the recent structural work on human Ago2 (Schirle et al. Science 2014) and discuss their findings in the context of this work, which supports canonical miRNA interactions.</p><p>In regards to context-dependency of miRNA interactions the authors should cite Erhard et al. Genome Research 2014.</p><p>In the third and fourth paragraphs of the subsection “Inefficacy of recently reported non-canonical binding sites”. How can the atypical shape of the curve be explained?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05005.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors should cite the recent structural work on human Ago2 (Schirle et al.
