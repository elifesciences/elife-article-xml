The non-mammalian dorsal pallium accommodates various compartmentalized structures among species. The developmental, functional, and evolutional diversity of the dorsal pallium remain unillustrated. Here, we analyzed the structure and epigenetic landscapes of cell lineages in the telencephalon of medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) that possesses a clearly delineated dorsal pallium (Dd2). We found that pallial anatomical regions, including Dd2, are formed by mutually exclusive clonal units, and that each pallium compartment exhibits a distinct epigenetic landscape. In particular, Dd2 possesses a unique open chromatin pattern that preferentially targets synaptic genes. Indeed, Dd2 shows a high density of synapses. Finally, we identified several transcription factors as candidate regulators. Taken together, we suggest that cell lineages are the basic components for the functional regionalization in the pallial anatomical compartments and that their changes have been the driving force for evolutionary diversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evo-devo</kwd><kwd>the telencephalon</kwd><kwd>medaka fish</kwd><kwd>cell lineages</kwd><kwd>ATAC-seq</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006324</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Basic Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIBB Collaborative Research Program 16-522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>Hideaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 16H06987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isoe</surname><given-names>Yasuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 16KT0072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>Hideaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 20K20303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamei</surname><given-names>Yasuhiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21K06013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas JP21H00245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006324</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Basic Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>Hideaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006324</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Basic Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeuchi</surname><given-names>Hideaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dorsal telencephalon (pallium) in medaka fish accommodates an epigenetically distinct brain area that selectively regulates unique set of synaptic genes compared to the surrounding pallial region, providing insights into the evolution of the pallium in vertebrate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The telencephalon is an essential brain part for an animal’s cognitive functions and is highly diverse in structure among vertebrates. The dorsal telencephalon, or the pallium, is divided into several distinct regions in mammals; for example, the cerebral neocortex in the mammalian dorsal pallium (MDP), the hippocampus in the mammalian medial pallium (MMP), and the basolateral amygdala in the mammalian lateral pallium (MLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briscoe and Ragsdale, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Northcutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). The MDP is characterized by a six-layered structure and by stereotypical projections from all sensory modalities. The non-mammalian dorsal pallium generally lacks a multilayered structure, with the exception of non-avian reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboitiz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aboitiz et al., 2003</xref>), but rather exhibits a compartmentalized architecture that is highly diverse across species. Little is known about how the anatomical diversity in the dorsal pallium has emerged during evolution. Nonetheless, the neocortex in mammals, as well as the dorsal pallium in non-mammalian clades, receives structured input from all sensory modalities, and these structures therefore are hypothesized to fulfill similar function. In teleost, the number of compartments in the dorsal pallium is also quite diverse among species. Somatosensory input into the dorsal pallium in marbled rockfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito et al., 1986</xref>) and visual projections from the optic tectum in the yellowfin goby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hagio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hagio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloch et al., 2020</xref>) are just a few specific examples of such sensory projections. However, because of the lack of genetic tools in these species, the molecular characterization of the dorsal pallium in teleosts is still largely underexplored. In zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), the most popular fish model organism, a clear dorsal pallium could not be delineated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Porter and Mueller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mueller et al., 2011</xref>), which has made a detailed characterization difficult in this species.</p><p>To study how the specific architecture of the dorsal pallium in teleosts emerges and is maintained throughout life, we combined two orthogonal approaches. First, cell lineage analysis was used to visualize cellular subpopulations derived from the same neural stem cells at an early developmental stage. Since post-hatch neurogenesis occurs throughout life in all teleosts, such cell lineage analysis of neural progenitors allows us to collectively label individual neural progenitors populations that may serve similar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dirian et al., 2014</xref>). Second, for characterizing gene expression within these clonal units, we focused on epigenetic regulation of transcription, where ATAC-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Letelier, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yin et al., 2020</xref>) allows for the identification of specifically regulated genes within each population, whose expression levels are further quantified by subsequent RNA-sequencing.</p><p>Here, we selected medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) as a model organism for three reasons. First, medaka possesses a dorsal pallium (Dd2) that is demarcated by a cellular boundary, which makes it anatomically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anken and Bourrat, 1998</xref>) and facilitates the isolation of this particular region. Second, transgenic medaka lines are available to visualize cell lineages in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Okuyama et al., 2013</xref>). Third, the genome size of medaka is smaller than that of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>), the genome sequence is of high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>), and it is readily available for epigenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We first investigated the clonal architecture of the entire telencephalon in medaka and found that all anatomical regions within the pallium, including Dd2, are formed by mutually exclusive clonal units. We next investigated that clonal units in Dd2 in particular possess a unique open chromatin landscape, where synaptic genes were actively regulated. Subsequently, we examined the transcriptional regulatory mechanism in Dd2 to identify some candidate transcription factors (TFs) that contribute to the unique epigenetic landscape in the dorsal pallium. Our data suggest that clonal units in the pallium show modular properties, and in particular, the dorsal pallium is constructed with distinct synaptic architecture according to different rules from those of other pallial regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomical regions in the adult medaka pallium consist of cell bodies of cell lineages</title><p>Other than in mammals, the teleost brain grows continuously throughout life via post-hatch neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuroyanagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left), such that the anatomical classification framework needs to be adapted to this expansion. For example, the nomenclature of the adult medaka telencephalon has been complicated by the difficulties in identifying the small brain structures that emerge in adult brain sections throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anken and Bourrat, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishikawa et al., 1999</xref>).

We also defined the anatomical regions by immunostaining of cell-type-specific neural markers, such as CaMK2α, parvalbumin, and GAD65/67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Here, we redefined the medial part of the pallial region (Dm) into several subcompartments (Dm2a, Dm2b, Dm3a, and Dm3b) by clear DAPI-positive boundaries. These subcompartments are absent in previous brain atlases. Also, we found clear anatomical boundaries in the dorsal pallium where different marker genes are expressed along the anterior–posterior axis (Dd2a, 2p) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; a detailed description of nomenclature is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clonal architecture in the adult medaka telencephalon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A larval medaka fish (1 week day post fertilization) and a dissected adult brain (top left).

We crossed it to a second line (Tg (HSP-Cre)) that expresses Cre recombinase under the heat shock protein promoter.

We chose this developmental stage because the heat shock at an earlier developmental stage labeled to many neurons, and the heat shock at a later stage rarely induced recombination in our Tg line, which is presumably because of the positional effect of the insertion site in this transgenic line. Then, we cleared the adult brains with Sca<italic>l</italic>e solution, stained them with DAPI, and performed light-sheet microscope imaging.

To that end, we registered the telencephalon of 81 medaka where 523 GFP-positive subpopulations were detected in total to a reference telencephalon. GFP-positive subpopulations that appeared multiple times in the same area were defined as clonally related units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On average, we could visualize 6–8 units per fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). We did not observe the GFP-positive units in a uniform frequency in the telencephalon, but more frequently in Dld, Dd2, and the subpallial regions than other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We found the smallest clone in Dcpm, which included a few dozens of cells. We did not find any laterality of clonally related units, but we found more observed GFP-positive cells in the pallium than in the subpallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>). In the subpallium, we observed GFP-positive cells mixed with DsRed-positive cell with a 50% probability. On the other hand, most of the GFP-positive cells in the pallium were not mixed with DsRed-positive cells and did not locate across multiple regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>). For example, in the lateral pallium (Dl), the dorsal and ventral part of Dl were clearly different in terms of how the GFP-positive cell bodies are distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Specifically, in the dorsal pallium, the anterior part (Dd2a) and the posterior part (Dd2p) consist of two clonally related units each that cluster laterally and medially, respectively. Taken together, we found that the anatomical regions in the pallium are formed by around 50 of the compartments of clonally related cell bodies, and the clonally related compartments distribute exclusively in one anatomical region but not across many anatomical regions.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal projections of clonal units in the telencephalon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Connectional matrix between clonal units in the telencephalon.

We compared the significantly enriched TF motifs between medaka OCR clusters and human differential OCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fullard et al., 2018</xref>) by counting the number of overlaps. We found that our medaka OCR clusters shared only a few motifs with the human medial dorsal thalamus (MDT), which is consistent with the fact that the thalamus does not belong to the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Also, we confirmed that the subpallium-specific medaka OCR cluster (C1) shared a relatively larger number of motifs with the human striatum (ST), a part of subpallium in mammals. We found that the medaka Dd2-specific OCR clusters (C6 and C7) share most motifs with the human hippocampus (HC), neocortex (NCX), and ST. However, this analysis might suffer from bias when there are many similar motifs from the same TF family. Thus, we examined the enrichment of Dd2-specific OCR motifs in human brain OCRs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, medaka OCR C6 and C7 were both enriched with three TF motifs that best match to Egr, Eomes/Tbx, and NeuroD1 motifs. We therefore examined the distribution of the motifs 1–3 of OCR C6 in human ATAC-seq peaks. We found that motifs 1 and 3 were enriched in HC and NCX OCRs, and motif 2 was enriched in NCX the most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">San Roman and Shivdasani, 2011</xref>), several organs, such as esophagus and glandular stomach, are formed by patches of clonal units that exhibit sharp boundaries and serve distinct digestive functions. Different expression patterns of <italic>Hox-</italic>cluster genes contribute to the boundary maintenance. In the medaka retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Centanin et al., 2014</xref>), retinal stem cells possess multipotency and generate all neuron types, and clonally related cells form the cylindrical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that clonal boundaries in the medaka pallium have been established with the similar mechanism as in medaka’s retinal boundaries. In the adult teleost pallium, the radial glia cells on the surface of the telencephalic hemisphere, which project toward inside of the hemisphere, function as neural stem cells, and generate neural progenitors throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This cellular arrangement might contribute to the compartmentalized structure.</p><p>As shown in mammals, the epigenetic landscape can be inherited from apical progenitors, which has a multipotency, to the late neural progenitors during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Bella et al., 2021</xref>). Since the teleost exhibit post-hatch neurogenesis in the entire life, we think that the common epigenetic landscape is inherited in each clonal unit in the adult medaka telencephalon. As a result, we make the assumption that function and characteristic of each clonal unit are defined already in progenitors by specific regulators (e.g. TFs), and those progenitors continuously produce neurons that possess the same property to function in a coordinated manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pallial diversity in teleost fish</title><p>The pallium in teleosts has been mysterious since different species exhibit different numbers or cellular densities of compartmentalized anatomical subregions within the pallium. On the other hand, the subpallial regions are relatively conserved among teleost species in terms of anatomical subregions and gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ganz et al., 2012</xref>). Our structural analysis in the adult medaka telencephalon revealed that the clonal architecture between the pallium and subpallium differs in the distribution of cells in clonal units: clonal units in the subpallium intertwine with each other, whereas the pallium is formed by the compartmentalized clonal units, giving rise to a modular structure. Modular structure is frequently seen in animal body, including brain; central complex in insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>), cerebellum in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>). The modularity of cell populations or organs is generally thought to contribute to evolutionary flexibility; one module can acquire a new phenotype without impacting the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuratani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>). We assume that the modular nature of the clonal units in the pallium plays a key role in the diversity across teleost.</p><p>How did the dorsal pallium evolve in teleosts? One hypothesis is that the teleostean dorsal pallium has been specialized from the teleostean lateral pallium (Dl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>), whereas an alternative hypothesis proposes that the teleostean dorsal pallium evolved independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Striedter and Northcutt, 2022</xref>). Our RNA-seq data identified a couple of TFs strongly expressed in Dd2 in medaka fish. In zebrafish, similar TFs, such as <italic>tshz-1, eomesa,</italic> and <italic>egr-1,</italic> are expressed in Dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diotel et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that medaka Dd2 shares a part of regulatory mechanism with zebrafish Dl. In addition, our PCA on ATAC-seq data with clonal units showed that open chromatin patterns in medaka Dd are relatively close to that in Dl. Taken together with the modular nature of clonal units in the pallium, our analyses favor the first scenario that Dd has been differentiated from the neighboring anatomical region, Dl.</p><p>Since medaka belong to the Beloniformes that diverged later than the Cypriniformes, which includes zebrafish, it might be possible that the last common ancestors of bony fish possess the dorsal pallium when they diverged, and the dorsal pallium disappeared later or it is not yet identified in Cypriniformes. Further analysis in other fish species will be required to explain the evolutionary trajectory of the dorsal pallium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible neural computations and functions of medaka Dd2</title><p>Numerous computations happen in synapses, and synaptic architecture is defined by the expression of a subset of specific molecules. Some neurons in mammals and songbirds exhibit synapses that are characterized by particularly strong plasticity and modulation, where complicated information processing takes place or memories are stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Champoux et al., 2021</xref>). In this article, we found that many synaptic genes are differentially regulated in Dd2 and they span the range from excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory synaptic genes. We also identified a synaptic organizer, <italic>C1ql3</italic>, which expressed specifically in the anterior Dd2 (Dd2a), and also expresses in the mammalian hippocampus where it is known to organize extracellular postsynaptic space and bind to GPCRs in a calcium-dependent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ressl et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that the transcription of synaptic genes in the dorsal pallium is selectively regulated and might assist information processing and activity-dependent plasticity in a manner different from other pallial regions.</p><p>What role does the dorsal pallium (Dd2) in medaka play within the telencephalic network? Our findings suggest that Dd2 might function as either a network hub where the flow of information is gated through synaptic modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gal et al., 2017</xref>), or, alternatively, it might serve as a working memory module that can transiently store information by persistent activity. Several lines of evidence support this notion. First, a couple of immediate early genes are expressed in Dd2. Second, from structural analysis, we observed axonal projections from many surrounding regions into Dd2 as well as dense and, usually unilateral, connectivity between Dd2 subregions (from Dd2p to Dd2a). Third, cadherin molecules are known to play an important role in regionally targeted axonal projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), and we found specific expression of <italic>pcdh9</italic> in Dd2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Here, it should be noted that our axonal projection analysis might have missed the projections from old mature neurons because the HuC promoter labels preferentially neural progenitors and young neurons, and the labels disappear at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Okuyama et al., 2013</xref>). Brain-wide exhaustive connectome analysis by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Odstrcil et al., 2022</xref>) or neurophysiological analysis will be necessary for further study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartoszek et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>At present, few studies have been done to uncover the behavioral function of the dorsal pallium in teleosts: in electric fish, projection analysis suggests that the dorsal pallium possesses hippocampal-like circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2017</xref>). In several cichlid fish species, the dorsal pallium gets activated specifically in the context of social memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rodriguez-Santiago et al., 2021</xref>). Further, some teleostean species that show social behaviors requiring memory exhibit distinct cytoarchitecture in their dorsal pallium. These include cichlid fish that show social dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rodriguez-Santiago et al., 2020</xref>), and, interestingly, medaka fish show mating behavior involving social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Okuyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang and Takeuchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yokoi et al., 2020</xref>).

Though zebrafish do not have clear boundaries in the dorsal part of the pallium, there are high activity in the central part of the pallium (Dc) in many behavioral paradigm, such as prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oldfield et al., 2020</xref>), multimodal avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Randlett et al., 2015</xref>), and even locomotive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>), which could correspond to the ongoing neural activity in the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>). Also based on gene expression, some studies imply that Dc is homologous to the mammalian dorsal pallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Porter and Mueller, 2020</xref>), and we detected high synaptic density in Dc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the other hand, medaka have clear boundaries in the dorsal pallium (Dd2). From the topological point of view, it is possible that Dd2 in medaka may be related to either the hippocampus or neocortex in mammals.</p><p>In our study, we found a specific transcriptional regulation in synapses in Dd2 in medaka, which could be a similar feature of the mammalian hippocampus and neocortex; some studies in mammals suggest that synaptic properties are regulated heavily in the hippocampus and neocortex, where density and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holler et al., 2021</xref>) of synapses are controlled, presumably in the context of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neves et al., 2008</xref>). Also, our motif analysis provides insight that medaka Dd2-specific OCRs share the binding motifs of transcriptional regulators with the human hippocampus and neocortex. On the other hand, we did not find a significant correlation in the overall gene expressions between medaka Dd2 and any of the mammalian brain regions. However, we believe further investigation on the synaptic regulations in specific circuits in the dorsal pallium will allow us to uncover whether the primitive region of either hippocampus, neocortex, or the mixture of two is conserved in the dorsal pallium in the teleost or not.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry</title><p>Medaka fish are kept at 14 hr/10 hr on light at 28°C.

We tracked GFP-positive neuronal projections by observing both registered brains and raw images. We found fewer GFP-positive populations in Dm2b and Dm3a.

First, we downloaded normalized gene expression levels (expression energy of structure unionizes) for all genes from the Allen Brain Atlas. Next, we obtained the medaka orthologs of those genes using Ensembl’s Biomart. We excluded cases where multiple medaka genes corresponded to a single mouse gene. To correct for expression bias across tissues caused by ISH, we normalized the expression levels of genes preferentially expressed in medaka’s Dd2 in each tissue to the average expression level of all genes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted using protocols specifically approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo (permit number: 12-07).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please try to better integrate and discuss the massive amount of high-quality data generated. Presented information in many cases is difficult to digest and several suggestions have been listed by the reviewers to address this point.</p><p>2. Data supporting the differential expression of synaptic genes is not fully presented. It would be good to show all differentially expressing genes.</p><p>3. The comparison between medaka fish and human telencephalon regions would benefit from a more extensive molecular analysis.</p><p>4. It would be good to assess what percentage of neurons within one domain are being targeted to have an estimate of how representative the clonal and connectivity information is. Also, higher-resolution images would be beneficial to exemplify the projections described.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are specific comments on the paper that might help the authors clarify some of the important concepts that they aim at sharing.</p><p>– Introduction, Page 3, lines 68 – 71. The authors refer to &quot;cellular sub-populations&quot; and &quot;clonal units&quot; as if these were synonyms. There is some confusion in these lines about the difference between lineages and cells with similar functions. Even if the authors want to make the point that clonal history and cell types are linked in the dorsal telencephalon, it is important to stress in the introduction that this is not the universal case – quite the opposite indeed in most stem cell systems.</p><p>– Introduction, Page 4, lines 92-93. The claim &quot;We propose that changes in the clonal units in the pallium is the driving force for the anatomical diversity during evolution.&quot; is not funded by experimental data from other species. The authors should share with the reader what pieces of evidence they have collected to make such a statement.</p><p>– Results, Page 7, lines 152-3. Also, Discussion, page 17, lines 361-3. The authors use here and elsewhere the term &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; when talking about the clones in the pallium. What does this mean? Isn't any clone mutually exclusive with another clone, by definition? The authors could re-phrase this to make their statement clear. This is about clones contributing exclusively to one region and not to another. If the authors develop this concept further, it would be appropriate to discuss this finding in relation to how boundaries are established in biological systems – i.e., early works in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where clones do not cross segments, on the mammalian intestine where clones do not cross villi territories, on the medaka retina and on the zebrafish heart where clones define sectors.</p><p>– Results, Page 8, Section &quot;Clonal Units tend to project to the same target regions&quot;. I do not see the added value for this section. Projections in the brain of different organisms of the same species follow the same pattern and do look alike. The authors had just stated that the anatomical regions are indeed clonal units. It is therefore natural that they project to the same targets. The authors should be more explicit in case they want to communicate something different.</p><p>– Discussion, page 18, lines 377 – 383. The authors are using a common regulatory network as evidence for a common evolutionary origin. This can not be the only speculation, mostly in a manuscript that highlights organization in clonal sectors. Can the authors expand their discussion integrating the clonal aspect that they have characterized?</p><p>– Discussion, page 19, lines 442 – 444. The authors refer to &quot;synaptic architecture&quot; in the pallium. I can not find any data in the paper that assess the synaptic architecture. There is no staining, no EM data, no functional output, and no visualization of how a synapsis looks like in the medaka pallium. The authors have indeed done much to characterize the genome architecture and identified synaptic genes in their bulk analysis. Without the characterization of synapsis in Dd2 neurons, the message of this paragraph needs to be toned down.</p><p>– &quot;The pallium in teleosts has been mysterious, since different species exhibit, within its boundaries, different numbers or cellular densities of compartmentalized anatomical sub-regions&quot;. Can the authors explain this concept further? They are making a big point with the comparison between the pallium and the subpallium, whose relevance is not clear to the non-expert reader.</p><p>– In mammals, neurons generated in the sub-pallium migrate towards the pallium. And in fish? Is this happening? Is this the reason the authors opted for a HuC promoter and not a ubiquitous promoter? If it is the case, the authors should become clear about it, and discuss this fact openly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Atlas: Nomenclature should be more accessible to readers. An easy-to-access table with the abbreviations and their meanings could be incorporated. Additionally, a succinct comparison (in the paper body) with the previous atlas might be helpful to underscore the differences and new information provided by this atlas. The clonal analysis could be integrated with the anatomical atlas to further define pallial regions. The authors should consider subdividing some of the regions based on the clones distribution they found, such as 3 clonal units in Dm2 and Dm3, 5 clonal units in Dld, 2 layers in Dlv, and 2 regions with distinct projections in Dp.</p><p>2. Table 2 (and supplementary figure 3) provides a wealth of information, but is very difficult to digest. Could the authors think of better ways of digesting and presenting the information? For instance, how many clones per animal? How many animals had clones in dorsal or ventral pallium or both? How many animals had clones in one vs more than one dorsal pallium region? How many clones had intermingled green and red cells in dorsal vs ventral pallium? Etc. Also true for summarizing and presenting connectivity data.</p><p>3. The connectivity section of the paper is underexplored. As said in point 2, this information could be incorporated to better refine the atlas. Higher-resolution images would be beneficial to exemplify the projections described. The connection matrix shows the number of fishes with a given projection. Is this resolved clearly in fishes with more than one clonal unit? Given that the number of clones per region is not homogenous, these values should be normalized. What is the implication of the findings? Speculations behind a few cross-boundary connections? Comparison to other teleost species?</p><p>4. Dd2 doesn't seem to be the only region containing a specific set of OCR. Are there other processes enriched in the OCR of other domains? Can this be used to identify genes selectively expressed in different domains? Could transcription factors associated with other domains also be identified? Besides, based on the pie charts, it seems that rather than being a Dd2 exclusive characteristic, all region-specific OCR clusters correspond mostly to intronic or intergenic regions and are likely to be enhancers. (line 222)</p><p>5. Data supporting the differential expression of synaptic genes is not presented, but only shown as a summary cartoon in figure 4d and supplementary figure 7. It would be convenient to show the differential expression of the synaptic genes and subunits of receptors, especially to support the statement in line 285 that inhibitory synaptic genes are specifically downregulated.</p><p>6. I'm curious to see what other genes (besides synaptic genes) are differentially expressed or differentially accessible. Can this information be used to further substantiate the search for homology between teleost and mammalian pallium (figure 5e)? Statement in line 349 about similar transcriptional regulators would benefit from additional support. The homology between human and medaka pallial regions is based on the motif binding site of 2 transcription factors, and requires more solid evidence.</p><p>7. HucD labels progenitors and immature neurons, while this is addressed by the authors in the discussion, it would be convenient to assess what percentage of neurons within one domain are being targeted to have an estimate of how representative the clonal and connectivity information is. Does a different driver generate similar results? Is the clonal compartmentalization retained when neurons reach maturity?</p><p>8. The atlas and clonal information are very valuable to others working in medaka or teleost telencephalon, and while it is appropriate to distribute the data through a public repository, the authors could consider an interactive webpage for exploration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main concern is about the data interpretation of the clonal tracing experiment:</p><p>In the study of the clonal architecture of the medaka brain, the authors reached the conclusion of &quot;the anatomical regions in the pallium are formed by mutually exclusive compartment of clonally-relate cell bodies&quot; based on the evidence of 1) GFP-signal distribution is different in pallium (exclusive) and subpallium (mixed green and red cells) regions; and 2) different &quot;clonal unit&quot; repeatedly occur in different subregions of the pallium. I would like to point out that this conclusion relies on two assumptions: a) Every individual fish follows the same pattern of neurogenesis, and b) common progenitor cells only give rise to cells (the so-called &quot;clonal units&quot;) within the same region within pallium. Given the regulatory developmental process of vertebrates and the fact certain progenitors can migrate far after being born in the brain, neither of the assumptions may hold true.</p><p>One experiment the authors should add is to induce the heat-shock at both earlier and later time points. If the &quot;clonal unit&quot; truly reflects lineally related cells, they should only co-occur in a later-induced clone but not in early-induced clones. Changing the timing of heat-shock will also give the authors a hint of how &quot;unique&quot; the pallium is in terms of clonal compartmentation in contrast to the subpallium region. For example, the subpallium is also compartmentalized, but at a later time point.</p><p>Otherwise, the paper is very well written. A possible typo on Page 17. Line 371: &quot;…the distribution of cells in clonal cells&quot;. The authors may have meant &quot;clonal units&quot;?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85093.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We added a paragraph in the discussion about the how boundaries are established in biological systems:</p><p>“In animal bodies, various boundaries are formed by clonally related cells. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, clones do not cross segments, suggesting that clones are projection units <sup>29</sup>. In the zebrafish heart <sup>34</sup>, as fish grow from juveniles to adults, the whole heart is formed by cells derived from a small number (~8) of cardiomyocytes, which define the sections through clonal dominance. In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract<sup>76</sup>, several organs, such as the esophagus and glandular stomach, are formed by patches of clonal units that exhibit sharp boundaries and serve distinct digestive functions. Different expression patterns of <italic>Hox-</italic>cluster genes contribute to the boundary maintenance. In the medaka retina <sup>35</sup>, retinal stem cells possess multipotency and generate all neuron types, and clonally-related cells form the cylindrical structure <sup>36</sup>.</p><p>We speculate that clonal boundaries in the medaka pallium have been established with the similar mechanism as in medaka’s retinal boundaries. In the adult teleost pallium, the radial glia cells on the surface of the telencephalic hemisphere, which project toward the inside of the hemisphere, function as neural stem cells and generate neural progenitors throughout life (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4). This cellular arrangement might contribute to the compartmentalized structure.” (page 22, line 419-431)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results, Page 8, Section &quot;Clonal Units tend to project to the same target regions&quot;. I do not see the added value for this section. Projections in the brain of different organisms of the same species follow the same pattern and do look alike.

The authors should be more explicit in case they want to communicate something different.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. It is not always true that cells whose cell bodies are located in the same region project to the same target with long axonal bundles. For example, the cell bodies in the subpallium are located inside the boundaries, but we found that the projections were mixed and don’t form axon bundles like the clonal units in the pallium. “Based on this observation that cell lineages in the pallium tend to project to the same target, we concluded that the labeled cellular sub-populations are clonal units.” (page 10, line 208-210) In the revised manuscript, we took more care in distinguishing “cell lineages'' and “clonal units.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion, page 18, lines 377 – 383.

The authors have indeed done much to characterize the genome architecture and identified synaptic genes in their bulk analysis. Without the characterization of synapsis in Dd2 neurons, the message of this paragraph needs to be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. In our figure 4 and the supplemental figure, we stained synaptic genes, such as synapsin and PSD95, but yes, we don’t have more detailed architectural data.

In our revised manuscript, we updated as follows, “The pallium in teleosts has been mysterious, since different species exhibit, within its boundaries, different numbers or cellular densities of compartmentalized anatomical sub-regions.

Though we considered updating the existing pallial regions with sub-regions based on clonal unit structure, we didn’t update the anatomical atlas since we only could visualize this clonal unit structure by lineage labeling. However, our clonal ATAC-seq revealed the differential open-chromatin pattern among clonal units in Dlv (Figure 2D, Dld_mv vs Dld_pv), which suggest that there are actually different cellular populations in the anatomical regions.

And we didn’t find strong asymmetricity in the induction of clonal units (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3B, D). In most of the fish, both the dorsal and ventral telencephalon had clones, but more clones in the pallium (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 B, E). In the subpallium, most of the clones are not individually appeared but visualized with neighboring clones (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 B), while we observed most of the clones in the pallium alone (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 B,F).

In the revised manuscript, we added a few lines to make our speculations clear: In the clonal structural analysis, we found that the cell bodies of the cell lineages in the pallium cluster together and locate inside the anatomical regions, but whether the projection of the cell lineages goes to the same target or not was not clear. After the projection analysis, we found that most cell lineages project to the same target, which implies that these cell lineages are also functional units. (page 10, line 205-207)</p><p>We found the clonal units in Dp project axons all the way to the olfactory bulb. This projection is conserved in teleost and experimentally visualized in zebrafish previously (Kermen et al. 2020). In the manuscript, we described that the expression of a few transcription factors (TFs) are conserved between the lateral pallium (Dl) of zebrafish and medaka (page 23, line 454-456). Though we haven’t analyzed the expression of TFs in Dp, we expect that there are some conserved expression of TFs in Dp of zebrafish and medaka.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Could transcription factors associated with other domains also be identified?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. In general, OCRs can function to both activate or repress gene expression, so RNA-seq data is required to identify genes specifically expressed in each domain. In this study, we chose Dd2 for RNA-seq analyses and found candidate TFs (page 18, Figure 6) In order to identify TFs associated with other brain regions, additional RNA-seq is required, and we leave it for a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides, based on the pie charts, it seems that rather than being a Dd2 exclusive characteristic, all region-specific OCR clusters correspond mostly to intronic or intergenic regions and are likely to be enhancers.

We added the following sentences, “We examined the distribution of ATAC-seq peaks in the genome, and Dd2-specific ATAC-seq peaks, located mainly in the intron and intergenic regions (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D), suggesting that the genomic regions that exhibit these peaks function as Dd2-specific enhancers.” (page 12, line 251 – page 13, line 253)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

I'm curious to see what other genes (besides synaptic genes) are differentially expressed or differentially accessible. Can this information be used to further substantiate the search for homology between teleost and mammalian pallium (figure 5e)?

The homology between human and medaka pallial regions is based on the motif binding site of 2 transcription factors, and requires more solid evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We modified Figure 4 to make it clearer which other genes are differentially expressed in Dd2 (See also Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). We showed that GO terms enriched with Dd2 OCR or genes are mainly synapse-related ones. Furthermore, we newly analyzed the expression of all Dd2-preferentially expressing genes (809 genes, which include non-synaptic genes) across the mouse brain regions (12 regions) using the Allen Institute dataset, but we couldn’t find the strong correlation with any specific brain regions in mice. We modified our manuscript to reflect these results. (page 20, line 396 – page 21, line 401)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. HucD labels progenitors and immature neurons, while this is addressed by the authors in the discussion, it would be convenient to assess what percentage of neurons within one domain are being targeted to have an estimate of how representative the clonal and connectivity information is.

We quantified the ratio of the labeled cells in the Tg line, we found that around 60-70% of cells in the telencephalon were labeled with DsRed in our transgenic line (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2B). (page 38, line 748-752)</p><p>We believe that we would get similar results in a different driver. In the previous paper (Dirian et al. 2014), clonal analysis was done in zebrafish using a ubiquitous promoter and showed a similar compartmentalized structure of cell lineages in the lateral pallium. Since the ubiquitous promoter is active in the mature neurons, we believe that the clonal compartmentalization is still retained with mature neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The atlas and clonal information are very valuable to others working in medaka or teleost telencephalon, and while it is appropriate to distribute the data through a public repository, the authors could consider an interactive webpage for exploration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for a good recommendation. Recently, as a different project, the first author is working on generating a larval medaka whole-brain atlas in an interactive website by extending the existing larval zebrafish whole-brain atlas (https://zebrafishatlas.zib.de/). We would include our medaka adult brain atlas to this atlas as well in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My main concern is about the data interpretation of the clonal tracing experiment:</p><p>In the study of the clonal architecture of the medaka brain, the authors reached the conclusion of &quot;the anatomical regions in the pallium are formed by mutually exclusive compartment of clonally-relate cell bodies&quot; based on the evidence of 1) GFP-signal distribution is different in pallium (exclusive) and subpallium (mixed green and red cells) regions; and 2) different &quot;clonal unit&quot; repeatedly occur in different subregions of the pallium. I would like to point out that this conclusion relies on two assumptions: a) Every individual fish follows the same pattern of neurogenesis, and b) common progenitor cells only give rise to cells (the so-called &quot;clonal units&quot;) within the same region within pallium. Given the regulatory developmental process of vertebrates and the fact certain progenitors can migrate far after being born in the brain, neither of the assumptions may hold true.</p><p>One experiment the authors should add is to induce the heat-shock at both earlier and later time points. If the &quot;clonal unit&quot; truly reflects lineally related cells, they should only co-occur in a later-induced clone but not in early-induced clones. Changing the timing of heat-shock will also give the authors a hint of how &quot;unique&quot; the pallium is in terms of clonal compartmentation in contrast to the subpallium region. For example, the subpallium is also compartmentalized, but at a later time point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. As the reviewer commented, in order to see the difference of compartmentalization between the pallium and the subpallium, we should perform the lineage analysis experiment that recombination is induced at the earlier or later stage. In our previous paper (Okuyama et al. 2013), when we applied the induction at the earlier stage, we observed GFP expression in a wider area. And for the later-stage recombination-induction experiment, unfortunately, it was technically very difficult since the heat shock promoter in our transgenic lines we used shows much less activity in the later developmental stage (Okuyama et al. 2013), and we couldn’t induce the cre-loxp recombination with the mild heat shock (38 C for 15 min) we used for our experiments.</p><p>However, we still think we can respond back to the reviewer’s comment that is based on the two concerns:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to point out that this conclusion relies on two assumptions: a) Every individual fish follows the same pattern of neurogenesis, b) common progenitor cells only give rise to cells (the so-called &quot;clonal units&quot;) within the same region within the pallium.

(page 6, line 111-112)</p><p>Also, in teleosts, adult neurogenesis occurs proficiently in the telencephalon but in a different structural mechanism in the pallium and subpallium (Grandel et al. 2006), (Labusch et al. 2020; Ganz et al. 2010). In the pallium, the cell bodies of radial glial cells (neural stem cells) are located on the surface of the hemisphere project toward the inside of the hemisphere (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4). And neural progenitors derived from the neural stem cells migrate along this projection. Thus we assume the pallial clonal units visualized in our paper were derived from the neural stem cells that are located in the same region (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4). On the other hand, neural stem cells for the teleost subpallium locate the subpallial ventricle, and the neural progenitors migrate from there in the anterior-posterior axis (page 40, Figure 1 —figure supplement 4, line 772-781). Therefore, organization of radial glial cells is also clearly different between pallium and subpallium, which is consistent with the difference in compartmentalization property.</p><p>Taken together, although the induction of the cre-loxp recombination at the later stage is informative, the clonal structural differences between the pallium and subpallium is supported from the observation of individual fish and radial glial cell organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Otherwise, the paper is very well written.
