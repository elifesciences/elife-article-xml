ocean, the hadal snailfish (<italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic>), which lives at a depth of 6,000–8,000 m, is a representative case for studying adaptation to extreme environments. Despite some preliminary studies on this species in recent years, including their loss of pigmentation, visual and skeletal calcification genes, and the role of trimethylamine N-oxide in adaptation to high-hydrostatic pressure, it is still unknown how they evolved and why they are among the few vertebrate species that have successfully adapted to the deep-sea environment. Using genomic data from different trenches, we found that the hadal snailfish may have entered and fully adapted to such extreme environments only in the last few million years. Meanwhile, phylogenetic relationships show that they spread into different trenches in the Pacific Ocean within a million years. Comparative genomic analysis has also revealed that the genes associated with perception, circadian rhythms, and metabolism have been extensively modified in the hadal snailfish to adapt to its unique environment. More importantly, the tandem duplication of a gene encoding ferritin significantly increased their tolerance to reactive oxygen species, which may be one of the important factors in their adaptation to high-hydrostatic pressure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic></kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd><italic>Liparis tanakae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shunping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the 1000 Talent Project Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds of Northwestern Polytechnic University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Shunping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hadal snailfish rapidly evolved and adapted to extreme deep-sea environments, modifying crucial genes and enhancing tolerance to high-hydrostatic pressure through ferritin gene duplication.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its capture in 2014, the hadal snailfish (<italic>Pseudoliparis swirei</italic>) has captured the attention of biologists and public as the deepest known vertebrate on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerringer et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerringer et al., 2021b</xref>). The hadal zone, 6 km below the sea surface where this species lives, and after which the species is named, is characterized by high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP), complete darkness, and barrenness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jamieson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jamieson, 2011</xref>). This special organism that survives and thrives in the hadal zone provides us with an unusual case of adaptation to an extreme environment. After several years of anatomical and genomic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerringer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerringer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), it is now known that the hadal snailfish has degraded vision and a lack of melanin in its skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have also revealed that having more unsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cossins and MacDonald, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 2000</xref>) and high levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yancey et al., 2014</xref>) may have played important roles in resistance to HHP. However, much remains to be discovered about this species; our lack of knowledge can be categorized into three principal areas.</p><p>The first concerns the origin of hadal snailfish. They have been observed in several trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean, including the Mariana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerringer et al., 2021a</xref>), Kuril–Kamchatka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerringer et al., 2017b</xref>), and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerringer et al., 2021a</xref>) trenches. The question arises: Do they have the ability to migrate across trenches, or do they enter the hadal zone independently? Furthermore, it has been shown that the divergence time between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish (a closely related species distributed in shallow areas) is about 20 million years ago (Mya) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; but when did the hadal snailfish enter the hadal zone and how long did they take to complete their adaptation to this ecological niche? The second aspect concerns its morphological and physiological characteristics. For example, in such a dark environment, what do hadal snailfish rely on to sense the world: is it smell, taste, or something else? Do they still have circadian rhythms in the absence of sunlight? Does darkness and HHP have any effect on their behavior? The last area concerns the mechanisms by which they tolerate HHP. If unsaturated fatty acids and TMAO are common in marine fish, why have only a few species such as hadal snailfish been observed to reach such depths? Some studies suggest that certain genetic alterations may confer tolerance to HHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), but if so, how do these alterations help hadal snailfish to adapt to this environment, and which alterations are most critical?</p><p>Unfortunately, these questions have not been well resolved because it is difficult for us to make long-term observations of deep-sea organisms in situ. During 2018–2019, we collected multiple samples of hadal snailfish from the Mariana Trench and Tanaka’s snailfish from the Yellow Sea. Based on more data and more refined genome, we have been able to trace the genomic signals left by adaptive evolution in an attempt to more fully understand the evolutionary processes and key changes in this special organism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Improved genome assembly for Mariana hadal snailfish</title><p>A total of four hadal snailfish (<italic>P. swirei</italic>) and four Tanaka’s snailfish (<italic>Liparis tanakae</italic>) individuals were collected for this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Using a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads, Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) short reads, and Hi-C sequencing technologies, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly for hadal snailfish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The genome assembly comprised 1,173 contigs (total length = 626.44 Mb, contig N50 = 4.22 Mb), organized into 24 chromosomes with an anchoring rate of 98.24%. The new assembly filled 1.26 Mb of gaps that were present in our previous assembly and have a much higher level of genome continuity and completeness (with complete BUSCOs of 96.0% [Actinopterygii_odb10 database]) than the two previous assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary file 3 and 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the genome redundancy caused by mis-assembly is also largely reduced in the new assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which ensures the reliability of the subsequent analysis. Meanwhile, we generated a high-quality chromosomal-level genome assembly for Tanaka’s snailfish for a comparative evolutionary study. We noticed that there is no major chromosomal rearrangement between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish, and chromosome numbers are consistent with the previously reported MTZ-ancestor (the last common ancestor of medaka, <italic>Tetraodon</italic>, and zebrafish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>), while the stickleback had undergone several independent chromosomal fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the new genome assemblies, we re-examined the genetic changes that occurred in the common ancestor of hadal snailfish in combination with the new resequencing and transcriptome data. After a thorough scan and careful inspection, we identified 51 absent genes, 20 unitary pseudogenes, 21 lineage-specific expanded genes, 33 genes with insertions and deletions (with a length ≥3 amino acids) in coding regions, and 33 de novo-originated new genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8 supp9 supp10 supp11 supp12">Supplementary file 8-12</xref>). Most of them have not been previously reported and we discuss them in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cross-trench distribution and high level of genetic diversity</title><p>Combining the eight new sequenced individuals (four hadal snailfish and four Tanaka’s snailfish) with five previously reported individuals (four hadal snailfish and one Tanaka’s snailfish), we have been able to form an initial perspective of the hadal snailfish at the population level. The principal component analysis (PCA), neighbor-joining tree, and genetic clustering analysis show that the eight hadal snailfish individuals can be divided into two populations, the first with seven individuals and the second with one individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, the first population includes samples from both the Mariana and Yap trenches. Using the mitochondrial data, we found that the divergence time of these individuals from different trenches appears to be only about 44,000 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Combined with additional publicly available mitochondrial data, we noticed that the sample from the Kermadec Trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerringer et al., 2017b</xref>), about 6400 km away from the Mariana Trench, is also clustered with individuals from the first population, and the divergence time was estimated to be 1.0 Mya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These results suggest that hadal snailfish have successfully spread to multiple trenches in the Pacific Ocean over the course of a million years. And this dispersal may have been caused by population expansion or deep circulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling information of hadal snailfish, and phylogenetic relationships and population structure of resequenced individuals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) of eight hadal snailfish and five Tanaka’s snailfish.

We might therefore speculate that the ancestor of hadal snailfish adapted to the deep-sea environment around 1,000 m at about 9.9 Mya, and subsequently gradually adapted to greater depths in the formed or forming trench. The upper and lower limits of the time for hadal snailfish to enter the hadal zone were estimated to be 9.9 Mya (divergence time between hadal snailfish and its closest relatives) and 1.0 Mya (divergence time between different hadal snailfish individuals), respectively.

Since light with longer wavelengths is absorbed more quickly than those with shorter wavelengths (except for the shortest UV wavelengths), high-energy light with shorter wavelengths, such as blue, is able to penetrate to greater depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The genes responsible for absorbing these shorter wavelengths (<italic>sws2</italic> and <italic>rh2</italic>) are therefore much more important to deep-sea species in the photic zone (above 200 m) than those that absorb longer wavelengths (<italic>lws</italic>).

From our transcriptome data, we also observed that the brain is one of the most divergent organs regarding expression levels between hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, there are 3,587 upregulated genes and 3,433 downregulated genes in the brain of hadal snailfish compared to Tanaka snailfish, and Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses revealed that upregulated genes in the hadal snailfish are associated with cilium, DNA repair, and microtubule-based movement, while downregulated genes are enriched in membranes, GTP-binding, proton transmembrane transport, and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp15">Supplementary file 15</xref>).

We also identified 15 de novo new genes in hadal snailfish that are highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

It appears that the hadal snailfish have a survival strategy of storing energy, which is often found in species that need to cope with occasional starvation. Here we find another clue that hints at the existence of this possibility: the pseudogenization of the gene <italic>gpr27</italic> in hadal snailfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>Gpr27</italic> is a G protein-coupled receptor, belonging to the family of cell surface receptors, involved in various physiological processes and expressed in multiple tissues including the brain, heart, kidney, and immune system.

The transcriptome data further confirm that the gene <italic>cpt1</italic> is significantly upregulated in the liver of hadal snailfish. As lipid mobilization is thought to be a common metabolic response to short-term starvation in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liao et al., 2017</xref>), the inactivation of <italic>gpr27</italic> could help hadal snailfish to better survive periods of food deficiency.

Next, we identified 34 genes that are significantly more highly expressed in all organs of hadal snailfish in comparison to Tanaka’s snailfish and zebrafish, while only 7 genes were found to be significantly more highly expressed in Tanaka’s snailfish using the same criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 34 genes are enriched in only one GO category, GO:0000077: DNA damage checkpoint (adjusted p-value: 0.0177). Moreover, 5 of the 34 genes are associated with DNA repair. Interestingly, however, when we analyzed the genes that were both expanded and highly expressed in most tissues, we identified only one gene, <italic>fthl27</italic> (encoding a ferritin heavy chain-like protein), which has 14 copies (most of which are tandem duplicates) in hadal snailfish as opposed to 3 copies in Tanaka snailfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

For example, given that the divergence time of the hadal snailfish and the other species of the family Liparidae living at a depth of 1,000 m was about 9.9 Mya, and the divergence time between different sequenced hadal snailfish individuals was about 1.1 Mya, it is known that the hadal snailfish entered the hadal zone between 1.1 and 9.9 Mya. Then consider the fact that the genes that are responsible for detecting light in dark environment are well preserved in the hadal snailfish, it is likely that this species have only entered a completely light-free environment in the last millions of years, after the full completion of the Mariana Trench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the phylogenetic relationships between different individuals clearly indicate that they have successfully spread to different trenches within 1.0 Mya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>The comparative genomic analysis revealed that the complete absence of light had a profound effect on the hadal snailfish. In addition to the substantial loss of visual genes and loss of pigmentation, many rhythm-related genes were also absent, although some rhythm genes were still present. The gene loss may not only come from relaxation of natural selection, but also for better adaptation. For example, the <italic>grpr</italic> gene copies are absent or downregulated in hadal snailfish, which could in turn increase their activity in the dark, allowing them to survive better in the dark environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wada et al., 1997</xref>). The loss of <italic>gpr27</italic> may also increase the ability of lipid metabolism, which is essential for coping with short-term food deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nath et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The most interesting question about the hadal snailfish is why this is currently one of the very few observed vertebrate species capable of surviving and reproducing at such depths. TMAO, which is able to maintain protein function under high pressure, is thought to be a limiting factor in determining the depth at which fish can survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yancey et al., 2014</xref>). Results from our previous analysis suggested that positive selection on <italic>fmo3</italic> may be important in promoting TMAO synthesis; but after an updated genome and rigorous FDR correction, we found that these genes had not undergone any particular or significant alteration in the amino acid sequences, although this does not exclude the possibility of a small number of amino acids (three species-specific mutations in all the five copies) having an effect on enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Since the expression of all five copies of <italic>fmo3</italic> is similar among the various tissues of Tanaka’s snailfish and hadal snailfish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp16">Supplementary file 16</xref>), it seems more likely that the mechanism associated with TMAO degradation is altered in hadal snailfish, although we do not yet have any additional evidence to support this because the genes associated with TMAO degradation are still unclear.</p><p>However, the levels of TMAO are not sufficient for us to understand why only the hadal snailfish can tolerate such HHP since this substance is widely present in marine fishes. In contrast, the tandem duplication events of two genes may play a more critical role in the adaptation of the hadal snailfish. The first event is the tandem duplication of <italic>cldnj</italic>, a gene essential for otolith formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hardison et al., 2005</xref>). The two more copies may help the hadal snailfish to maintain the densities of their otoliths far beyond the limits of CCD. Since the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate increases with higher pressure, the otoliths stability may be one of the reasons limiting fishes to dive to even deeper regions. The second event is the massive expansion and high expression of <italic>fthl27</italic>. Our cellular experiments proved that this gene could help cells to resist ROS burst and protect it from various damages caused by oxidative stress. Meanwhile, comparative transcriptomic analysis observed multiple genes associated with DNA repair are significantly more highly expressed in all tissues of hadal snailfish than in other fishes, which also coincides with the presence of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we provide chromosome-level genomes of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish, as well as additional transcriptome and resequencing data.

Then, the genes with SLSs accounting for at least 40% of the coding sequence length were selected as the candidate specific loss genes. (3) The protein sequences of the genes selected in the previous step were used as a reference to search through the genome of hadal snailfish using BLAT v. 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kent, 2002</xref>) and predict the gene structure using GeneWise v2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birney et al., 2004</xref>) to determine the genes that were completely lost or partially lost in this species. (4) The synteny alignment between the hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish, and stickleback was plotted for partial or fully lost of the gene.</p><p>For gene duplication, the following methods were used for identification. (1) Short reads of eight hadal snailfish and five Tanaka’s snailfish were compared to the stickleback and Tanaka’s snailfish genome using BWA v0.7.12-r1039 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li, 2013</xref>) and subsequently sorted using SAMtools v1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to obtain the BAM files. (2) The homologous sites whose average value of reads depth of all hadal snailfish individuals were greater than 1.5 the average value of the Tanaka’s snailfish individuals were retained and defined as hadal snailfish specific high-copy sites (HCSs). Then, the genes with HCSs accounting for at least 50% of the coding sequence length were selected as the candidate high-copy genes. (3) We searched for the location of this gene on the hadal snailfish genome using BLAT v. 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kent, 2002</xref>) and predicted the gene structure using GeneWise v2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birney et al., 2004</xref>) to determine its copy number. (4) Finally, the expansion of this gene was determined by constructing a gene tree of the protein sequences of this gene family from nine species: hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish, medaka, Atlantic cod, flatfish, stickleback, zebrafish, turbot, and fugu.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Identification of unitary pseudogenes</title><p>Unitary pseudogenes are nonfunctional genes that decay at their original location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tutar, 2012</xref>), and we suggest that some missing homologs will exist in hadal snailfish genome as unitary pseudogenes during their adaptation to the special environment of the hadal zone.</p><p>We obtained pseudogenes in hadal snailfish by following five steps. (1) Using the stickleback genome sequence as a reference, we performed synteny alignment for three species (hadal snailfish, Tanaka’s snailfish, and stickleback) with Last v956 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiełbasa et al., 2011</xref>) using the parameters ‘-E 0.05', generating a total of 382  Mb (of which 290 Mb was informative for all species) of one-to-one alignment sequences with Multiz v1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanchette et al., 2004</xref>) using the default parameters. (2) Genes with at least 70% of the coding sequences of stickleback or Tanaka’s snailfish present in the MAF and not present in the corresponding regions of hadal snailfish were selected as alternative unitary pseudogene datasets. (3) We used BLAST v2.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) to determine if this gene was present in other regions of the hadal snailfish genome.

In the second step, we defined a single-sequenced sample with reads depths &lt;10 at a single locus as a deletion locus. Based on the annotation file of hadal snailfish, we screened all Tanaka’s snailfish individuals for genes with deletions &gt;50%. Next, for the genes specifically present in hadal snailfish selected in the previous step, we used BLAST v2.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) to align them with the genomes of eight other fishes (Tanaka’s snailfish, medaka, Atlantic cod, flatfish, stickleback, zebrafish, turbot, and fugu) and screened for genes with a matching region &lt;0.4. Genes with transcripts per million (TPM) maxima less than 1 in each tissue of hadal snailfish were filtered out. The fully annotated genes (presence of start and stop codons) in the results were defined as novel genes of hadal snailfish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Lineage-specific changes in amino acid sequences</title><p>For 17 species – Tanaka’s snailfish, stickleback, pacific bluefin tuna, medaka, platy fish, Atlantic cod, flatfish, zebrafish, turbot, fugu, spotted gar, coelacanth, chicken, mouse, human, brownbanded bamboo shark, and elephant shark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) – we identified one-to-one orthologs for each species and hadal snailfish by the Reciprocal Best-Hits (RBH) method, and subsequently selected genes present in 15 species, including hadal snailfish, as conserved gene sets. Next, the protein sequences of the selected genes were aligned using MAFFT v7.471 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), and a custom script was used to select regions that were consistent in other species and had contiguous specificity at sites greater than 3 bp in hadal snailfish, and that had at least 90% sequence identity for each 5 bp region before and after this variant region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).

StringTie v1.3.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>) was then used to count the number of reads paired for each gene with the help of gene annotation information of the species, and then TPM values were calculated for each gene in both species. Next, we identified 17,281 one-to-one orthologs of hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish using the RBH method. Subsequently, we identified the genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) between the same tissues of two species using the R package DESeq2 with |log<sub>2</sub> (foldchange)| ≥ 1 and corrected p&lt;0.05. For genes that are upregulated or downregulated in multiple tissues, we first found by stochastic simulation that a gene is differentially expressed between two species in one organ does not affect the probability that this gene is differentially expressed in any other organ. Subsequently, we counted the genes that were upregulated or downregulated in each tissue to obtain a list of genes that were co-altered in multiple tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell lines</title><p>We selected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells as an in vitro model.

This is an extension and update of previous work from the group on the hadal snailfish genome. The chromosomal assemblies allow comparisons of genome architecture between a shallow water snailfish and the hadal snailfish to aid inference on timing of colonization of trenches and genomic changes that may have been adaptive for that move.</p><p>The comparisons in genomic architecture are compelling: genes present in Tanaka's snailfish that are lost in hadal snailfish that involve whole regions of the genome that no longer map even though adjacent regions do map between the species and across a large evolutionary distance to stickleback. Or genes that are duplicated in hadal snailfish but only appear as single copy in other fishes. The paper focuses on genes in the eye, in hearing, in circadian rythms, and in ROS scavaging. These are all functions that could play a role in adapting to the hadal environment.</p><p>The genomic comparisons all seem sound. Stylistically I would prefer if the authors could introduce the gene product and protein function every time they introduce a gene locus. They introduce a gene and general function, but don't usually note what the protein encoded by the gene is and what it's specific function is.</p><p>I found the paper generally well written, and the data compelling and creatively displayed.</p><p>Upon revision, the authors have commendably addressed all reviewer comments and added a slew of additional analyses. I find the paper stronger, better argued and have no further questions or comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

It is important to note that different generation times do not change the shape of the PSMC curve, they only shift the curve along the axis.

Through comparative transcriptome analysis, we identified 3,587 up-regulated genes and 3,433 down-regulated genes in the brains of hadal snailfish compared to Tanaka's snailfish.

Conversely, the down-regulated genes were associated with membranes, GTP-binding, proton transmembrane transport, and synaptic vesicles, as shown in following table (Supplementary file 15). Previous studies have shown that high hydrostatic pressure induces DNA strand breaks and damage, and that DNA repair-related genes upregulated in the brain may help hadal snailfish overcome these

L276: What is the relationship between low bone mineralization and deep-sea adaptation, and can low mineralization help deep-sea fish better adapt to the deep sea?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for this suggestion. The hadal snailfish exhibits lower bone mineralization compared to Tanaka's snailfish, which may have facilitated its adaptation to the deep sea. On one hand, this reduced bone mineralization could have contributed to the hadal snailfish's ability to maintain neutral buoyancy without excessive energy expenditure. On the other hand, the lower bone mineralization may have also rendered their skeleton more flexible and malleable, enhancing their resilience to high hydrostatic pressure. Accordingly, we added the following new descriptions (lines 295-300): “Nonetheless, micro-CT scans have revealed shorter bones and reduced bone density in hadal snailfish, from which it has been inferred that this species has reduced bone mineralization (M. E. Gerringer et al., 2021); this may be a result of lowering density by reducing bone mineralization, allowing to maintain neutral buoyancy without expending too much energy, or it may be a result of making its skeleton more flexible and malleable, which is able to better withstand the effects of HHP.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

It is curious what functions are associated with the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in all tissues of hadal snailfish compared to Tanaka's snailfish, and what functions have hadal snailfish lost in order to adapt to the deep sea?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for this suggestion. We added a description of this finding in the results section (lines 337-343): “Next, we identified 34 genes that are significantly more highly expressed in all organs of hadal snailfish in comparison to Tanaka’s snailfish and zebrafish, while only seven genes were found to be significantly more highly expressed in Tanaka’s snailfish using the same criterion (Figure 5-figure supplements 1). The 34 genes are enriched in only one GO category, GO:0000077: DNA damage checkpoint (Adjusted P-value: 0.0177). Moreover, five of the 34 genes are associated with DNA repair.” This suggests that up-regulated genes in all tissues in hadal snailfish are associated with DNA repair in response to DNA damage caused by high hydrostatic pressure, whereas down-regulated genes do not show enrichment for a particular function.</p><p>Overall, the functions lost in hadal snailfish adapted to the deep sea are mainly related to the effects of the dark environment, which can be summarized as follows (lines 375-383): “The comparative genomic analysis revealed that the complete absence of light had a profound effect on the hadal snailfish. In addition to the substantial loss of visual genes and loss of pigmentation, many rhythm-related genes were also absent, although some rhythm genes were still present. The gene loss may not only come from relaxation of natural selection, but also for better adaptation. For example, the grpr gene copies are absent or down-regulated in hadal snailfish, which could in turn increased their activity in the dark, allowing them to survive better in the dark environment (Wada et al., 1997). The loss of gpr27 may also increase the ability of lipid metabolism, which is essential for coping with short-term food deficiencies (Nath et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have pointed out some of the examples that struck me as worthy of additional thought/writing/comments from the authors. Any changes/comments are relatively minor.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you very much for your positive comments on this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For comparative transcriptome analyses, reads were mapped back to reference genomes and TPM values were obtained for gene-level count analyses. 1:1 orthologs were used for differential expression analyses. This is indeed the only way to normalize counts across species, by comparing the same gene set in each species. Differential expression statistics were run in DEseq2. This is a robust way to compare gene expression across species and where fold-change values are reported (e.g. Fig 3, creatively by coloring the gene name) the values are best-practice.</p><p>In other places, TPM values are reported (e.g. Fig 2D, Fig 4C, Fig 5A, Fig 4-Fig supp 4) to illustrate expression differences within a tissue across species. The comparisons look robust, although it is not made clear how the values were obtained in all cases. For example, in Fig 2D the TPM values appear to be from eyes of individual fish, but in Fig 4C and 5A they must be some kind of average? I think that information should be added to the figure legends.</p><p>Of note: TPM values are sensitive to the shape of the RNA abundance distribution from a given sample: A small number of very highly expressed genes might bias TPM values downward for other genes. From one individual to another or from one species to another, it is not obvious to me that we should expect the same TPM distribution from the same tissues, making it a challenging metric for comparison across samples, and especially across species. An alternative measure of RNA abundance is normalized counts that can be output from DEseq2. See:</p><p>Zhao, Y., Li, M.C., Konaté, M.M., Chen, L., Das, B., Karlovich, C., Williams, P.M., Evrard, Y.A., Doroshow, J.H. and McShane, L.M., 2021. TPM, FPKM, or normalized counts? A comparative study of quantification measures for the analysis of RNA-seq data from the NCI patient-derived models repository. Journal of translational medicine, 19(1), pp.1-15.</p><p>If the authors would like to keep the TPM values, I think it would be useful for them to visualize the TPM value distribution that the numbers were derived from. One way to do this would be to make a violin plot for species/tissue and plot the TPM values of interest on that. That would give a visualization of the ranked value of the gene within the context of all other TPM values. A more highly expressed gene would presumably have a higher rank in context of the specific tissue/species and be more towards the upper tail of the distribution. An example violin plot can be found in Fig 6 of:</p><p>Burns, J.A., Gruber, D.F., Gaffney, J.P., Sparks, J.S. and Brugler, M.R., 2022. Transcriptomics of a Greenlandic Snailfish Reveals Exceptionally High Expression of Antifreeze Protein Transcripts.

I assume I am looking for regions where Tanaka’s snailfish reads map and Hadal snailfish reads do not, but it is not abundantly clear. Also, other measures of selection might be good to investigate: accumulation of mutations in the region could be evidence of relaxed selection, for example, where essential genes will accumulate fewer mutations than conditional genes or (presumably) genes that are not needed at all.

Following your suggestion, we have removed the mention of the down-regulation of some visual genes in the eyes of hadal snailfish and the results of the original Fig2-Fig supp 1 that were based on reads mapping to confirm whether the genes were lost or not. To investigate the potential relaxation of natural selection in the opn1sw2 gene in hadal snailfish, we conducted precise gene structure annotation. Our findings revealed that the opn1sw2 gene is pseudogenized in hadal snailfish, indicating a relaxation of natural selection. We have included this result in Figure 2-figure supplements 1.</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Pseudogenization of opn1sw2 in hadal snailfish.</title><p>The deletion changed the protein’s sequence, causing its premature termination.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87198-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Accordingly, we have toned down the related conclusions in the main text as follows (lines 164-173): “We noticed that the lws gene (long wavelength) has been completely lost in both hadal snailfish and Tanaka’s snailfish; rh2 (central wavelength) has been specifically lost in hadal snailfish (Figure 2B and 2C); sws2 (short wavelength) has undergone pseudogenization in hadal snailfish (Figure 2-figure supplements 1); while rh1 and gnat1 (perception of very dim light) is both still present and expressed in the eyes of hadal snailfish (Figure 2D). A previous study has also proven the existence of rhodopsin protein in the eyes of hadal snailfish using proteome data (Yan, Lian, Lan, Qian, &amp; He, 2021). The preservation and expression of genes for the perception of very dim light suggests that they are still subject to natural selection, at least in the recent past.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 161-170: What tissue were the transcripts derived from for looking at expression level of opsins?

We have added functional annotations for the cldnj to the main text (lines 200-204): “Moreover, the gene involved in lifelong otolith mineralization, cldnj, has three copies in hadal snailfish, but only one copy in other teleost species, encodes a claudin protein that has a role in tight junctions through calcium independent cell-adhesion activity (Figure 3B, Figure 3C) (Hardison, Lichten, Banerjee-Basu, Becker, &amp; Burgess, 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 199-210: Paragraph on cldnj: there are extra cldnj genes in the hadal snailfish, but no apparent extra expression.

Despite not observing significant changes in cldnj expression in the brain tissue of hadal snailfish compared to Tanaka's snailfish, it is important to consider that the brain may not be the primary site of cldnj expression. Previous studies in zebrafish have consistently shown expression of cldnj in the otocyst during the critical early growth phase of the otolith, with a lower level of expression observed in the zebrafish brain. However, due to the unavailability of otocyst samples from hadal snailfish in our current study, our findings do not provide confirmation of any additional expression changes resulting from cldnj amplification. Consequently, it is crucial to conduct future comprehensive investigations to explore the expression patterns of cldnj specifically in the otocyst of hadal snailfish. Accordingly, we added a discussion of this result in the main text (lines 209-214): “In our investigation, we found that the expression of cldnj was not significantly up-regulated in the brain of the hadal snailfish than in Tanaka’s snailfish, which may be related to the fact that cldnj is mainly expressed in the otocyst, while the expression in the brain is lower. However, due to the immense challenge in obtaining samples of hadal snailfish, the expression of cldnj in the otocyst deserves more in-depth study in the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 225-231: I wonder whether low expression of a circadian gene might be a time of day effect rather than an evolutionary trait. Could the authors comment?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Thank you for your suggestions. Previous studies have shown that the grpr gene is expressed relatively consistently in mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) throughout the day (Figure 4-figure supplements 1) and we hypothesize that the low expression of grpr-1 gene expression in hadal snailfish is an evolutionary trait. We have modified this result in the main text (lines 232-242): “In addition, in the teleosts closely related to hadal snailfish, there are usually two copies of grpr encoding the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor; we noticed that in hadal snailfish one of them is absent and the other is barely expressed in brain (Figure 4C), whereas a previous study found that the grpr gene in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) did not fluctuate significantly during a 24-hour light/dark cycle and had a relatively stable expression (Pembroke, Babbs, Davies, Ponting, &amp; Oliver, 2015) (Figure 4-figure supplements 1). It has been reported that grpr deficient mice, while exhibiting normal circadian rhythms, show significantly increased locomotor activity in dark conditions (Wada et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2023). We might therefore speculate that the absence of that gene might in some way benefit the activity of hadal snailfish under complete darkness.”</p><fig id="sa3fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Expression of the grpr in a 24-hour light/dark cycle in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).</title><p>Data source with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq">http://www.wgpembroke.com/shiny/SCNseq</ext-link>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87198-sa3-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 253: What is gpr27?

This scaffold was then merged with the human genome to assess the expression levels of each gene in the three transcriptome datasets. The results demonstrated that the fthl27 gene exhibited the highest expression in fthl27-transfected HEK293T cells, while in the control group, the expression of the fthl27 gene was negligible (TPM = 0).
