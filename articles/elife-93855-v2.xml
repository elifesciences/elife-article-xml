During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO<sub>2</sub>. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though many studies indicate that these degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to the carbon flow in marine systems, we know little about how cells alternate between polysaccharide degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate, both in its soluble polymeric form as well as on its breakdown products. We used microfluidics coupled to time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. We found that single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, and this is accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward polymeric but not digested alginate, likely enabling them to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal cellular mechanisms that might also underlie bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles, which influence the remineralization of biomass in marine environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF270</kwd><kwd>glycan</kwd><kwd>cell dispersal</kwd><kwd>alginate</kwd><kwd>exoenzyme</kwd><kwd>colony formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>Marie Sklodovska-Curie Actions for People COFUND program fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEL-37-16-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Souza</surname><given-names>Glen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ETH Career Seed Grant FEL-14 18-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Souza</surname><given-names>Glen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#542379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ackermann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#542395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stocker</surname><given-names>Roman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Degradation products of polysaccharides trigger partial population dispersal and alter cellular metabolism, shaping the marine biomass decomposition by foraging bacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polysaccharides represent the largest fraction of biomass on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BeMiller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reintjes et al., 2019</xref>) and are constantly degraded and remineralized by microorganisms. Polysaccharides, also known as glycans, are long chains of monosaccharide units produced by cells for structural support (e.g. cellulose, chitin, and alginate) or energy storage (e.g. starch or glycogen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BeMiller, 2019</xref>). Heterotrophic microbes obtain nutrients and energy from the polysaccharide breakdown products. They often use exoenzymes, either secreted or anchored in the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reintjes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratzke and Gore, 2016</xref>), to cleave these large polymers into smaller units that can be taken up by cells. The formation of dense cell groups is observed during growth on polysaccharides by diverse bacteria, including the soil- and gut-dwelling <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratzke and Gore, 2016</xref>), the oligotrophic fresh-water <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Povolo et al., 2022</xref>), and several representatives of the copiotrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2014</xref>) marine <italic>Vibrio spp</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartzman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). It has been suggested that ‘cooperative’ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratzke and Gore, 2016</xref>), where dense cell groups reduce diffusional loss of valuable degradation products and secreted exoenzymes, represents a general principle in polysaccharide degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Povolo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). Yet, how bacteria subsequently disperse from exhausted polysaccharide sources and navigate towards new polysaccharide hotspots remains poorly understood.</p><p>To study the cellular mechanisms that govern the switch between polysaccharide degradation and dispersal toward new polysaccharide hotspots, we worked with the ubiquitous marine Gammaproteobacterium <italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, a degrader of the prevalent marine polysaccharide alginate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that is produced by brown algae as a cell wall component, as well as by certain bacteria. It can be cleaved into oligomers by endo-acting alginate lyases or into monomers by exo-acting alginate lyases (alginate lyases reviewed here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2000</xref>), namely β-D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mabeau and Kloareg, 1987</xref>). <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 is found predominantly in the large-particle fractions of coastal water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunt et al., 2008</xref>), can attach and form biofilms on the surfaces of multiple polysaccharides including alginate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yawata et al., 2014</xref>), and was shown to secrete alginate lyases during alginate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). In this study, we used microfluidics coupled to automated time-lapse imaging to quantify the growth dynamics, group formation, and motility of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 at the single-cell level under constant supply of either polymeric alginate or alginate degradation product in the form of digested alginate, as well as upon a transition from alginate to digested alginate. Furthermore, we used RNA-sequencing to compare the gene expression of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 grown on alginate and digested alginate. We found striking responses to the form of alginate in growth rate, group formation, motility and chemotaxis, as well as in the expression of corresponding genes. Overall, our work provides insights into the metabolic and cellular regulation that allows cells to forage in heterogeneous nutrient-scapes through degradation-dispersal cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extracellular break down of alginate delays population growth</title><p>To probe the phenotypic and metabolic regulation of bacterial cells during the progressive degradation of a polysaccharide source, we developed an experimental system consisting of the marine bacterium <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 growing on alginate, a highly abundant polysaccharide in the ocean. To mimic the local nutrient environment during the colonization of a new polysaccharide source, we used 0.1% weight per volume (w/v) algae-derived alginate in its soluble form (in the following also simply referred to as ‘alginate’). Since commercially available alginate breakdown products of specific sizes are limited and expensive, with only one monomeric component available at a considerable cost, we simulate an advanced stage of polysaccharide degradation by supplying cells with digested alginate (0.1% (w/v)). This digested alginate is prepared by treating alginate with a readily available endo-acting alginate lyase (see Materials and methods). This mimics an environment where degradation products like monomers and oligomers become abundant through the action of extracellular alginate lyases. The commercially available alginate lyase has been shown to produce alginate oligomers of progressively smaller size over extended digestion periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the composition of the digested alginate, which had been subject to 48 hr of digestion. We found that digested alginate contained more monosaccharides than untreated alginate, which contained more alginate molecules of higher molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Using this system, we first set out to investigate the growth dynamics of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 in well-mixed batch cultures containing either alginate or digested alginate as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Measurements of optical density showed that the onset of growth on alginate was delayed by about 7.5 hr compared to growth on digested alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations that in well-mixed environments the lag time of bacteria growing on alginate can be reduced by the external supplementation of alginate lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). We also observed that the optical density at stationary phase was higher when cells were grown on alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, colony counts did not show a significant difference in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the increased optical density may stem from aggregation of cells in the alginate medium, as observed for other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwartzman et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that growth on polysaccharides such as alginate in well-mixed cultures is initially limited by the extracellular breakdown of the polysaccharide, although similar cell numbers were reached eventually.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Large cell groups form on alginate but not on digested alginate</title><p>To better understand how cells react to the changing degree of depolymerization of a polysaccharide source during degradation, we investigated the growth of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 at the level of single cells on alginate and digested alginate. For this purpose, we grew the cells in microfluidic growth chambers, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and described in detail by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dal Co et al., 2020</xref>. In brief, the microfluidic chips are made of an inert polymer (polydimethylsiloxane) bound to a glass coverslip. The PDMS layer contains flow channels through which the culture medium is pumped continuously. Each channel is connected to several growth chambers that are laterally positioned. The dimensions of these growth chambers (height: 0.85 µm, length: 60 µm, width: 90–120 µm) allow cells to freely move and grow as monolayers. The culture medium, containing either alginate or digested alginate in their soluble form, is constantly pumped through the flow channel and enters the growth chambers primarily through diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dal Co et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D’Souza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Povolo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D’Souza et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). Therefore, the number of cells and their positioning within microfluidic chambers is determined by the cellular growth rate as well as by cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Povolo et al., 2022</xref>). This setup combined with time-lapse microscopy allowed us to follow the development of cell communities over time. We found that over 24 hr dense groups of more than 1000 cells formed on alginate, filling the entire microfluidic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, cells supplied with digested alginate grew in smaller groups that never exceeded 100 cells per chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Reconstructed cell lineages revealed that the large cell groups on alginate formed because cells often did not disperse after division and thereby formed dense cell groups originating from a single cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lower cell density on digested alginate could be caused by slower growth or by more cells leaving the chambers. As the maximum growth rate both in bulk and on single cell level is similar in alginate and digested alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is more likely that the lower cell density in digested alginate is caused by cell dispersal. To test the role of increased viscosity of polymeric alginate in causing the increased aggregation of cells, we measured the viscosity of 0.1% (w/v) alginate or digested alginate dissolved in TR media. For alginate, the viscosity was 1.03±0.01 mPa·s (mean and standard deviation of three technical replicates) whereas the viscosity of digested alginate in TR media was found to be 0.74±0.01 mPa·s. Both these values are relatively close to the viscosity of water at this temperature (0.89 mPa·s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berstad et al., 1988</xref>) and, while they may affect swimming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zöttl and Yeomans, 2019</xref>), they are insufficient to physically restrain cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg and Turner, 1979</xref>).

Following the limited cell motility on alginate, this switch led to a rapid decrease in cell density within the growth chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), presumably caused by cell dispersal. As we previously reported for other <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic> isolates, the growth rate of the cells on alginate was dependent on the local cell density: Initially, the growth rate increased with cell density but then decreased at high cell densities, indicating that cell groups can benefit from the sharing of breakdown products generated by each other’s exoenzymes, but also increasingly compete for nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 2023a</xref>). This led us to investigate whether cells in larger groups, potentially experiencing stronger nutrient competition, might have a higher propensity to disperse after a switch to digested alginate than cells in smaller groups. We indeed found that the nutrient switch caused a few or no cells to disperse from small cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas a large fraction of cells from large cell groups dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

It contains additional genes involved in protein export, implicating them as interesting subjects to further research in their role in protein secretion and cell attachment and detachment during degradation-dispersal cycles of polysaccharide-degrading bacteria. Also, the gene set of transporters and in particular ABC transporters were positively enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10 supp11">Supplementary file 10 and 11</xref>). The latter showed enrichment especially in genes related to saccharide, iron, zinc, and phosphate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), which suggests that cells growing on digested alginate invest proportionally more of their transcriptome into uptake of not only saccharides but also essential nutrients like iron, zinc, and phosphate, which may become growth-limiting when degradation products are abundantly available.</p><p>Both motility and quorum sensing genes increased in expression in cells growing on digested alginate. The positive enrichment of the gene set containing bacterial motility proteins aligned with our expectations based on the increase in motile cells that we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>.

This role in dispersal is in agreement with a previous study that showed induction of the quorum sensing master regulator in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells during dispersal from biofilms on a similar time scale as here (less than an hour; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singh et al., 2017</xref>).

The strong cellular response to the degree of alginate depolymerization was also emphasized by the finding that transcription factor genes were enriched among genes with decreased expression on digested alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>). The set of genes associated to KEGG’s beta-lactam resistance category was enriched in genes with increased expression on digested alginate. However, most genes in this gene set are also associated to the KEGG pathways ‘Transporters’, ‘Quorum sensing’, ‘Chromosome and associated genes’, and ‘Peptidoglycan biosynthesis’ and thus the enrichment likely reflects expression changes in these categories and may relate to the difference in growth dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp15">Supplementary file 15</xref>).

In the genome of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 we found a gene cluster that encodes most genes involved in flagellar assembly and that was flanked by chemotaxis genes (hereon called flagellar locus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp17">Supplementary file 17</xref>). Overall, 21/34 flagellar locus genes were differentially expressed (log2 fold change &gt;0.5, BH-adjusted p-value &lt;0.01) and the majority (90%) of these differentially expressed genes showed increased expression on digested alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The expression of flagellar biosynthesis genes in <italic>Vibrionacaea</italic> occurs by a cascade of gene expression of four classes of genes (Class I - IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prouty et al., 2001</xref>). We found the expression of the master regulator of the flagellar biosynthesis regulon, the Class I gene <italic>flrA</italic>, to be 1.6-fold increased on digested alginate (BH-adj. p-value 3e-19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klose and Mekalanos, 1998</xref>). The Class II regulatory genes <italic>flrBC</italic>, controlling Class III genes, and <italic>fliA</italic>, controlling Class IV genes, showed 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold increased expression on digested alginate (BH-adj. p-value 1e-12 for <italic>flrB</italic>, 2e-39 for <italic>flrC</italic>, 6e-15 for <italic>fliA;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Echazarreta and Klose, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Srivastava et al., 2013</xref>). These findings suggest that the increased phenotypic motility observed on digested alginate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is related to the upregulation of flagellar biosynthesis genes. Additionally, the expression of the flagellum filament, encoded by <italic>fliC</italic> genes of the flagellar locus, was partially increased: <italic>flaD</italic> and <italic>flaC</italic> expression were increased by 3.8 and 1.6-fold, whereas the <italic>flaA</italic> gene was not significantly differentially expressed (BH-adj. <italic>p</italic>-value 7e-37, 2e-19, and 1e-02, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Over the last years, the study of extracellular bacterial degradation of polysaccharides has revealed that bacterial growth on polysaccharides increases with increased cell density, enabling cells to benefit from the exoenzymes and extracellular degradation products of surrounding cells otherwise lost to diffusion (‘cooperative growth’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ebrahimi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drescher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2021</xref>). However, cells have been observed not only to aggregate on polysaccharide sources, but also to leave them before the source is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yawata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2021</xref>). This cycle of biomass degradation and dispersal has long been discussed in the context of foraging e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yawata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenchel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Preheim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yawata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDougald et al., 2012</xref>, but the cellular mechanisms that drive the cell dispersal remain unclear.</p><p>Our work links these observations and connects them to the cellular mechanisms that underlie the degradation-dispersal cycles of bacterial degraders, which we see as basal drivers of the biogeochemical processing of polysaccharides in heterogeneous nutrient-scapes. When bacteria encounter a new source of biomass, their local environment likely contains few mono- or oligosaccharides but is rich in polysaccharides which usually require extracellular breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘Finding a new nutrient source’). General concepts of how bacteria recognize the presence of large biopolymers remain elusive, but it was proposed that ‘sentry’ enzymes are constitutively expressed at a basal level to cleave mono- or oligosaccharides from polysaccharides, which cells can take up and which prime their metabolism for the degradation of the respective polysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dudek et al., 2020</xref>). It is not known yet how widespread the concept of sentry enzymes may be, but the observation of a constitutively expressed PL7 and PL15 family alginate lyase gene in <italic>Z. galactanivorans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>) is mirrored in our work by the constant expression of an extracellular PL7 family alginate lyase gene, which may act as sentry enzyme that helps to initiate alginate degradation when cells encounter alginate.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Bacterial growth and regulation on patches of polysaccharides.</title><p>By integrating our results with previous studies on cooperative growth on the same system, as well as results on dispersal cycles in other systems, we highlight where the specific results of this work add to this framework (bold font). When cells encounter polymer sources, the colonization of the nutrient hotspot may be aided by the basal exoenzyme production of ‘sentry’ enzymes (‘Encounter of a new carbon source’). This phase is succeeded by group formation, which enables cells to benefit from exoenzymes of neighboring cells and diffusing degradation products (‘Early-stage polysaccharide breakdown’). The following phase includes cooperative extracellular degradation of the polysaccharide source, further increasing the concentration of available degradation products. These degradation products trigger the overexpression of alginate degrading, importing, and catabolizing enzymes, ensuring swift polysaccharide degradation (‘Late-stage polysaccharide breakdown’). The increased pool of breakdown products also cues flagellar swimming in a subpopulation of cells and increases the expression of chemotaxis genes. Polymeric alginate acts as chemoattractant towards new polysaccharide sources. Cells and molecules are not drawn to scale.

We found that cells grown on degradation products reach their maximal growth earlier and show increased expression of ribosomal biosynthesis, enzyme secretion, especially of secreted alginate lyases, transporters, quorum sensing and expression changes in the central carbon metabolism. The secretion of alginate lyases might seem surprising and wasteful in a monomer-rich environment. One reason for this observation may be that cells primarily rely on intracellular monosaccharide levels to trigger the upregulation of genes associated with polysaccharide degradation and catabolism, as has previously been observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> across various carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez-Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, the majority of carbon sources are sensed by prokaryotes through one-component sensors inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>). In the one-component internal sensing scheme, the enzymes and transporters for the use of various carbon sources are expressed at basal levels, which leads to an increase in pathway intermediates upon nutrient availability. The pathway intermediates are sensed by an internal sensor, usually a transcription factor, and lead to the upregulation of transporter and enzyme expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez-Antonio et al., 2006</xref>). This results in a positive feedback loop, which enables small changes in substrate abundance to trigger large transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wall et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the presence of alginate breakdown products may likely result in increased expression of all components of the alginate degradation pathway, including the expression of degrading enzymes. As the gene expression analysis was performed on well-mixed cultures in culture medium containing alginate breakdown products, we therefore expect a strong stimulation of alginate catabolism. In a natural scenario, where cells disperse from a polysaccharide hotspot before its exhaustion, the expression of alginate catabolism genes may likely decrease again once the local concentration of breakdown products decreases. However, continued production of alginate lyases could also provide an advantage when encountering a new alginate source and continued production of alginate lyases may thus help cells to prepare for likely future environments. Further investigations of bacterial enzyme secretion in changing nutrient environments and at relevant spatial scales are required to improve our understanding of the regulation of enzyme secretion along nutrient gradients.</p><p>We show that cells respond to the exposure to degradation products with dispersal from dense cell groups by means of increased flagellum-driven swimming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘Late-stage polysaccharide breakdown’), decreasing their local cell number. This finding matches with previous observations of cells leaving biopolymer particles before they are depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yawata et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2021</xref>). A plausible explanation for this density-dependent dispersal is that cells in larger groups compete with each other for nutrients and space, while not profiting from cooperative degradation anymore due to the abundance of degradation products. Motility has also been shown to increase the encounter rate of cells with sources of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meibom et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting motility as a strategy that allows cells to escape from the ensuing competition. Previous work in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> demonstrated that a flagellum knock-out mutant formed larger cell groups, resulting in reduced growth rates due to intercellular competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Povolo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D’Souza et al., 2021</xref>). While it would be interesting to study non-motile mutants of <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270, the non-tractability of natural isolates makes direct tests of molecular mechanisms difficult. Additionally, subjecting cells separately to the two monomeric units of alginate or oligomers of defined size could improve our understanding of the specific molecules that trigger motility, but this was experimentally not feasible.</p><p>Direct chemotaxis towards polysaccharides may facilitate the search for new polysaccharide sources after dispersal. We found that the presence of degradation products not only induces cell dispersal but also increases the expression of chemotaxis genes. Interestingly, we found that <italic>V. cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 cells show chemotaxis towards polymeric alginate but not digested alginate. This contrasts with previous findings for bacterial strains degrading the insoluble marine polysaccharide chitin, where chemotaxis was strongest towards chitin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassler et al., 1991</xref>), suggesting that oligomers may act as an environmental cue for polysaccharide nutrient sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keegstra et al., 2022</xref>). However, recent work has shown that certain marine bacteria are attracted to the marine polysaccharide laminarin, and not laminarin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clerc et al., 2023</xref>). Together with our results, this indicates that chemotaxis towards soluble polysaccharides may be mediated by the polysaccharide molecules themselves. The mechanism of this behavior is yet to be identified, but could be mediated by polysaccharide-binding proteins as have been found in <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> sp. A1 facilitating chemotaxis towards pectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Konishi et al., 2020</xref>). Direct polysaccharide sensing adds complexity to chemosensing as polysaccharides cannot freely diffuse into the periplasm, which can lead to a trade-off between chemosensing and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Norris et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, most polysaccharides are not immediately metabolically accessible as they require degradation. But direct polysaccharide sensing can also provide certain benefits compared to using oligomers as sensory cues. First, it could enable bacterial strains to preferably navigate to polysaccharide nutrients sources that are relatively uncolonized and hence show little degradation activity. Second, strong chemotaxis towards degradation products could hinder a timely dispersal process as the dispersal then requires cells to travel against a strong attractant gradient formed by the degradation products. Overall, this strategy allows cells to alternate between degradation and dispersal to acquire carbon and energy in a heterogeneous world with nutrient hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenchel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackburn and Fenchel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackburn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smriga et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The heterogeneous landscape of polysaccharide hotspots in natural systems requires bacteria to effectively break down polymeric carbohydrates as well as readily ensure dispersal to new nutrient hotspots. Our findings show that the degree of depolymerization of the polysaccharide influences this decision, altering the growth dynamics, metabolic activity, and motility of cells. Our study also contextualizes the surprising finding that foraging bacteria majorly leave polysaccharide particles before the last third of the particle is consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2021</xref>). Dispersal from a partially degraded carbon source may serve several purposes: (i) escaping competition that ensues within large cell groups, (ii) ensuring the spread of a part of the clonal population to new environments as bet hedging strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDougald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ronce, 2007</xref>), here guided by chemotaxis towards new nutrient hotspots, (iii) preventing whole populations degrading a sinking marine particle or a deposited sediment particle to be buried in depth where nutrient hotspots become sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcolombri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fenchel, 2008</xref>), and/or (iv) increase the genetic variation in bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDougald et al., 2012</xref>). However, dispersal may also occur when a nutrient source offers a surplus of carbon while other essential nutrients become limiting, as the increased expression of iron, zinc, and phosphate transporters in cells grown on digested alginate suggested. These findings emphasize that metabolic molecules can also act as triggers of dispersal, expanding upon the current perspective of dispersal in biofilms as a reaction to dispersal cues like NO, signaling molecules, nutrient starvation, and oxygen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rumbaugh and Sauer, 2020</xref>). The study of bacterial motility on increasingly complex biomass particles will reveal the role of the nutrient composition of the present nutrient hotspot on the bacterial decision-making. Overall, these new insights into the cellular mechanisms and regulation that drive degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to our understanding of the microbially driven remineralization of biomass, and factors that modulate this process. The open questions of how bacteria sense polysaccharides in their environment, which cell signaling pathways integrate the presence of degradation products in the cellular decision-making of degradation and dispersal, and to what extent cell populations coordinate this decision, present an exciting avenue of further research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, media, and growth assays</title><p><italic>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</italic> ZF270 (available through Culture Collection Of Switzerland; Accession number: 2043) cells were cultured in Marine Broth (DIFCO) and grown for 18 hr at 25 °C. Cells from these cultures were used for growth experiments in Tibbles Rawling (TR) salts minimal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hehemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tibbles and Rawlings, 1994</xref>) containing either 0.1% (weight/volume) algae-derived alginate (referred to as ‘alginate’; Sigma-Aldrich, CAS-number 9005-38-3) or 0.1% (weight/volume) digested alginate. At these concentrations, both alginate and digested alginate are soluble in the culture medium. The digested alginate was produced by enzymatically digesting 2% alginate with 1 unit ml<sup>–1</sup> of alginate lyase (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS-number 9024-15-1) at 37 °C for 48 hr. In our experiment we used 1 unit/ml of alginate lyases in a 4.5 ml solution to digest the alginate. As the commercially purchased alginate lyases are 10,000 units/g, our 4.5 ml solution contains 0.45 mg of alginate lyase protein. The digested alginate solution diluted 45 x when added to culture medium. This means that we added 0.18 µg alginate lyase protein to 1 ml of culture medium. Based on the above calculation, we conclude that the amount of protein added to the growth medium by the addition of alginate lyases is so small that we consider it negligible. As a comparison, for 1 ml of alginate medium, 1000 µg of alginate is added or for 1 ml of Lysogeny broth (LB) culture medium, 3,500 µg of LB are added. Thus, the amount of alginate lyase protein that we added is ca. 5000–20,000 times smaller than the amount of alginate or LB that one would add to support cell growth. Therefore, we expect the growth that the digestion of the added alginate lyases would allow to be negligible.</p><p>Carbon sources were prepared in nanopure water and filter sterilized using 0.40 µm Surfactant-Free Cellulose Acetate filters (Corning, USA).

The culture was diluted down to 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>–1</sup> in 0.22 μm filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) to perform the chemotaxis experiment.

The data are measurements of motility and gene expressing using microfluidic devices and RNA sequencing. The results reveal that degradation products of alginate do stimulate motility but not chemotaxis. In contrast, alginate itself (the polymer) does stimulate chemotaxis. Further, the dispersal from degrading alginate is density dependent, increasing at higher density. The evidence for these claims are strong. From these the authors propose a narrative (Fig. 6) for growth and dispersal cycles in this system. The idea is that cells colonize and degrade alginate, this degradation stimulates motility and dispersal followed by chemotaxis to a new alginate source. This complete narrative has modest support in the data. A quantitative description of these dynamics awaits future studies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The microfluidic measurements are the central strength of the paper. The density dependence claim is qualitatively supported by the data. The motility and chemotaxis claims are also well supported by the data. The presentation of the experiment and results are well done. The study serves to motivate a unifying picture of growth and dispersal in marine systems. This is a key process in the global carbon cycle.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Perhaps not a weakness, but a glimmer that this is not yet the full story. The RNA expression data show alginate lyase expression in response to digested alginate which is unexpected given the narrative articulated above. Why express lyases while leaving the polymer patch via motility? This question is addressed in the Discussion. A holistic and quantitative picture of the proposed process in Figure 6 awaits additional studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93855.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Stubbusch and coauthors examine the foraging behavior of a marine species consuming an abundant marine polysaccharide.

I found myself confused about many of the genes (e.g., quorum sensing) that pop up enriched during dispersal quite in contrast to my expectations. While the authors do mention some of this in the text as worth following up on, I think the analysis as it stands adds little insight into the behaviors studied. However, I acknowledge that it might have the potential to generate hypotheses and thus aid future studies. Further, I found the connections to the carbon cycle and marine environments in the abstract weak --- the microfluidics setup by the authors is nice, but it provides limited insight into naturalistic environments where the spatial distribution and dimensionality of resources are expected to be qualitatively different.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestions to improve our manuscript. We agree that the original manuscript would have benefitted from more detailed interpretation of the observed changes in gene expression. We have revised the manuscript to elaborate on the interpretation of the changes in expression of quorum sensing genes (see response to reviewer 1, comment 3), motility genes (see response to reviewer 1, comment 6), alginate lyase genes (see response to reviewer 1, comment 7 and reviewer 2, comment 2), and ribosomal and transporter genes (see response to reviewer 2, comment 2).</p><p>In general, we think that the gene expression study not only supports the phenotypic observations that we made in the microfluidic device, such as the increased swimming motility when exposed to digested alginate medium, but also adds further insights. Our reasoning for studying the transcriptomes in well mixed-batch cultures was the inability to study gene expression dynamics to support the phenotypic observations about differential motility and chemotaxis in our microfluidics setup. The transcriptomic data clearly show that even in well-mixed environments, growth on digested alginate instead of alginate is sufficient to increase the expression of motility and chemotaxis genes. In addition, the finding that expression of alginate lyases and metabolic genes is increased during growth on digested alginate was revealed through the analysis of transcriptomes, something which would not have been possible in the microfluidic setup. We agree with the reviewer that our analyses implicate further, perhaps unexpected, mechanisms like quorum sensing in the cellular response to breakdown products, and that this represents an interesting avenue for further studies.</p><p>Finally, we also agree with the reviewer that it would be good to be more explicit in the text that our microfluidic system cannot fully capture the complex dynamics of natural environments. Our approach does, however, allow the characterization of cellular behaviors at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to the interactions of bacteria, and thus provides a better understanding of colonization and dispersal of marine bacteria in a manner that is not possible through in situ experiments. We have edited our manuscript to highlight this and modified our statements regarding carbon cycling towards emphasizing the role degradation-dispersal cycles in remineralization of polysaccharides (see response to reviewer 1, comment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...]</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The explanation of the microfluidics measurements is somewhat confusing but I think this could be easily remedied.

We have revised the manuscript with these suggestions in mind and believe that the manuscript is improved by a more detailed explanation of the microfluidic setup.

We have also modified the presentation and discussion of the dispersal data (Fig. 2C), as described in detail below in response to reviewer 2, comment 4, and argue that they clearly show density-dependent dispersal. We believe that this modification of how the results are presented provides a more convincing case for our main conclusion, namely that the presence of degradation products controls bacterial dispersal in a density-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...]</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I find this paper very descriptive and speculative.

We have edited the manuscript to interpret the results of this study more clearly, in particular with regard to the fact that breakdown products of alginate cause cell dispersal (see response to reviewer 2, comment 1), gene expression changes of ribosomal proteins and transporters (see response to reviewer 2, comment 2), as well as genes relating to alginate catabolism (see response to reviewer 2, comment 3).</p><p>To provide more context for the interpretation of our results we now also embed our findings in more detail in the previous work on foraging strategies and dispersal tradeoffs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors should clarify in more detail what they mean by density dependence in Figure 2. Usually density dependence refers to a per capita dependence, but here it seems that the per capita rate of dispersal might be roughly independent of density (Figure 2c; if you double the number of cells it doubles the number of cells leaving). Rather it seems the dispersal is such that the density of remaining cells falls below a threshold (~300 cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. To analyze the data more explicitly in terms of per capita dependence and so make the density dependence in the dispersal from the microfluidic chambers more clear, we have modified Figure 2C and edited the text.</p><p>In the modified Figure 2C, we computed the fraction of dispersed cells for each chamber (i.e the change in cell number divided by the cell number at the time of the nutrient switch).

I do not believe the results as they stand could be used to understand degradation-dispersal cycles in marine environments relevant to the carbon cycle, since these behaviors have been studied in microfluidic environments which in my understanding are quite different. As such, statements such as &quot;degradation-dispersal cycles are an integral part in the global carbon cycle, we know little about how cells alternate between degradation and motility&quot; and &quot;Overall, our findings reveal the cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles that drive remineralization in natural environments&quot; are overstated in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments regarding the connections of our work with the carbon cycle. We have now rephrased these statements in our manuscript to describe a potential connection between our work and the marine carbon cycle. The colonization of polysaccharides particles by bacteria and subsequent degradation has been widely acknowledged to play a significant role in controlling the carbon flow in marine ecosystems. (Fenchel, 2002; Preheim et al., 2011; Yawata et al., 2014, 2020). We still refer to carbon flow in the revised manuscript, though cautiously, as microbial remineralization of biomass, which is recognized as an important factor in the marine biological carbon pump (e.g., Chisholm, 2000; Jiao et al., 2024). As stated in the previous version of the manuscript, the main motivation of our work was to study the growth behaviors of marine heterotrophic bacteria during polysaccharide degradation, especially to understand when bacteria depart already colonized and degraded particles and find novel patches to grow and degrade, a process that is poorly understood. Therefore, it is conceivable that degradation-dispersal cycles do play a role in the flow of carbon in marine ecosystems. However, we acknowledge that the carbon cycle is influenced by a multitude of biological and chemical processes, and the bacterial degradation-dispersal cycle might not be the sole mechanism at play.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s comments highlighting that the complexity of natural environments is not fully captured in our microfluidics system. However, our microfluidics setup does allow us to quantify responses and behaviors of microbial groups at high spatial and temporal resolution, especially in the context of environmental fluctuations. Microbes in nature interact at small spatial scales and have to respond to changes in the environment, and the microfluidics setup enables the quantification of these responses. Moreover, dispersal of the bacterium V. cyclitrophicus that we use in our study, has been previously observed even during growth on particulate alginate (Alcolombri et al., 2021), but the cues and regulation controlling dispersal behaviors have been unclear. Microfluidic experiments have now allowed us to study this process in a highly quantitative manner, and align well with observations from experiments from more nature-like settings. These quantitative experiments on bacterial strains isolated from marine particles are expected to constrain quantitative models of carbon degradation in the ocean (Nguyen et al., 2022).</p><p>We have now adjusted our statements throughout our manuscript to reflect the knowledge gaps in understanding the triggers of degradation-dispersal cycles and their links with carbon flow in marine ecosystems. The revised manuscript, especially, contains the following statements (line 47 and line 60):</p><p>“Even though many studies indicate that these degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to the carbon flow in marine systems, we know little about how cells alternate between polysaccharide degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch.”</p><p>“Overall, our findings reveal cellular mechanisms that might also underlie bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles, which influence the remineralization of biomass in marine environments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should clarify why they think quorum-sensing genes are increased in expression on digested alginate. The authors currently mention that QS could be used to trigger dispersal, but given the timescales of dispersal in Figure 2 (~half an hour), I find it hard to believe that these genes are expressed and have the suggested effect on those timescales. As such I would have expected the other way round - for QS genes to be expressed highly during alginate growth, so that density could be sensed and responded to. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified this point in the revised manuscript. While the triggering of dispersal by quorum-sensing genes may indeed appear counterintuitive, and the response is rapid (we see dispersal of cells within 30-40 minutes), both observations are in line with previous studies in another model organism <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. The dispersal time is similar to the dispersal time of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells from biofilms, as described by Singh and colleagues, (Figure 1E of Ref. Singh et al., 2017). In that case, induction of the quorum sensing dispersal regulator HapR was observed during biofilm dispersal within one hour after switch of condition (Fig. 2, middle panel of Ref. Singh et al., 2017). Even though the specific quorum sensing signaling molecules are probably different in our strain (there is no annotated homolog of the hapR gene in V. cyclitrophicus), we observed that the full set of quorum sensing genes was enriched in cells growing on digested alginate (as reported in line 314 and Fig. 4A).</p><p>We have added this information in the manuscript (line 317):</p><p>“The set of quorum sensing genes was also positively enriched in cells growing on digested alginate (Fig. 4A and S4F, Table S13). This role in dispersal is in agreement with a previous study that showed induction of the quorum sensing master regulator in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells during dispersal from biofilms on a similar time scale as here (less than an hour) [28].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Around line 144 - I don't really understand how you flow alginate through the microfluidic platform. It seems if the particles are transiently going through the microfluidic chamber then the flow rate and hence residence time of the alginate particles will matter a lot by controlling the time the cells have to colonize and excrete enzymes for alginate breakdown. Or perhaps the alginate is not particulate but is instead a large but soluble polymer? I think maybe a schematic of the microfluidic device would help -- there is an implicit assumption that we are familiar with the Dal Co et al device, but I don't recall its details and maybe a graphic added to Figure 1 would help.</p><p>a. In reviewing the Dal Co paper I see that cells are trapped and the medium flows through channels and the plane where the cells are held. I am still a little confused about the size of the polymeric alginate -- large scale (&gt;1um) particles or very small polymers?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a detailed description of our microfluidic experimental system. At the start of the experiments, cells are in fact not trapped within the microfluidic device, but grow and can move freely within a chamber designed with dimensions (sub-micron heights) so that growth occurs only as a monolayer. Cells were exposed to nutrients, either alginate or alginate digestion products, both in soluble form (not particles). These compounds were flowed into the device through a main channel, but entered the flowfree growth chambers by diffusion. To make these aspects of our experiments clearer, we have added further information on this in the Materials &amp; Methods section (line 556), added this information in the abstract (line 51), and in the results (line123).</p><p>To make our microfluidic setup clearer, we have followed this advice and added a schematic as Figure 1A and have added more information on the setup to the main text (line 153):</p><p>“In brief, the microfluidic chips are made of an inert polymer (polydimethylsiloxane) bound to a glass coverslip. The PDMS layer contains flow channels through which the culture medium is pumped continuously. Each channel is connected to several growth chambers that are laterally positioned. The dimensions of these growth chambers (height: 0.85 µm, length: 60 µm, width: 90-120 µm) allow cells to freely move and grow as monolayers. The culture medium, containing either alginate or digested alginate in their soluble form, is constantly pumped through the flow channel and enters the growth chambers primarily through diffusion [15,16,4,17,8]. Therefore, the number of cells and their positioning within microfluidic chambers is determined by the cellular growth rate as well as by cell movement4. This setup combined with time-lapse microscopy allowed us to follow the development of cell communities over time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What makes this confusing is the difference between Figure 1C and Figure S2A -- the authors state that the difference in Figure 1C is due to dispersal, but is there flow through the microfluidic device? So what role does that flow through the device have in dispersal? Is the adhesion of the cell groups driven at all by a physical interaction with high molecular weight polymers in the microfluidic devices or is this purely a biological effect? Could this also be explained by different real concentrations of nutrients in the two cases?</p></disp-quote><p>We realize from this comment that the role of flow of the medium in the microfluidic setup was not clearly addressed in our manuscript. In fact, cells were not exposed to flow, and nutrients were provided to the growth chambers by diffusion. We have added a clearer explanation of this point on line 158:</p><p>“The culture medium, containing either alginate or digested alginate in their soluble form, is constantly pumped through the flow channel and enters the growth chambers primarily through diffusion [15,16,4,17,8]. Therefore, the number of cells and their positioning within microfluidic chambers is determined by the cellular growth rate as well as by cell movement4.“</p><p>One purely physical effect that we anticipate is that a high viscosity of the medium could immobilize cells. To address this point, we measured the viscosity of both alginate and digested alginate and conclude that the increase in viscosity is not strong enough to immobilize cells. We added a statement in the text (line 170)</p><p>“To test the role of increased viscosity of polymeric alginate in causing the increased aggregation of cells, we measured the viscosity of 0.1% (w/v) alginate or digested alginate dissolved in TR media. For alginate, the viscosity was 1.03±0.01 mPa·s (mean and standard deviation of three technical replicates) whereas the viscosity of digested alginate in TR media was found to be 0.74±0.01 mPa·s. Both these values are relatively close to the viscosity of water at this temperature (0.89 mPa·s18) and, while they may affect swimming behavior [19], they are insufficient to physically restrain cell movement [20].”</p><p>as well as a section in the Materials and Methods (line 594):</p><p>“Viscosity of the alginate and digested alginate solution</p><p>We measured the viscosity of alginate solutions using shear rheology measurements. We use a 40 mm cone-plate geometry (4° cone) in a Netzsch Kinexus Pro+ rheometer. 1200 uL of sample was placed on the bottom plate, the gap was set at 150 um and the sample trimmed. We used a solvent trap to avoid sample evaporation during measurement. The temperature was set to 25°C using a Peltier element. We measure the dynamic viscosity over a range of shear rates = 0.1 – 100 s-1. We report the viscosity of each solution as the average viscosity measured over the shear rates 10 – 100 s-1, where the shear-dependence of the viscosity was low.</p><p>We measured the viscosity of 0.1% (w/V) alginate dissolved in TR media, which was 1.03 +/- 0.01 mPa·s (reporting the mean and standard deviation of three technical replicates.). The viscosity of 0.1% digested alginate in TR media was found to be 0.74+/-0.01 mPa·s. This means that the viscosity of alginate in our microfluidic experiments is 36% higher than of digested alginate, but the viscosities are close to those expected of water (0.89 mPa·s at 25 degree Celsius according to Berstad and colleagues [18]).”</p><p>While our microfluidic setup allows us to track the position and movement of cells in a spatially structured setting, these observations do not allow us to distinguish directly whether the differences in dispersal are a result of purely physical effects of polymers on cells or are a result of them triggering a biological response in cells that causes them to become sessile. It is known that bacterial appendages like pili interact with polysaccharide residues (Li et al., 2003). Therefore, it is quite plausible that cross-linking by polysaccharides can contribute growth behaviors on alginate. However, our analysis of gene expression demonstrates that flagellum-driven motility is decreased in the presence of alginate compared to digested alginate, alongside other major changes in gene expression. In addition, our measures of dispersal show that dispersal of cells when exposed to digested alginate is density dependent. Both observations suggest that the patterns in dispersal are governed by decision-making processes by cells resulting in changes in cell motility, rather than being a product of purely physical interactions with the polymer.</p><p>The finding that viscosities of both alginate and digested alginate are similar to that of water, suggests that diffusion of nutrients in the growth chambers should be similar. Therefore, we think that the differences in real concentrations of nutrients is likely not contributing to the observed differences in behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Why is Figure S1 arbitrary units?

However, to calibrate the mass spectrometer signals (ion counts) to absolute concentrations for the different alginate compounds, we would need an analytical standard of known concentration. We are not aware of such a standard and thus report only relative concentrations. We agree that the y-axis label of Figure S1 should not contain ‘arbitrary’ units, as it shows a ratio (of measurements in the same arbitrary units). We have edited the labels of Figure S1 accordingly and the figure legend in line 26 of the Supplemental Material (“Relative concentrations…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 188 - density-dependent dispersal. The claim here is that &quot;cells in chambers with many cells were more likely to disperse than cells in chambers with less cells.&quot; (my emphasis). Looking at the data in Figure 2C it appears that about 40% of the cells disperse irrespective of the density, before the switch to digested alginate. So it would seem that there is not a higher likelihood of dispersal at higher cell densities. For the very highest cell density, it does appear that this fraction is larger, but I'd be concerned about making this claim from what I understand to be a single experiment. To support the claim made should the authors plot Change in Cell number/Starting Cell number on the y-axis of Fig. 2C to show that the fraction is increasing? It would seem some additional data at higher starting cell densities would help support this claim more strongly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which is in line with a remark made by reviewer 1 in their comment 1. In response to these two comments (and as described above), we have edited Figure 2C and now have plotted the change in cell number relative to starting cell number at the y axis to directly show the density dependence. We observe a positive (approximately linear) relationship between the fraction of dispersed cells with the number of cells present in the chamber at the time of switching. This indicates that there is a density dependence in the dispersal process, with highly populated chambers showing a higher fraction of dispersed cells.</p><p>In addition to the change in Figure 2C, we have modified the paragraph around line 208: “We indeed found that the nutrient switch caused a few or no cells to disperse from small cell groups (Fig. 2B), whereas a large fraction of cells from large cell groups dispersed (Fig. 2C).

The ecological relevance of this (line 219) seems like an important result that is worth expanding on a bit at least in the discussion. For now, my question is whether the authors know of any mechanism by which chemotaxis receptors could respond to alginate but not the monomer. How can a receptor distinguish between the two?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this result is surprising, given that oligomers can be more easily transported into the periplasm where sensing takes place, and they also provide an easier accessible nutrient source. Indeed, in case of the insoluble polymer chitin it has been shown that chemotaxis towards chitin is mediated by chitin oligomers (Bassler et al., 1991), which was suggested as a general motif to locate polysaccharide nutrient sources (Keegstra et al., 2022). However, a recent study has changed this perspective by showing widespread chemotaxis of marine bacteria towards the glucose-based marine polysaccharide laminarin, but not towards laminarin oligomers or glucose (Clerc et al., 2023). Together with our results on chemotaxis towards alginate (but not significantly toward alginate oligomers) this suggests that chemotaxis towards soluble polysaccharides can be mediated by direct sensing of the polysaccharide molecules.</p><p>As recommended, we expanded the discussion of the ecological relevance and also added more information on possible mechanisms of selective sensing of alginate and its breakdown products (around line 479).:</p><p>“Direct chemotaxis towards polysaccharides may facilitate the search for new polysaccharide sources after dispersal. We found that the presence of degradation products not only induces cell dispersal but also increases the expression of chemotaxis genes. Interestingly, we found that V. cyclitrophicus ZF270 cells show chemotaxis towards polymeric alginate but not digested alginate. This contrasts with previous findings for bacterial strains degrading the insoluble marine polysaccharide chitin, where chemotaxis was strongest towards chitin oligomers53, suggesting that oligomers may act as an environmental cue for polysaccharide nutrient sources55. However, recent work has shown that certain marine bacteria are attracted to the marine polysaccharide laminarin, and not laminarin oligomers56. Together with our results, this indicates that chemotaxis towards soluble polysaccharides may be mediated by the polysaccharide molecules themselves. The mechanism of this behavior is yet to be identified, but could be mediated by polysaccharide-binding proteins as have been found in Sphingomonas sp. A1 facilitating chemotaxis towards pectin57. Direct polysaccharide sensing adds complexity to chemosensing as polysaccharides cannot freely diffuse into the periplasm, which can lead to a trade-off between chemosensing and uptake58. Furthermore, most polysaccharides are not immediately metabolically accessible as they require degradation. But direct polysaccharide sensing can also provide certain benefits compared to using oligomers as sensory cues. First, it could enable bacterial strains to preferably navigate to polysaccharide nutrients sources that are relatively uncolonized and hence show little degradation activity. Second, strong chemotaxis towards degradation products could hinder a timely dispersal process as the dispersal then requires cells to travel against a strong attractant gradient formed by the degradation products. Overall, this strategy allows cells to alternate between degradation and dispersal to acquire carbon and energy in a heterogeneous world with nutrient hotspots [44,59–61].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Comment on lines 287-8 -- that the &quot;positive enrichment of the gene set containing bacterial motility proteins matched the increase in motile cells that we observe in Fig 3E.&quot; I'm confused about what is meant by the word &quot;matched&quot; here. Is the implication that there is some quantitative correspondence between increased motility in Figure 3 and the change in expression in Figure 4? Or is the statement a qualitative one -- that motility genes are upregulated in the presence of digested alginate? Table S12 didn't help me answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comment.

How does this square with the previous narrative about cells growing on alginate digest expressing motility genes and chemotaxing towards alginate? It seems like the story is a bit tenuous here in the sense that digested alginates stimulate both motility - which is hypothesized to drive the discovery of new alginate particles - and lyase enzymes which are used to degrade alginate. So do the high motility cells that are chemotaxing towards alginate also express lyases en route? I'm of the opinion that constructing narratives like these in the absence of a more quantitative understanding of the colonization and degradation dynamics of alginate particles presents a major challenge and may be asking more of the data than the data can provide.</p><p>a. I noted later that this is addressed later around lines 393 in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the notion that the presence of breakdown products triggers motility and also increases the expression of alginate lyases and other metabolic genes for alginate catabolism seems counterintuitive. We have now expanded our discussion of these results to contextualize these findings (around line 443):</p><p>&quot;One reason for this observation may be that cells primarily rely on intracellular monosaccharide levels to trigger the upregulation of genes associated with polysaccharide degradation and catabolism, as has previously been observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> across various carbon sources [50,51]. In fact, the majority of carbon sources are sensed by prokaryotes through one‑component sensors inside the cell50. In the one‑component internal sensing scheme, the enzymes and transporters for the use of various carbon sources are expressed at basal levels, which leads to an increase in pathway intermediates upon nutrient availability. The pathway intermediates are sensed by an internal sensor, usually a transcription factor, and lead to the upregulation of transporter and enzyme expression [50,51]. This results in a positive feedback loop, which enables small changes in substrate abundance to trigger large transcriptional responses [50,52]. Thus, the presence of alginate breakdown products may likely result in increased expression of all components of the alginate degradation pathway, including the expression of degrading enzymes. As the gene expression analysis was performed on well-mixed cultures in culture medium containing alginate breakdown products, we therefore expect a strong stimulation of alginate catabolism. In a natural scenario, where cells disperse from a polysaccharide hotspot before its exhaustion, the expression of alginate catabolism genes may likely decrease again once the local concentration of breakdown products decreases. However, continued production of alginate lyases could also provide an advantage when encountering a new alginate source and continued production of alginate lyases may thus help cells to prepare for likely future environments. Further investigations of bacterial enzyme secretion in changing nutrient environments and at relevant spatial scales are required to improve our understanding of the regulation of enzyme secretion along nutrient gradients.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) I like Figure 6, and I think this hypothesis is a good result from this paper, but I think it would be important to emphasize this as a proposal that needs further quantitative analysis to be supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now edited the manuscript to make this point more clear.

As the commercially purchased alginate lyases are 10,000 units/g, our 4.5 ml solution contains 0.45 mg of alginate lyase protein.

The gene expression data was obtained from batch cultures and measured at the same approximate bacterial densities in batch, which indeed shows that the digested alginate is a sufficient signal for an increase in motility gene expression. This agrees very well with our observation that cells growing on digested alginate in microfluidic chambers have an increased fraction of motile cells in comparison with cells exposed to alginate (Fig 3E). However, we did not mean to suggest that the observed dispersal by bacterial motility is not influenced by cell density, in fact, we see that dispersal (and hence the increase in cell motility) in microfluidic chambers that are switched from polymeric to digested alginate depends on the bacterial density in the chamber, with higher bacterial densities showing increased dispersal. This shows that the presence of alginate oligomers does trigger dispersal through motility, but this signal affects bacterial groups in a cell density dependent manner.</p><p>Similar observations have been made in Caulobacter crescentus, which was found to form cell groups on the polymer xylan while cells disperse when the corresponding monomer xylose becomes available (D’Souza et al., 2021).

This would be in line with observed increased chemotaxis towards the polymer rather than the monomer (Similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic>).</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is in line with reviewer 2, comment 7. In response to these two comments (and as described above), we expanded our discussion of these results to contextualize these findings (around line 443):</p><p>“One reason for this observation may be that cells primarily rely on intracellular monosaccharide levels to trigger the upregulation of genes associated with polysaccharide degradation and catabolism, as has previously been observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> across various carbon sources [50,51].

In the one‑component internal sensing scheme, the enzymes and transporters for the use of various carbon sources are expressed at basal levels, which leads to an increase in pathway intermediates upon nutrient availability. The pathway intermediates are sensed by an internal sensor, usually a transcription factor, and lead to the upregulation of transporter and enzyme expression [50,51]. This results in a positive feedback loop, which enables small changes in substrate abundance to trigger large transcriptional responses [50,52]. Thus, the presence of alginate breakdown products may likely result in increased expression of all components of the alginate degradation pathway, including the expression of degrading enzymes. As the gene expression analysis was performed on well-mixed cultures in culture medium containing alginate breakdown products, we therefore expect a strong stimulation of alginate catabolism. In a natural scenario, where cells disperse from a polysaccharide hotspot before its exhaustion, the expression of alginate catabolism genes may likely decrease again once the local concentration of breakdown products decreases. However, continued production of alginate lyases could also provide an advantage when encountering a new alginate source and continued production of alginate lyases may thus help cells to prepare for likely future environments. Further investigations of bacterial enzyme secretion in changing nutrient environments and at relevant spatial scales are required to improve our understanding of the regulation of enzyme secretion along nutrient gradients.”</p><p>Additionally, we agree with the intriguing comment that continued expression of alginate lyases may also prepare cells for likely future environments. Further studies that aim to answer whether marine bacteria are primed by their growth on one carbon source towards faster re-initiation of degradation on a new particle will be an interesting research question. We now address this point in our manuscript (line 458):</p><p>“However, continued production of alginate lyases could also provide an advantage when encountering a new alginate source and continued production of alginate lyases may thus help cells to prepare for likely future environments.

Only cell counts are similar. Perhaps the author can correct this statement and speculate on the reason leading to this discrepancy: perhaps cells tend to aggregate in alginate despite the fact that these are well-mixed cultures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the description of the OD measurements accordingly and agree with the reviewer that aggregation is indeed a possible reason for the discrepancy (line 141):</p><p>“We also observed that the optical density at stationary phase was higher when cells were grown on alginate (Fig. S2B and C). However, colony counts did not show a significant difference in cell numbers (Fig. S3), suggesting that the increased optical density may stem from aggregation of cells in the alginate medium, as observed for other Vibrio species [7].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I suggest toning down the importance of the results presented in this study for understanding global carbon cycling. There is a link but at present it is too much emphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited our statements regarding the carbon cycle. In the revised manuscript we stress the lack of direct quantifications of carbon cycling. . We still refer to carbon flow in the revised manuscript, as we would argue that microbial remineralization of biomass is recognized as an important factor in the marine biological carbon pump (e.g., Chisholm, 2000) and research on marine bacterial foraging investigates how bacterial cells manage to find and utilize this biomass.</p><p>Our revised manuscript contains the following modified statements (line 47 and line 60): “Even though many studies indicate that these degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to the carbon flow in marine systems, we know little about how cells alternate between polysaccharide degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch.”</p><p>“Overall, our findings reveal cellular mechanisms that might also underlie bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles, which influence the remineralization of biomass in marine environments.”</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Alcolombri, U., Peaudecerf, F.
