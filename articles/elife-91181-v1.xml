Neutralizing antibodies represent ideal candidates to prevent or treat virus disease. However, no antibody has been approved for MARV treatment to date. In this study, we identified a novel human antibody named AF-03 that targeted MARV glycoprotein (GP). AF-03 possessed a high binding affinity to MARV GP and showed neutralizing and protective activities against the pseudotyped MARV in vitro and in vivo. Epitope identification, including molecular docking and experiment-based analysis of mutated species, revealed that AF-03 recognized the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) binding domain within GP1. Interestingly, we found the neutralizing activity of AF-03 to pseudotyped Ebola viruses (EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV) harboring cleaved GP instead of full-length GP. Furthermore, NPC2-fused AF-03 exhibited neutralizing activity to several filovirus species and EBOV mutants via binding to CI-MPR. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that AF-03 represents a promising therapeutic cargo for filovirus-caused disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marburg</kwd><kwd>neutralizing antibody</kwd><kwd>filovirus</kwd><kwd>glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>NPC2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81672803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Guojiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yanchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81871252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yanchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel antibody recognizing receptor-binding region of MARV glycoprotein was developed and displays broad-spectrum neutralizing activity to filovirus species when NPC2 was fused to the N-terminus of the mAb.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Filoviruses are nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses, comprised of six genera, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Cuevavirus, Striavirus, Thamnovirus, and a recently discovered sixth genus, Dianlovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarasinghe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baseler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn et al., 2019</xref>). The Marburgvirus genus consists of Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarasinghe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bào et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ristanović et al., 2020</xref>). The former includes three strains-- Uganda, Angola, and Musoke. The Ebola virus genus includes six distinct species including Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Reston virus (RESTV), Taii Forest virus (TAFV) and Bombali virus (BOMV), the first three of which cause severe hemorrhagic fevers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein et al., 2018</xref>). The genus Cuevavirus (Lloviu virus, LLOV) was isolated from Miniopterus schreibersii bats in Spain and Hungary and potently infected monkeys and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Negredo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kemenesi et al., 2022</xref>). The genus Měnglà virus (MLAV) was discovered in the liver of a bat from Mengla, Yunnan, China in 2019. So far, only an almost complete RNA sequence of the viral genome is available, there are no viable MLAVs isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). MARV and EBOV infect humans and non-human primates, causing Marburg virus disease (MVD) and EBOV virus disease (EVD) with an incubation period of 2–21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehedi et al., 2011</xref>). The symptoms of MVD include severe headache and high fever rapidly within 5 days of the onset of symptoms, followed by diarrhea and vomiting, leading to up to 90% fatality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehedi et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, MARV and EBOV have high potentials to cause a public health emergency.</p><p>Glycoprotein (GP) on the surface of filoviruses is a type I transmembrane protein and consists of GP1 and GP2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beniac and Booth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee and Saphire, 2009</xref>). It is inserted into the virus envelope in the form of homotrimeric spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brauburger et al., 2012</xref>) and is responsible for viral attachment and entry. The furin cleaves Marburg GP at the amino acid 435 into two subunits, GP1 and GP2, which remain linked by a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schafer et al., 2021</xref>). GP1 contains a receptor binding domain (RBD), a glycan cap, and a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain (MLD), which mediates binding to entry factors and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashiguchi et al., 2015</xref>). GP2 has a partial MLD, a transmembrane domain for viral anchoring to the envelop surface, and a fusion peptide required for the fusion of virus and cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fusco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregory et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). In the Ebola virus, the furin cleavage site is located at residue 501 and the entire MLD is attached to the GP1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Volchkov et al., 2000</xref>). Marburg virus contains 66 amino acids on GP2 that are absent from the Ebola virus MLD, and are called ‘wings’ due to their outward projection and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fusco et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Currently, GP is a major target for antibodies validated in filovirus-infected animals and clinical trials because it is exposed on the surface of the virus and plays a key role in viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dye et al., 2012</xref>). Filoviruses initially enter cells by endocytosis or macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrowicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saeed et al., 2010</xref>). Once inside the endosome, GP is cleaved by host cathepsins, and glycan cap and MLD are removed, enabling GP to bind to NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brecher et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Ebola viral entry requires cathepsin B cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez et al., 2010</xref>), which is redundant for MARV entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gnirss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Misasi et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashiguchi et al., 2015</xref> proposed that the receptor binding domain was masked by glycan cap and MLD in the Ebola virus, whereas it was partially exposed in the Marburg virus.</p><p>To date, there is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Marburg infection, although a panel of antibodies with the potentials of neutralization has been isolated from a survivor subjected to MARV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flyak et al., 2015</xref>). Herein, we utilized phage display technology to screen an antibody in a well-established antibody library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and obtained a novel human antibody with prominent neutralizing activity. Furthermore, NPC2 fusion at the N terminus of the light chain of this antibody potentiates broad-spectrum inhibition of cell entry of filovirus species and mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of AF-03</title><p>AF-03 was selected from a well-established phage surface display antibody library with immense diversity in the selected complementarity determining region (CDR) loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2019</xref>). We further subcloned VH and VL sequences of the antibody into a mammalian full-length immunoglobulin expression vector for full-length IgG expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, AF-03 was eukaryotically expressed with the purity of over 95%. To determine the binding affinity, recombinant MARV GP without MLD was prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ELISA analysis showed the remarkable binding of AF-03 to MARV GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, SPR assay was done to determine the binding kinetics and showed that AF-03 bound to MARV GP with high affinity (AF-03 K<sub>D</sub> value was 4.71 × 10<sup>–11</sup> M, monovalent AF-03 Fab KD value was 2.15 × 10<sup>–11</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify determinants of MARV GP binding to AF-03, we utilized computer-guided homology modeling and molecular docking to generate computer models of MARV GP in a complex with AF-03. Specifically, we obtained the theoretical 3D structure of AF-03 Fv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on the 3D structure of AF-03 and MARV GP separately, the 3D complex structure of AF-03 and MARV GP achieved utilizing the molecular docking method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Overall, these data suggest the potency of AF-03 binding to MARV GP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Binding activity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) AF-03 to Marburg virus (MARV) glycoprotein (GP) and its epitopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AF-03 and MARV GP proteins are examined by SDS-PAGE.

These two cell lines were susceptible to MARV cell entry. We used MR78 and cetuximab as positive and negative controls, respectively. As expected, cetuximab had no effects on pseudotyped MARV entry. In contrast, AF-03 actively inhibited viral entry to HEK293T cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.13 μg/ml.

Furthermore, compared with the control antibody, AF-03 exhibited a protective property against pseudovirus infection in mice. Epitope mapping results showed that Q<sup>128</sup>-N<sup>129</sup> and C<sup>226</sup> of GP was the binding and functional epitopes that interacted with AF-03, which means AF-03 targeting the interface of GP-NPC1 interaction, considering that N<sup>129</sup> is known to be located in the NPC1 binding domain. RBD is highly conserved among filovirus species, so it is an attractive target for broadly effective anti-filovirus drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Densumite et al., 2021</xref>). We found that AF-03 also bound to EBOV GPcl and could neutralize ebola viruses bearing cleaved GP in vitro, suggesting that AF-03 represents a good candidate for endosome-delivering strategy by ligation to another mAb against a surface-exposed EBOV GP epitope or a ligand peptide for host cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wirchnianski et al., 2021</xref>), which will ultimately afford cross-reactivity against multiple filovirus species. Accordingly, we designed NPC2-fused AF-03 and demonstrated its broad-spectrum inhibitory capacity to filovirus species and EBOV mutants. Future investigations on the inhibition of AF03-NL to authentic virus infection in vitro and in vivo are warranted.</p><p>Overall, our study identified a high-affinity anti-MARV antibody AF-03 targeting a conserved and hidden site at the filovirus GPcl-NPC1 interface, which was capable of neutralizing MARV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, AF-03 may be a potential candidate for the effective protection against pan-filovirus species infection. Investigations on AF-03 treatment of mice challenged by authentic virus are undergoing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Huh7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_U443">CVCL_U443</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (Chinese hamster)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ExpiCHO-S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_5J31">CVCL_5J31</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Marburg virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uganda</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: AFV31370.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Marburg virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Angola</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: Q1PD50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Marburg virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Musoke</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: P35253</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Marburg virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RAVN</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: Q1PDC7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TAFV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: Q66810</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RESTV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Uniprot: Q66799</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BOMV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: YP_009513277.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EBOV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kindly gifted by the China Institute for Food and Drug Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: AHX24649.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDBV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kindly gifted by the China Institute for Food and Drug Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: YP_003815435</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Ebola virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SUDV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kindly gifted by the China Institute for Food and Drug Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: YP_138523.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Cueva virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LLOV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: JF828358.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (Dianlo virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MLAV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank: YP_010087186.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pSG3.

Overall, the manuscript is much improved from first review.</p><p>While the authors only use docking studies and this does not convincingly map the AF03 epitope, they do provide compelling evidence that residues Q128, N129, and possibly C226 are part of the epitope or at least close enough to affect binding and neutralisation. This is not conclusive support for their assumption that AF03 targets the NPC1 binding site. However, the authors do show that AF03 competes for MR78 binding to its epitope (in the NPC1 binding site), and this is enough to roughly place the epitope in this region (barring the possibility of an adjacent binding site with steric occlusion of the MR78 epitope).</p><p>The authors provide evidence for broad neutralisation, and also provide good support for the internalization of AF03-NL as the mechanism for improved breadth over the original AF03 antibody.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study shows convincing binding to Marburgvirus GP and neutralization of Marburg viruses by AF03, as well as convincing neutralization of Ebolaviruses by AF03-NL. While there is not good separation of PE-stained populations by FACS in figure 5A, the cell staining data in Figure 5C are compelling to a non-expert in endosomal staining like myself. The control experiments in Figure 7 are compelling showing neutralization by AF03-NL but not AF03 or NPC2 alone or in combination. Altogether these data support the internalisation and stabilisation mechanism that is proposed for the gain in neutralization breadth observed for Ebolaviruses by AF03-NL over AF03 alone.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>To support their affinity measurements, the authors argue that they show GP is a monomer in Figure 1A by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE cannot be used to assess oligomerisation of GP. Native PAGE or size exclusion profiles would have been better suited to this purpose. If affinity was calculated on a 1GP:2IgG binding sites as the authors imply, then the affinity data are incorrect due to avidity effects. As suggested by a previous reviewer, using monomeric Fab would solve this problem.</p><p>The information for figure 2 states: &quot;we investigated if this mutated MARV species was STILL sensitive o AF-03 treatment&quot;. But, &quot;we sought to determine whether AF-03 could impede pseudotyped MARV viral entry&quot; only happens in Figure 3. This information for figure 3 has now already been determined in Figure 2 where wildtype MARV is neutralised (black curves) introducing redundancy. The authors should first show that AF-03 can neutralise MARV pseudotyped virus, and then assess whether mutants are STILL sensitive to AF-03.</p><p>Figure 1: The visualisation of AF03 modelling and docking is better on a white background, but still difficult to interpret as currently presented. The labels of predicted contact residues are still impossible to read, and the yellow text does not show. As suggested previously, a zoom-in showing predicted co-location with Q128 and N129 would show these data better. It would also be useful to orient the reader with respect to trimeric membrane bound GP.</p><p>Figure 2: The presentation of these data is much improved and support the text.</p><p>Figure 3: The presentation of these data is much improved and support the text.</p><p>Figure 4: The presentation of these data is much improved and support the text.</p><p>Figure 5: The presentation of these data

The antibody was obtained from a phage-display library. The study shows that AF-03 competes with the previously characterized MARV-neutralizing antibody MR78, which binds to the virus's receptor binding site. The authors also performed GP mutagenesis experiments to confirm that AF-03 binds near the receptor binding site. In addition, the study confirmed that AF-03, like MR78, can neutralize Ebola viruses with cleaved glycoproteins. Finally, the authors demonstrated that NPC2-fused AF-03 was effective in neutralizing several filovirus species.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The main premise of this study is unclear. Flyak et al. in 2015 described the isolation and characterization of a large panel of neutralizing antibodies from a Marburg survivor (Flyak et al., Cell, 2015). Based on biochemical and structural characterization, Flyak proposed that the Marburg neutralizing antibodies bind to the NPC1 receptor binding side. In the same study, it has been shown that several MARV-neutralizing antibodies can bind to cleaved Ebola glycoproteins that were enzymatically treated to remove the mucin-like domain and glycan cap. In the following study, it has been shown that the bispecific-antibody strategy can be used to deliver Marburg-specific antibodies into the endosome, where they can neutralize Ebola viruses (Wec et al., Science 2016). Finally, the use of lysosome-resident protein NPC2 to deliver antibody cargos to late endosomes has been previously described (Wirchnianski et al., Front. Immunol, 2021). The above-mentioned studies are not referenced in the introduction. The authors state that &quot;there is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Marburg [virus] infection.&quot; While this is true, there are human antibodies that recognize neutralizing epitopes - that information can't be excluded while providing the rationale for the study. Furthermore, the authors use the word &quot;novel&quot; to describe the AF-03 antibody. How novel is AF-03 if multiple Marburg-neutralizing antibodies were previously characterized in multiple studies? Since AF-03 competes with previously characterized MR78, it binds to the same antigenic region as MR78. AF-03 also has comparable neutralization potency as MR78.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Thank for your valuable advice. In terms of the novelty of AF-03, the inhibition assay indicates that Q128/N129/C226 functions as key amino acids responsible for AF-03 neutralization given that the neutralizing capacity of AF-03 to pesudotyped virus harboring these mutants is impaired (see revised Fig. 2A left panel). Furthermore, ELISA assays show that mutation of Q128S-N129S or C226Y significantly disrupts the binding of GP to AF-03, while the neutralizing and binding capacity of MR78 to mutant GP and pseudovirus harboring C226Y instead of Q128S-N129S is not almost affected (see revised Fig. 2A right panel and 2B). Considering the fact that AF-03 and MR78 could compete with each other to bind to MARV GP (Fig. 2D). we thus make a conclusion that the epitopes of these two mAbs overlapped partially. Therefore, AF-03 is not a clone of MR78 and is a novel neutralizing mAb to MARV.</p><p>The work from Wirchnianski and colleagues has been referenced actually in the ms (see Ref. 38). Although our strategy for the design of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody refers to their work, we further expand the species being evaluated including RAVN and mutated EBOV strains. The results show that NPC2-fused AF-03 exhibits neutralizing activity to 10 filovirus species and 17 EBOV mutants (Fig. 6A and B). The work by Flyak et al. in 2015 that described the isolation and characterization of a large panel of neutralizing antibodies from a Marburg survivor has been cited in Introduction section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Without the AF-03-MARV GP crystal structure, it's unclear how van der Waals interactions, H-bonds, and polar and electrostatic interactions can be evaluated. While authors use computer-guided homology modeling, this technique can't be used to determine critical interactions. Furthermore, Flyak et al. reported that binding to the NPC1 receptor binding site is the main mechanism of Marburg virus neutralization by human monoclonal antibodies. Since both AF-03 (this study) and MR78 (Flyak study) competed with each other, that information alone was sufficient for GP mutagenesis experiments that identified the NPC1 receptor binding site as the main region for mutagenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Computer-guided homology modeling has been exploited successfully in our lab to determine key residues responsible for the interaction between antigen and mAbs (Immunol Res. 2015, 62:377; Scand J Immunol. 2019, 90:e12777; Sci Rep. 2022, 12:8469; Front Immunol. 2022, 13:831536). We refer to the crystal structure of MARV GP and the complex of MR78 and GP reported previously (Cell 2015, 160:904) and then model the complex of MARV GP and AF-03. Although AF-03 and MR78 compete with each other, we show that the epitopes of these two mAbs just overlap partially (Fig. 2A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The AF-03-GP affinity measurements were performed using bivalent IgG molecules and trimeric GP molecules. This format does not allow accurate measurements of affinity due to the avidity effect. The reported KD value is abnormally low due to avidity effects. The authors need to repeat the affinity experiments by immobilizing trimeric GPs and then adding monovalent AF-03 Fab.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: As shown in Fig. 1A, GP protein used in this work is not trimer but largely monomer composed of MLD-deleted GP1 and GP2, which may at a certain extent weaken the engagement between GP and AF-03. It is noteworthy that we re-done the SPR assays for the binding of AF-03 to GP and show that KD value is 4.71x10-11M (see revised Fig. 1C). This GP protein is thus available to the evaluation of mAb affinity. In addition, it is reasonable to utilize bivalent IgG to detect the affinity of mAb to monomeric GP since the affinity likely decreases significantly when monovalent Fab is used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe the discovery of a filovirus neutralizing antibody, AF03, by phage display, and its subsequent improvements to include NPC2 that resulted in a greater breadth of neutralization. Overall, the manuscript would benefit from considerable grammatical review, which would improve the communication of each point to the reader. The authors do not convincingly map the AF03 epitope, nor do they provide any strong support for their assumption that AF03 targets the NPC1 binding site. However, the authors do show that AF03 competes for MR78 binding to its epitope, and provides good support for the internalization of AF03-NL as the mechanism for improved breadth over the original AF03 antibody.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study shows convincing binding to Marburgvirus GP and neutralization of Marburg viruses by AF03, as well as convincing neutralization of Ebolaviruses by AF03-NL. While there are no distinct populations of PE-stained cells shown by FACS in Figure 5A, the cell staining data in Figure 5C are compelling to a non-expert in endosomal staining like me. The control experiments in Figure 7 are compelling showing neutralization by AF03-NL but not AF03 or NPC2 alone or in combination. Altogether these data support the internalisation and stabilisation mechanism that is proposed for the gain in neutralization breadth observed for Ebolaviruses by AF03-NL over AF03 alone.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall, this reviewer is of the opinion that this paper is constructed haphazardly. For instance, the neutralization of mutant pseudoviruses is shown in Figure 2 before the concept of pseudovirus neutralization by AF03 is introduced in Figure 3. Similarly, the control experiments for AF03+NPC2 are described in Figure 7 after the data for breadth of neutralization are shown in Figure 6. GP quality controls are shown in Figure 2 after GP ELISAs / BLI experiments are done in Figure 1. This is disorienting for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: AF-03 production and its binding capacity to GP is determined in Fig. 1. The epitopes of AF-03 is identified in Fig. 2. The neutralizing activity of AF-03 to pseudotyped MARV in vitro and in vivo is detected in Fig. 3. The neutralizing activity of AF-03 to pseudotyped ebolavirus harboring cleaved GP is detected in Fig. 4. The endosome-delivering ability of AF03-NL is examined in Fig. 5. The neutralization of filovirus species and EBOV mutants by AF03-NL is detected in Fig. 6. The requirement of CI-MPR for neutralization activity of AF03-NL is determined in Fig. 7. We think that this arrangement is suitable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: The visualisation of AF03 modelling and docking endeavours is extremely difficult to interpret. Firstly, there is no effort to orient the non-specialist reader with respect to the Marburgvirus GP model. Secondly, from the figures presented it is impossible to tell if the Fv docks perfectly onto the GP surface, or if there are violent clashes between the deeply penetrating AF03 CDRs and GP. This information would be better presented on a white background, perhaps showing GP in surface view from multiple angles and slices. The authors attempt to label potential interactions, but these are impossible to read, and labels should be added separately to appropriately oriented zoomed-in views.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: To be readily understood the rationale of computer-guided modeling, the descriptions in the Methods and Results section have been refined accordingly. In addition, the information of the theoretical structure was presented on white background (see revised Fig. 1D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The neutralization of mutant pseudoviruses cannot be properly assessed using bar graphs. These data should be plotted as neutralization curves as they were done for the wild-type neutralization data in Figure 3. The authors conclude that Q128 &amp; N129 are contact residues, but the neutralization data for this mutant appear odd as the lowest two concentrations of AF03 show higher neutralization than the second highest AF03 concentration. Neutralization of T204/Q205/T206 (green), Y218 (orange), K222 (blue), or C226 (purple) appears to be better than neutralization of the wild-type MARV. The authors do not discuss this oddity. What are the IC50's? The omission of antibody concentrations on the x-axis and missing IC50 values give a sense of obscuring the data, and the manuscript would benefit from greater transparency, and be much easier to interpret if these were included. I am intrigued that the Q128S/N129S mutant is reported as having little effect on the neutralization of MR78. The bar graph appears to show some effect (difficult to interpret without neutralization curves and IC50 data), and indeed PDB:5UQY seems to suggest that these amino acids form a central component of the MR78 epitope (Q128 forms potential hydrogen bonds with CDRH1 Y35 and CDRL3 Y91, while N129 packs against the MR78 CDRH3 and potentially makes additional polar contact with the backbone). Lastly, since neutralization was tested in both HEK293T cells and Huh7 cells in Figure 3, the authors should clarify which cells were used for neutralization in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Thank for your advice. Accordingly, in the revised ms, the neutralization curve of AF-03 and MR78 is presented in revised Fig. 2A. The neutralization of AF-03 to pseudotyped MARV harboring Q128S/N129S or C226Y is impaired significantly compared with WT MARV and those bearing other indicated mutations, while Q128S/N129S instead of C226Y mutation affect the neutralizing capacity of MR78 at a certain extent. This is consistent with the data on the binding of AF-03 or MR78 to MARV GP protein assayed by ELISA (see revised Fig. 2B). Overall, these results show that Q128/N129/C226 functions as key amino acids responsible for AF-03 neutralization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: The first two images in Figure 3C showing bioluminescent intensity from pseudovirus-injected mice pretreated with either 10mg/kg or 3mg/kg AF03 are identical images. This is apparent from the location, shape, and intensity of the bioluminescence, as well as the identical foot placement of each mouse in these two panels. Currently, this figure is incomplete and should be corrected to show the different mice treated with either 10mg/kg or 3mg/kg of AF03.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Thank for your carefulness. Indeed, it is our mistake. In the revised ms, this fault has been corrected. The correct images have been added (see revised Fig. 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 would benefit from a control experiment without antibodies comparing infection with GP-cleaved and GP-uncleaved pseudoviruses. The paragraph describing these data was also difficult to read and would benefit from additional grammatical review.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Accordingly, a control experiment comparing the infection of GP-cleaved with GP-uncleaved pseudoviruses is performed. The results show that The infection of pseudotyped ebolavirus harboring cleaved GP to host cells is comparable or stronger than those containing intact GP（see revised Fig. s1）. Therefore, the data in Fig. 4 support the inhibition of cell entry of ebolavirus species harboring cleaved GP by AF-03, which is not attributed to the possible impairment of cell entry capacity of GPcl-containing ebolavirus. In addition, the sentences have been modified to be read smoothly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The authors should clarify in the methods section that the &quot;mock&quot; experiment included the PE anti-human IgG Fc antibody. Without this clarification, the lack of a distinct negative population in the FACS data could be interpreted as non-specific staining with PE. If the PE antibody was added at an equivalent concentration to all panels, what does the directionality of the arrowheads in Figure 5A (labelled PE) and 5B (labelled pHrodo Red) indicate?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: Thank for your advice. In the revised version, we denote that the mock is actually a human IgG isotype in the figure legend. The arrowheads denote the fluorescence intensity of PE or pHrodo on the lateral axis of the plots. Of course, herein the percentage of PE or pHrodo-positive cells is shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B: These data would benefit from the inclusion of IC50, transparency of antibody concentrations used, and consistency in the direction of antibody concentrations (increasing to the right or left of the x-axis) when compared to Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response: The concentration of antibody titrated is shown in figure legends. The direction of antibody concentrations is unified throughout the paper. Although IC50 is not included, these data clearly show that AF03-NL rather than AF-03 prominently inhibits the cell entry of EBOV mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Line 143: anti-human should be anti-human.</p><p>Line 223: From the SDS-PAGE results, it's not clear that the AF-03 was expressed in the eukaryotic cell line.
