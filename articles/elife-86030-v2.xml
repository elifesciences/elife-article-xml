macroautophagy. Here, we show that upon exposing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants to intense light, NBR1 associates with photodamaged chloroplasts independently of ATG7, a core component of the canonical autophagy machinery. NBR1 coats both the surface and interior of chloroplasts, which is then followed by direct engulfment of the organelles into the central vacuole via a microautophagy-type process. The relocalization of NBR1 into chloroplasts does not require the chloroplast translocon complexes embedded in the envelope but is instead greatly enhanced by removing the self-oligomerization mPB1 domain of NBR1. The delivery of NBR1-decorated chloroplasts into vacuoles depends on the ubiquitin-binding UBA2 domain of NBR1 but is independent of the ubiquitin E3 ligases SP1 and PUB4, known to direct the ubiquitylation of chloroplast surface proteins. Compared to wild-type plants, <italic>nbr1</italic> mutants have altered levels of a subset of chloroplast proteins and display abnormal chloroplast density and sizes upon high light exposure. We postulate that, as photodamaged chloroplasts lose envelope integrity, cytosolic ligases reach the chloroplast interior to ubiquitylate thylakoid and stroma proteins which are then recognized by NBR1 for autophagic clearance. This study uncovers a new function of NBR1 in the degradation of damaged chloroplasts by microautophagy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chlorophagy</kwd><kwd>microautophagy</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>autophagy receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1840687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0019013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name><name><surname>Eliceiri</surname><given-names>Kevin W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10 OD026769-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM124452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL200100057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Millar</surname><given-names>A Harvey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Photodamaged chloroplasts are targeted for vacuolar degradation through microautophagy by the NBR1 autophagy receptor without the participation of the canonical autophagy machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is a process by which cytoplasmic contents including organelles, individual proteins, protein complexes and cytosolic aggregates, collectively called autophagic cargo, are delivered to vacuoles (plants and yeast) and lysosomes (animals) for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mizushima et al., 1998</xref>). In plants, autophagy most commonly occurs through the formation of cargo-sequestering double-membrane-bound organelles called autophagosomes (macroautophagy) or through the direct engulfment of cargo by the vacuolar membrane (microautophagy). Although the molecular underpinnings of microautophagy are poorly understood, the machinery behind macroautophagy involves more than 40 ATG (Autophagy Related) proteins whose actions are regulated by upstream phosphorylation events ultimately leading to formation of autophagosomes decorated with a conjugate of ATG8 bearing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). This lipidation is mediated by an enzymatic cascade sequentially involving the activating enzyme ATG7, the conjugating enzyme ATG3, and a ligase complex comprising an ATG5-ATG12 conjugate complexed with ATG16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohsumi, 2001</xref>). The resulting ATG8-PE adduct is not only required for autophagosomes assembly but also, through its interaction with a host of autophagic receptors, for the selection of appropriate autophagic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noda et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>There are several selective autophagy receptors that specifically recognize ubiquitylated cargo. Among them, metazoan SQSTM1/p62 (Sequestosome 1) and NBR1 (NEIGHBOR OF BRCA1 gene 1) promote the accretion of ubiquitylated proteins into larger condensates which are then encapsulated by autophagosomes for macroautophagic clearance (aggrephagy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nezis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasmussen et al., 2022</xref>). The PB1 (Phox and Bem1 domain) domain present in both SQSTM1 and NBR1 mediate their mutual interaction and oligomerization into helical filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciuffa et al., 2015</xref>) which then promote the aggregation of ubiquitylated species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jakobi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turco et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, mammalian SQSTM1 and NBR1 share a zinc-finger domain (ZZ) that can bind N-terminally arginylated proteins, polyubiquitylated proteins, and other cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cha-Molstad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain with affinity for ubiquitin, and an ATG8-interacting motif (AIM) sequence that binds ATG8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zientara-Rytter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2022a</xref>). NBR1, but not SQSTM1, also contains a Four-Tryptophan (FW) domain, which at least in some fungal species helps recognize cargo for selective autophagy. The plant NBR1 proteins uniquely harbor two UBA domains but only the C-terminal sequence (UBA2) binds ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svenning et al., 2011</xref>). Through these collective features, SQSTM1 and NBR1 can mediate selective autophagy of cargo in both ubiquitin and ubiquitin-independent manners. Most non-metazoan species encode only NBR1, whereas metazoans can express either or both SQTM1 and NBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svenning et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In plants, NBR1 has been connected genetically to numerous physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and Chen, 2020</xref>). For example, it modulates tolerance to heat stress through at least two mechanisms; recognition and sorting for degradation of proteotoxic ubiquitylated aggregates that accumulate at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), and the negative regulation of heat stress memory by mediating the clearance of heat-shock-related chaperones and their co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thirumalaikumar et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> NBR1 also targets for autophagic clearance: (i) the exocyst subunit EXO70E2 and its associated organelle EXPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ji et al., 2020</xref>), (ii) misfolded protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2020</xref>), and (iii) viral capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafrén et al., 2017</xref>) and pathogenic bacterial effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dagdas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dagdas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Üstün et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leong et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> null <italic>nbr1</italic> mutants develop normally under favorable growth conditions and are still able to execute general autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2020</xref>) and the selective clearance of certain organelles such as peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Young et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mutants are hypersensitive to heat, drought, oxidative, and salt stress and over-accumulate cytoplasmic protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, NBR1 appears to be required for some but not all autophagy-dependent events, consistent with a role in selective autophagy.</p><p>Chloroplast turnover involves multiple routes that are dependent on autophagy and/or the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Several ATG8-dependent autophagic routes control the piecemeal turnover of chloroplast components <italic>via</italic> Rubisco-containing bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitzer et al., 2015</xref>), ATI1-PS (ATG8-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1) bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaeli et al., 2014</xref>), and SSLG (small starch-like granule) bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) as well as the engulfment of whole photodamaged chloroplasts through microautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>). Outer envelope proteins, including components of the outer envelope translocon complex (TOC), can be ubiquitylated by chloroplast membrane-localized ubiquitin E3 ligase SP1 (SUPPRESOR OF PPI1 LOCUS 1) and extracted from the envelope membrane by the β-barrel channel protein SP2 and the AAA +ATPase CDC48 for degradation by the 26 S proteasome in a process named chloroplast-associated degradation (CHLORAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2019</xref>). The cytosolic E3 ligase PLANT U-BOX4 (PUB4) also ubiquitylates chloroplast envelope proteins in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woodson et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, proteins within the chloroplast lumen (e.g<italic>.</italic> thylakoid and stroma proteins) were also shown to be targeted by ubiquitylation for break down <italic>via</italic> the proteasomes under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2022b</xref>). However, it remains unclear how ubiquitylation occurs inside chloroplasts.</p><p>Here, we show that NBR1 associates with photodamaged chloroplasts <italic>via</italic> its ubiquitin-binding UBA domain and mediates their vacuolar degradation by an autophagic pathway independent of ATG7, and therefore, of ATG8 lipidation. NBR1 associates with the surface and interior of chloroplasts without the need for intact translocon complexes within the outer and inner membranes. We proposed that photodamaged chloroplasts lose structural integrity of their envelopes, thus allowing access of cytosolic components such as the ubiquitylation machinery and NBR1 into the plastid interior for subsequent microautophagic clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NBR1 associate with chloroplasts upon exposure to high light</title><p>To determine whether the autophagy receptor NBR1 is involved in chloroplast turnover upon photoradiation damage, we imaged by confocal microscopy the NBR1-GFP fusion protein expressed under the control of the NBR1 promoter [<italic>ProNBR1:NBR1-GFP</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafrén et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thirumalaikumar et al., 2021</xref>)] in seedlings grown under low light (LL; 40 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at 22 °C and then exposed to high light (HL; 1500 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at 12 °C for 2 h, with a focus on the sub-adaxial epidermal mesophyll layer (mesophyll cells under the cotyledon adaxial epidermis) exposed to HL.

When analyzing this collection separately, we found that plastid proteins were well represented among those with decreased abundance upon HL exposure in wild type and the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which was consistent with the overall reduction in chloroplast density and sizes seen in both backgrounds upon HL exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, in the three mutants, but not in the wild type, proteins with increased abundance were also found associated with plastids and organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with impaired organelle turnover caused by the <italic>atg7</italic> and <italic>nbr1</italic> mutations.

The wild-type plants showed an overall decrease in chloroplast proteins after HL treatment (2.5% of total chloroplast proteins were less abundant and 1% were more abundant compared to LL conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, the three mutants showed a more pronounced increase in chloroplast protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) compared to wild type. For example, in the <italic>atg7</italic> mutant, 9% were more abundant after HL exposure and only 3.5% were less abundant, while in <italic>nbr1</italic> mutant, approximately the same number of chloroplast proteins (3% of the total chloroplast proteins) showed significant increase or decrease in abundance after HL. The chloroplast proteins accumulating in the mutants localized to chloroplast envelopes, stroma, and thylakoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the <italic>atg7</italic> and <italic>nbr1</italic> mutations affects the homeostasis of all chloroplast subcompartments when plants are exposed to HL. Interestingly, when compared to the wild type, it became evident that both under LL and HL conditions, the three mutants contain less chloroplast proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that chloroplast homeostasis is regulated by both ATG7 and NBR1, even under non-photodamaging conditions.</p><p>We then compared the overlap of more and less abundant proteins in the four genotypes in response to HL. We found that 66% (25 of 38) of the chloroplast proteins significantly enriched in <italic>nbr1</italic> were also more abundant in <italic>atg7</italic>, whereas only 22% (25 of 115) of the more abundant chloroplast proteins in <italic>atg7</italic> were also enriched in <italic>nbr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Of the 24 enriched proteins in the <italic>nbr1 atg7</italic> double mutant, 16 proteins (67%) were shared with either <italic>atg7, nbr1,</italic> or both.

Of the 41 proteins decreasing in abundance in <italic>nbr1 atg7</italic> plants, 21 proteins (51%) also showed reduced abundance in one or both single mutants.

All fluorescent NBR1 fusion proteins remained cytosolic under LL condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). After HL exposure, YFP-NBR1 associated with photodamaged chloroplasts as expected, either forming coats (average ~3% of chloroplasts; n=28 fields) or localizing inside a small fraction of chloroplasts (average ~0.5% of chloroplasts; n=28 fields) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). YFP-NBR1mPB also localized to photodamaged chloroplasts but almost exclusively to their interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Thus, although the total percentages of chloroplasts labeled by YFP-NBR1 and YFP-NBR1mPB were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), YFP-NBR1 mainly coated the chloroplast surface whereas most of YFP-NBR1mPB was located to the chloroplast lumen. Just like YFP-NBR1, YFP-NBR1mAIM was mostly detected as chloroplast coats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Interestingly, YFP-NBR1ΔUBA2 failed to associate with chloroplasts after HL exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).

Upon photoradiation damage, NBR1 first becomes associated with the chloroplast surface to be later internalized into the chloroplast stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The association of NBR1 with chloroplasts requires its ubiquitin-binding UBA2 domain whereas NBR1 internalization into the chloroplast stroma is negatively regulated by its self-polymerization PB1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The relocation of NBR1 into the chloroplast stroma does not rely on a functional TIC-TOC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We propose that the rupture of the outer and inner envelopes in photodamaged chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) allows for the diffusion of the ubiquitylation machinery and NBR1 from the cytosol into the chloroplast lumen, promoting ubiquitylation of both stroma and thylakoid proteins and their subsequent binding to NBR1 for vacuolar degradation via microautophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NBR1 as a ubiquitin-binding chlorophagy receptor</title><p>NBR1 is a well-known aggrephagy receptor that recognizes and sorts ubiquitylated cargo for vacuolar clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasmussen et al., 2022</xref>). In plants, the formation of ubiquitylated cargo aggregates by NBR1 depends on it self-oligomerizing PB1 domain and its ubiquitin-binding capacity through the UBA2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svenning et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zientara-Rytter and Sirko, 2014</xref>). The AIM domain of NBR1 mediates its interaction with ATG8 and its sequestration into autophagosomes for vacuolar degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svenning et al., 2011</xref>). Our studies found that, upon high photoradiation exposure, NBR1 associates with a population of photodamaged chloroplasts via a process dependent on its UBA2 domain, which then enables the association of NBR1 with both the surface of the chloroplast and its lumen (stroma and thylakoids).</p><p>A simple scenario based on past studies is that NBR1 binds ubiquitylated substrates of the E3 ligases PUB4 and SP1, which ubiquitylate chloroplast envelope proteins as part of the CHLORAD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woodson et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found that a mutant lacking both PUB4 and SP1 activity showed normal recruitment of NBR1 to photodamaged chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Recent reports have also shown that most chloroplast proteins, including those localized to stroma and thylakoids are ubiquitylated for subsequent break down by the proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2022b</xref>), but how such ubiquitylation might occur inside chloroplasts was unresolved. As rupture of the chloroplast envelope membranes is a known consequence of damaging photoradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>), it is important to note our observations that NBR1 heavily decorates the surface, stroma, and thylakoids of photodamaged chloroplasts with structurally disrupted envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesize that the loss of envelope structural integrity allows access of the cytosolic ubiquitylation machinery to the stroma and thylakoids of compromised chloroplast thus directing the massive ubiquitylation of chloroplast proteins for recognition by the NBR1 receptor. Although ubiquitylation of intra-chloroplast proteins has been connected to degradation by the 26 S proteasome through CHLORAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2022b</xref>), it is also possible that remaining ubiquitylated chloroplast ghost membranes coated with NBR1 are delivered to the vacuole by microautophagy.</p><p>The mPB1 domain of NBR1 is necessary for aggrephagy in plants as it mediates the formation of ubiquitylated cargo accretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svenning et al., 2011</xref>).

We speculate that monomeric NBR1 proteins diffuses more easily through disrupted envelope membranes to reach the normally inaccessible chloroplast stroma where they bind ubiquitylated chloroplast proteins.</p><p>Surprisingly, although NBR1 targets photodamaged chloroplasts for vacuolar clearance, this process requires neither its ATG8-interacting AIM domain nor ATG7, and thus is independent of canonical autophagy. Although microautophagy of ATG8-decorated chloroplasts upon radiation damage requires the core ATG machinery that assembles the ATG8-PE adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>), microautophagy of chloroplasts damaged by oxidative stress does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemke et al., 2021</xref>).

This unexpected increase could be attributed to either a lower nutrient availability in autophagy defective lines, which results in lower protein biosynthesis, or the induction of alternative proteolytic pathways to compensate for the lack of autophagy. With the limitation that this study focused on, albeit well characterized, single mutant alleles, in the absence of nutritional deficiency, we also observed a lower abundance of chloroplast proteins for all autophagy defective lines (<italic>atg7</italic>, <italic>nbr1</italic>, and <italic>nbr1 atg7</italic>) after HL exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), consistent with either the induction of other proteolytic route(s) and/or a delay in chloroplast protein synthesis and recovery after photoradiation damage.

A failure to control chloroplast protein turnover is often very deleterious to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rowland et al., 2022</xref>). Not surprisingly considering the complexity of the organelle and its functions, chloroplast remodeling and turnover are intricate processes that integrates multiple likely redundant or partially redundant pathways. Besides chloroplast proteases that can locally degrade proteins inside chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rowland et al., 2022</xref>), several autophagy and non-autophagic pathways mediate vacuolar clearance of chloroplast components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otegui, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kikuchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rowland et al., 2022</xref>). At least three flavors of ATG8-dependent piecemeal autophagy of chloroplasts have been characterized: Rubisco-containing bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spitzer et al., 2015</xref>), ATG8-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaeli et al., 2014</xref>), and small starch-like granule bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, microautophagy of whole damaged chloroplasts occurs through at least two pathways, one dependent and the other independent of canonical autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemke et al., 2021</xref>). For the latter pathway, we provide evidence for a novel microautophagic route that requires NBR1 but not ATG8 lipidation.</p><p>How exactly all these pathways coordinate the remodeling and degradation of damaged chloroplasts is unclear. Upon HL exposure, we observed chloroplasts associated with either ATG8 and NBR1 as organelle cargo for canonical autophagy-dependent and independent microautophagy, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Only a very low proportion of chloroplasts were coated with both ATG8 and NBR1, supporting the notion that there are two separate microautophagy pathways for chloroplast clearance. However, we noticed a higher proportion of NBR1-decorated chloroplasts in HL-exposed <italic>atg7</italic> mutant seedlings compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). Although this could be due to the increased levels of NBR1 protein in the <italic>atg7</italic> mutant (Fig, 2 G; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2020</xref>), the higher frequency of photodamaged chloroplasts observed in <italic>atg7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), supports the idea that photodamaged chloroplasts that are not successfully repaired or degraded by canonical autophagy, become substrates of an NBR1-mediated route. Interestingly, the <italic>tic40-4</italic> mutant, which contains structurally abnormal chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kovacheva et al., 2005</xref>), also shows increased association of chloroplasts with NBR1 upon HL exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), consistent with more widespread photodamage in the <italic>tic40-4</italic> chloroplasts, which in turn results in more chloroplasts being targeted by NBR1.</p><p>We had anticipated that an <italic>nbr1 atg7</italic> double mutant exposed to HL would show more pronounced defects in chloroplast homeostasis after HL exposure than the single mutants if the ATG8- and NBR1-mediated microautophagy pathways were both disrupted. However, a more drastic phenotypic alteration as compared to those seen in the single mutants was not seen in terms of both chlorophyll mean intensities and chloroplast proteome profiles, and instead, the mutant behaved either as intermediate between the two single mutants or more similarly to the <italic>atg7</italic> single mutant. This observation suggests that canonical autophagy controls the main pathway for clearance of photodamaged chloroplasts, whereas NBR1 targets a relatively small population of chloroplasts and chloroplast proteins that fail to be degraded via either CHLORAD or canonical autophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The reaction was quenched with 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and diluted with 900 µL 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce the urea concentration below 1 M, digested overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 1.5 µg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega).

Peptides were loaded onto a 20 μL nanoViper sample loop (Thermo Fisher) and separated on a C18 analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 75 µm×25 cm, Thermo Fisher) by the application of a linear 2 hr gradient from 4% to 45% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, with a column flow rate set to 250 nL/min. Analysis of the eluted tryptic peptides was performed online using a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) possessing a Nanospray Flex Ion source (Thermo Fisher) fitted with a stainless steel nano bore emitter operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode at a capillary voltage of 1.9 kV. Data-dependent acquisition of full MS scans within a mass range of 380–1500 m/z at a resolution of 70,000 was performed, with the automatic gain control (AGC) target set to 3.0×10<sup>6</sup>, and the maximum fill time set to 200ms. High-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation of the top eight most intense peaks was performed with a normalized collision energy of 28, with an intensity threshold of 4.0×10<sup>4</sup> counts and an isolation window of 3.0 m/z, excluding precursors that had an unassigned,+1 or&gt;+7, charge state.

Peptides were assigned using SEQUEST HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eng et al., 1994</xref>), with search parameters set to assume the digestion enzyme trypsin with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage, a minimum peptide length of 6, precursor mass tolerances of 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerances of 0.02 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a static modification, while oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were specified as dynamic modifications. The target false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 (strict) was used as validation for peptide-spectral matches (PSMs) and peptides. Proteins that contained similar peptides and that could not be differentiated based on the MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Label-free quantification was performed in Proteome Discoverer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2006</xref>) with a minimum Quan value threshold of 0.0001 using unique peptides, and ‘3 Top N’ peptides used for area calculation. All samples were injected in two technical duplicates, and the protein abundances reflected the average of two technical replicates if proteins were detected in two technical replicates or used directly if the proteins were only detected in one technical replicate. Protein abundances were normalized using the median values of 150 proteins considered the least variable among each sample.

Eight-day-old cotyledons either grown under LL or at 24 hr after HL exposure were cut into small pieces and frozen in a high-pressure freezer (Leica EM Ice). To analyze the ultrastructure of chloroplasts, the samples were freeze-substituted in 2% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in acetone on dry ice overnight; samples were adjusted to room temperature on a rocker. After several rinses with acetone, the samples were infiltrated with Epon resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with increasing the concentration of Epon 10% (v/v), 25%, 50%, 75% in acetone, followed by three exchanges with 100% Epon.

NBR1 autophagy receptor protein. The work proposed a new function of this protein in the degradation of damaged chloroplasts upon exposing Arabidopsis plants to intense light. The evidence supporting the conclusions is compelling, using a combination of genetics, proteomics and state-of-the-art microscopy.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cejudo Francisco Javier (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers emphasized that data showing that NBR1 decorates the exterior and interior of photodamaged chloroplasts is an important finding and categorize the results as valuable for the community. Essential revisions are:</p><p>1) The proteomic part is highlighted as the weakest point of the study. This part should be corrected – perhaps moved to supplementary as suggested by one reviewer or rewritten.</p><p>2) potential problems with the increased amount of NBR1 in atg7 mutant should be clarified and/or discussed.</p><p>3) the genetic data rely on single mutant alleles. This is not strictly rigorous in terms of interpreting the phenotypes thus conclusions should be tempered to reflect this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below is a list of a few rather mild comments.</p><p>1) line 63- SQTM1 change into SQSTM1.</p><p>2) lines 66-68 – I am not sure if the provided references contain information that the ZZ domain binds K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitinated proteins.</p><p>3) In some figures (e.g. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 7, Figure 8) there is no information about the number (N) of repeats used for plotting the charts and calculating of statistical significance of the differences. It would be useful to know how many chloroplasts were counted, from how many plants and/or how many cells.</p><p>4) line 602 should be &quot;photodamaged&quot;.</p><p>5) line 654-655 (or other places in the discussion) – it would be worth including in the discussion the information (clearly shown in e.g. Jung et al. 2020, JXB) that the amount of NBR1 in atg7 mutant is increased in comparison to the wild type because of its defective degradation. The discussion of the effects of the single and double mutations (nbr1, atg7, and nbr1/atg7) should consider the above information. This could change the perspective because, in the atg7 mutant, the authors observed, in fact, the effect of the excess of NBR1 while in the double mutant, both proteins are missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 2, part G, the differences described in the text regarding specific protein levels in this immunoblot is not clearly seen. It would be good to provide quantification if possible. Also, it is not indicated how often such immunoblots were replicated, and maybe quantification could help to give an idea of reproducibility.</p><p>Figure 3 shows some very interesting data regarding the distribution (separate) of ATG8 and NBR1. The visual data are very clear, but I personally found the graphical data a little bit hard to assimilate. would it be an idea to provide a simplified schematic e.g. Venn diagram to simply convey the overlap (and lack thereof) of the populations in addition to these figures? Looking at this data I have been struck by the thought that whilst it is clear that there is reasonable discrimination between these two proteins associating different populations of chloroplasts, this might be a function of time relative to the initiated highlight stress. This is something the authors might like to comment on/investigate.</p><p>The authors have used single alleles for their mutant analysis, and I appreciate the pragmatic issues regarding using multiple alleles and/or complementation given that it increases the number of samples to be worked on significantly, however, strictly speaking, one cannot assume that all phenotypes shown in Figures 1 to 6 are truly linked to the mutations in question without this additional information. I would urge the authors to at least rein in their conclusions pertaining to these mutants. Of course, the effects seen are very likely (in terms of probability) to be linked to the mutations, but without additional genetic information, one really strictly cannot say this for certain. Given that the authors perform complementation experiments with tagged NBR1 shown in Figure 7, it would have been at least nice to see some data for complemented nbr1 mutant in the experiments presented in Figure 1 to Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86030.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers emphasized that data showing that NBR1 decorates the exterior and interior of photodamaged chloroplasts is an important finding and categorize the results as valuable for the community.
