An effective HIV-1 vaccine should elicit broad immune responses in order to block the entry of diverse T/F viruses. Currently, no such vaccine exists. An in-depth study of escape variants emerging under host immune pressure during very early stages of infection might provide insights into such a HIV-1 vaccine design. Here, in a rare longitudinal study involving HIV-1 infected individuals just days after infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, we discovered a remarkable genetic shift that resulted in near complete disappearance of the original T/F virus and appearance of a variant with H173Y mutation in the variable V2 domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein. This coincided with the disappearance of the first wave of strictly H173-specific antibodies and emergence of a second wave of Y173-specific antibodies with increased breadth. Structural analyses indicated conformational dynamism of the envelope protein which likely allowed selection of escape variants with a conformational switch in the V2 domain from an α-helix (H173) to a β-strand (Y173) and induction of broadly reactive antibody responses. This differential breadth due to a single mutational change was also recapitulated in a mouse model. Rationally designed combinatorial libraries containing 54 conformational variants of V2 domain around position 173 further demonstrated increased breadth of antibody responses elicited to diverse HIV-1 envelope proteins. These results offer new insights into designing broadly effective HIV-1 vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hiv escape</kwd><kwd>v2

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While combinatorial antiretroviral therapy has greatly improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV, it does not cure the infection even with life-long adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mocroft et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">WHO, 2021</xref>). In the absence of a preventative vaccine, HIV-1 continues to be a global public health concern, causing ~1.5 million new infections annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Global HIV &amp; AIDS statistics, 2019</xref>). After dozens of HIV-1 vaccine failures in the last four decades, the only vaccine trial that showed promise was the phase 3 RV144 trial conducted in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esparza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Souza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>). The RV144 demonstrated an early efficacy of ~60% reduction in HIV acquisition at 12 months post-vaccination which gradually declined to 31.2% at 42 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009</xref>). Several studies demonstrated correlation of IgG antibodies specific to the V2 variable domain of the HIV envelope protein (Env) to vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Souza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, protection was not due to their ability to neutralize the virus but likely due to the Fc effector function, specifically the antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, sieve analysis of the breakthrough infections in RV144 vaccinees showed mutations in the V2 domain, in the semi-conserved structural core encompassing residues 166–183, which seems to be one of the prime targets of the host immune pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moodie et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, broadening the vaccine-induced immunity against the V2 region can potentially confer protection against breakthrough infections. Additionally, there have been concerted efforts to generate vaccine-induced broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jardine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leggat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jardine et al., 2015</xref>) but remains challenging and elusive.</p><p>The Env spike on the surface of HIV forms essential interactions with its primary receptor, CD4, followed by interactions with the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor on a CD4 +T cell for viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pancera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klasse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 receptors, interaction of the V2 region with integrin α4β7 has also been implicated as a significant contributor in the pathogenesis of HIV-1, particularly for dissemination and gut-reservoir establishment in the infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthos et al., 2018</xref>). It has been shown that the V2 domain by virtue of mimicking MadCAM, a natural ligand of α4β7, assists in co-stimulation of CD4 +T cells promoting HIV-1 replication during an acute stage of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goes et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, vaccinees of the RV144 trial generated non-neutralizing V2 antibodies that are shown to block interaction with α4β7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peachman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Eeden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lertjuthaporn et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Env is expressed as a 160 kD glycoprotein (gp160) and cleaved by the cellular protease furin into gp120 and gp41 subunits. The membrane-external subunit, gp120, has five conserved regions (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) and five variable regions (V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5) that are alternately positioned in the Env sequence with the exception of V1V2 variable regions that assemble as a single domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Land and Braakman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonard et al., 1990</xref>). Three protomers, each composed of non-covalently associated gp120 and gp41 subunits, assemble as a trimeric spike on the viral envelope. The three V1V2 domains form a well-exposed ‘crown’ of the mushroom-shaped spike, hence a frequent target of the host immune system. Each V1V2 domain consists of a conserved Greek-key motif structure with 4–5 β-strands (A, B, C, C’, D) forming an anti-parallel β-sheet and two hypervariable loops that are flexible and conformationally dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). The virus takes advantage of these features to engage in immune battles with the host defenses and selecting mutations, particularly in the hypervariable loops that can escape host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trinh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hioe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagar et al., 2006</xref>). The V1V2 domain of HIV-1 envelope protein is therefore an attractive target for a preventative vaccine design.</p><p>The human host is often exposed to a complex genetic pool of highly diverse and heterogeneous viral quasispecies from an infected donor of which only one (or a few) transmitted founder (T/F) virus can successfully establish a productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keele et al., 2008</xref>). However, very little is known about how the T/F viruses emerge out of the exposed variants or how they might escape the initial host immune responses to establish chronic infections. Moreover, how the structural and conformational dynamics of the variable V1V2 domain might contribute to mechanisms of immune escape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of escape of a T/F virus from V2-directed host immune responses in an acutely infected participant of a prospective acute HIV cohort, RV217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robb et al., 2016</xref>). RV217 is a unique and rare clinical trial in which HIV infection could be tracked starting from just days after infection up to nearly 3 years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ananworanich et al., 2017</xref>). Our studies discovered a remarkable genetic shift in the T/F virus population due to a key mutation, H173Y, in the semi-conserved epitope of the V2 domain, which rendered the pre-existing antibody responses completely obsolete. Furthermore, this mutation caused a conformational shift of the V2-epitope to which the human host responded with more broadly reactive antibody responses, a phenomenon that we show could be recapitulated in a mouse model. We further show that combinatorial V2 immunogen libraries comprised of 54 naturally occurring conformational variants at or near H173 elicited antibody responses with increased breadth to diverse HIV-1 envelope proteins. These studies provide new insights into effective design of future HIV vaccines that could induce broad immunity against diverse strains of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypothesis and experimental design</title><p>We hypothesized that understanding how a T/F virus escapes host immune pressure at the very early stages of infection might identify key mutations that if included in a HIV vaccine could stimulate broader immune responses and preemptively interfere or block HIV acquisition. Our primary focus is the V1V2 domain of HIV-1 Env, one of the key determinants of virus escape in the moderately successful RV144 vaccine trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore decided to study the evolution of V1V2 domain in the T/F viruses from four HIV-1 infected participants of RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, a unique and rare trial that allowed tracking of HIV infection starting from just days after infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.</p><p>First, we performed phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal Env sequences to identify V1V2-specific variants that correlated with T/F virus escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, the selected escape variants were fused with the oligomeric (11- and 12-mers) bacteriophage (phage) T4 small ‘terminase’ protein, gp16, to generate V1V2 epitope-displaying nanoscaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2012</xref>) for effective antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These constructs were then expressed in HEK293GnTi (GnTi) cells to produce gp16-scaffolded V1V2 escape mutant domains with native-like high mannose glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Such glycosylated gp16-V1V2 scaffolds were previously shown to retain a native-like V1V2 epitope presentation as evident from their binding to well-characterized mAbs, in particular the glycan-dependent PG9 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chand et al., 2017</xref>). Next, the immunogenicity of the V1V2 variants was evaluated in a mouse model to determine if they could recapitulate the distinctive escape mutant-specific immune responses observed in the human plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, cocktails of V1V2 variant-targeted immunogen pools were created using controlled mutagenesis to determine the effect of escape mutation on the antibody response and recognition of diverse HIV-1 Env antigens in the context of a library designed with and without escape mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since V2 is known to be a very conformationally polymorphic region of the Env, we hypothesized that if the escape mutations identified in the T/F virus would have dominant effect of on the conformation and subsequent antibody response despite other V2 mutations. Identifying such conformation influencing V2 residues might inform effective vaccine design.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic analysis of longitudinal <italic>env</italic> sequences isolated from four acutely infected participants in the RV217 study.

At 24 wk post-infection, however, nearly the entire T/F07 virus population made a complete shift to a single variant containing two mutations, one at position 173 that changed histidine to tyrosine (H173Y) and another at position 236 that changed lysine to threonine (K236T). The K236T mutation restored the well-conserved N-linked glycan at position N234 located at gp120/gp41 interface. Additionally, in some of the variants, a 3-residue deletion in the variable V2 loop (ΔDSV) and a 5-residue deletion (ΔNTTRFL) in the variable V4 loop co-occurred with the H173Y mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). The H173Y mutation is localized in the relatively well-conserved ‘C’ β-strand positioned at the junction of the cationic first half and the hydrophobic second half of the β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These characteristics, a singular variant and the remarkable shift of the viral population, strongly suggested a linkage between the variant and potential viral escape. This was in contrast to many mutations observed in the other three T/F viruses in the hypervariable V1 and V2 loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) which are difficult to track and of little value for vaccine design.

H173 is located in the C β-strand of V1V2 domain, a region that in previous studies was also found to be a critical target for host immune responses by RV144 trial vaccines. To determine if this mutant indeed arose through a strong selection against V2-directed antibody responses, the epitope specificity of antibodies was evaluated in the longitudinal plasma samples. The V1V2 domains, but not the full-length Env proteins, were used for testing in order to exclude the binding responses directed against other regions of the envelope protein. Four V1V2 domain recombinants were constructed using the phage T4 small terminase subunit gp16 (18 kDa) as a nanoscaffold: gp16-H173 (‘wild-type’ T/F07) and three 24-wk V2 mutants namely, gp16-H173Y (Y173), gp16-ΔDSV, and gp16-Y173+ΔDSV. Gp16 is a well-characterized oligomer that forms highly soluble and stable 11-mer and 12-mer ring structures. The V1V2 domains with a StrepTag fused to the C-terminus of gp16 are expected to decorate the nanoscaffold. These were expressed in GnTi cells, affinity-purified by StrepTactin chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and used to capture the respective V1V2-specific antibody titers in the longitudinal plasma samples of participant 7 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay.</p><p>The data revealed remarkable epitope specificity to the V2 domain of the original T/F07 virus, but not to the H173Y variant, at 24 week post-infection.

These gp140 Envs allowed evaluation of V2 epitope specificity in the native gp140 Env context and also filtered out the gp16 scaffold- and strep-tag-specific antibody titers.

This was tested by blocking assays using CH58 and CH59 mAbs. The H173 gp140 Env antigen was coated on ELISA plates and were exposed to H173 or Y173 mice sera after first blocking by treatment with CH58 or CH59 mAbs. Remarkably, the H173 sera, but not the Y173 sera, with or without ΔDSV, showed significant reduction in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Furthermore, since CH58 and CH59 binding is sensitive to mutation at D180 residue that is adjacent to C β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), we evaluated its binding. Consistent with the above antibody blocking data, binding of H173-induced antibodies but not of Y173-induced antibodies was significantly more sensitive to D180A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–I</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the presence of histidine at position 173 favors induction of CH58/59-like antibodies with narrow specificity as were elicited by the RV144 vaccinees.</p><p>The above datasets show that the mouse H173-induced antibodies, like their human counterparts, are narrowly specific to the autologous C β-strand and hence sensitive to sequence variation. Conversely, the Y173-induced antibodies are broadly reactive, conformation-dependent, and cross-reactive to diverse V2 domains that differ in length, sequence, and glycosylation. Furthermore, these antibodies also tolerated variations in C β-strand sequence not only at 173 position but also at other critical positions such as K168 or K169 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Structural analyses indicate conformational switching in virus escape</title><p>To determine if the mutational switch involved in virus escape might be due to a conformational switch in the C β-strand, we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and structural modeling analyses of H173- and Y173-V1V2 domains. For MD simulations, we first modeled H173- and Y173-V1V2 domains using MODELLER 9v7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>) based on our recently published cryo-EM structure of CRF_AE T/F100 HIV-1 Env trimer as template (PDB ID: 6NQD), due to their extensive sequence similarity (87.6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ananthaswamy et al., 2019</xref>). Both these V1V2 domains assumed β-stranded conformation matching the template. The V1V2 domains were extracted to run simulations using GROMACS 5.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Der Spoel et al., 2005</xref>) and trajectories were produced for 100 ns with 2fs time step. We then explored how H173 and Y173 strand V1V2 models undergo changes in conformation over time.</p><p>In H173/Strand but not in Y173/Strand trajectory, helix content increased over time, though the β-pairing within the domain remained stable. In contrast to H173/Strand trajectory, Y173/Strand trajectory displayed a dynamic and fluctuating β-strand content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left). We further investigated how the V1V2 conformation would change if the C strand was a helix in the initial conformation. To construct a helix initial model, helical restraints were put on residues, 167–176 (DKKQRVH<bold>/</bold>YALF), following the helical conformation of the published crystal structure of V2/C-strand peptide (PDB ID: 4HPO). The helical structures were also modeled using MODELLER 9v7. Different from the strand conformation simulations, trajectories with helix initial conformations showed unstable trajectories for both H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains. The overall β-strand content increased around 30 ns in both the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right). However, while helix in Y173/Helix model was fully unwound during simulation, one turn encompassing residues 166–171 remained in H173/Helix until the end of the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Furthermore, the unwound region of H173/Helix but not Y173/Helix model could still engage in β-pairing. Overall, the MD simulations data suggested distinct conformational dynamics for H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains with the latter being relatively more dynamic. Furthermore, while the conserved β-sheet conformation is thermodynamically favored and hence predominates for V1V2 domain, H173/C-strand region could tolerate helical constraint owing to the stable β-pairing in the rest of the domain.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structural analyses of H173 and Y173 variant V1V2 domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Secondary-structure content variation as a function of time in nanoseconds (ns) initiated with V2/strand conformation (left) and V2/helix conformation (right) of H173 and Y173 V1V2 models during MD simulation.

Five 3D models depicting possible conformations were generated for each V1V2 variant based on replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulation under the guide of an atomic-level knowledge-based force field. It was found that only one of the five H173-V1V2 models depicted C strand as β-strand, while the rest showed a coil plus a short β-strand or a full coil conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, four of the five Y173-V1V2 models depicted C strand in β-stranded conformation while only one model showed this region to assume coil conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Overall, these models indicate that H173Y mutation causes a structural change in the C β-strand thereby altering the conformational dynamics of the V1V2 domain. Furthermore, notably, models of both the variants depicted the C strand as β-strand to some degree which represent the conserved Greek key motif captured by all the resolved Env trimer structures. However, the degree of β-stranded character was identified to be much higher in Y173 variant than in H173 variant. Hence, it is plausible that the observed antibody evasion and virus escape that occurred in participant 7 was due to a structural transition in this V2 epitope, from helix to β-strand owing to H173Y mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Combinatorial V2 immunogen library construction rationale</title><p>The H173Y mutation leading to structural transition, viral escape, and induction of broadly reactive antibody species provided a conceptual basis to design an ensemble of V2-conformation variants, which could further determine if H173 and Y173 immunotypes can exhibit any effect on the V2 conformation and antibody responses with other V2 mutations. Furthermore, we hypothesized that combinatorial immunogen libraries might further broaden antibody responses which might have implications for vaccine design.</p><p>For designing these combinatorial immunogen libraries, first, we sought to identify the potential escape sites in the semi-conserved C β-strand which is previously reported to be conformationally polymorphic and a prime target of V2-directed antibodies. HIV sequence database was explored to extract 100 Env sequences from each of the major geographically prevalent HIV subtypes including A, B, C, and AE. These sequences were individually aligned using CLC Main Workbench and the partly conserved C strand sequence alignment was extracted to generate a consensus logo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Subsequently, sites of highest variability were identified in the consensus logogram with the rationale that a less conserved or highly variable site is likely to be linked to viral escape. This resulted in the prediction of four residues-at amino acid positions 166, 169, 170, 171 as highly variable. Then, primers were designed such that the most common variants in the natural HIV-1 population, lysine (K), arginine (R), or glutamine (Q), were incorporated at each of these positions through controlled mutagenesis approach to generate a combinatorial library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The resultant library encompassed 54 V2-variants possibly representing the V2 conformations prevalent in the HIV population. The rationale behind choosing naturally selected mutations is not only to represent natural diversity of HIV-1 but to also ensure the structural and functional integrity of the V1V2 domain, thereby presenting only the most relevant epitope diversity to the immune system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Combinatorial V2-immunogens induce broad antibody responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Consensus logo of C β-strand (residue 166–178) of the V1V2 region generated using 100 <italic>env</italic> sequences each of clades A, B, C, D, and AE.

In contrast, H173-induced sera strongly reacted with Env antigens from A244, 93TH75, 1086, and CM235 strains that contained similar C β-strand sequence as the T/F07 virus, while showing moderate to poor reactivity with the rest of the Env antigens as depicted in the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Upon grouping the antigens into T/F07 matched and mis-matched C β-strand sequence, H173 antibody responses were more sensitive to mismatches in the C β-strand region than the Y173 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Cumulative response towards all the antigens was also compared for H173 and Y173 groups by plotting the summarized response based on AUC values (%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These data clearly showed that with single residue change, H173Y, there occurred significant improvement in recognition of diverse Env antigens and hence breadth of V2 reactivity.</p><p>The combinatorial H173-induced antibodies, like the H173-induced antibodies, were significantly inhibited by CH58 antibodies while no significant inhibition was observed for sera induced by Y173 or Y173 combinatorial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). These data suggest that both these immunotypes play a dominant role in influencing the conformation even in the context of a library of V2 variants. Furthermore, since CH58 recognizes V2 region as α-helix, it is consistent with our analyses described above that the H173 immunotype has more propensity for helical conformation over β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, unlike the H173 group, the combinatorial H173 group showed relatively broader responses, with much improved binding to Env antigens such as T/F61, T/F94, T/F100, MN, and Bal. Hence, H173 library-based vaccine candidates led to enhanced recognition of other Env proteins. With respect to Y173 and Y173.∆DSV combinatorial libraries, strong binding was seen with all Y173 antigens and moderate reactivity towards H173 bearing antigens. Notably, the sera induced by Y173.∆V1 combinatorial library showed strong overall binding to both H173 and Y173 antigens. Though the breadth of reactivity for this group was comparable to a non-combinatorial Y173 group, it represented a distinct binding profile because of its stronger reactivity to most of the Env antigens such as A244, T/F100, 96ZM651, and BG505 than the H173Y group containing the V1 loop (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, the Y173.∆V1 combinatorial immunogens containing both the Y173 mutation and V1 loop deletion could be an effective design for broader and stronger cross-reactive V2 antibodies. Overall, this combinatorial approach demonstrates that accommodating putative escape mutations with either histidine or tyrosine at position 173 have differential effect on V2 conformation and antibody responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The modest 31.2% efficacy of the only successful RV144 HIV vaccine trial in Thailand was correlated with the induction of V2-directed antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of breakthrough infections of vaccinees showed mutations in the V2 domain of the circulating viruses, presumably selected for their ability to survive under the host immune pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moodie et al., 2022</xref>). If the vaccine-induced antibody responses had increased breadth, vaccine efficacy would have been greater and it would have also minimized the emergence of viral escape mutants. Hence, increasing the breadth of vaccine-induced antibody responses is a critical goal of HIV-1 vaccine design. Here, we report detailed analyses of a remarkable genetic shift of a transmitted/founder HIV-1 virus through a single amino acid substitution in the V2 domain to escape strong host immune pressure that also resulted in increased breadth and cross-reactivity toward diverse HIV-1 V2 domains and envelope proteins.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses of T/F viruses in longitudinal samples of RV217 ECHO trial identified a complete genetic shift of virus population in participant 7 at 24 wk post-infection. The shifted viruses carried a histidine to tyrosine substitution at position 173 of the semi-conserved C β-strand of the V2 domain. This shift coincided with a wave of H173-epitope specific antibodies produced by the host immune system. That the Y173-epitope showed no detectable reactivity to these antibodies while the H173 epitope reacted strongly demonstrates that the Y173 substitution represents an escape mutant selected in response to the strong immune pressure. Furthermore, the Y173 epitope either did not bind, or bound poorly, to CH58 and CH59 mAbs isolated from RV144 vaccinees, which are also directed to the same C β-strand epitope and recognize H173 as a critical residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, two of the three vaccine immunogens (A244 and 93TH023) used in the RV144 trial had histidine at 173 position, suggesting the H173 specificity of these vaccine induced CH58 and CH59 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robb et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Neither the participant 7 T/F sera, nor the RV144 vaccine sera or the CH58 and CH59 mAbs, exhibited strong virus neutralizing activity, but the latter exhibited strong ADCC activity which correlated with reduced infection in immune correlate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonsignori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollara et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in our current study, the Y173 escape mutant which also consisted of an additional DSV tripeptide deletion in the adjacent variable V2 loop showed significant resistance to ADCC mediated killing when compared to the H173 epitope. The DSV deletion alone otherwise had no effect on the binding of the C β-strand epitope to antibodies as evaluated by ELISA or SPR binding assays, yet it was co-selected along with the Y173 mutation. This would argue that the strong immune pressure exerted by the host might be due to the ADCC activity of the elicited antibody responses, consistent with the previous reports suggesting the importance of ADCC responses in HIV-1 infected individuals particularly the elite controllers, and the protection imparted by vaccines in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonsignori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Excler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupuy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mabuka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isitman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollara et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, a second wave of antibodies with greater breadth emerged following the H173 to Y173 genetic shift and the essential disappearance of the H173-specific first wave antibodies. Unlike the latter, the second wave antibodies bound equally well to both H173 and Y173 C β- strand epitopes, as analyzed by multiple assays including the sensitive SPR assay. Notably, an examination of Env trimer structures show that the H173 residue is at the center of the C β-strand that contains hydrophilic and solvent-exposed residues flanking on one side and hydrophobic and buried residues on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2015</xref>). A H173Y mutation could therefore have significant structural consequences. Previous X-ray structures showed that the H173 peptide epitope assumes an α-helix when bound to CH58 and CH59 antibodies as opposed to a β-strand in the envelope proteins with tyrosine at residue 173 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ananthaswamy et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, prevalence of either H or Y residues at this position among numerous Env sequences in the database argues for functional importance of this site in HIV-1 evolution. Thus, it appears most likely that the H173Y genetic shift in T/F07 HIV-1 virus may have caused a significant structural/conformational change in the C β-strand epitope, which led to total escape of H173-specific immune pressure while inducing the second wave antibodies with distinct specificity and greater breadth.</p><p>Remarkably, the differential immunological responses observed in the human immune system were recapitulated in a mouse model. First, the gp16-V1V2 nanoscaffolds elicited antibody responses in mice that recognized the respective V2 epitopes in the context of gp120 or gp140 envelope protein structures. This is significant not only because antibodies induced by other scaffolded V2 domains do not bind well to the envelope proteins but also that it indicates that the gp16-scaffolded V2 epitopes are displayed in a native-like conformation. Second and more important, the H173 and Y173 variants induced antibodies with distinct specificities, similar to that observed in the human system. While the H173-induced antibodies strongly reacted with the autologous peptides but not with the Y173 peptide, the Y173-induced antibodies exhibited broad reactivity to both the peptides. This differential response was also observed in their reactivity towards diverse HIV-1 Env proteins. While the H173 antibodies were sensitive to mismatches or sequence diversity in the C β-strand, the Y173 antibodies showed cross-reactivity to a variety of Env proteins. Third, the H173 antibodies but not the Y173 antibodies competed with the RV144 CH58 and CH59 mAbs for binding to the C β-strand epitope.</p><p>The picture that emerges from the above data, combined with the previously reported studies, is that the C β-strand region is conformationally dynamic and probably undergoes a structural transition when H173 changes to Y, from a β-strand conformation as part of conserved Greek motif to an α-helix/helix-coil conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Eeden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wibmer et al., 2018</xref>). Our MD simulations and <italic>ab initio</italic> structural modeling of H173 and Y173 V1V2 domains further suggest that the H173 region is rigid and assumes a helical/coil conformation whereas the Y173 domain is more dynamic, preferring to be β-stranded and part of a β-sheet core. Thus, it is imperative to include both these structural forms in any vaccine design for increasing the breadth of antibody responses. In fact, a pentavalent vaccine containing five Env proteins including both the H173 and Y173 variants gave better protection in non-human primates when compared to single immunogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given the above considerations, we rationalized that for a vaccine to be highly effective, it should not only contain the H173 and Y173 variants, but additionally it should also include commonly found mutations that could fine-tune the C β-strand conformation, some of which might have arisen as escape mutants against host immune pressures in past infections. Furthermore, presenting these variants as gp16 scaffolds would be ideal because this would eliminate nonspecific distraction to other nonessential epitope sites of the Env but also that the gp16-scaffolded V1V2 domains, as discussed above, elicit antibodies that recognize the C β-strand epitopes in a native context. Therefore, a combinatorial immunogen design was developed by including both H173 and Y173 variants, each in addition carrying combinations of the commonly found substitutions in the C β-strand as informed by sequence analyses. These combinations, a total of 54 variant epitopes in each library, in some respects might mimic the natural V2 conformations of HIV-1 viruses humans are exposed to at the site of entry. Assessment of the antibody responses in the mouse model showed that, indeed, some of these libraries significantly enhanced the immune breadth when compared to the respective single immunogen controls. However, consistent with the human responses, the breadth is greater in the context of Y173 when compared to H173, particularly when Y173 was combined with a deletion of V1 loop. The greater breadth and cross-reactive responses resulted from the Y173-∆V1 library was most likely due to reducing the immunodominance of V1 epitopes as well as generation of breadth favoring conformational variants generated by Y173 switch. Consistent with these data is the recent report that showed that the responses directed to V1 loop interferes with binding of protective V2-directed antibodies to Env and promotes virus acquisition in SIV vaccinated macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silva de Castro et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, the H173 combinatorial libraries induced antibodies similar to CH58 mAb as shown by the CH58 blocking data. Induction of such responses despite additional mutations in the C β-strand argues for a dominant role the H173 residue plays in assuming a helical conformation that is recognized by the CH58 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our studies show that residue 173 and the presence of histidine or tyrosine at this position strongly influence the local conformation of V2 domain and this conformational dynamism might lead to virus escape and breakthrough infections. This could potentially be curtailed by combinatorial vaccine designs such as the Y173-∆V1 library of immunogens that can display a set of dynamic and flexible conformations and have the potential to generate broad antibody responses. This type of escape and conformational variations could also be obtained on a larger scale by AI-based structural modeling and machine learning using the vast HIV sequence database from various clinical trials. These approaches in future could lead to highly effective HIV-1 vaccines with enhanced efficacy and greater ability to block diverse virus transmissions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viral load analysis</title><p>Viral loads were determined in participant 7 longitudinal samples from wk 0 up to wk 144 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trinh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robb et al., 2016</xref>).

Dodecahedron periodic box was solvated by TIP3P water molecules. The size of the solvation box was set to 1.0 nm from the V1/V2 domain. Sodium ions were added to neutralize the system. After solvation, steepest decent minimization with 50000 steps was applied. Then, the systems were equilibrated at 300 K during 100 ps (NVT equilibrium) and at 1.0 bar during 100 ps (NPT equilibrium). After equilibration, 100 ns MD trajectory was produced for each system. The equilibration and MD production were done with 2 fs timestep, applying LINCS algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recombinant plasmid constructions gp16-V1V2 scaffolds and combinatorial libraries</title><p>The gp140-TF07 <italic>env</italic> sequence (spanning gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain up to amino acid 664) was codon optimized and synthesized using GeneArt Strings gene synthesis (Life Technologies). This synthetic fragment was used as template to amplify T/F07-V1V2 sequence corresponding to the residues 117–206 of the Env. The V1V2 sequence was cloned into pCDNA3.1(–) mammalian expression vector engineered to harbor codon optimized bacteriophage T4 terminase, gp16 with an N-terminal Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) signal peptide for secretion of recombinant protein into the media, and a Twin Strep-tag II sequence (WSHPQFEK) for affinity purification at the C-terminus. The amplified V1V2 fragment was cloned downstream to gp16 followed by Twin-strep tags. After the construction gp16-T/F07 V1V2 clone, point mutation and/or deletion was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis to construct gp16-H173Y, -ΔDSV and -H173Y+ΔDSV V1V2 scaffolds. For the construction gp16-V1V2 combinatorial libraries, these scaffolds were used as templates. Controlled mutagenesis was performed using randomized primer pool (IDT) with desired mutations or substitutions at the selected positions in the C strand to generate V1V2 mutant libraries. Amplified V1V2 library fragments were then cloned into the same pcDNA 3.1 vector used previously but with an exception that this vector was further engineered to harbor HRV3c protease cleavage site positioned before the Twin-strep tags for tag removal. For the construction of gp16-H173Y_ΔV1 combinatorial library, H173Y template with a stretch of V1 loop residues (SNITVERNITIANDTYD) deleted and replaced by an optimized short-linker (AGGAS) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>gp140 and gp120 Env clones</title><p>Codon-optimized gp140 <italic>env</italic> sequences (spanning gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain up to amino acid 664) from T/F07, T/F61, T/F94, T/F100, BG505, JRFL and SF162 HIV-1 viruses harboring trimer-stabilizing SOSIP mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>) and six arginine (R6) furin cleavage site (replacing native REKR cleavage site at the junction of gp120 and gp41) were synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binley et al., 2002</xref>).

Non-specifically bound proteins were washed off by passing at least 20 column volumes of the wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) or until the absorbance reached the baseline level. Bound gp16-V1V2 proteins were eluted with StrepTactin elution buffer (5 mM d-Desthiobiotin, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted peak fractions were buffer exchanged into 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer. Protein fractions were stored with 10% glycerol at –80 °C until use for antigenicity and immunogenicity studies.

One μL of protease was added per 20 μg of the purified protein (1:20) and incubated at 4 °C for 16 hr. Digested protein was passed twice through StrepTactin spin column (IBA). Uncleaved StrepTagged protein bound to the column while the flow-through containing desirable cleaved fraction was collected. The cleaved protein was then loaded onto the size-exclusion chromatography column for fractionation using 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer. Owing to a large difference in the native dodecameric gp16-V1V2 (~336 kD), HRV3C protease (47.8 kD) was separated from the final immunogens.

All gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 solution. Band intensities were measured using Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR +System and Image Lab software. BSA standards were used to generate a standard curve for quantification. Deglycosylation was also performed to sharpen the bands for accurate quantitation as HIV Env proteins are glycosylated and hence appear fuzzy on gels. For deglycosylation, 1 µl (500 Units) of PNGase F (New England BioLabs, Inc) was used to deglycosylate 10 µg of the protein in the presence of 5 mM DTT and mild detergents by incubating at room temperature for 1 hr according to manufacturer’s recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Mini PVDF Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc).

The striking feature of the RV217 cohort is the ability to detect viremia in the first week of infection, which can be followed at discrete Fiebig stages over long time intervals. This study evaluated Env sequences at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 24 weeks to provide a picture of viral and immunological co-evolution from Fiebig Stage I (1 week), Fiebig Stages IV (4 weeks), and Fiebig Stage VI (&gt;24 weeks). This study design enabled lineage tracing of viral variants from a single transmitted founder (T/F) over the Fiebig Stages I, IV, and VI under nascent immune pressure generated in response to the T/F virus and its subsequent mutants.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>As expected, there were temporal differences in the appearance of virus quasispecies among the individuals, which were located predominantly in solvent-exposed residues of Env, which is consistent with prior literature. Interestingly, two waves of antibody reactivity were observed for variants with mutations in the V2 region that harbors V2i and V2p epitopes correlated with protection in the RV144 clinical trial. Two waves of antibody response, detected by SPR, were observed, with the first wave being predominated by antibodies specific for the T/F07 V2 epitope associated with H173 located on the C β-strand in the V2 region. The second wave was dominated by antibodies specific for an H to Y mutation at 173 that emerged due to antibody-mediated pressure to the original H173 virus. This is a remarkable finding in three ways.</p><p>First, the mutation is in the C β-strand, an unlikely paratope contact residue, as this region of the V2 loop is shielded by glycans in Env trimer structures with full glycan representation (see PDB:5t3x). The structure used for modeling in the current study was an earlier structure, PDB:4TVP, that had many truncated glycans. This does not detract from the finding that the H173Y mutation likely causes a conformational shift from a more rigid helical/coil conformation to a more dynamic conformation with a β-stranded and β-sheet core preference as indicated by the literature and by the MD simulations carried out by the authors. This observation suggests that using V2 scaffolds with both the H173 and H173Y variants will increase the breadth of potentially protective antibody responses to HIV-1, as indicated in reference 42, cited by the authors. Interestingly, the H173Y mutation abrogates reactivity to mAb CH58 and attenuates reactivity to mAb CH59 isolated from RV144 volunteers. These mAbs recognize conformationally distinct V2 epitopes, adding further credence to the conclusion that the H173Y mutation results in a conformational switch of the V2 region.</p><p>Second, the H173Y mutation affects the conformation of V2 epitopes recognized by mAbs that do not neutralize T/F HIV-1 while mediating potent ADCC. The ADCC data in the manuscript provides strong support for this hypothesis and augers for further exploration of the V2 epitopes as HIV-1 vaccine targets.</p><p>Third, it is striking that immunogens based on the H173Y mutation successfully recapitulated the observed human antibody responses in wild-type Balb/c mice. The investigators used their extensive knowledge of V2 structures and scaffold-immunogens to create the library of constructs used for this study. In this case, the ΔDSV mutation increased the breadth and magnitude of the murine antibody responses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92379.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, researchers aimed to understand how a transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV virus escapes host immune pressure during early infection. They focused on the V1V2 domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, a key determinant of virus escape. The study involved four participants from the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, which allowed tracking HIV infection from just days after infection.</p><p>The study identified a significant H173Y escape mutation in the V2 domain of a T/F virus from one participant. This mutation, located in the relatively conserved &quot;C&quot; β-strand, was linked to viral escape against host immune pressure. The study further investigated the epitope specificity of antibodies in the participant's plasma, revealing that the H173Y mutation played a crucial role in epitope switching during virus escape. Monoclonal antibodies from the RV144 vaccine trial, CH58, and CH59, showed reduced binding to the V1V2-Y173 escape variant. Additionally, the study examined antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses and found resistance to killing in the Y173 mutants. The H173Y mutation was identified as the key variant selected against the host's immune pressure directed at the V2 domain.</p><p>The researchers hypothesized that the H173Y mutation caused a structural/conformational change in the C β-strand epitope, leading to viral escape. This was supported by molecular dynamics simulations and structural modeling analyses. They then designed combinatorial V2 immunogen libraries based on natural HIV-1 sequence diversity, aiming to broaden antibody responses. Mouse immunizations with these libraries demonstrated enhanced recognition of diverse Env antigens, suggesting a potential strategy for developing a more effective HIV vaccine.</p><p>In summary, the study provides insights into the early evolution of HIV-1 during infection, highlighting the importance of the V1V2 domain and identifying key escape mutations. The findings suggest a novel approach for designing HIV vaccine candidates that consider the diversity of escape mutations to induce broader and more effective immune responses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The article presents several strengths:</p><p>(1) The experimental design is well-structured, involving multiple stages from phylogenetic analyses to mouse model testing, providing a comprehensive approach to studying virus escape mutations.</p><p>(2) The study utilizes a unique dataset from the RV217 Early Capture HIV Cohort (ECHO) project, allowing for the tracking of HIV infection from the very early stages in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. This provides valuable insights into the evolution of the virus.</p><p>(3) The use of advanced techniques such as phylogenetic analyses, nanoscaffold technology, controlled mutagenesis, and monoclonal antibody evaluations demonstrates the application of cutting-edge methodologies in the study.</p><p>(4) The research goes beyond genetic analysis and provides an in-depth characterization of the escape mutation's impact, including structural analyses through Molecular Dynamics simulations, antibody responses, and functional implications for virus survival.</p><p>(5) The study provides insights into the immune responses triggered by the escape mutation, including the specificity of antibodies and their ability to recognize diverse HIV-1 Env antigens.</p><p>(7) The exploration of combinatorial immunogen libraries is a strength, as it offers a novel approach to broaden antibody responses, providing a potential avenue for future vaccine design.</p><p>(8) The research is highly relevant to vaccine development, as it sheds light on the dynamics of HIV escape mutations and their interaction with the host immune system. This information is crucial for designing effective vaccines that can preemptively interfere with viral acquisition.</p><p>(9) The study integrates findings from virology, immunology, structural biology, and bioinformatics, showcasing an interdisciplinary approach that enhances the depth and breadth of the research.</p><p>(10) The article is well-written, with a clear presentation of methods, results, and implications, making it accessible to both specialists and a broader scientific audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92379.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Venigalla B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Catholic University of America</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington, DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Swati</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Uritskiy</surname><given-names>Gherman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Catholic University of America</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington, DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahalingam</surname><given-names>Marthandan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Catholic University of America</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington, DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Batra</surname><given-names>Himanshu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Boston Children&amp;apos;s Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chand</surname><given-names>Subhash</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Nebraska Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nebraska</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Trinh</surname><given-names>Hung V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Woong-Hee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Alsalmi</surname><given-names>Wadad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Catholic University of America</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington, DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kijak</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eller</surname><given-names>Leigh A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henry M.

Although the V2-scaffolds were produced in GnTi- cells to produce highmannose proteins, it appears that no systematic analysis of glycan content or structure was carried out save for enzymatic deglycosylation of the constructs to sharpen bands on SDS-PAGE gels. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on how the lack of this information might impact their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p><p>The lack of native glycan structures is a common phenomenon in all HIV studies involving in vitro cell culture-expressed envelope proteins.</p><p>As the reviewer mentioned, it is clear that our V1V2 scaffolds produced in GnTi-cells contain the expected high-mannose glycans, as evident from a significant shift and sharpening of the protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel upon deglycosylation with the PNGase enzyme.</p><p>In our previously published studies by Chand et al.,2017* (ref. below), the V1V2 scaffolds were shown to bind to glycan-dependent PG9 antibody suggesting that the conformation of the PG9 epitope is retained in the high-mannose V1V2 scaffold. This information has also been added to the “Hypothesis and Experimental Design” section of the Results in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, as shown in Results, the human antibodies elicited in study participants against native glycosylated envelope protein due to natural HIV-1 infection distinguished the H173 and Y 173 epitopes in the high-mannose scaffolds, which was also recapitulated in our mouse studies using the GnTi-expressed high-mannose V1V2 scaffolds as antigens.</p><p>Therefore, it does not seem likely that differences in glycans per se majorly affected the binding or the conclusions from our studies.</p><p>*Chand S, Messina EL, AlSalmi W, Ananthaswamy N, Gao G, Uritskiy G, Padilla-Sanchez V, Mahalingam M, Peachman KK, Robb ML, Rao M, Rao VB.

Therefore, we focused on the protein backbone of the short C-strand in the V2 region that lacks glycan sites and in previous published studies has been demonstrated as conformationally polymorphic.</p><p>Since this C-strand epitope is the binding site for many V2-directed antibodies identified previously, we hypothesized that it is relevant to explore this small immunogenic epitope for its propensity to change conformation due to an escape mutation discovered at residue 173 in a natural HIV-1 infection. How might this epitope behave in MD simulations in the presence of different glycans requires further investigation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
