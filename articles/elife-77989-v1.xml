However, coiled coils lack features typical of protein–protein interaction sites, and it is therefore challenging to understand how M proteins achieve specific binding, for example, with the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, leading to its neutralization. The crystal structure of a complex of LL-37 with M87 protein, an antigenic M protein variant from a strain that is an emerging threat, revealed a novel interaction mode. The M87 coiled coil unfurled and asymmetrically exposed its hydrophobic core to capture LL-37. A single LL-37 molecule was bound by M87 in the crystal, but in solution additional LL-37 molecules were recruited, consistent with a ‘protein trap’ neutralization mechanism. The interaction mode visualized crystallographically was verified to contribute significantly to LL-37 resistance in an M87 Strep A strain and was identified to be conserved in a number of other M protein types that are prevalent in human populations. Our results provide specific detail for therapeutic inhibition of LL-37 neutralization by M proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>We share our environment with many different bacteria. Some are beneficial for our health, like gut bacteria, but others can cause severe disease if they infect and spread within the body’s tissues. For example, the bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> can cause conditions ranging from skin infections to a rapidly spreading deep-tissue infection, giving it the nickname “flesh-eating bacterium”.</p><p>To prevent infection, our bodies have developed defence mechanisms that target disease-causing bacteria. These include antimicrobial molecules, such as LL-37, which is a small protein produced on the skin. LL-37 kills bacteria by puncturing their cell membrane (the bacterial equivalent of our skin); in other words, it acts like a tiny chemical dart that ‘pops’ the bacterial cell.</p><p>However, some bacteria, including <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, can disarm these defences. <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> captures LL-37 on its surface with so called M proteins, which prevent LL-37 from reaching and destroying the underlying membrane. However, it was unknown how exactly the two proteins interact, especially since LL-37 is a simple molecule that lacks the structural features that allow most proteins to bind to each other.</p><p>Kolesiński et al. set out to determine how the M protein can ‘grab’ LL-37. A technique called X-ray crystallography allowed them to visualise the molecules atom by atom and to examine the configuration of the M protein after it had captured LL-37. The M protein selected for these experiments (M87) came from a strain associated with particularly severe disease, considered to be an emerging health threat. The results showed that M87 uncurled itself, thereby exposing specific parts that normally remain hidden. This way, it could capture LL-37, like a hand opening to grab an object.</p><p>Kolesiński et al. have revealed a key molecular mechanism that enables a disease-causing bacterium to invade our immune defences. Identifying which regions of M87 are involved in capturing LL-37 may help design more effective therapies to combat <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>coiled coils</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic></kwd><kwd>M protein</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptide</kwd><kwd>cathelicidin</kwd><kwd>LL-37</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pyogenes</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI144901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Partho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> M87 protein unfurls its coiled coil to capture and neutralize the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>M proteins are the major surface-localized virulence factor of the widespread and potentially deadly bacterial pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> or Strep A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ghosh, 2018</xref>). One of the primary functions of M proteins is to enable Strep A to evade human innate and adaptive immune responses. This is brought about by interaction of M proteins with select human proteins. M proteins are antigenically sequence variable, with over 220 different types having been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McMillan et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this variation, the primary sequences of M proteins generally have a propensity to form dimeric, α-helical coiled coils, as verified by direct experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McNamara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Macheboeuf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buffalo et al., 2016</xref>). This propensity is easily distinguishable by the presence of heptad repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manjula and Fischetti, 1980</xref>), in which amino acids in the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions of the heptad are usually small and hydrophobic, and form the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil. In contrast to the usually complex topography of globular proteins, demarcated by pockets and cavities that enable specific protein–protein interactions, the simple fibrillar structure of M protein coiled coils raises the question of how M proteins achieve specific binding with their human targets.</p><p>A particular challenge lies in understanding how M proteins specifically bind and thereby neutralize the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37. This is because LL-37 also has a simple topography: LL-37 consists of a short amphipathic α-helix. LL-37 is a member of the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide family and constitutes a major host immune defense against Strep A, as well as other pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nizet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LaRock and Nizet, 2015</xref>). The 37-amino acid peptide is proteolytically generated from the precursor protein hCAP-18, which is produced by neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and keratinocytes, along with other epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nizet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zaiou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Like other amphipathic α-helical antimicrobial peptides, LL-37 functions by inserting into and lysing bacterial plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, M1 protein was shown to neutralize the antimicrobial activity of LL-37 by sequestering it in a ‘protein trap’ on the Strep A surface and away from its target of action, the bacterial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lauth et al., 2009</xref>). Not only does M1 protein attached to bacterial surface have this neutralization capacity, but so too does M1 protein released in soluble form from the Strep A surface, as occurs during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herwald et al., 2004</xref>). M1 protein also binds the LL-37 precursor hCAP-18 and consequently prevents the proteolytic generation of LL-37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine the mechanism of LL-37 binding and neutralization by M proteins, we pursued co-crystallization. While M1 protein proved recalcitrant to co-crystallization, several new M protein types that bind and neutralize LL-37 were identified. LL-37 was co-crystallized with M87 protein, which is an M type from a strain that is an emerging health threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al., 2019</xref>). The structure revealed a remarkable and novel mode of interaction for a coiled coil, in which a portion of the M87 protein coiled coil unfurled and exposed its hydrophobic core for interaction with LL-37. The LL-37-binding motif visualized in M87 protein was identified in a number of other M protein types, many of which are prevalent in human populations. Experimental evidence showed that some of these other M types bound and neutralized LL-37 similarly to M87 protein. Our results provide specific detail for inhibiting the interaction of M proteins with LL-37.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the M87/LL-37 complex</title><p>To determine the mechanism of binding of LL-37 by M proteins, we pursued co-crystallization beginning with M1 protein but were unable to obtain co-crystals despite various attempts.

Two nearly identical 1:2 complexes occupied the asymmetric unit of the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, RMSD 0.70 Å). Almost the entire length of LL-37, which was predominantly in α-helical conformation, was visible in the crystal structure. GCN4-M87 was likewise in α-helical conformation throughout, but strikingly, only the GCN4 portion formed a coiled coil while the M87 α-helices were unfurled and asymmetrically disposed. This was best appreciated by comparing the structures of the complexed and free form of GCN4-M87. The structure of the latter was determined to 2.4 Å resolution limit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Free GCN4-M87 formed a dimeric coiled coil throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the unfurling of the M87 α-helices was unique to the bound form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The greatest extent of unfurling occurred at Phe91, in which the distance between Cα atoms was 8.7 Å in the free form but 15.6 Å in the bound form. Only the M87 portion contacted LL-37, and therefore we will refer only to M87 rather than GCN4-M87 hereafter. The two M87 α-helices and the LL-37 α-helix together formed a parallel, three-helix bundle. One of the M87 α-helices made more contact with LL-37 (1016 Å<sup>2</sup> total buried surface area, average of the two complexes in the asymmetric unit of the crystal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, dark blue) while the other made less but still substantial contact (491 Å<sup>2</sup> average total buried surface area) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, cyan); to differentiate between the two M87 α-helices, the one making greater contact will be denoted M87α1 and the other M87α2.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>M87/LL-37 interface.</title><p>LL-37 is in magenta, and the M87 α-helix that forms a greater number of contacts with LL-37 is in blue (M87α1) and the one that forms fewer contacts in cyan (M87α2).

Most notably, a number of hydrophobic M87 amino acids that occupied the core <italic>a</italic> or <italic>d</italic> positions and contacted each other in the free form, as is typical of coiled coils, were exposed in the bound form and instead contacted the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic LL-37 α-helix. Nearly five helical turns of LL-37 (Phe5-Val21) and M87 protein (Leu74-Trp92) engaged one another. Near the N-terminus of LL-37, a consecutive pair of phenylalanines, Phe5 and Phe6, was surrounded by hydrophobic <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> position amino acids of M87–Leu74 (<italic>a</italic>, usual position in heptad), Ala77 (<italic>d</italic>), and Tyr81 (<italic>a</italic>) from M87α along with Ala77 from M87α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The two LL-37 Phe’s and M87 Tyr81 formed a series of π-stacks. Two helical turns later in LL-37 was Ile13 that engaged in a ring of isoleucines, with M87 contributing Ile84 (<italic>d</italic>) from each of its helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A further helical turn later in LL-37 was Phe17 that packed against a pair of M87 leucines, Leu88 (<italic>a</italic>), one from each of the M87 helices, and π-stacked against M87α2 Phe91 (<italic>d</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Lastly, one more helical turn further in LL-37 were Ile20, which was surrounded by M87α1 Phe91 (<italic>d</italic>) and Trp92; Val21, which packed against M87α2 Phe91; and Arg23 whose aliphatic side-chain atoms packed against M87α1 Trp92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These hydrophobic contacts were supplemented by a sparingly few polar ones, which occurred all within a small polar break in the hydrophobic face of LL-37, near its N-terminus: LL-37 Ser9 and Lys12 formed a hydrogen bond and salt bridge, respectively, with M87α1 Glu85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and in one of the two complexes, LL-37 Lys12 also formed a salt bridge with M87α1 Glu89.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Importance of hydrophobic interactions</title><p>The role of the contacts observed structurally was evaluated through site-directed mutagenesis of M87 protein. To ensure that our structural observations were not limited to a fragment of M87 protein, these experiments were carried out with intact M87 protein. Intact His-tagged M87 protein and LL-37 were incubated at 37°C, and their interaction was determined through a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose bead co-precipitation assay. Dual alanine substitutions of M87 Tyr81 (<italic>a</italic>) and Ile84 (<italic>d</italic>), which interacted with LL-37 Phe5, Phe6, and Ile13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), significantly decreased LL-37 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). M87 Y81A/I84A was verified through circular dichroism (CD) to have a similar structure to wild-type M87 protein at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, M87 Y81A/I84A had a temperature-induced unfolding profile similar to that of wild-type M87 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), also as monitored by CD. These results indicated that alanine substitutions of Tyr81 and Ile84 affected LL-37 binding directly rather than indirectly through compromised structure, stability, or both. Alanine substitution of M87 Leu88 (<italic>a</italic>) and Phe91 (<italic>d</italic>), which interacted hydrophobically with LL-37 Phe17, Ile20, and Val21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), likewise markedly decreased LL-37 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The secondary structure and stability of M87 L88A/F91A resembled that of wild-type M87 protein as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). A substantial amount of the surface area of M87 Trp92 was buried by contact with LL-37, but surprisingly, substitution of this amino acid with alanine increased LL-37 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). M87 Trp92 was adjacent to LL-37 Arg23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and thus we asked whether Arg substitution of M87 Trp92 would interfere with LL-37 binding. Indeed, M87 W92R was almost entirely deficient in LL-37 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), while showing no changes in secondary structure or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of M87/LL-37 interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LL-37 binding by His-tagged, intact wild-type M87 or M87 Y81A/I84A, L88A/F91A, E85A, E85R, W92A, or W92R at 37°C as determined by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose bead co-precipitation.

To ask whether it instead contributed to specificity, we asked whether Arg substitution of this amino acid would decrease interaction with LL-37 as M87 Glu85 was adjacent to LL-37 Lys12. Consistent with our structural observations and a role in specificity, M87 E85R had significantly decreased interaction with LL-37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

The molecular weight of intact M87 protein alone was 73.6±1.2 kDa (calc. 72.4 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black). A 10-fold excess of LL-37 to the intact M87 dimer was added, and the sample was applied to SEC-MALS almost immediately after mixing. The complex had a mass of 80.4±0.6 kDa, which corresponded to an M87 protein dimer bound to one or two molecules of LL-37 (calc. 4.5 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, blue). Notably, after 1 hr of incubation of LL-37 with M87 protein, the mass of the complex was 97.1±0.6 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red), which corresponded to an M87 protein dimer bound to five or six molecules of LL-37. Incubation of up to 4 hr also resulted in the same increased mass, indicating self-limiting growth of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To test whether the LL-37-binding mode observed for M87 protein was conserved in these M proteins, Arg substitutions of the equivalent of M87 E85 were constructed. As the E85R substitution had been evaluated only in intact M87 protein, it was introduced into the M87<sup>N100</sup> fragment, which resulted in significantly decreased LL-37 binding as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>).

While Arg substitution of M58<sup>N100</sup> (E97) decreased LL-37 binding, this effect was not statistically significant. Modeling suggested that an Arg at this position in M58 was capable of salt bridging with M58 D94, thereby attenuating its LL-37 repulsion. In the case of M25 and M58 proteins, we noticed that the amino acid preceding the strictly conserved Tyr was Gly, which is a helix-breaking amino acid. Therefore, we substituted the Gly in M25 and M58 proteins with Asp, which is the equivalent amino acid in M87 (D80), and found that M25<sup>N100</sup> G82D and M58<sup>N100</sup> G92D had significantly higher levels of LL-37 binding compared to their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with M25, M58, and M68 binding LL-37 in the same mode as observed for M87 protein and support the hypothesis that the M87 protein LL-37-binding motif is conserved in at least 14 other M proteins, which belong to the E2 or E3 cluster of M proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanderson-Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We sought to understand how M proteins achieve specific binding of LL-37, which is essential to neutralization of this human antimicrobial peptide by the M1 strain of Strep A and likely by other strains as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nizet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lauth et al., 2009</xref>). This question was challenging as the fibrillar structure of M proteins excludes features commonly present in globular proteins that enable specific binding, such as pockets or cavities. Adding to the challenge, the structure of LL-37 lacks complexity, consisting simply of an amphipathic α-helix. We discovered a remarkable mode of interaction of M87 protein with LL-37 through structure determination. The two α-helices of M87 protein in the free state formed a coiled coil, with amino acids in the core <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions engaged in ‘knobs-into-holes’ packing. In the bound state, the two helices did not form a coiled coil, which was instead unfurled with the helices asymmetrically disposed. Intriguingly, analysis of ‘knobs-into-holes’ packing of M87 in the free state shows that A77 and Y81 are not ideally packed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kumar and Woolfson, 2021</xref>). This suggests that the segment containing A77 and Y81 may initiate unfurling to bind LL-37. Most significantly, in the bound state, hydrophobic amino acids at the M87 <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions were exposed and formed a continuous patch that contacted the hydrophobic face of the LL-37 α-helix. These hydrophobic contacts dominated the interaction interface and were shown to be essential by Ala substitution mutagenesis. Recently, a coiled-coil dimer that binds an α-helical partner in a roughly similar manner was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dimitrova-Paternoga et al., 2021</xref>), but in that complex coiled-coil character is maintained, unlike the loss of coiled-coil character observed for the M87/LL-37 complex. In addition, while coiled-coil asymmetry coupled to cognate partner binding has been noted in some proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noell et al., 2019</xref>), this has taken the form of a helical stagger with coiled-coil character maintained. To our knowledge, the unfurling and asymmetric exposure of consecutive <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> position amino acids to form a continuous interaction site is a novel binding mechanism for a coiled-coil protein.</p><p>The LL-37-binding site in M87 protein was formed by two ideal heptads preceded by a nearly ideal heptad (Ala and Gln being tolerated at the <italic>d</italic> position). M proteins identified or predicted to bind LL-37 in the same mode also had at least three such consecutive repeats, with the first heptad being ideal in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, M proteins identified not to bind LL-37 lacked consecutive ideal or near-ideal heptads. Instead, ideal heptads occurred as isolated singletons in the midst of nonideal heptads. Notably, M1 protein has only an isolated ideal repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that there are additional mechanisms for binding LL-37, different from that observed for M87 protein. In general, the occurrence of two or more consecutive ideal heptads is rare in M protein variable regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), whose sequences frequently have coiled-coil destabilizing amino acids at the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions (e.g., Glu or Lys) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McNamara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nilson et al., 1995</xref>). In the case of the M1 B-repeats region, nonideal heptads have been shown to be functionally essential for creating protein dynamics, which are required for binding fibrinogen in a ‘capture-and-collapse’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart et al., 2016</xref>). Dynamics in the consecutive ideal repeats of M87 and related M proteins are likely to be much lower in magnitude than in the nonideal M1 B-repeats, but nevertheless, it appears that enough breathing motion exists even in these ideal coiled coils for the infiltration of LL-37 and disruption of coiled-coil structure. The loose ‘knobs-into-holes’ packing of Y81 in the free form of M87, along with the conservation of the Tyr in M proteins shown or implicated to bind LL-37, suggests that this may be a general site for initiating unfurling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>LL-37-binding motif and higher-order complex formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Occurrence of ideal heptads (dark gray boxes; Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr, or Val at both <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> positions) and near-ideal heptads (light gray boxes; ideal amino acid at <italic>a</italic> position and Ala at <italic>d</italic> position, with M25 being an exception with Gln at this position) within the N-terminal regions of various M protein types.

One or two molecules of LL-37 molecule bound to M87 protein in solution at an initial time point, but grew to five or six molecules over time, as evidenced by SEC-MALS analysis. This is consistent with observations that LL-37 oligomerizes in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johansson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xhindoli et al., 2016</xref>). Plausible mechanisms for the recruitment of additional LL-37 molecules are suggested by crystal structures of LL-37 alone. In one crystal structure, the polar faces of two LL-37 molecules contact one another in antiparallel orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2020</xref>), and in another, the hydrophobic faces do likewise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancho-Vaello et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the single LL-37 molecule bound through its hydrophobic face to M87 protein is able to recruit a second molecule of LL-37 through polar face–polar face interactions. This second LL-37 molecule would then be able to recruit a third molecule of LL-37 through hydrophobic face–hydrophobic face interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). While this sort of growth is not self-limiting, we observed that the LL-37/M87 complex was self-limiting at five or six molecules of LL-37 per M87 dimer, and thus the specific details of LL-37/LL-37 interactions are likely to differ. The excess of LL-37 bound by M87 protein is consistent with a ‘protein trap’ neutralization mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The physiological relevance of the mode of LL-37 binding by M87 protein was established through deletion and complementation experiments.

The search model was generated from the coiled-coil dimer structure of GCN4 fused to the coiled-coil dimer structure of striated muscle α-tropomyosin (PDB 1KQL) using Sculptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunkóczi and Read, 2011</xref>) with default settings. Extensive model modification and building were performed with Coot and guided by the inspection of σA-weighted 2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc omit maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>LL-37 in the GCN4-M87/LL-37 complex was manually modeled into well-defined difference electron density that was visible after a few rounds of refinement of the search model. The asymmetric unit of the GCN4-M87/LL-37 crystal contained two heteromeric assemblies, each composed of two chains of GCN4-M87 and one of LL-37. Refinement was performed using Refine from the Phenix suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>) with default settings. At the final stages of refinement, TLS parameters were applied. TLS groups were applied as follows: chain A; chain B; chain C aa 41–55 and 56–93; chain D aa 38–55 56–104; chain E; and chain F. Side chains with no corresponding electron density were truncated to Cβ. Interaction interfaces between M87 and LL-37 were analyzed with PISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The GCN4-M87 dimer was modeled into continuous electron density. The asymmetric unit of the GCN4-M87 crystal contained a single coiled-coil dimer. Refinement of GCN4-M87 was performed using Refine with default settings in addition to the application of twofold NCS restraints and TLS parameters. Each chain constituted a single TLS group. Three and six amino acids at N- and C-termini, respectively, of chain A and a single N-terminal amino acid of chain B lacked electron density and were not modeled.</p><p>Molecular figures were generated with PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pymol.sourceforge.net">http://pymol.sourceforge.net</ext-link>).</p><p>Structures have been deposited in the PDB: 7SAY for GCN4-M87/LL-37 and 7SAF for GCN4-M87.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>CD spectroscopy</title><p>CD spectra were measured on an Aviv 215 Circular Dichroism Spectrometer using a quartz cell with 1 mm path length. Protein samples were ~0.125–0.250 mg/ml in 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.9. Wavelength spectra were recorded in a range of 190–260 nm at 37°C at 0.5 nm intervals with a 0.5 s averaging time per data point. Melting curves were determined at 222 nm between 20°C and 75°C with 1°C increments and 30 s equilibration time for each temperature point.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were very positive about this, please see below for more details from each reviewer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 76- I don't think the gels give information on binding capacity, this would require more quantitative assays to measure Kds. Although it looks like M87N100 pulled down more LL-37, it also looks like there is less M58N100 in the adjacent well, and there are two bands present there, making it impossible to compare these with each other. The Coomassie gels in Figure 1A should also be quantified across replicates.</p><p>Figure 1B needs stats, otherwise one cannot directly compare samples as done in Lines 83-85.</p><p>It's not clear why the authors used a truncated form of the M87 protein (68-105aa). In addition, what was the advantage of adding a portion of GCN4? What is this fragment? In general, more information in these regards is necessary for the more general audience, preferably before jumping into line 86.</p><p>It is not clear what 2C is showing, can the amino acids be marked on the image? The text indicates it should be a comparison of bound and unbound, but it looks to be in a different orientation?</p><p>Is there a way Figure 3 can illustrate more information about the types of contacts that are predicted to be occurring? The information is in the text, but it would be helpful to have them illustrated in the figure for reference.</p><p>In figure 4, given that the E85A mutation did not affect the interaction with LL-37, the interpretation would be that the electrostatic interaction with the Lysine in LL-37 is not important for the association of M87 with LL-37. The E85R mutant could be causing repulsion effects that are dominant negative. This should be considered, and it is not clear what is the basis for the conclusion in lines 167-168 &quot;the polar contact conferred by M87 Glu85 conferred specificity rather than binding affinity&quot;. Data has yet to be presented to support this statement. Because of the caveat regarding the E85R mutant, it is important to perform the Strep experiment in Figure 4D with other M87 mutants with alanine substitutions. This also affects the data interpretations in Figure 5. Were alanine substitutions made here as well?</p><p>For figure 4B, how are stats determined if there is no variation in WT? Did the authors compare the WT values to the average WT to determine the spread and distribution of WT data? There are also error bars missing from most of the samples in 4B.</p><p>Line 70- the word &quot;binding&quot; (or something analogous) missing at beginning of the sentence: &quot;The determine the mechanism of LL-37 by M proteins&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In terms of the general science and the way that the paper is written and presented, I can find little to fault. However, I think that the paper might be improved with a few additional considerations and small changes.</p><p>First of all, have Kds (dissociation constants) been measured for the LL-37 peptide binding to the M protein fragments? This would be useful quantitative information on the system anyway, but it could also inform on the mechanism and efficacy of action of the M proteins in sequestering the peptide.</p><p>Second, I agree that to my knowledge this unfurling (or what I would term strand-invasion) mechanism of binding is new in natural coiled-coil structures. However, there is one other recently described system that operates somewhat similarly. See: Dimitrova-Paternoga et al. &quot;Molecular basis of mRNA transport by a kinesin-1-atypical tropomyosin complex&quot;, DOI: 10.1101/gad.348443.121; and PDB entry 7BJS. Whilst this is clearly very different in terms of proteins involve and the mechanism (the work that I point out is &quot;strand-accretion&quot; rather than &quot;strand-invasion&quot; per se), I think that it's worth discussing (briefly) and citing this paper in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, I would encourage the authors to perform a SOCKET analysis of their structures (Kumar and Woolfson &quot;Socket2: a program for locating, visualizing and analyzing coiled-coil interfaces in protein structures&quot;, DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab631; http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/socket2/home.html). I did this quickly using the two structures provided by the authors using 7, 7.5, and 8 Å cutoffs, and I found it informative. Obviously, the GCN4 regions are positive for coiled-coil knobs-into-holes (KIH) interactions at all cutoffs. However, and in both structures, KIHs interactions in the M protein regions are actually quite sparse; though more are revealed as the threshold is increased-with only I84 apparent at 7 Å, then 84 +L88 at 7.5 Å, and these plus Y81 at 8 Å. First, this does mean that the authors should modify their description of that region a little as it does not have many a + d positions engaged in KIH interaction. Moreover, and more interestingly, this suggests to me at least that the M protein coiled coils are not-ideal, or weak, and therefore potentially receptive to unfurling and strand invasion. This would be a neat bit of coiled-coil biology and evolution if it proved to be the case.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77989.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 76- I don't think the gels give information on binding capacity, this would require more quantitative assays to measure Kds.

This body of work has shown that protein-protein affinity mainly depends on hydrophobic interactions (entropic contributions due to the release of waters into the bulk environment in the bound state that are otherwise organized around hydrophobic groups in the free state), whereas polar interactions contribute little to affinity (as a protein-protein electrostatic interactions in the bound state are replaced by electrostatic protein-water interactions in the free state, each having similar energies and therefore providing no substantial net contribution to affinity). However, polar interactions do confer specificity based on charge complementarity (e.g., negative group on one protein adjacent to a positive group on the second). E85 has the characteristics of an amino acid that provides specificity rather than affinity — i.e., no difference in affinity when the side chain is removed (i.e., Ala substitution) but abrogation of binding when the character of the side chain is reversed (i.e., Arg substitution). We have modified the text to make this point more clearly (l. 163):</p><p>“Ala-substitution of M87 Glu85 had little effect on LL-37 binding (Figures 4A and B), suggesting it did not contribute to affinity. To ask whether it instead contributed to specificity, we asked whether Arg-substitution of this amino acid would decrease interaction with LL-37, as M87 Glu85 was adjacent to LL-37 Lys12.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For figure 4B, how are stats determined if there is no variation in WT? Did the authors compare the WT values to the average WT to determine the spread and distribution of WT data? There are also error bars missing from most of the samples in 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We applied the normalization at the incorrect stage in our initial submission, resulting in all WT values being 1.0 and with no standard deviations. We have corrected that, and there are now standard deviations in Figure 4B. We have also added a description in Materials and methods as to how the data were handled (l. 364):</p><p>“The intensity of gel bands was quantified with ImageJ (38) and confirmed to be within the linear range of detection. As the intensity on each gel depended on the length of time of staining and destaining, a normalization factor was used. For this, the ratio of the LL-37 band intensity to wild-type M protein band intensity from a particular gel lane was determined from three or more independent gels, and the mean of these ratios (mean of LL-37/M<sub>WT</sub>) was used as the normalization factor. Accordingly, for each data point (i.e., gel lane), the ratio of the LL-37 band intensity to M protein (wild-type or mutant) band intensity was quantified, and divided by the normalization factor (mean of LL-37/M<sub>WT</sub>).”</p><p>And also in the Figure Legends (l. 673):</p><p>“B. Quantification of LL-37 binding to intact wild-type and mutant M87 proteins. The ratio between LL-37 and wild-type M87 protein band intensities was determined in four independent experiments, and used to determine a mean LL-37/wt-M87 ratio. Points shown are ratios between LL-37 and (wild-type or mutant) M87 protein band intensities, normalized by the mean LL-37/wt-M87 ratio. For each sample, means and SD are shown.

Whilst this is clearly very different in terms of proteins involve and the mechanism (the work that I point out is &quot;strand-accretion&quot; rather than &quot;strand-invasion&quot; per se), I think that it's worth discussing (briefly) and citing this paper in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this paper to our attention, and we have added the following to the Discussion (l. 256):</p><p>“Recently, a coiled-coil dimer that binds an α-helical partner in a roughly similar manner was reported (29), but in that complex coiled-coil character is maintained, unlike the loss of coiled-coil character observed for the M87/LL-37 complex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I would encourage the authors to perform a SOCKET analysis of their structures (Kumar and Woolfson &quot;Socket2: a program for locating, visualizing and analyzing coiled-coil interfaces in protein structures&quot;, DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab631; http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/socket2/home.html). I did this quickly using the two structures provided by the authors using 7, 7.5, and 8 Å cutoffs, and I found it informative. Obviously, the GCN4 regions are positive for coiled-coil knobs-into-holes (KIH) interactions at all cutoffs. However, and in both structures, KIHs interactions in the M protein regions are actually quite sparse; though more are revealed as the threshold is increased-with only I84 apparent at 7 Å, then 84 +L88 at 7.5 Å, and these plus Y81 at 8 Å. First, this does mean that the authors should modify their description of that region a little as it does not have many a + d positions engaged in KIH interaction. Moreover, and more interestingly, this suggests to me at least that the M protein coiled coils are not-ideal, or weak, and therefore potentially receptive to unfurling and strand invasion. This would be a neat bit of coiled-coil biology and evolution if it proved to be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention, and we have added this point to the Discussion (l. 250):</p><p>“Intriguingly, analysis of ‘knobs-into-holes’ packing of M87 in the free state shows that A77 and Y81 are not ideally packed (28).
