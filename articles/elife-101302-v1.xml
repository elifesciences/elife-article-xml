mechanism remains poorly known. The posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is a hub for emotional processing and receives inputs from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), the well-recognized thermoregulation center. The present study was designed to explore whether chronic heat exposure leads to aberrant activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and subsequent changes in emotional states. By devising an air heating paradigm mimicking the condition of heatwaves and utilizing emotion-related behavioral tests, viral tract tracing, in vivo calcium recordings, optogenetic manipulations, and electrophysiological recordings, we found that chronic heat exposure for 3 weeks led to negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states in mice. The pPVT neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory innervations from the POA. These neurons exhibited a persistent increase in neural activity following chronic heat exposure, which was essential for chronic heat-induced emotional changes. Notably, these neurons were also prone to display stronger neuronal activities associated with anxiety responses to stressful situations. Furthermore, we observed saturated neuroplasticity in the POA-pPVT excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure that occluded further potentiation. Taken together, long-term aberration in the POA to pPVT pathway offers a neurobiological mechanism of emotional and behavioral changes seen in extended periods of hot weather like heatwaves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heatwaves</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus preoptic area</kwd><kwd>paraventricular thalamus</kwd><kwd>negative emotional valences</kwd><kwd>hyperarousal states</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001839</institution-id><institution>University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C4012-22G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yung</surname><given-names>Wing-Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001839</institution-id><institution>University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09203236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ke</surname><given-names>Ya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001839</institution-id><institution>University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6034-21G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yung</surname><given-names>Wing-Ho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A neural circuit mechanism explains how chronic extreme heat exposure affects emotions in the mouse model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Against a backdrop of global warming, heatwaves that are characterized by abnormally hot weather for extended periods have become more frequent and intense. This is highlighted by that the July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded by human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tollefson, 2023</xref>). Traditional views support that repetitive heat exposure and the related heat acclimation have some beneficial effects in allowing the animals and humans to gain heat tolerance, such as strengthening the cardiovascular system, reducing energy metabolism, and weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Podstawski et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">PÃ©riard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fausnacht et al., 2021</xref>). However, many studies have also established a correlation between heatwaves and impaired physical health leading to increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barriopedro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">GarcÃ­a-Herrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robine et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, elevated temperatures could impact mental health by triggering feelings of anger, stress, aggression, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beecher et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, epidemiological research conducted across various regions also extensively demonstrated a positive association between chronic heat exposure and higher hospital admissions for mental and behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amr and Volpe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominiak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulder et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitney et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, our understanding of how the brain regulates emotional changes following prolonged heat exposure remains limited.</p><p>Current understanding about heat-induced emotional changes mainly focuses on the impact of heat stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which leads to abnormal plasma concentrations of the hormone cortisol and neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline, all of which play a significant role in modulating emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McMorris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, how heat affects emotions from the perspective of neural circuits has not been substantiated. Moreover, the relationship between chronic heat exposure and emotional changes is likely to be more complex. Multifaceted factors, such as the levels of physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sampath et al., 2023</xref>), changes of neuroendocrine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Podstawski et al., 2021a</xref>), sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altena et al., 2023</xref>), adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppermann et al., 2021</xref>), even the age, and individual health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kenny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malmquist et al., 2022</xref>), could interact in various ways to directly and indirectly contribute to emotional changes in response to chronic heat exposure. Thus, gaining insights into the circuitry mechanisms behind emotional changes caused by chronic heat exposure is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological foundations of emotional regulation.</p><p>Emerging evidence has suggested that the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) serves as an important integrative node that detects aversive sensory and homeostatic challenges and regulates emotional responses and adaptive behaviors. As such, PVT neurons receive inputs from diverse nuclei in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain, and has been implicated in a variety of behavioral responses, including arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurik et al., 2015</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heilbronner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spencer et al., 2004</xref>), fear, and fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, PVT is now considered as an essential component of the emotional processing system in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Among the various inputs from different brain regions to the PVT, the hypothalamus preoptic area (POA) is a well-known thermoregulatory center of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Anatomically, the posterior PVT (pPVT) has been reported to receive projections from POA warm-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we hypothesize that the direct projection from POA to pPVT contributes to chronic heat-induced emotional disturbances. Based on the murine model, we dissected the synaptic connection from POA to pPVT, tracked its activities, and interrogated its involvement in behavioral responses of the animals under acute and chronic heat exposure paradigms. Our results uncovered long-term aberration in the activity of this pathway and pPVT neurons mediating chronic heat-induced changes in emotional and hyperarousal states, providing a neurobiological basis of how chronic heat affects mental states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chronic heat produces negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states but not depression-like behaviors in mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic heat by putting them into a pre-heated (38Â±2Â°C) chamber daily for 21 days with free access of food and water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, details in Materials and methods). In our preliminary experiments, various durations of daily heat exposure were tested. We settled to 90 min due to its robustness in inducing emotional state-related behavioral changes without causing the collapse of the animals. Throughout the entire process of chronic heat exposure, we monitored the physiological states of mice daily. We did not observe abnormal changes in body temperature the day after chronic heat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>) but affected normal gain in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and reduced food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>), compared with control mice. On the other hand, mice subjected to chronic heat displayed a higher prevalence of stress responses in various behavioral tests. Specifically, in the elevated plus maze test, chronic heat-exposed mice spent less time in the open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), indicating increased stress levels. Moreover, in the three-chamber test, these mice displayed reduced interests in exploring the unfamiliar male mouse compared to an inanimate object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), suggesting decreased sociability. Similarly, during the female encounter test, these mice showed less engagement with the unfamiliar female mouse compared with the unfamiliar male mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), indicating decreased innate motivation. Interestingly, the chronic heat-exposed mice displayed decreased latencies for the first attack but increased attack durations in the resident-intruder test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>), indicating elevated aggression levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chronic heat exposure produces negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states but not depression-like behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematics.

Notably, no comparable increases of activities in the POA recipient pPVT neurons were observed when chronic heat-exposed mice paused at the center and finally walked out to the open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>) or walked to the closed arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1DâF</xref>).

We injected <italic>Camk2a</italic>-promotor encoded ChR2 AAV into the POA of mice and divided them into two groups: a control group exposed to room temperature and a chronic heat group.

Local optogenetic stimulation vertically (470 nm) through the objective was applied to elicit light-evoked EPSCs in POA recipient pPVT neurons and baseline of 10 min was recorded. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) is an effective induction protocol for eliciting LTP at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grover et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nugent et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, by delivering blue light at various frequencies (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 Hz) to activate the POA excitatory terminals within pPVT, we developed an optogenetic HFS protocol (HFS<sub>opto</sub>: light pulses at 30 Hz, repeated three times at 20 s interval) effective in eliciting potentiated EPSCs on POA recipient pPVT neurons after baseline recording. HFS<sub>opto</sub> protocol could successfully induce LTP at POA-pPVT synapses. The amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs in the control group following HFS<sub>opto</sub>, at the onset, showed an obvious increase and gradually became stable potentiation, lasting at least 30 min (150%Â±18 of baseline, 14 neurons from 5 mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). However, when we applied the same protocol to the POA recipient pPVT neurons of mice after chronic heat exposure, typically no LTP could be induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6KâM</xref>), suggesting that the pathway in these mice was already saturated during chronic heat exposure.</p><p>Taken together, our findings suggest enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT neurons and increased membrane excitability of these neurons may underlie the behavioral changes observed in mice following chronic heat exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we aimed to uncover the neurobiological basis of how extended periods of high temperature such as heatwaves impact on emotional processing in the mammalian brain. We demonstrated that chronic heat exposure led to negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states in mice, but not depression-like behavior. We discovered that hypothalamic POA recipient pPVT neurons in the thalamus mediate such emotional state changes via increased baseline activities and excitability in response to stressful conditions. Presumably, this is attributed to that repeated activation of the POA to pPVT circuit modulates both pre- and postsynaptic processes leading to their long-term changes.</p><p>Different from utilizing heating panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>) to investigate heat-induced thermoregulation, our study employed an air heating strategy. This choice was motivated by the aim of replicating the realistic conditions induced by heatwaves. To ensure the well-being of the animals and prevent unnecessary physiological harm, we maintained temperatures around 38Â°C, as temperatures exceeding 40Â°C can lead to adverse effects on the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deuis et al., 2017</xref>). It is noted that our study differs from many previous studies that applied less high temperature but continuously over several days and weeks, which could have beneficial effects related to cardiovascular fitness, energy metabolism, and even cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings revealed that the protocol of chronic heat exposure at 90 min per day for 21 days did not impact the thermoregulatory function in mice. In the various emotional state-related behavioral tests we conducted, including the open-field, three-chamber, and female encounter test, we did not observe locomotion hyperactivity in mice. However, a distinct ASR was noted following chronic heat exposure. This may initially appear contradictory, as hyperarousal states are typically associated with hyperlocomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibited heightened responses to stressful and aversive situations, which suggested that chronic heat exposure might primarily induce a state of increased susceptibility toward anxiety and hyperarousal rather than persistent hyperarousal states in mice.</p><p>There are a number of studies revealing the connections from the POA to pPVT. Some previous reports have already shown that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within POA contribute to thermoregulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison and Nakamura, 2011</xref>). Augustine et al. on the other hand demonstrated that POA neurons expressing nNOS send both excitatory and inhibitory projections to PVT, with an emphasis on their roles in thirst regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>, previously described those thirst-related POA neurons sending projections to PVT-mediated reinforcing behavior, highlighting their independence from POA heat-responsive neurons. The findings of the present study enriched our understanding that heat-responsive neurons in the POA could send both excitatory and inhibitory projections to pPVT, and uncovered the role of excitatory projections from POA to pPVT in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes. While the role of the excitatory inputs in mediating the negative emotional valence and hyperarousal state is unveiled in this study, the role of the inhibitory inputs awaits further investigation.</p><p>Notably, we observed that POA recipient pPVT neurons exhibited higher baseline activities and displayed heightened response to stress or aversive stimuli following chronic heat exposure. Consistently, a recent study also found that long-term heat exposure rendered POA neurons to become tonically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambroziak et al., 2025</xref>). Interestingly, prior studies have reported that PVT neurons exhibited stronger activation when mice were subjected to novel stimuli after repeated restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vertes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhatnagar and Dallman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heydendael et al., 2011</xref>). This also effectively supports our theory of heightened susceptibility to anxiety and our results provide a rationale for this widely observed phenomenon. Meanwhile, the specific neuronal signals correlated with actions indicative of heightened anxiety such as fast running to closed arms and fast running in chronic-heat exposed chamber were not induced by the motion per se. Our recording was conducted when mice were spontaneously behaving without any pre-set cues, excluding the influence of salient stimuli on the activity of POA recipient pPVT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the enhanced excitatory connections from POA to pPVT after chronic heat exposure, we observed an increased amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic response after both acute and chronic heat exposure. Increased inhibition could act to compensate for the initial over-excitation at critical time, to ensure that neurons briefly activated by stress can be effectively regulated and prevent the occurrence of excessive stress-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perica and Luna, 2023</xref>). pPVT neurons are anatomically innervated by strong inhibitory projections from different brain nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>). Acute stress-mediated disinhibition of pPVT neurons, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beas et al., 2018</xref>, can rapidly induce an anxiety-like state in mice. Other studies also showed that inhibition of activated neurons induced by stressful stimuli is effective to avoid abnormal affective behavioral performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghasemi et al., 2022</xref>). Our results showed that long-term optogenetic inhibition of POA recipient pPVT neurons during chronic heat exposure can effectively prevent changes of emotional and hyperarousal states in mice. Therefore, the increase in mIPSC amplitude observed under both acute and chronic heat conditions in this study suggests the potential presence of negative feedback regulation in response to the over-excitation. However, under chronic heat exposure, further persistent significant increase in excitatory synaptic transmission may surpass this effect, leading to a final net activation in the pPVT neurons. However, the potential mechanisms by which increased excitatory synaptic transmission and enhanced postsynaptic inhibitory responses interact to achieve activation or inhibition of neurons themselves still require further study.</p><p>Current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of pPVT in mediating anxiety-like behavior primarily focused on the dopamine-mediated disinhibition of hypothalamic inhibitory terminals within pPVT during acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beas et al., 2018</xref>). Our study distinctly revealed that the enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT and increased excitability following chronic heat exposure are responsible for the ensuing negative emotional and hyperarousal states. Interestingly, different from previous studies that reported a decrease in the amplitude of mIPSC in pPVT-expressing dopamine receptor 2 neurons 24 hr after acute restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beas et al., 2018</xref>), our slice recording from pPVT neurons 24 hr after acute heat exposure exhibited an increase in mIPSCs amplitude. The reasons behind these differences could be attributed to the treatment applied and the specific neuronal types under investigation. Both the enhanced presynaptic excitability and increased intrinsic postsynaptic excitability following chronic heat exposure suggested the involvement of long-term neuroplasticity. The fact that LTP of the POA to pPVT pathway was no longer inducible after chronic heat exposure strongly suggested that this pathway was potentiated during the heat treatment, which accounted for the increased excitability of POA terminals to pPVT and their increased neuronal activities. Overall, both the enhanced excitatory inputs to pPVT and increased excitability may play an indispensable role in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes in mice.</p><p>There are certain limitations in the scope of the present study. First, our study was conducted solely on male mice. Further investigation is required to determine whether chronic heat exposure can elicit similar behavioral phenotypes in female mice. Also, the pPVT is known to express various peptide receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtis et al., 2020</xref>). However, the specific roles of these peptide receptors in chronic heat exposure-induced emotional changes remain unexplored. Some possible mechanisms may contribute to heightened activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons, such as the increased sensitization, the increased activity of HPA axis, the transition from chronic adaptation to pathological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herman, 2013</xref>), and even the chronic effect of dopamine-induced disinhibition of inhibitory terminals within pPVT, all of which require further investigations. Moreover, POA and pPVT were both previously reported to be activated by stimuli other than heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Additional studies are needed to explore the specificity of POA recipient pPVT neurons on chronic heat-induced emotional changes.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that the heightened activities of POA recipient pPVT neurons are critically involved in chronic heat-exposure-mediated negative emotional valence and hyperarousal states, and render mice to enter anxiety-like state more readily, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

A home-made chamber was constructed for chronic heat exposure (80 cm [L]Ã40 cm [W]Ã60 cm [H]) which was composed of two built-in components (heating system and an environmental monitoring sensor). For the heating system, a heater with (1) adjustable buttons that could control the heating power and (2) a âdual heatingâ setting that was able to stop heating when the temperature exceeded 40Â° in the chamber and restarted heating when the temperature in the chamber decreased to lower than 36Â°C. After the air temperature of the chamber was gradually heated to the targeted temperature ranges and was monitored to be stable for at least 30 min, mice would be gently put into the chamber for 90 min of heat exposure per day for 21 days. During heat exposure, mice were freely accessible to drinking water and consuming food. The time point within each day to start heat exposure was random. For the environmental monitoring sensor, it was used to monitor the chamber temperature value and humidity level (Peng He Dian Zi, Shanghai, China). And the behavioral tests were conducted the following day after 21 daysâ heat exposure.</p><p>The method for measuring the body temperature of mice was based on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawakami et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, prior to exposing them to heat, the mice were gently held by their tails to expose their lower abdomen. An infrared thermometer sensor was positioned beneath the lower abdomen and the temperature was measured. This measurement process was repeated three times for each mouse, and the stable values obtained were then averaged to determine the specific mouseâs body temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>A variety of emotion-related behavioral tests were conducted on mice after acute and chronic heat exposure.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Elevated plus maze test</title><p>The self-made elevated plus maze apparatus was made up of two open arms (25 cm [L]Ã5 cm [W]Ã0.5 cm [H]) and two closed arms (25 cm [L]Ã5 cm [W]Ã16 cm [H]) arranged in a âplusâ shape and elevated 50 cm above the floor. The mice were gently placed at the junction of the open and closed arms while facing toward one of the open arms to initiate the test.

Mice exposed to sound at 105 dB measured by a decibel meter exhibited obvious startle response while 75 dB evoked no response. 105 dB was thus set as the sound decibel of pulse-only stimulation with 0.2 s duration, while 75 dB was set as pre-pulse stimulation with 0.2 s duration. Before the ASR test, mice were placed into an acrylic box for 3 days of environmental habituation and then for the test. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) test started with at least 20 min baseline to make the tested mice quiet and immobile, and then the habituation phase, which consisted of 10 pulses, each 20 s apart, and finally presented with a PPI phase, in which 20 trials, 5 pulse-only trials and 15 pre-pulse and pulse trials, were delivered. In the pre-pulse and pulse trials, the pre-pulse was presented about 500 ms before the pulse stimulus. The miceâs startle response was captured by a high-speed camera and then analyzed with the machine learning method: DeepLabCut. The brief details were as follows: the miceâs body parts were manually labeled and labeled data were input into the google co-lab for the machine learning process until the learning error was lower than 0.5. The successful training data were exported as a .csv file. The startle amplitude of mice was calculated as the average value of all the labeled body partsâ vibration amplitude within 200 ms after the sound was broadcast. Each trial was manually checked, and startle response affected by the miceâs random moving would not be collected for further analysis. The startle response was visualized with custom MATLAB scripts.</p><p>The formula for calculating the PPI ratio was:</p><p>PPI ratio = amplitude of pre-pulse and pulse trial/amplitude of pulse-only trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Open-field test</title><p>Mice were gently placed in the center of the open-field test chamber (60 cm [L]Ã60 cm [W]Ã40 cm [H]) and allowed for free exploration for 10 min.

It has long been known that temperature can be a potent driver of behaviors and can lead to anxiety and aggression. However, the neural circuitry that mediates these changes is not known. Cao et al. take on this question by integrating optical tools of systems neuroscience to record and manipulate bulk activity in neural circuits, in combination with a creative battery of behavior assays. They demonstrate that chronic daily exposure to heat leads to changes in anxiety, locomotion, social approach, and aggression. They identify a circuit from preoptic area (POA) to posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) in mediating these behavior changes. The POA-PVT circuit increases activity during heat exposure. Further, manipulation of this circuit can drive affective and social behavioral phenotypes even in the absence of heat exposure. Moreover, silencing this circuit during heat exposure prevents the development of negative phenotypes.

It has long been known that temperature can be a potent driver of behaviors and can lead to anxiety and aggression. However, the neural circuitry that mediates these changes is not known. Cao et al. take on this question by integrating optical tools of systems neuroscience to record and manipulate bulk activity in neural circuits, in combination with a creative battery of behavior assays. They demonstrate that chronic daily exposure to heat leads to changes in anxiety, locomotion, social approach, and aggression. They identify a circuit from the preoptic area (POA) to the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) in mediating these behavior changes. The POA-PVT circuit increases activity during heat exposure. Further, manipulation of this circuit can drive affective and social behavioral phenotypes even in the absence of heat exposure. Moreover, silencing this circuit during heat exposure prevents the development of negative phenotypes. Overall the manuscript makes an important contribution to the understudied area of how ambient temperature shapes motivated behaviors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The use of state-of-the-art systems neuroscience tools (in vivo optogenetics and fiber photometry, slice electrophysiology), chronic temperature-controlled experiments, and a rigorous battery of behavioral assays to determine affective phenotypes. The optogenetic gain of function of affective phenotypes in the absence of heat, and loss of function in the presence of heat are very convincing manipulation data. Overall a significant contribution to the circuit-level instantiation of temperature-induced changes in motivated behavior, and creative experiments.</p><p>Weaknessesï¼</p><p>(1) There is no quantification of cFos/rabies overlap shown in Figure 2, and no report of whether the POA-PVT circuit has a higher percentage of Fos+ cells than the general POA population. Similarly, there is no quantification of cFos in POA recipient PVT cells for Figure 2 Supplement 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The quantification results of c-Fos signal have been provided in the main text and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors do not address whether stimulation of POA-PVT also increases core body temperature in Figure 3 or its relevant supplements. This seems like an important phenotype to make note of and could be addressed with a thermal camera or telemetry.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point. We did indeed monitor the core body temperature during stimulation of POA-PVT pathway, but we did not observe any significant changes. We have included this finding in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3G: is Day 1 vs Day 22 &quot;pre-heat&quot; significant? The statistics are not shown, but this would be the most conclusive comparison to show that POA-PVT cells develop persistent activity after chronic heat exposure, which is one of the main claims the authors make in the text. This analysis is necessary in order to make the claim of persistent circuit activity after chronic heat exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3G does compare the Day 1 preheat to Day22 preheat, and the difference was significant. The wording has been corrected to avoid confusion. Also, we have modified Figure 3D to 3H in our revised manuscript to improve the clarity of these plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 4, the control virus (AAV1-EYFP) is a different serotype and reporter than the ChR2 virus (AAV9-ChR2-mCherry). This discrepancy could lead to somewhat different baseline behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing out this issue. We acknowledge that using AA1-EGFP (a different serotype and reporter compared to the AAV9-ChR2-mCherry) as our control virus is not ideal. But based on our own prior experiments, we observed no significant differences in baseline behaviors between animals injected with AAV1 and AAV9 EYFP as well as control mice without virus injection. Therefore, we believe that the baseline behaviors of the animals were unaffected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 5G, N for the photometry data: the authors assess the maximum z-score as a measure of the strength of calcium response, however the area under the curve (AUC) is a more robust and useful readout than the maximum z score for this. Maximum z-score can simply identify brief peaks in amplitude, but the overall area under the curve seems quite similar, especially for Figure 5N.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We agree with the reviewer that the area under the curve (AUC) is an alternative readout for measurement of the strength of calcium response. However, the reason why we chose the maximum z-score is based on the observation that we found POA recipient pPVT neurons after chronic heat treatment exhibited a higher calcium peak corresponding to certain behavioral performances when compared to pre-heat conditions. We thus applied the maximum z-score as a representative way to describe the neuronal activity changes of mice during certain behaviors before and after chronic heat treatment. The other consideration is that we want to reflect that POA recipient pPVT neurons become more sensitive and easier to be activated after chronic heat exposure under the same stressful situations compared to control mice. The maximum z score represented by peak in combination with particular behavioral performances is considered more suitable to highlight our findings in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For Fig 5V: the authors run the statistics on behavior bouts pooled from many animals, but it is better to do this analysis as an animal average, not by compiling bouts. Compiling bouts over-inflates the power and can yield significant p values that would not exist if the analysis were carried out with each animal as an n of 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment and suggestion. We had tried both methods and the statistical results were similar. As suggested, we have updated Fig 5V, as well as Fig. 5H and 5O by comparing animal average in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In general this is an excellent analysis of circuit function but leaves out the question of whether there may be other inputs to pPVT that also mediate the same behavioral effect. Future experiments that use activity-dependent Fos-TRAP labeling in combination with rabies can identify other inputs to heat-sensitive pPVT cells, which may have convergent or divergent functions compared to the POA inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestion, which would enhance the conclusion. We will consider adopting this approach in future investigations into this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>The study by Cao et al. highlights an interesting and important aspect of heat- and thermal biology: the effect of repetitive, long-term heat exposure and its impact on brain function.</p><p>Even though peripheral, sensory temperature sensors and afferent neuronal pathways conveying acute temperature information to the CNS have been well established, it is largely unknown how persistent, long-term temperature stimuli interact with and shape CNS function, and how these thermally-induced CNS alterations modulate efferent pathways to change physiology and behavior.

These points would be nice to discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising these important questions. Although it is not our primary focus, we are aware of the substantial inhibitory inputs from POA to pPVT which suggests an important function. However, we do not think that this pathway, which would exert an opposite effect on POA-recipient pPVT neurons compared to the excitatory input, contributes to the long-term effect of chronic heat exposure. This is due to the increased, rather than decreased, excitability of the neurons. There is a possibility that this inhibitory input serves as a short-term inhibitory control for other purpose. Further work is needed to fully address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is very interesting that no LTP can be induced after chronic heat exposure (Figures K-M); the authors suggest that &quot;the pathway in these mice were already saturated&quot; (line 375).

It would be interesting to learn if &quot;depression indicators&quot; increase acutely but then adapt (as a consequence of heat acclimation) or if they are not changed at all and are also low during acute heat exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our observations, we did not find increased depression parameters after acute heat stress in our experiments (data not shown), which was consistent with other two previous studies (Beas et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). It appears that acute heat stress is more associated with anxiety-like behavior and may not be sufficient to induce depression-like phenotypes in rodents, aligning with our observation during experiments.</p><p>Beas BS, Wright BJ, Skirzewski M, Leng Y, Hyun JH, Koita O, Ringelberg N, Kwon HB, Buonanno A, Penzo MA (2018) The locus coeruleus drives disinhibition in the midline thalamus via a dopaminergic mechanism Nat Neurosci 21:963-973.</p><p>Zhang GW, Shen L, Tao C, Jung AH, Peng B, Li Z, Zhang LI, Whit Tao HZ (2021) Medial preoptic area antagonistically mediates stress-induced anxiety and parental behavior Nat Neurosci 24:516-528.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses/suggestions for improvement.</p><p>(1) The introduction and general tenet of the study is, to us, a bit too one-sided/biased: generally, repetitive heat exposure --<monospace>heat acclimation</monospace>-- paradigms are known to not only be detrimental to animals and humans but also convey beneficial effects in allowing the animals and humans to gain heat tolerance (by strengthening the cardiovascular system, reducing energy metabolism and weight, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have modified the introduction in our revised manuscript to make it more balanced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The point is well taken that these authors here want to correlate their model (90 minutes of heat exposure per day) to heat waves. Nevertheless, and to more fully appreciate the entire biology of repetitive/chronic/persistent heat exposure (heat acclimation), it would be helpful to the general readership if the authors would also include these other aspects in their introduction (and/or discussion) and compare their 90-minute heat exposure paradigm to other heat acclimation paradigms. For example, many past studies (using mice or rats)m have used more subtle temperatures but permanently (and not only for 90 minutes) stimulated them over several days and weeks (for example see PMID: 35413138). This can have several beneficial effects related to cardiovascular fitness, energy metabolism, and other aspects. In this regard: 38{degree sign}C used in this study is a very high temperature for mice, in particular when they are placed there without acclimating slowly to this temperature but are directly placed there from normal ambient temperatures (22{degree sign}C-24{degree sign}C) which is cold/coolish for mice. Since the accuracy of temperature measurement is given as +/- 2{degree sign}C, it could also be 40{degree sign}C -- this temperature, 40{degree sign}C, non-heat acclimated C57bl/6 mice will not survive for long.</p><p>The authors could consider discussing that this very strong, short episodic heat-stress model used here in this study may emphasize detrimental effects of heat, while more subtle long-term persistent exposure may be able to make animals adapt to heat, become more tolerant, and perhaps even prevent the detrimental cognitive effects observed in this study (which would be interesting to assess in a follow-up study).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out the important aspect regarding the different heat exposure paradigms and their potential impacts. We have incorporated these points into both the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 140: It would help to be clear in the text that the behaviors are measured 1 day after the acute heat exposure - this is mentioned in the legend to the figure, but we believe it is important to stress this point also in the text. Similarly, this is also relevant for chronic heat stimulation: it needs to be made very clear that the behavior is measured 1 day after the last heat stimulus. If the behaviors had been measured during the heat stimulus, the results would likely be very different.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, and we have clarified the procedure in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 2 D and Figure 2- Figure Supplement 1: since there is quite some baseline cFos activity in the pPVT region we believe it is important to include some control (room temperature) mice with anterograde labelling; in our view, it is difficult/not possible to conclude, based on Fig 2 supplement 2C, that nearly 100% of the cfos positive cells are contacted by POA fibre terminals (line 168). By eye there are several green cells that don't have any red label on (or next to) them; additionally, even if there is a little bit of red signal next to a green cell: this is not definitive proof that this is a synaptic contact. It is therefore advisable to revisit the quantification and also revisit the interpretation/wording about synaptic contacts.</p><p>In relation to the above: Figure 2h suggests that all neurons are connected (the majority receiving inhibitory inputs), is this really the case, is there not a single neuron out of the 63 recorded pPVT neurons that does not receive direct synaptic input from the POA?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. For Figure 2-figure supplement 1, the baseline c-Fos activity in pPVT were indeed measured from mouse under room temperature. Observed activity may be attributed to the diverse functions that the pPVT is responsible for. Compared to the heat-exposed group, we observed significant increases in c-Fos signals, suggesting the effect of heat exposure.</p><p>For Figure 2-figure supplement 2, through targeted injection of AAV1-Cre into the POA, we achieved selective expression of Cre-dependent ChR2-mCherry in pPVT neurons receiving POA inputs. Following heat exposure, we observed substantial colocalization between heat-induced c-Fos expression (green signal) and ChR2-mCherry-labeled neurons (red signal) in the pPVT. This extensive overlap indicates that POA-recipient pPVT neurons are predominantly heat-responsive and likely mediate the behavioral alterations induced by chronic heat exposure. We have validated these signals and included updated quantification in our revised manuscript.</p><p>For Fig 2H, we specifically patched those neurons that were surrounded by red fluorescence under the microscope, ensuring that the patched neurons had a high likelihood of being innervated from POA. This is why all 63 recorded pPVT neurons were found to receive direct synaptic input from the POA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It would be nice to characterize the POA population that connects to the pPVT, it is possible/likely that not only warm-responsive POA neurons connect to that region but also others. The current POA-to-pPVT optogenetic fibre stimulations (Figure 4) are not selective for preoptic warm responsive neurons; since the POA subserves many different functions, this optogenetic strategy will likely activate other pathways. The referees acknowledge that molecular analysis of the POA population would be a major undertaking. Instead, this could be acknowledged in the discussion, for example in a section like &quot;limitation of this study&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have supplemented this part in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3a the strategy to express Gcamp in a Cre-dependent manner: it seems that the Gcamp8f signal would be polluted by EGFP (coming from the Cre virus injected into the POA): The excitation peak for both is close to 490nm and emission spectra/peaks of GCaMP8f (510-520 nm) and EGFP (507-510 nm) are also highly overlapping. We presume that the high background (EGFP) fluorescence signal would preclude sensitive calcium detection via Gcamp8f, how did the authors tackle this problem?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. We acknowledge that we included AAV1-EGFP when recording the GCaMP8F signal to assist in the post-verification of the accuracy of the injection site. But we also collected recording data from mice with AAV1-Cre without EGFP injected into POA and Cre-dependent GCaMP8F in pPVT, albert in a smaller number. We did not observe any obvious differences in the change in calcium signal between these two virus strategies, suggesting that the sensitivity of the GCaMP signals was not significantly affected by the increased baseline fluorescence due to EGFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) How did the authors perform the social interaction test (Figures 1F, G)? Was the intruder mouse male or female? If it was a male mouse would the interaction with the female mouse be a form of mating behavior?

For this female encounter test, we strictly followed the protocol by Ago Y, et al., (2015). During this test, both the strange male and female mice were placed into a wired cup (which is made up of mental wire entanglement and the size for each hole is 0.5 cm [L] x 0.5 cm [W]), which successfully prevented large body contact and the mating behavior but only innate sex-motivated moving around the cup.

The authors show that chronic heat exposure leads to heightened activity of the POA projection-receiving pPVT neurons, potentially contributing to behavioral changes such as increased anxiety level and reduced sociability, along with heightened startle responses. In addition, using electrophysiological methods, the authors suggest that increased membrane excitability of pPVT neurons may underlie these behavioral changes. The use of a variety of behavioral assays enhances the robustness of their claim. Moreover, while previous research on thermoregulation has predominantly focused on physiological responses to thermal stress, this study adds a unique and valuable perspective by exploring how thermal stress impacts affective states and behaviors, thereby broadening the field of thermoregulation. However, a few points warrant further consideration to enhance the clarity and impact of the findings.</p><p>(1) The authors claim that behavior changes induced by chronic heat exposure are mediated by the POA-pPVT circuit. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are unique to heat exposure or if this circuit represents a more general response to chronic stress. It would be valuable to include control experiments with other forms of chronic stress, such as chronic pain, social defeat, or restraint stress, to determine if the observed changes in the POA-pPVT circuit are indeed specific to thermal stress or indicative of a more universal stress response mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We also share similar considerations as the reviewer and indeed have conducted experiments to explore this possibility. Our findings suggest that the POA-pPVT pathway may also mediate behavioral changes induced by other chronic stress, e.g. chronic restraint stress. Nevertheless, given the well-known prominent role of POA neurons in heat perception, we do believe that the POA-pPVT has a specialized role in mediating chronic heat induced changes. The role of this pathway in other stress-related responses will need a more comprehensive study in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors use the term &quot;negative emotion and hyperarousal&quot; to interpret behavioral changes induced by chronic heat (consistently throughout the manuscript, including the title and lines 33-34). However, the term &quot;emotion&quot; is broad and inherently difficult to quantify, as it encompasses various factors, including both valence and arousal (Tye, 2018; Barrett, L. F. 1999; Schachter, S. 1962). Therefore, the reviewer suggests the authors use a more precise term to describe these behaviors, such as valence. Additionally, in lines 117 and 137-139, replacing &quot;emotion&quot; with &quot;stress responses,&quot; a term that aligns more closely with the physiological observations, would provide greater specificity and clarity in interpreting the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have modified the description of âemotionâ to âemotional valenceâ in various places throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to the role of POA input to pPVT,</p><p>a) The authors showed increased activity in pPVT neurons that receive projections from the POA (Figure 3), and these neurons are necessary for heat-induced behavioral changes (Figures 4N-W). However, is the POA input to the pPVT circuit truly critical? Since recipient pPVT neurons can receive inputs from various brain regions, the reviewer suggests that experiments directly inhibiting the POA-to-pPVT projection itself are needed to confirm the role of POA input. Alternatively, the authors could show that the increased activity of pPVT neurons due to chronic heat exposure is not observed when the POA is blocked. If these experiments are not feasible, the reviewer suggests that the authors consider toning down the emphasis on the role of the POA throughout the manuscript and discuss this as a limitation.</p><p>b) In the electrophysiology experiments shown in Figures 6A-I, the authors conducted in vitro slice recordings on pPVT neurons. However, the interpretation of these results (e.g., &quot;The increase in presynaptic excitability of the POA to pPVT excitatory pathway suggested plastic changes induced by the chronic heat treatment.&quot;, lines 349-350) appears to be an overclaim. It is difficult to conclude that the increased excitability of pPVT neurons due to heat exposure is specifically caused by inputs from the POA. To clarify this, the reviewer suggests the authors conduct experiments targeting recipient neurons in the pPVT, with anterograde labeling from the POA to validate the source of excitatory inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>For point (a), we acknowledge that pPVT neurons receiving POA inputs may also receive projections from other brain regions. While these additional inputs warrant investigation, they fall beyond the scope of our current study and represent promising directions for future research. Notably, compared to other well-characterized regions such as the amygdala and ventral hippocampus, the pPVT receives particularly robust projections from hypothalamic nuclei (Beas et al., 2018). Our optogenetic inhibition of POA-recipient pPVT neurons during chronic heat exposure effectively prevented the influence of POA excitatory projections on pPVT neurons. Furthermore, selective optogenetic activation of POA excitatory terminals within the pPVT was sufficient to induce similar behavioral abnormalities in mice, strongly supporting the causal role of POA inputs in mediating chronic heat exposure-induced behavioral alterations.</p><p>Beas BS, Wright BJ, Skirzewski M, Leng Y, Hyun JH, Koita O, Ringelberg N, Kwon HB, Buonanno A, Penzo MA (2018) The locus coeruleus drives disinhibition in the midline thalamus via a dopaminergic mechanism Nat Neurosci 21:963-973.</p><p>Regarding point (b), we acknowledge certain limitations in our in vitro patch-clamp recordings when attributing increased pPVT neuronal excitability to enhanced presynaptic POA inputs. Nevertheless, our brain slice recordings clearly demonstrated heightened excitability of pPVT neurons following chronic heat exposure. This finding was further corroborated by our in vivo fiber photometry recordings specifically targeting POA-recipient pPVT neurons, which confirmed that the increased pPVT neuronal activity was indeed modulated by POA inputs. The causal relationship was strengthened by our observation that optogenetic activation of POA excitatory terminals within the pPVT reproduced behavioral abnormalities similar to those observed in chronic heat-exposed mice. Additionally, our inability to induce circuit-specific LTP in the POA-pPVT pathway suggests that these synapses were already potentiated and saturated, reflecting enhanced excitatory inputs from the POA to pPVT. Collectively, these findings support our conclusion that increased excitatory projections from the POA to pPVT likely represent a key mechanism underlying chronic heat exposure-induced behavioral alterations in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors focus on the excitatory connection between the POA and pPVT (e.g., &quot;Together, our results indicate that most of the pPVT-projecting POA neurons responded to heat treatment, which would then recruit their downstream neurons in the pPVT by exerting a net excitatory influence.&quot;, lines 169-171). However, are the POA neurons projecting to the pPVT indeed excitatory? This is surprising, considering (i) the electrophysiological data shown in Figures 2E-K that inhibitory current was recorded in 52.4% of pPVT neurons by stimulation of POA terminal, and (ii) POA projection neurons involved in modulating thermoregulatory responses to other brain regions are primarily GABAergic (Tan et al., 2016; Morrison and Nakamura, 2019). The reviewer suggests showing whether the heat-responsive POA neurons projecting to the pPVT are indeed excitatory (This could be achieved by retrogradely labeling POA neurons that project to the pPVT and conducting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays against Slc32a1, Slc17a6, and Fos to label neurons activated by warmth). Alternatively, demonstrate, at least, that pPVT-projecting POA neurons are a distinct population from the GABAergic POA neurons that project to thermoregulatory regions such as DMH or rRPa. This would clarify how the POA-pPVT circuit integrates with the previously established thermoregulatory pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment and suggestion. We acknowledge that there are both excitatory and inhibitory projections from POA to pPVT. Although it is not our primary focus, we are aware of the substantial inhibitory inputs from POA to pPVT which suggests an important function. However, we do not think that this pathway, which would exert an opposite effect on POA-recipient pPVT neurons compared to the excitatory input, contributes to the long-term effect of chronic heat exposure. This is due to the increased, rather than decreased, excitability of the neurons. There is a possibility that this inhibitory input serves as a short-term inhibitory control for other purpose. Further work is needed to fully address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have a number of suggested minor edits that would improve the readability and interpretation of figures for the reader.

Interaction of animals, such as huddling, can be used by animals as a form of behavioral thermoregulation in cold environments and heat may drive animals apart to allow for better heat dissipation. The social interaction measured here is not huddling (because, I assume, the animals are separated by a divider?) but is this form of behavior measured here related to huddling/&quot;social thermoregulation&quot;? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our behavioral tests were performed at room temperature.

We believe that the term &quot;arousal&quot; may not be justified in this context because the authors have not measured sleep patterns (EEG and EMG) to show that the mice arouse from a sleep (or sleep-like) stage; the authors may consider changing the terminology, e.g. something along the lines of &quot;agitation&quot; or &quot;activity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further elaborated the meaning of Figure 1J and K in our revised manuscript. The acoustic startle response is a well-recognized behavioral parameter reflecting arousal levels in rodent model. The more agitation in response to stimulus, the higher the arousal levels in mice.

However, there are no experiments or discussions on how the POA-pPVT circuit interacts with these factors. In line with the study's proposed direction in the introduction section, it would be valuable to explore, or at least discuss, whether and how the POA-pPVT circuit interacts with the HPA axis or other neural circuits known to regulate emotional and stress responses. Alternatively, the reviewer suggests revising the content of the introduction to align with the focus of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Although POA is known to possibly interact with the HPA axis via its connection with the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, there is hardly any evidence for the pPVT.

However, considering the long pre- and post-recording time gap of approximately three weeks, the additional expression of GCaMP protein over time could potentially account for the increased signal. Therefore, the reviewer recommends including a control group without heat exposure to rule out this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included Figure 3-figure supplement 1 in our manuscript to exclude the effect of expression of GCaMP protein over time on the recording of calcium signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to Figure 2, (a) Please include quantification data of the overlap between retrogradely labeled and c-Fos-expressing POA neurons, which can be presented as a bar graph in Figure 2.
